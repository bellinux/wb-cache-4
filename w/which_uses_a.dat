5|$|North of Pentwater, US31 crosses into Mason County {{and passes}} Bass Lake and the Ludington Pumped Storage Power Plant, <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> {{reservoir}} {{next to the}} freeway to generate electricity. Just north of that reservoir, the freeway turns to the northeast and Ludington's business spur runs off to the northwest. US31 curves around {{the east side of}} Ludington, crossing the Pere Marquette River. Due east of downtown, the freeway ends and US31 turns east to merge with US10. The concurrent highways follow a four-lane roadway to Scottville. On the west side of that town, US31 separates from US10, turning northward to bypass Scottville.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen-year-old Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a sunny {{high school}} senior who loves cheerleading and is dating a {{football}} player, Jared (Brandt Wille). She does not enjoy kissing Jared, however, and prefers looking at her fellow cheerleaders. Combined with Megan's interest in vegetarianism and Melissa Etheridge, {{her family and friends}} suspect that she is in fact a lesbian. With the help of ex-gay Mike (RuPaul), they surprise her with an intervention. Following this confrontation, Megan is sent to True Directions, a reparative therapy camp <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> five-step program (similar to Alcoholics Anonymous' twelve-step program) to convert its campers to heterosexuality.|$|E

5|$|The ferric {{chloride}} test {{is a traditional}} colorimetric test for phenols, <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> 1% iron(III) chloride solution that has been neutralised with sodium hydroxide until a slight precipitate of FeO(OH) is formed.

The organic substance is dissolved in water, methanol or ethanol, then the neutralised iron(III) chloride solution is added—a transient or permanent coloration (usually purple, green or blue) indicates {{the presence of a}} phenol or enol.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E

Second was the [...]41 Wildey Magnum (also known as the 10 mm Wildey Magnum) <b>which</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> [...]41 Magnum bullet.

5|$|In January 2007, the Shetland Islands Council {{signed a}} {{partnership}} agreement with Scottish and Southern Energy for the Viking Wind Farm, a 200-turbine wind farm and subsea cable. This renewable energy project would produce about 600 megawatts and contribute about £20 {{million to the}} Shetland economy per year. The plan met with significant opposition within the islands, primarily resulting from the anticipated visual impact of the development. The PURE project on Unst is a research centre <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> combination of wind power and fuel cells to create a wind hydrogen system.

5|$|In {{the field}} map, players may engage the enemy {{as soon as}} they enter Battle Mode, <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> pausable {{real-time}} combat system, much like Square's Parasite Eve (1998). In Battle Mode, when the player taps the attack button, a spherical grid appears around Ashley. Individual body parts within this sphere can be targeted. The battle system involves the player chaining different attacks known as Chain Abilities to achieve large combos and deal damage to the enemy. This is done by pressing buttons in timely succession, making combat resemble a rhythm game. In addition to Chain Abilities, Defensive Abilities allow Ashley to reduce or reflect damage or avoid status ailments. Ashley also gains Break Arts, which exchange his hit points (HP) for increased damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{specialized}} hardware of graphics processing units (GPU) {{is designed}} to accelerate rendering of 3-Dgraphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs {{are one of the}} most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture. Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the open source OpenMM library, <b>which</b> <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> bridge design pattern with two application programming interface (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.|$|E
