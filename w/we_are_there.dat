The prayer of this petition was granted, audits penalties were enforced during several reigns.|$|E

2500|$|George Steiner is {{regarded}} as a polymath and often credited with recasting the role of the critic by exploring art and thought unbounded by national frontiers or academic disciplines. He advocates generalisation over specialisation, and insists that the notion of being literate must encompass knowledge of both arts and sciences. Steiner believes that nationalism is too inherently violent to satisfy the moral prerogative of Judaism, saying [...] "that because of what <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> <b>there</b> are things we can't do." ...|$|E

[...] "You are male and I am female. You are of the sky and I am of the earth. You are {{constant}} in your brightness, but I must change with the seasons. Remember that I willingly let you enter me and I gave birth to your sons, [...] enduring pain to bring them into the world. As different as we are, we are of one spirit. As dissimilar as we are, you and I, we are of equal worth. As different as <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> <b>there</b> must be solidarity between us.

There is to be no more coming from me to you than there is from you to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 10, 2003, Shays {{told the}} Connecticut Post that [...] "'The successes to date are extraordinary. The war {{plan has been}} nearly flawless. Now {{we need to make}} sure the peace plan rises to the same level,' Shays said. 'If we are able to help them form a {{government}} quickly, we will be viewed as liberators. If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> too long, we will be viewed basically as conquerors.'" [...] On August 19, 2004, Shays told reporters, [...] "We're on the right track now." [...] On June 24, 2005, Shays said [...] "We've seen amazing progress [...]" [...] On July 27, 2005, Shays said on a local radio program that he was optimistic about the future of Iraq, and that he opposed any timetable for troop withdrawal. On June 11, 2006 Shays told the Hartford Courant that his position on the war was a matter of principle and he was not going to stop talking about it.|$|E
2500|$|Attwood died in 1838, and Goss {{hoped to}} succeed him as organist of St Paul's. He sought {{the advice of the}} Rev Sydney Smith, canon of St Paul's, who teased him by telling him that the salary was only £34 a year. Having a family to support, Goss replied that he {{might not be able to}} apply for the post, but Smith then {{revealed}} that the post of organist carried with it several additional sources of income, which enabled Goss to reconsider. He was appointed to the post, but immediately found that the organist was employed solely to play the organ, and enjoyed little influence over the other music of the cathedral. Control of the music lay with the Succentor, Canon Beckwith, who was at odds with the Almoner, Canon Hawes, who was responsible for rehearsing the boy choristers. The cathedral authorities were not interested in raising musical standards. Sydney Smith's view was typical: [...] "It is enough if our music is decent … <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> to pray, and the singing is a very subordinate consideration." [...] Some of Smith's colleagues were indifferent to both considerations, there being frequent absenteeism by the junior clergy, neglecting their duties and failing to conduct services.|$|E

2500|$|In the past, I've worried {{openly about}} NATO {{turning into a}} two-tiered alliance: Between members who {{specialize}} in [...] "soft" [...] humanitarian, development, peacekeeping and talking tasks, and those conducting the [...] "hard" [...] combat missions. [...] Between those {{willing and able to}} pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of NATO membership—be they security guarantees or headquarters billets—but don't want to share the risks and the costs. [...] This is no longer a hypothetical worry. [...] <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> today. [...] And it is unacceptable. The blunt reality {{is that there will be}} dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress—and in the American body politic writ large—to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense. [...] Nations apparently willing and eager for American taxpayers to assume the growing security burden left by reductions in European defense budgets. Indeed, if current trends in the decline of European defense capabilities are not halted and reversed, future U.S. political leaders—those for whom the Cold War was not the formative experience that it was for me—may not consider the return on America's investment in NATO worth the cost.|$|E
