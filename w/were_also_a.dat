5|$|Any German {{invasion}} of Britain {{would have to}} involve the landing of troops and equipment somewhere on the coast, and the most vulnerable areas were {{the south and east}} coasts of England. Here, Emergency Coastal Batteries were constructed to protect ports and likely landing places. They were fitted with whatever guns were available, which mainly came from naval vessels scrapped {{since the end of the}} First World War. These included 6inch (152mm), 5.5inch (140mm), 4.7inch (120mm) and 4inch (102mm) guns. These had little ammunition, sometimes as few as ten rounds apiece. At Dover, two 14inch (356mm) guns known as Winnie and Pooh were employed. There <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> few land based torpedo launching sites.|$|E

5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> {{hallmark of the}} period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in {{that they were not}} part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume the {{following}} season, Salo signed another two-year contract with the Canucks at $1.5 million per season. He was limited to 59 games in the subsequent 2005–06 season, suffering a shoulder injury with the Finnish national team during the 2006 Winter Olympics, colliding with a teammate during a line change. He recorded 10 goals and 33 points with the Canucks, second among team defencemen in scoring. His 23 assists <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> career-high.|$|E
5|$|At the 1967 Interzonal, held at Sousse, Tunisia, Fischer scored 8½ {{points in}} the first 10 games, to lead the field. His {{observance}} of the Worldwide Church of God's seventh-day Sabbath was honored by the organizers, but deprived Fischer of several rest days, which led to a scheduling dispute, causing Fischer to forfeit two games in protest and later withdraw, eliminating himself from the 1969 World Championship cycle. Communications difficulties with the highly inexperienced local organizers <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> significant factor, since Fischer knew little French and the organizers had very limited English. No one in Tunisian chess had previous experience running an event of this stature.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1991 Croatia had no regular army, and {{in an effort to}} bolster its defence the country doubled its police force to about 20,000. The force's most effective component was its 3,000-strong special police, deployed in 12 battalions with a military structure. There <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> 9,000–10,000-strong regionally-organized reserve police, grouped into 16 battalions and 10 companies. The reserve police carried only small arms, and a portion of the force was unarmed. Although the Croatian government responded in May by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde – ZNG), its development was hampered by a United Nations arms embargo introduced in September. On 12 September the ZNG was ordered to blockade all JNA facilities it could reach, beginning the Battle of the Barracks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, Vanity Fair {{writers and}} Algonquin regulars Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert E. Sherwood started meeting for lunch at The Algonquin. Alexander Woollcott, acerbic critic and war correspondent, {{received}} a warm welcome from literary friends in 1919. They gathered in the Rose Room that afternoon; one person enjoyed the event enough to request that it become a daily event. That same request prompted a daily exchange of ideas and opinions shared between highly esteemed literary figures. George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Edna Ferber <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> part of this August assembly; these individuals influenced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. They founded The New Yorker magazine; all hotel guests receive free copies to this day.|$|E
5|$|Benedictine monasticism, {{present in}} England from the 6th century, was greatly {{extended}} after the Norman Invasion in 1066. There <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> number of Cistercian abbeys, {{but these were}} often in remote areas and not destined to become cathedrals. The Romanesque architecture of Normandy replaced that of Saxon England, the buildings being generally larger and more spacious, the general arrangement of monastic buildings following those of the great Abbey of Cluny. The Romanesque style, of which the English form is often known as Norman architecture, developed local characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Bernoulli {{wrote the}} text between 1684 and 1689, {{including}} {{the work of}} mathematicians such as Christiaan Huygens, Gerolamo Cardano, Pierre de Fermat, and Blaise Pascal. He incorporated fundamental combinatorial topics such as his theory of permutations and combinations (the aforementioned problems from the twelvefold way) {{as well as those}} more distantly connected to the burgeoning subject: the derivation and properties of the eponymous Bernoulli numbers, for instance. Core topics from probability, such as expected value, <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> significant portion of this important work.|$|E
5|$|Despite the on-ice success, the Atlanta {{ownership}} {{was never}} on sound financial footing.

5|$|Domestic {{politics}} in Eastern European countries continued {{to push for}} more enlargement, and political parties reluctant to move on NATO membership, such as the Bulgarian Socialist Party and Slovak HZDS, were voted out of office. Hungary's interest in joining was confirmed by a November 1997 referendum that returned 85.3 percent in favor of membership. Russia's actions in the First Chechen War <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> motivating factor for several countries that had memories of similar Soviet offensives.|$|E

5|$|Drosera anglica {{was first}} {{described}} by William Hudson in 1778. It has frequently been {{confused with the}} other circumpolar long-leaf Drosera, D. intermedia. This confusion was fueled by the resurfacing of an older name, D. longifolia (described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753), which was regarded as being too ambiguous in description and had been applied to specimens of both D. anglica and D. intermedia. Herbarium specimens <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> mix of the two species. These points led Martin Cheek to propose D. longifolia for rejection as a species name in 1998. The proposal was accepted and the taxon listed as rejected in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Due to the impeding {{threat of}} Vera to Shanghai, more than 3,000ships were piloted into port and 120pumping {{stations}} were readied to avert potential flooding. Furthermore, 20,000cruise passengers were evacuated to shelter. Despite tracking east of Shanghai, seven {{people were killed}} and twenty-eight others were injured in the city. The New China News Agency reported that over 500homes were destroyed. There <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> total of 25accidents and the storm disrupted power supplies in 1,000different locations across the city. A total of 3,000emergency workers were recalled to restore electrical supplies across Shanghai. In nearby Shengshi Qunado, one person was killed, and 70fishing boats sunk.

5|$|In 2003 and 2004, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{carried out}} two expeditions to Titanic. The first, carried out between 22 June and 2 July 2003, {{performed}} four dives in two days. Its key aims were {{to assess the}} current condition of the wreck site and carry out scientific observations to support ongoing research. The stern section, which had previously received relatively little attention from explorers, was specifically targeted for analysis. The microbial colonies aboard Titanic <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> key focus of investigation. The second expedition, from 27 May– 12 June 2004, saw the return of Robert Ballard to Titanic nearly 20 years after he discovered it. The expedition spent 11 days on the wreck, carrying out high-resolution mapping using video and stereoscopic still images.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, Thomas John Newbold, an English soldier {{working for}} the East India Company, {{estimated}} the population of Kuala Terengganu to be around 15,000 to 20,000 Malays with 600 Chinese, but it was presumably an overestimation. There were few brick buildings in the town. The principal brick buildings were a mosque and a custom house. Most of the houses were made of wood and thatch. The Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu, Kampung Cina, had become an old and established settlement. Most of the houses and shops in Kampung Cina were made of stone and brick. There <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> considerable number of Arabs and their descendant in Kuala Terengganu.|$|E
5|$|Jews <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> native {{religious}} {{group to the}} Islands during the Venetian period.

Jewish presence in Corfu can be traced since the times of the Principality of Taranto. In Cephalonia, there is evidence of Jewish habitation in the old capital, the Castle of St. George, since the early 17th century. When the capital of the island was transferred to Argostoli the Jews resettled there.|$|E
