30|$|Although with {{different}} <b>working</b> <b>modules,</b> {{most of the}} genome-editing tools share the same editing methodology by introducing double stranded-breaks (DSBs) into a desired genomic site. Cells react to DSBs by initiating DNA repair processes, either through non-homology end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed recombination (HDR). DNA repaired by NHEJ is error-prone, which can introduce small insertions or deletions (indels) into a genomic locus—causing frameshift thus knocking out the gene in coding region, or destroying a DNA regulation element in non-coding region; whereas DNA repaired by HDR {{can be used to}} introduce precise single nucleotide alterations or insert a whole gene into a specific genomic locus by providing an exogenous DNA template. When multiple DSBs have been made simultaneously into the cells (so called “multiplex”), chromatin structure changes, such as truncation, or even translocation or duplication, can also be made, albeit at a relatively lower rate (Hsu et al., 2014; Wang and Qi, 2016).|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{increasing}} number of determinations performed by radioimmunoassays necessitates rationalization of the procedures. An analyzer system has been developed in order to fully mechanize double antibody radioimmuno-assays, which is essentially composed out of four independently <b>working</b> <b>modules.</b> The samples, in microliter vials, are carried in sample chains of up to 650 links. The first pipetting step is performed by syringes with displacement pistons. Additional reagents are rapidly added by an electronically controlled Hamilton repeating dispenser, which makes shaking procedures for mixing unnecessary. The bound/free separation is achieved discontinuously by use of Nuclepore-filters, which are carried in 3 inches distance (76 mm) by a 35 mm dark leader film. After covering the radioactive filter positions with an adhesive plastic foil from both sides, the film spool is directly inserted into a specially constructed gamma-counter.
