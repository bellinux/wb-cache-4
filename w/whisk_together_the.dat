60|$|The {{reader who}} has had the {{patience}} to accompany me on these somewhat futile errands must {{have been aware of}} making them largely on the lordly omnibus-tops which I always found so much to my proud taste. Often, however, we <b>whisked</b> <b>together</b> from point to point in hansoms; often we made our way on foot, with those quick transitions from the present to the past, from the rush and roar of business thoroughfares to the deep tranquillity of religious interiors, or the noise-bound quiet of ancient church-yards, where the autumn flowers blazed under the withering autumn leaves, and the peaceful occupants of the public benches were scarcely more agitated by our coming than the tenants of the graves beside them.|$|R
25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and <b>whisk</b> <b>together</b> with a wire whisk until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified butter to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|R

To add different flavors into Serradura, green tea powder, vanilla extract or any other flavors can be added into the cream. Then, <b>whisk</b> them <b>together.</b> Another way {{to make some changes}} according to individual preferences, is to replace the Marie biscuits with other biscuits, such as Oreo.|$|R
