However, due to the different and numerous issues to face, it is <b>witnessing</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>interest</b> {{in the use of}} methodologies suitable for supporting the development of service-oriented applications. The paper proposes an approach, centered on the Method Engineering paradigm, which enables the definition of new methodologies tailored to address specific issues arising in developing of service-oriented applications through the exploitation of fragments of methodologies existing and experimented. In particular, it is shown how to obtain, through composition of method fragments, a complete process which covers from requirements specification to testing of service-oriented applications. The complete definition of a method fragment (MF-Web Services Builder) and a related CASE tool are also presented along with a case study showing their exploitation for building a real service...|$|R

These hybrid energy-aware Routers/Intrusion Prevention Systems have the ability to combine the packet forwarding activity with the possibility to perform packet inspection according to the actual energy availability, {{in such a way that}} allows sanitizing the traffic and save routing energy. However, while this allows early detection and discard of malicious packets, it may, on the other side, introduce additional delays in the packet delivery. In this paper we empirically assess to which extent the aggressive packet analysis needed to achieve substantial energy savings impacts upon the delay in the packet delivery...|$|R

In such an environment the need to maximise customer satisfaction and reliability and consequently, the deriving obligation to quantify and measure service functions becomes apparent. As traditional centralized NMS manager-agent approach has stretched to its limits, we propose a way of bringing together the static nature of SNMP protocol with the Mobile Agent Technology (MAT) in IP network. In order to address lack of quality of service inherent in current Internet technology, we have chosen differentiated services architecture by implementing the corresponding DiffServ MIB proposed by IETF. The major objective {{of this paper is}} to compare the required time to configure and monitor DiffServ domain routers by using MAs and the client-server model. The results drawn from our research lend support to the claim that the performance enhancement by adaptating MAT to rigid network management area depends mainly on the traffic load on the link connecting the managed network with the manager.

The increased levels of traffic have already resulted in many cities suffering from serious problems in the areas of: safety, congestion and pollution. Some of these problems could be solved if the number of short car journeys were reduced and replaced by walking. Many of our travel routines are influenced by a number of factors such as socio-economic, demographic, together with needs and attitudes. An important step in the direction of developing general concepts for the implementation of supportive measures for walking would therefore be to collect enough background information about the traveller him/herself. The results from different studies have found that in general people’s attitudes are very positive about walking if the conditions are right. One important factors is distance others are comfort, traffic, perception of safety, security and aesthetics. The conclusion is therefore that in order to encourage people to walk comprehensive programs are needed, including a range of different approaches, from physical implementation, new business and social structures to educational programs...|$|R

Matrix factorization that estimates the user liking for an item by taking an inner {{product on the}} latent features of users and item have been widely studied owing to its better accuracy and scalability.

In this paper, we aim to propose a novel multilayer non-linear approach to a variant of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to learn such factors from the incomplete ratings matrix. Firstly, we construct a user-item matrix with explicit ratings, secondly we learn latent factors for representations of users and items from the designed nonlinear multi-layer approach. Further, the architecture is built with different nonlinearities using adaptive gradient optimizer to better learn the latent factors in this space. We show that by doing so, our model is able to learn low-dimensional representations that are better suited for recommender systems on several benchmark datasets. Comment: version...|$|R

These extraction techniques are most advanced for text sources, {{but they are also}} researched for other media, for instance for recognizing persons and objects in images or video. The extracted information enriches and adds semantic meaning to document and queries (the latter e. g., in a relevance feedback setting). In addition, content recognition techniques trigger automated linking of information across documents and even across media. This situation poses a number of opportunities and challenges for retrieval and ranking models. For instance, instead of returning full documents, information extraction provides the means to return very focused results in the form of entities such as persons and locations. Another challenge is to integrate content recognition and content retrieval as much as possible, for instance by using the probabilistic output from the information extraction tools in the retrieval phase. These approaches are important steps towards semantic search, i. e., retrieval approaches that truly use the semantics of the data...|$|R

The {{proliferation of}} portable devices {{along with the}} widespread availability of wireless network connectivity is converting mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) into a basic scenario where impromptu collaborations take place. Recently, several collaborative middlewares have recently emerged for developing new collaboration tools. However, it is rather {{difficult to find a}} middleware for MANETs that enables building reliable applications from scratch, rapidly and easily, while explicitly taking into account the coordination issue, necessary to provide a more modular and standardized way of development. To cope with this, we present SCOMET, a middleware that permits the provisioning of collaborative services over MANETs. Its major aim is to provide an efficient coordination media layer to allow the coordinable entities to perform complex tasks in a completely decentralized fashion. In order to do this, SCOMET provides efficient group communication and membership services, which are known to be critical for collaborative environments. To address one-to-many communication, SCOMET proposes a new Application Layer Multicast protocol (ALM) called OMCAST. Designed to deal with the specific requirements of CWEs, OMCAST benefits from the broadcast nature of the wireless medium to minimize communication delays and congestion. Evaluation results show that OMCAST can achieve significant improvements...|$|R

In this paper, we present a social influence based clustering framework for analyzing heterogeneous information networks with three u-nique features. First, we introduce a novel social influence based vertex similarity metric in terms of both self-influence similarity and co-influence similarity. We compute self-influence and co-influence based similarity based on social graph and its associat-ed activity graphs and influence graphs respectively. Second, we compute the combined social influence based similarity between each pair of vertices by unifying the self-similarity and multiple co-influence similarity scores through a weight function with an iterative update method. Third, we design an iterative learning al-gorithm, SI-Cluster, to dynamically refine the K clusters by con-tinuously quantifying and adjusting the weights on self-influence similarity and on multiple co-influence similarity scores toward-s the clustering convergence. To make SI-Cluster converge fast, we transformed a sophisticated nonlinear fractional programming problem of multiple weights into a straightforward nonlinear para-metric programming problem of single variable. Our experiment results show that SI-Cluster not only achieves a better balance be-tween self-influence and co-influence similarities but also scales extremely well for large graph clustering...|$|R
