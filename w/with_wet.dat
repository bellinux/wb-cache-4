5|$|Banksia sessilis is {{endemic to}} the Southwest Botanical Province, a floristic {{province}} renowned as a biodiversity hotspot, {{located in the}} southwest corner of Western Australia. This area has a Mediterranean climate, <b>with</b> <b>wet</b> winters and hot, dry summers. B.sessilis occurs throughout much of the province, ranging from Kalbarri in the north, south to Cape Leeuwin, east along the south coast as far as Bremer Bay, and inland to Wongan Hills and Kulin. It thus spans a wide range of climates, occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland. It is also absent from the Karri forest in the cool, wet, southwest corner of the province, but even there, B.sessilis var. cordata occurs along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica {{grows in}} open, non-forested habitat <b>with</b> <b>wet,</b> often calcium-rich soils. These include bogs, marl fens, quaking bogs, cobble shores, and other {{calcareous}} habitats. This tolerance of calcium is relatively {{rare in the}} rest of the genus. D. anglica is often associated with various sphagnum mosses, and many times grows in a soil substrate that is entirely composed of living, dead, or decomposed sphagnum. The sphagnum wicks moisture to the surface while simultaneously acidifying it. What soil nutrients are not seeped away by the constant moisture are often used up by the sphagnum or made unavailable by the low soil pH. Since nutrient availability is low, competition from other plants is diminished, allowing the carnivorous English sundew to flourish.|$|E
5|$|High {{rainfall}} {{can cause}} widespread flooding, {{which can lead}} to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas. Such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and submerge homes. The Ghaggar-Hakra River, which only flows during India's monsoon season, can flood and severely damage local crops. Floods can be exacerbated by fires during the previous dry season, which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic, or water repellent. In various ways governments may help people deal <b>with</b> <b>wet</b> season floods. Flood plain mapping identifies which areas are more prone to flooding. Instructions on controlling erosion through outreach are also provided by telephone or the internet.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{surveys the}} {{physical}} properties of aramid and aramid/nylon hybrid air-jet textured yarns(ATY) for protective garments according to {{wet and dry}} texturing conditions. Aramid and nylon filaments were used to make two kinds of para-aramid ATY and four kinds of aramid/nylon hybrid ATY <b>with</b> dry and <b>wet</b> treatments. The analyzed physical properties of six specimens (made on the ATY machine) are as follows. The tenacity and initial modulus of aramid and aramid/nylon hybrid ATY decreased <b>with</b> the <b>wetting</b> and breaking strain; however, the yarn linear density of aramid and hybrid ATY increased <b>with</b> <b>wetting</b> treatment. The dry and wet thermal shrinkage of the hybrid ATY increased with wet-ting. The stability of aramid and hybrid ATY also increased <b>with</b> <b>wetting.</b> The physical properties of core/effect type hybrid ATY showed significantly more change than the core type hybrid ATY and the physical properties of nylon/aramid core/ effect hybrid ATY showedsignificantly more change than the of aramid/nylon core/effect hybrid ATY. A higher bulky and breaking strain of hybrid ATY require ATY processing conditions of nylon on the core part <b>with</b> <b>wetting</b> and aramid on the effect part. ATY processing conditions for nylon and aramid on the core part <b>with</b> <b>wetting</b> are required for a higher tenacity and modulus. ATY processing conditions of nylon and aramid on the core <b>with</b> no <b>wetting</b> are required for a low thermal shrinkage.

5|$|In areas <b>with</b> <b>wet</b> and dry seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish {{and erosion}} increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival {{strategies for the}} wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E

5|$|Transmission {{may occur}} via {{consumption}} of contaminated water, or when people share personal objects. In places <b>with</b> <b>wet</b> and dry seasons, water quality typically worsens during the wet season, and this correlates {{with the time}} of outbreaks. In {{areas of the world}} with four seasons, infections are more common in the winter. Bottle-feeding of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause on a global scale. Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, especially among children, in crowded households, and in those with pre-existing poor nutritional status. After developing tolerance, adults may carry certain organisms without exhibiting signs or symptoms, and thus act as natural reservoirs of contagion. While some agents (such as Shigella) only occur in primates, others may occur {{in a wide variety of}} animals (such as Giardia).|$|E
5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} on Louisiana, {{the storm}} produced a moderate storm surge, causing tidal flooding. In {{a city in}} the northeastern portion of the state, the surge breached a levee, which flooded many homes in the town. Moderate winds combined <b>with</b> <b>wet</b> soil knocked down trees, which then hit a few houses and power lines, and left hundreds of thousands without electric power. Two people drowned from rough surf in Florida. Further inland, tornadoes from the storm produced localized moderate damage. Throughout its path, Tropical Storm Bill caused around $50million in damage (2003USD) and four deaths.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating {{solar plants}} in the Mojave Desert have brought up issues of water use, because concentrating solar power plants with wet-cooling systems have high water-consumption intensities {{compared}} to other types of electric power plants; only fossil-fuel plants with carbon-capture and storage may have higher water intensities. A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating solar power plants <b>with</b> <b>wet</b> cooling was 810 ga/MWhr for power tower plants and 890 gal/MWhr for trough plants. This was higher than the operational water consumption (with cooling towers) for nuclear (720 gal/MWhr), coal (530 gal/MWhr), or natural gas (210). A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions: for power plants with cooling towers, water consumption during operations was 865 gal/MWhr for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWhr for CSP tower, 687 gal/MWhr for coal, 672 gal/MWhr for nuclear, and 198 gal/MWhr for natural gas. The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes 850 gal/MWhr.|$|E

5|$|The wet, or rainy, {{season is}} the time of year, {{covering}} one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas <b>with</b> <b>wet</b> seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location {{during the middle of the}} warm season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.|$|E
5|$|Water is the {{dominant}} element in the Everglades, and it shapes the land, vegetation, and animal life of South Florida. The South Florida climate was once arid and semi-arid, interspersed <b>with</b> <b>wet</b> periods. Between 10,000 and 20,000years ago, sea levels rose, submerging portions of the Florida peninsula and causing the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone, eroding some of it and creating springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and through evaporation formed thunderstorms. Limestone was dissolved by the slightly acidic rainwater. The limestone wore away, and groundwater {{came into contact with}} the surface, creating a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, the wearing away of the limestone in some areas created slight valleys and plateaus—a difference of inches in elevation—that affected not only the flow of water, but also types of vegetation present.|$|E
