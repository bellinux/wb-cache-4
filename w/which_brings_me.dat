2500|$|Groucho {{maintained}} his irrepressible {{sense of humor}} to the very end, however. [...] George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story {{of one of his}} final visits to Groucho's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Groucho from his wheelchair, put his arms around his torso, and began to [...] "walk" [...] the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put his fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> to tears." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before I {{enter on}} the {{business}} <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> here," [...] I said, [...] "I ought to warn you, Mr. Kyrle, that the shortest statement I can make of it may occupy some little time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] she said, [...] "let me beg you now to go away. If {{you care}} to, {{come and see}} me this evening. I will explain everything. It is a little family affair <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> here." ...|$|E
60|$|The Vicomte {{paused and}} took a turn in the apartment, whilst I pondered his words, <b>which</b> were <b>bringing</b> <b>me</b> a curious revelation. Presently he resumed.|$|R
5000|$|... "Aeroplane" [...] was {{the fifth}} single from the album. It is a rock song. Lyrics include: [...] "I love you like an {{aeroplane}} / <b>which</b> is <b>bringing</b> <b>me</b> home again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] said she. [...] "I know that {{here in the}} city you are very busy making money all the time, so I must not stay long. Will you buy me some stocks,--some good safe stocks, <b>which</b> will <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> in at least four per cent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One of the errands, my dear, <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> {{here is to}} bid you good-bye," [...] I began. [...] "I {{must get}} back to London to-day: and, before I leave, I {{want to have a}} word with you on the subject of your own affairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know, sir," [...] {{she began}} after awhile, [...] "if my coming {{here at this}} hour doth greatly {{surprise}} you, but in truth the matter <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> is so grave that I cannot give a thought to your feelings or to mine own." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pearce's {{customary}} matutinal {{visit was}} unusually agreeable to-day, inasmuch as he laid {{on my desk}} nineteen golden sovereigns and thirteen shillings. It being {{the day of the}} steamer's departure, an unusual number of invoice certificates had been required,--my signature to each of <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> two dollars.|$|E
6000|$|... "The wild savages!" [...] exclaimed the King, [...] "would they limit {{our best}} and dearest royal privilege, that {{of putting a}} stop to strife, and crying truce to battle? Will they remove the only motive <b>which</b> could <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> to the butcherly {{spectacle}} of their combat? Would they fight like men, or like their own mountain wolves?" ...|$|R
5000|$|No Master MindThere {{is a fact}} {{still more}} astounding: The absence of a master mind, of anyone dictating or {{forcibly}} directing these countless actions <b>which</b> <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> into being. No trace of such a person can be found. Instead, we find the invisible handat work.... Since only God can make a tree, I insist that only God could make me. Man can no more direct these millions of know-hows to <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> into being than he can put molecules {{together to create a}} tree.... The lesson I have to teach is this: Leave all creative energies uninhibited. Merely organize society to act in harmony with this lesson. Let society's legal apparatus remove all obstacles the best it can. Permit these creative know-hows freely to flow. Have faith that free men and women will respond to the Invisible Hand. This faith will be confirmed. [...] "I, Pencil", 2008 edition ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May that accursed Star of Hassan <b>which</b> tempted <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> {{better luck}} to others, and may hell receive {{the soul of}} Mesrour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The matter <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> to you, sir,' she said, 'is {{one which}} {{should call the}} blood up into your cheeks, and make you burn to hear, as it does me to tell. I have been wronged; my {{feelings}} have been outraged, insulted, wounded past all healing, and by your friends.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am indeed fond {{of early}} walking," [...] replied Emma, with a smile; [...] "but I cannot {{say that it}} is so much {{pleasure}} as duty <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> here. I am a day-governess, and pass this pond every morning on my way to Kensington, where the family in which I teach resides." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good evening," [...] he said. [...] "Now, madame, let us come to {{business}} at once. You will observe that I mention no names, but I {{know who is}} in the next room, and what he carries in that valise. That is the point <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> here. I have come to dictate terms of surrender." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Which</b> homily <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> {{directly}} to a brace of the most finished little fiends that ever banged drum or tootled fife in the Band of a British Regiment. They ended their sinful career by open and flagrant mutiny and were shot for it. Their names were Jakin and Lew--Piggy Lew--and they were bold, bad drummer-boys, both of them frequently birched by the Drum-Major of the Fore and Aft.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fortunately, if I do {{not fall}} in battle, I have a talisman <b>which</b> will <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> safe to you. Titus {{has given me}} a signet ring which will, at all times, procure me access to him. He has promised that, at all times, he will be my friend and, should I {{fall into the hands of}} his {{soldiers}} again, he will let me go free, and will give me the lives of any who may be dear to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would like}} to find a snug little place where, I can live, and carry on some {{business}} which I can attend to myself, and <b>which</b> will <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> into contact with people of all sorts--people who will interest me. It must be a small business, because I don't {{want to have to}} work very hard, and it must be snug and comfortable, because I want to enjoy it. I would like a shop of some sort, because that brings a man face to face with his fellow-creatures." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Mr. Robbie, I shall hope {{to try it}} some day, but not yet,’ I replied. ‘I {{hope you}} will not {{misunderstand}} me. My business, <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> to your city, is of a peculiar kind. Till you shall have heard it, and, indeed, till its issue is known, I should feel as if I had stolen your invitation.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In this instance," [...] he said coldly, [...] "I am {{not entirely}} my own master. There were {{powerful}} reasons why I {{should have taken}} this voyage to America, and there are reasons why I should have done so with Mrs. Van Reinberg. <b>Which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me,</b> by the bye, to the second matter concerning which I wished to speak to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Robbie, I shall hope {{to try it}} some day, but not yet," [...] I replied. [...] "I {{hope you}} will not {{misunderstand}} me. My business, <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> to your city, is of a peculiar kind. Till you shall have heard it, and, indeed, till its issue is known, I should feel as if I had stolen your invitation." ...|$|E
60|$|I glanced {{round at}} this, and I {{perceived}} {{that we had}} trotted along at so good a pace {{during the time that}} we were keeping up our pleasant chat, that the dragoon with the lame horse was altogether out of sight. I looked on every side, but in the whole of that vast rocky valley there was no one save only the Bart and I--both of us armed, you understand, and both of us well mounted. I began to ask myself whether after all it was quite necessary that I should ride that mile <b>which</b> would <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> to the British outposts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Leon, listen; {{for here}} is the favor I am asking. Mr. Jim Belcher"--she {{pronounced}} the name with great gravity--"will write {{to you in a}} few days. But inside of YOUR letter will be a little note to <b>me,</b> <b>which</b> you will <b>bring</b> <b>me.</b> You can show your letter to your family, if they want to know who it is from; but no one must see MINE. Can you manage that?" ...|$|R
5000|$|I have {{so often}} been asked the question: [...] "But {{how did you}} come to think of The Scarlet Pimpernel?" [...] And my answer has always been: [...] "It was God's will that I should." [...] And to you moderns, who perhaps do not believe as I do, I will say, [...] "In the chain of my life, there were so many links, all of <b>which</b> tended towards <b>bringing</b> <b>me</b> to the {{fulfillment}} of my destiny." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did her no wrong. There was {{a motive}} {{which she was}} keeping from you. In {{revealing}} that motive, I reveal the painful secret <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> to this house. All that I could do to prepare you, I have done. Let me now tell the truth in the plainest and fewest words. When Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone left Combe-Raven, in the March of the present year--" ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{is to look}} forward. After Jessie {{had been}} but a little while upon his heels, the Master comes to me {{one day in the}} steward's office, and with more civility than usual, [...] "Mackellar," [...] says he, [...] "there is a damned crazy wench comes about here. I cannot well move in the matter myself, <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> to you. Be so good as to see to it: the men must have a strict {{injunction}} to drive the wench away." ...|$|E
6000|$|And yet I {{am sorry}} the lady told me, since a wound <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> no {{happiness}} has resulted. I am most willing to apply such salve as I can. The {{best way to}} set the matter right and make everything pleasant and agreeable all around will be to print in this place {{a description of the}} shrine as it appeared to a recent visitor, Mr. Frederick W. Peabody, of Boston. I will copy his newspaper account, and the reader will see that Mrs. Eddy's portrait is not there now: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was always}} heedless. I was born heedless; and {{therefore}} I was constantly, and quite unconsciously, committing breaches {{of the minor}} proprieties, which brought upon me humiliations which ought to have humiliated me but didn't, because I didn't know anything had happened. But Livy knew; and so the humiliations fell to her share, poor child, who had not earned them and did not deserve them. She always said I {{was the most difficult}} child she had. She was very sensitive about me. It distressed her to see me do heedless things <b>which</b> could <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> under criticism, and so she was always watchful and alert to protect me from the kind of transgressions which I have been speaking of.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{at present}} {{intensely}} fills {{our hearts and}} minds is all that took place on St. Matthias Day, and the day or two before and after. Passages and circumstances there were, which it is almost wonderful that you all could respectively bear, some affecting one the more and some the other; but the absorbing feeling that a great work was then done, and the ardent trust and prayer that it {{might turn out to}} the glory of God, and the good of mankind, supported every one, I have no doubt. It was about one of those days that I was first informed {{of the nature of the}} complaint which had just been discovered, and <b>which</b> is <b>bringing</b> <b>me</b> gradually to the grave.|$|R
60|$|At Tumento the halt {{of a day}} (March 22) was {{necessary}} in order to hire carriers and get ready for the march eastward. Here, too, I washed sundry specimens of soft earth from various parts of the river-banks, finding colour of gold in all except the grey clay. Our Mohammedan friends were there; the eldest called upon me and was exceedingly civil, besides being to a certain extent useful. For the hire of a shilling and two cakes of Cavendish he found me eggs in a village some three miles off, and he ended by writing me a 'safy,' <b>which</b> would <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> good luck in all my undertakings. It consists of the usual Koranic quotations in black, and of magic numbers in pink, ink.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And now,' he went on, 'I {{may as well}} say a word in {{vindication of}} my conduct lately, at the risk, too, of {{offending}} you. My actual motive in submitting to your order that I should send for my late wife, and live with her, was not the mercenary policy of wishing to retain an office <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> greater comforts than any I have enjoyed before, but this unquenchable passion for Cytherea. Though I saw the weakness, folly, and even wickedness of it continually, it still forced {{me to try to}} continue near her, even as the husband of another woman.' ...|$|E
60|$|July 18.--- A Sunday with {{alternate}} {{showers and}} sunshine. Wrote double task, <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> to page forty-six inclusive. I read the Spae-wife of Galt. There is something good in it, {{and the language}} is occasionally very forcible, but he has made his story difficult to understand, by adopting a region of history little known, and having many heroes of the same name, whom {{it is not easy}} to keep separate in one's memory. Some of the traits of the Spae-wife, who conceits herself to be a changeling or twin, are very good indeed. His Highland Chief is a kind of Caliban, and speaks, like Caliban, a jargon never spoken on earth, but full of effect for all that.|$|E
6000|$|Forgive me for {{not having}} written to you before, but I have been so bothered that I have felt no taste for writing; when I have the time, I have some curious stories to tell you. Once again I have {{encountered}} that demon of misfortune which dogs my footsteps. Being occupied all day and nearly all night upon business <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> a heap of worries and next to no profit, I have no chance to look after my things. Thieves have entered my room, stolen everything, and left me an empty box. I am once again almost without clothes, and know not where to turn to make that figure necessary for the fulfilment of my duties. You see, I am not lucky. Since coming to your country, the sole piece of fortune I have had was to tumble on a man like you. Excuse {{me for not}} writing more at this moment. Hoping {{that you are in}} good health, and in affectionately pressing your hand, ...|$|E
60|$|Your {{letter of}} the 31st of May is just {{received}}. I should have written to you {{within a day or}} two to inform you of a slight change of plan, <b>which</b> will <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> into Copenhagen from ten days to two weeks later than I wrote you I should be there, even if I had not received your letter. To save retracing my steps, as I should be obliged to do by the routes laid out in my last letter, I now intend to go from The Hague to Berlin and visit a few of the German cities before going to Denmark. From Copenhagen I shall go by water to Norway, thence to Sweden, St. Petersburg, Moscow, and to Vienna.|$|R
60|$|For {{a second}} or two after that my ear caught the soft sound of her {{retreating}} footsteps, then nothing more. To say that I felt anxious and ill at ease was but to put it mildly. I was face to face with an adventure which might cost me at least five years' acute discomfort in New Caledonia, but <b>which</b> might also <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> as rich a reward as could befall any man of modest ambitions: a lovely wife and a comfortable fortune. My whole life seemed to be hanging on a thread, and my overwrought senses seemed almost to catch the sound of the spinning-wheel of Fate weaving the web of my destiny.|$|R
60|$|This {{is already}} the third time I have taken up pen to write to you, but, having nothing but misfortune to recount, I hesitated, {{awaiting}} better days. Indeed, I have been so profoundly discouraged that if I had not thought it my duty {{to let you know}} of my fortunes I know not even now if I should have found the necessary spirit. 'Les choses vont de mal en mal'. From what I hear there has never been so bad a season here. Nothing going on. All the same, I am tormented by a mob of little matters <b>which</b> <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> not sufficient to support my life. I know not what to do; one thing is certain, in no case shall I return here another year. The patron of this hotel, my good employer, is one of those innumerable specimens who do not forge or steal because they have no need, and if they had would lack the courage; who observe the marriage laws because they have been brought up to believe in them, and know that breaking them brings risk and loss of reputation; who do not gamble because they dare not; do not drink because it disagrees with them; go to church because their neighbours go, and to procure an appetite for the mid-day meal; commit no murder because, not transgressing in any other fashion, they are not obliged. What is there to respect in persons of this sort? Yet they are highly esteemed, and form three quarters of Society. The rule with these good gentlemen is to shut their eyes, never use their thinking powers, and close the door on all the dogs of life for fear they should get bitten.|$|R
