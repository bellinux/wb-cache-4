25|$|The area of Kielce {{has been}} {{inhabited}} {{since at least}} the 5th century BC. Until the 6th or 7th century the banks of the Silnica were inhabited by Celts. They were driven out by a Slavic tribe of Vistulans who started hunting in the nearby huge forests and had settled most of the area now known as Lesser Poland and present-day Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship. The lands of Wiślanie were at first subdued by Bohemia, however they soon came {{under the control of the}} Piast dynasty and became a part of Poland. According to a local legend, Mieszko, son of Boleslaus II of Poland dreamt he was attacked by a band of brigands in a forest. In the dream he saw a vision of Saint Adalbert who drew a <b>winding</b> <b>line</b> which turned into a stream. When Mieszko woke up, he found the Silnica River whose waters helped him regain strength. He also discovered huge white tusks of an unknown animal. Mieszko announced he would build a town and a church to St. Adalbert at that site. According to this legend, the town's name Kielce commemorates the mysterious tusks (kieł in Polish).|$|E

This was {{a consequence of the}} precipitate abandonment of Bray and the <b>winding</b> <b>line</b> of the Somme river, with its important bridgeheads westwards towards Sailly-le-Sec, by the Third Army on the afternoon of 26 March.

However some flies, such as the trolling tandem streamer fly, are designed for trolling behind a moving boat.|$|E

50|$|All {{of these}} bombsights shared {{the problem that}} {{they were unable to}} deal with wind in any {{direction}} other than along the path of travel.

Unless the target just happened to be travelling directly in <b>line</b> with the <b>wind,</b> their motion would carry the bomber away from the <b>wind</b> <b>line</b> as they approached. Additionally, as anti-aircraft artillery grew more effective, they would often pre-sight their guns along the <b>wind</b> <b>line</b> of the targets they were protecting, knowing that attacks would come from those directions. A solution for attacking cross-wind was sorely needed.|$|R

Here the hauptmann drew a deep sigh of relief, for after days of hopeless wandering through almost impenetrable jungle the broad vista of waving grasses dotted here and there with open park like woods and in the far distance the <b>winding</b> <b>line</b> of green shrubbery that denoted a river appeared to the European a veritable heaven.|$|E
60|$|Not a sound, not {{a moving}} object, broke the utter {{stillness of the}} glen of Scetis.

The plumes of the palm-trees hung motionless, as if awaiting in resignation the breathless blaze of the approaching day. At length, among the green ridges of the monastery garden, two gray figures rose from their knees, and began, with slow and feeble strokes, to break the silence by the clatter of their hoes among the pebbles.|$|E

The ionized gas in I Zw 18 has a low oxygen abundance (O approx. 1 / 30 Osun) and nitrogen abundance (N- 1 / 100 Nsun) (Pequignot 2008). We have obtained a far-UV spectrum of the northwest massive star cluster of I Zw 18 using Hubble's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS).

40|$|Building upon a {{previous}} analysis of P V <b>wind</b> <b>lines</b> in LMC O stars, we analyze the P V <b>wind</b> <b>lines</b> {{in a sample}} of Galactic O stars which have empirical mass loss rates determined from either their radio fluxes or H alpha profiles. Since the wind analysis provides a measure of Ṁq where q is the ionization fraction of the ion, we determine q(P V) observationally. In spite of model predictions that q should be about 1 for mid-O stars, we find q(P V) is less than 0. 15 throughout the O stars. We discuss the origin of this discrepancy.

60|$|It {{was obvious}} that he desired {{to be rid of}} them; and as it was getting cooler George resumed his journey. He found the creek early the next morning, and as the day promised to be unusually hot he delayed only until he had watered the stock. In an hour or two the sun was hidden by banks of leaden cloud, but the {{temperature}} did not fall and there was an oppressive heaviness in the air. The prairie had faded to a sweep of lifeless gray, obscured above its verge. The men made progress, however; and late in the afternoon a <b>winding</b> <b>line</b> of timber that marked the river's course appeared ahead. Shortly afterward, Edgar looked around.|$|E
60|$|Above Venters loomed a {{wonderful}} arch of stone bridging the canyon rims, {{and through the}} enormous round portal gleamed and glistened a beautiful valley shining under sunset gold reflected by surrounding cliffs. He gave a start of surprise. The valley was a cove a mile long, half that wide, and its enclosing walls were smooth and stained, and curved inward, forming great caves. He decided that its floor was far higher than the level of Deception Pass and the intersecting canyons. No purple sage colored this valley floor. Instead there were the white of aspens, streaks of branch and slender trunk glistening from the green of leaves, and the darker green of oaks, and {{through the middle of}} this forest, from wall to wall, ran a <b>winding</b> <b>line</b> of brilliant green which marked the course of cottonwoods and willows.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour later}} {{they left the}} tall {{elevators}} and straggling town behind, and after brushing through a belt of crimson flowers, they followed the torn-up black trail that led into the waste. After {{a mile or two}} it broke into several divergent rows of ruts, and they went on toward a <b>winding</b> <b>line</b> of bluff across the short grass. Reaching that, they pushed through the thin wood of dwarf birch and poplar, skirting little pools from which mallard rose: and then, crossing a long rise, they sat down to smoke on its farther side. Sage Butte had disappeared, the sun had dipped, and the air was growing wonderfully fresh and cool. Here and there a house or barn rose from the sweep of grass; {{but for the most part}} it ran back into the distance lonely and empty. It was steeped in strong, cold coloring, but on its western rim there burned a vivid flush of rose and saffron. Edgar was impressed by its vastness and silence.|$|E
40|$|The binarity of Eta Carinae {{has been}} debated {{for a long}} time.

50|$|The {{ejection}} material, {{transported by}} the wind, {{is responsible for}} the process of renovation of the surface at speeds, according to the measurements of the Venera soundings, of approximately one metre per second. Given the density of the lower Venusian atmosphere, the winds are more than sufficient to provoke the erosion of the surface and the transportation of fine-grained material. In the regions covered by ejection deposits one may find <b>wind</b> <b>lines,</b> dunes, and yardangs. The <b>wind</b> <b>lines</b> are formed when the wind blows ejection material and volcanic ash, depositing it on top of topographic obstacles such as domes. As a consequence, the leeward sides of domes are exposed to the impact of small grains that remove the surface cap. Such processes expose the material beneath, which has a different roughness, and thus different characteristics under radar, compared to formed sediment.|$|R

We searched for a magnetic field using spectropolarimetry. From UV spectroscopy, we analysed the wind variability and investigated the correlation with the magnetic data. Using 130 time-resolved circular polarisation spectra, obtained with the MuSiCoS spectropolarimeter at the 2 m TBL from 1998 until 2005, we applied the least-squares deconvolution method on the Stokes V spectra and derived the longitudinal component of the integrated magnetic field over the visible hemisphere of the star. We performed a period analysis on the magnetic data and on EW measurements of UV <b>wind</b> <b>lines</b> obtained over 17 years. We also analysed the short- and long-term radial velocity variations, which are due to the pulsations and the 90 -year binary motion. beta Cep hosts a sinusoidally varying magnetic field with an amplitude 97 (4) G and an average value - 6 (3) G. From the UV <b>wind</b> <b>line</b> variability, we derive a period of 12. 00075 (11) days, which is the rotation period of the star, and {{is compatible with the}} observed magnetic modulation.

60|$|To us, {{however, the}} {{situation}} is a new one; and it looks dangerous in the extreme. More than once I check myself, not without an effort, {{in the act of}} resuming the command of my pony on passing the more dangerous points in the journey.

And then came the great prize, Tancred, mounted on a dromedary, his right arm bound up in a sling which Baroni had hastily made, and surrounded and followed by a large troop of horsemen, who treated him with the highest consideration, not only because he was a great prince, whose ransom could bring many camels to their tribe, but because he had shown those feats of valour which the wild desert honours.|$|E

Aims. We searched for a magnetic field using high-resolution spectropolarimetry. From UV spectroscopy, we analysed the wind variability and investigated the correlation with the magnetic data. Methods. We used 130 time-resolved circular polarisation spectra that were obtained from 1998 (when β Cep was discovered to be magnetic) to 2005, with the MuSiCoS échelle spectropolarimeter at the 2 m Télescope Bernard Lyot. We applied the least-square deconvolution method on the Stokes V spectra and derived the longitudinal component of the integrated magnetic field over the visible hemisphere of the star. We performed a period analysis on the magnetic data and on equivalent-width measurements of UV <b>wind</b> <b>lines</b> obtained over 17 years. We also analysed the short- and long-term radial velocity variations, which are due to the pulsations and the 90 -year binary motion, respectively. Results. β Cep hosts a sinusoidally varying magnetic field with an amplitude 97 ± 4 G and an average value − 6 ± 3 G. From the UV <b>wind</b> <b>line</b> variability, we derive a period of 12. 00075 (11) days, which is the rotation period of the star, and {{is compatible with the}} observed magnetic modulation.
