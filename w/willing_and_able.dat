5|$|Analyses {{has been}} {{published}} by currency strategists at RBS, scoring countries on their potential to undertake intervention, measuring their relative intention to weaken their currency and their capacity to do so. Ratings {{are based on the}} openness of a country's economy, export growth and real effective exchange rate (REER) valuation, as well as the scope a country has to weaken its currency without damaging its economy. As of January 2013, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> <b>able</b> to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are among the least.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1793, war and {{internal}} disorder had combined with poor weather to leave France facing starvation following {{the collapse of the}} harvest. France's ongoing conflict with her neighbours precluded overland imports; the only nation <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> <b>able</b> to sell grain to the National Convention was the United States. Importing food from the Americas was a highly risky venture, as the British Royal Navy—at war with France since early 1793—patrolled much of the Atlantic passage. To provide effective protection for the vessels involved, a plan was agreed between France and the United States to collect the supplies over a period of months and transport them in a single convoy. A gathering point was arranged at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E

5|$|Truman was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which established a formal peacetime military alliance with Canada and democratic European nations that had not fallen under Soviet control following World War II. The treaty establishing it was widely popular and easily passed the Senate in 1949; Truman appointed General Eisenhower as commander. NATO's goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a clear message to communist leaders that the world's democracies were <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> <b>able</b> to build new security structures in support of democratic ideals. The U.S., Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and Canada were the original treaty signatories. The alliance resulted in the Soviets establishing a similar alliance, called the Warsaw Pact.|$|E
5|$|Consuls {{were each}} {{assigned}} {{two of the}} four legions to command, rarely employing all four legions at once to the same assignment. However, the Senate feared a real threat and not only deployed all four legions to the field but all eight, including allies. Ordinarily, each of the two consuls would command his own portion of the army, but since the two armies were combined into one, Roman law required them to alternate their command on a daily basis. The traditional account puts Varro in command {{on the day of the}} battle, and much of the blame for the defeat has been laid on his shoulders. However, his low origins seem to be exaggerated in the sources, and Varro may have been made a scapegoat by the aristocratic establishment. He lacked the powerful descendants that Paullus had, descendants who were <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> <b>able</b> to protect his reputation— most notably, Paullus was the grandfather of Scipio Aemilianus, the patron of Polybius (one of our main sources of this history).|$|E
5|$|Feeling {{that her}} {{employment}} opportunities were being blocked, that same year, on 19 January 1959, Johnson asked {{to address the}} members of the Bahamian House of the Assembly, but was told she could only speak after the session adjourned, to which she agreed. In her speech, she pointed out that a petition had been submitted to the House in 1958 for suffrage, which Members had claimed showed only 13 petitioners and 529 signatories. She provided mimeographed copies showing the actual number was 2,829 people and included people from Abaco, Andros, Cat Island, Eleuthera, Exuma, Grand Bahama, Long Island, and New Providence. She went on to complain that women were being taxed without representation and reasoned that should the vote not be extended to them, they should no longer have to pay taxes. She insisted that women were working members of society and were ready, <b>willing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>able</b> to participate as full citizens. Though the Members of Parliament were impressed with the speech, they did nothing.|$|E

25|$|In microeconomics, the Bertrand–Edgeworth {{model of}} price-setting {{oligopoly}} looks at {{what happens when}} there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where {{there is a limit to}} the output of firms which they are <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> <b>able</b> to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are <b>willing</b> <b>and</b> <b>able</b> to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E
