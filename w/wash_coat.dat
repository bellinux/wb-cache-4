40|$|Metallic foams {{with their}} {{specific}} structural properties are attractive candidates for exhaust after treatment systems, e. g diesel particulate filters (DPF) and catalyst supports. The high temperature and corrosive operating conditions require outstanding material properties. For such applications {{a number of}} corrosion resistant nickel- and iron-nickel-based alloys were successfully developed. The paper reports on a powder metallurgical route which transforms a commercial available nickel foam into a high temperature stable foam alloy using a pre-alloyed powder which is coated on the foam substrate and subsequently sintered. A further heat treatment process was developed to enhance the durability over the lifetime. The thermal conditions under an atmosphere with a specific oxygen partial pressure ensure a selective oxidation to form a a- alumina layer which acts as a diffusion barrier to prevent the <b>wash</b> <b>coat</b> aging and furthermore increases the high temperature oxidation resistance considerably...|$|E
40|$|Catalysts {{have been}} used on cars since 1974 to reduce {{tailpipe}} emission levels of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. Initially, oxidation catalysts were used that operated under very lean air/fuel conditions and gave rise to increased sulphate particulate emissions. These sulphate emissions could fortunately be reduced by better air/fuel control. However, the introduction of more active catalyst compositions, in particular the use of cerium oxide components on the <b>wash</b> <b>coat,</b> led to bad odour complaints from motorists. In the report it is shown that under fuel-lean conditions, sulphur, originating from the fuel, is stored as aluminium and cerium sulphates onto the washcoat. Upon a rapid change to fuel-rich engine operation the stored sulphates are released as hydrogen sulphide and is the cause for the smell observed. The sulphur storage/release process results in hydrogen sulphide emissions many times higher than is possible from steady-state conversion from the fuel sulphur level. By using a catalyst/engine combination on a testbed the experiments {{have shown that the}} hydrogen sulphide release is a kinetically limited reaction and, apart from the air/fuel control, depends mainly on the catalyst temperature...|$|E
40|$|Catalytic {{converters}} are devices {{attached to}} the exhaust system of automobile or other engines to eliminate or substantially reduce polluting emissions. They consist of coated substrates enclosed in a stainless steel housing. The substrate is typically made of ceramic honeycombs; however stainless steel foil honeycombs are also used. The coating is usually a slurry of alumina, silica, rare earth oxides and platinum group metals. The slurry {{also known as the}} <b>wash</b> <b>coat</b> is applied to the substrate in two doses, one on each end of the substrate; in some cases multiple layers of coating are applied. X-ray imaging is used to inspect the applied coating depth on a substrate to confirm compliance with quality requirements. Automated image analysis techniques are employed to measure the coating depth from the X-ray image. Coating depth is assessed by analysis of attenuation line profiles in the image. Edge detection algorithms with noise reduction and outlier rejection are used to calculate the coating depth at a specified point along an attenuation line profile. Quality control of the product is accomplished using several attenuation line profile regions for coating depth measurements, with individual pass or fail criteria specified for each region...|$|E

40|$|Three-phase reactor designs {{based on}} {{rotating}} solid foams are {{developed for the}} application in the fine chemical industry. The solid foam is used as catalyst support and stirrer in order to mix the gas and liquid phases and create fine gas bubbles. Gas-liquid mass transfer data are presented for different solid foam stirrer configurations and compared to an optimized Rushton stirrer. Solid foam stirrers were developed in a blade and a block design. Both foam reactor designs work at very low stirring rate. For similar power input, the mass transfer is comparable to a Rushton stirrer. A recipe {{for the application of}} alumina catalyst support on aluminium foams was developed. Anodization of aluminium foams leads to a strong increase of the <b>wash</b> <b>coat</b> stability. Interparticle pores in micrometer size range lead to a high mass transfer through the catalyst layer. The foam stirrer designs can easily be used in ordinary three-phase reactors and show a high potential for further optimization of the gas-liquid flow pattern and therefore for increase of the mass transfer. In addition to having a superior mass transfer performance, catalyst filtering can be avoided, since the liquid can simply be drained from the reacto...|$|E

40|$|Catalysts {{deposited}} on structured supports, such as ceramic or metallic monoliths, have several advantages over conventional packed bed reactors: increase of mass and heat transfer, lower pressure drop, larger surface-to-volume ratio and compact reactor design. Structured supports permit {{to decrease the}} particle size of the active metals by using low metal content, maintaining high catalytic performance.

40|$|WASP and SCAR {{homologue}} (WASH) is {{a recently}} identified and evolutionarily conserved regulator of actin polymerization. In this paper, {{we show that}} <b>WASH</b> <b>coats</b> mature Dictyostelium discoideum lysosomes and is essential for exocytosis of indigestible material. A related process, the expulsion of the lethal endosomal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans from mammalian macrophages, also uses WASH-coated vesicles, and cells expressing dominant negative WASH mutants inefficiently expel C. neoformans. D. discoideum WASH causes filamentous actin (F-actin) patches to form on lysosomes, leading to the removal of vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) and the neutralization of lysosomes to form postlysosomes. Without WASH, no patches or coats are formed, neutral postlysosomes are not seen, and indigestible material such as dextran is not exocytosed. Similar results occur when actin polymerization is blocked with latrunculin. V-ATPases are known to bind avidly to F-actin. Our data imply a new mechanism, actin-mediated sorting, in which WASH and the Arp 2 / 3 complex polymerize actin on vesicles to drive the separation and recycling of proteins such as the V-ATPase...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{development}} of an external reformer of methane using Ni-based structured and unstructured catalysts. Nickel is so far the most active catalyst for the DRM, but also highly prone to carbon formation, because, together with the ability to activate the C-H bond, Ni has an high affinity to carbon. The Ni particle size has a strong effect on the carbon tolerance of the catalyst, therefore, the stabilization of small Ni nanoparticles at high temperatures is a promising way for the lifetime increase. The catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of active phase (10 wt. % Ni) on γ-Al 2 O 3 or Ru(0. 05 wt. %) /γ-Al 2 O 3 and <b>wash</b> <b>coating</b> deposition of the carrier on cordierite monoliths.

An Engineering Development Unit (EDU) of the MTSA Subassembly (MTSAS) was designed and assembled for optimized Martian operations, but also meets system requirements for lunar operations. For lunar operations the MTSA sorption cycle is driven via a vacuum swing between suit ventilation loop pressure and lunar vacuum. The focus of this effort was testing in a simulated lunar environment. This environment was simulated in Paragon's EHF vacuum chamber. The objective of the testing was to evaluate the full cycle performance of the MTSA Subassembly EDU, and to assess CO 2 loading and pressure drop of the <b>wash</b> <b>coated</b> aluminum reticulated foam sorbent bed. Lunar environment testing proved out the feasibility of pure vacuum swing operation, making MTSA a technology that can be tested and used on the Moon prior to going to Mars. Testing demonstrated better than expected CO 2 Nomenclature loading on the sorbent and nearly replicates the equilibrium data from the sorbent manufacturer. This exceeded any of the previous sorbent loading tests performed by Paragon. Subsequently, the increased performance of the sorbent bed design indicates future designs will require less mass and volume than the current EDU rendering MTSA as very competitive for Martian PLSS applications...|$|R

For this purpose, cross sectional survey of the bacterial contamination of white coats in a medical college has been carried out in 3 different locations; Royal College of Medicine, Perak, University of Kuala Lumpur and a private college attached to Ipoh General Hospital. It was found that the incidence of Staphylococus aureus, was 32 % on short-sleeved and 54 % on long-sleeved white coats. Bacillus species was the second most common type of bacteria found. Male collars and female pockets had higher microbial contaminations (p= 0. 01, 0. 03 respectively). Clinical students’ white coats were significantly less contaminated than non-clinical students (p= 0. 001) although they tend to wear it for a longer period (5. 75 ± 2. 19 h vs. 2. 32 ± 0. 81 h) (p= 0. 001).

40|$|Rotating foam stirrer {{reactors}} have {{a promising}} application in multiphase reactions. In this reactor, highly porous open-celled materials, solid foams, are used {{both as a}} catalyst support and as stirrer blades. One {{of the advantages of}} such a foam stirrer is easy catalyst handling. This paper presents a preparation method for catalysts on solid foam supports. The performance of the alumina foam catalysts is tested in the hydrogenation of a functionalized alkyne. A stable and homogeneous catalytic coating was deposited on aluminum foams by a combination of anodization and <b>wash</b> <b>coating</b> using the slurry method. Anodization produced a rough and porous material that improved the adhesion of the catalytic coating. The use of a slurry with a bimodal particle size distribution increased the catalytic coating stability. The mass loss of the catalytic coating after applying ultrasonic vibrations was less than 10 wt %, which indicates a good adhesion. A high specific surface area was achieved by increasing the foam cell density, that is, the number of pores per linear inch (ppi), and the catalytic coating thickness. With the wash-coating method, catalytic coatings were produced having a thickness between 10 and 40 µm, a porosity of around 50 %, and a specific surface area up to 28. 5 m 2 /gfoam. The hydrogenation of 3 -methyl- 1 -pentyn- 3 -ol was chosen as the test reaction. Internal and external mass transfers limit the reaction rate of this fast reaction. High activity and selectivity were reached by combining a high specific surface area with a thin catalytic coating on the foam. Increasing the foam cell density up to 20 ppi led to enhanced liquid-solid mass transfer because of the high specific surface area combined with the fast refreshment of the catalyst surface. Coating thicknesses of less than 20 µm led to improved internal mass transfer due to shorter diffusion paths...|$|R

This study examined whether the metabolites washed from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) roots modulated the metabolic response to the NPs of a biosensor generated in the root colonizer, Pseudomonas putida KT 2440. The root wash components boosted light output of the biosensor consistent with their catabolism. Dose-dependent and rapid inhibition of cell metabolism occurred with both ZnO and CuO NPs in water suspensions but high light output was maintained in root wash. Root wash also protected biosensor output in challenges with Zn ions. However the root wash components did not protect culturability or biosensor light output upon exposure to Cu ions. Imaging by atomic force microscopy suggested that root <b>wash</b> materials <b>coated</b> the NPs. We deduced that the response of a microbe to these metal oxide NPs could be negated by components released from roots. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
