5|$|As in Myst, the {{topology}} of {{the islands}} was originally created as grayscale images, where brightness corresponded to elevation. In Softimage, these maps were turned into the terrain models seen in the game. The large island objects were broken apart to facilitate efficient rendering, <b>which</b> <b>required</b> them to be created using polygonal geometry. All other objects were modeled using B-splines and NURBS.|$|E
