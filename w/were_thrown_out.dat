Sion, however, <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> of the tournament by UEFA due to them fielding ineligible players in the two games against Celtic. Celtic were thus reinstated, eventually finishing third in Group I, behind Atlético Madrid and Udinese and ahead of Rennes.|$|E

The union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in February 1915. There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects.|$|E
5|$|Shakur {{personally}} cross-examined the witnesses, getting White {{to admit}} that he had once been in love with her; the same day, one juror (who had been frequently napping during the trial) was replaced with an alternate. During the retrial, the defendants repeatedly left or <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> of the courtroom. Both defendants were acquitted in the retrial; six jurors interviewed after the trial stated that they did not believe the two key prosecution witnesses. Shakur was immediately returned to Morristown, New Jersey, under a heavy guard following the trial. Louis Chesimard (Shakur's ex-husband) and Paul Stewart, the other two alleged robbers, had been acquitted in June.|$|E
5|$|When {{the stock}} market in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929, the effect in Germany was dire. Millions <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> of work and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the NSDAP {{prepared}} {{to take advantage of}} the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to strengthen the economy and provide jobs. Many voters decided the NSDAP was capable of restoring order, quelling civil unrest and improving Germany's international reputation. After the federal election of 1932, the Nazis were the largest party in the Reichstag, holding 230 seats with 37.4 percent of the popular vote.|$|E

5|$|Before Animaniacs was {{put into}} {{production}} in 1991, various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up to create both the characters and premise of the series. For instance, ideas that <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> were Rita and Runt being the hosts of the show and the Warners being duck characters that senior producer Tom Ruegger drew in his college years. After the characters from the series were created, they were all shown to executive producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which characters would make it into Animaniacs (the characters Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg's daughter). The characters' designs came from various sources, including caricatures of other writers, designs based on early cartoon characters, and characters that simply had a more modern design.|$|E
5|$|Iwadare {{was asked}} to create memorable melodies, but found {{creating}} suitable tracks difficult as many of his initial pieces <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out.</b> For Kameoka, recording the live orchestral segments proved a time-consuming and difficult business: each element of a track was recorded separately, then mixed into a single track, then each orchestral element needed to be adjusted for speed and tone so they lined up correctly. According to Mitsuda, the live recording of music spanned seven full sessions, estimated by him as being the largest-scale musical production for a video game to that date. He was entirely dedicated to orchestration and recording for four months. Mitsuda was tasked with creating the music for the game's 2010 reveal trailer, which he knew was an important task {{as it would have}} an international audience. He estimated that around 150 people in total worked on the score throughout its creation.|$|E
5|$|The semi-final {{round of}} the tournament took place {{immediately}} after the first round, and Mr. Perfect gained the early advantage over Bret Hart. Hart reversed {{the momentum of the}} match by applying a series of headlocks on Perfect. Perfect then performed a dropkick on Hart and followed it up by pushing him {{off the edge of the}} ring into the steel barricade on the arena floor. Perfect then performed another dropkick, but Hart recovered and executed a superplex on Perfect. Hart wore down Perfect's leg with a figure four leglock and attempted to perform the Sharpshooter, his finishing maneuver. Perfect blocked the move and attempted to perform the Perfectplex, his finishing move, on Hart. Hart reversed this move, however, and both men <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> of the ring. When they returned to the ring, Perfect tried to pin Hart with a small package. Hart reversed the move to get the pinfall victory and advance to the tournament final.|$|E

5|$|On 13 March 1985, Millwall visited Kenilworth Road for an FA Cup sixth round match. After only 14 {{minutes the}} match was halted as the visiting fans began to riot. The referee took both teams off for 25 minutes, before {{bringing}} {{them back on}} to complete the match. Following the final whistle, and a 1–0 victory for Luton, another pitch invasion and subsequent riot by away supporters caused noticeable damage {{to the ground and}} the surrounding area. Many of those arrested turned out to be supporters of teams other than Millwall. The club's chairman, David Evans, reacted by imposing a ban on all away supporters from Kenilworth Road {{from the start of the}} 1986–87 season as well as introducing a scheme that would require even home supporters to carry membership cards to be admitted to matches. The Football League insisted that Luton relax the ban for League Cup matches, but when Evans refused to allow Cardiff City fans to visit Kenilworth Road for their second round tie, the club <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> of the competition. The ban continued for four seasons, with exceptions for cup matches, before Luton Town repealed the ban before the 1990–91 season.|$|E
5|$|The last {{stage of}} rocky planet {{formation}} is the merger stage. It begins when {{only a small}} number of planetesimals remains and embryos become massive enough to perturb each other, which causes their orbits to become chaotic. During this stage embryos expel remaining planetesimals, and collide with each other. The result of this process, which lasts for 10 to 100million years, is the formation of a limited number of Earth sized bodies. Simulations show that the number of surviving planets is on average from 2 to 5. In the Solar System they may be represented by Earth and Venus. Formation of both planets required merging of approximately 10–20 embryos, while an equal number of them <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>out</b> of the Solar System. Some of the embryos, which originated in the asteroid belt, are thought to have brought water to Earth. Mars and Mercury may be regarded as remaining embryos that survived that rivalry. Rocky planets, which have managed to coalesce, settle eventually into more or less stable orbits, explaining why planetary systems are generally packed to the limit; or, in other words, why they always appear to be at the brink of instability.|$|E
