25|$|He alternated {{between the}} Liberal (PNL) and Conservative (PC) parties in a vain {{search for the}} right {{conditions}} <b>within</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> achieve his democratic ideals. Along with other radicals of the period, his alternation was not due primarily to opportunism, but because the king recognized only the two main parties as legitimately able to form a government, and smaller parties were denied an effective role in public life. Although he frequently clashed with their leadership and despised their way of doing business, he hoped that by working from within, {{he would be able}} to secure at least some of his objectives. It is in this context that the militant of the 1880s moved to the Conservatives in the 1890s while preserving his core convictions. Additionally, he was unable to join the Liberals at that point because he believed they were too compromised by their long years in power, and had himself helped to overthrow them.|$|E
25|$|Initially, More O’Ferrall {{introduced}} {{this type of}} analysis to discuss the continuity between concerted and step-wise β-elimination reaction mechanisms. The model also provided a framework <b>within</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> explain the effects of substituents and reaction conditions on the mechanism. The appropriate lower energy species were placed {{at the corners of}} the two dimensional plot (Figure 2). These were the reactants (top left), the products (bottom right) and the intermediates of the two possible stepwise reactions: the carbocation for E1 (bottom left) and the carbanion for E1cB (top-right). Thus, the horizontal axes represent the extent of deprotonation (C-H bond distance) and the vertical axes represent the extent of leaving group departure (C-LG distance). By applying the Hammond and anti-Hammond effects, he predicted the effects of various changes in the reactants or reaction conditions. For example, the effects of introducing a better leaving group on a substrate that initially eliminates via an E2 mechanism are illustrated in Figure 2. A better leaving group increases the energy of the reactants and of the carbanion intermediate. Thus, the transition state moves towards the reactants and away from the carbanion intermediate.|$|E

500|$|The {{crux of the}} issue, Bonds asserts, [...] "was {{never really}} one of style ... but rather of generic conception." [...] Between his Third and Seventh Symphonies, Beethoven had pushed the symphony well beyond the {{boundaries}} of entertainment into those of moral, political and philosophical statement. By adding text and voices in his Ninth Symphony, he not only redefined the genre but also called into question whether instrumental music could truly be superior to vocal music. The Ninth, Bonds says, in fact became the catalyst that fueled debate about the symphony genre. Hector Berlioz was the only composer [...] "able to grapple successfully with Beethoven's legacy." [...] However, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann and Niels Gade also achieved successes with their symphonies, putting at least a temporary stop to the debate as to whether the genre was dead. Regardless, composers increasingly turned to the [...] "more compact form" [...] of the concert overture [...] "as a vehicle <b>within</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> blend musical, narrative and pictoral ideas"; examples included Mendelssohn's overtures A Midsummer Night's Dream (1826) and The Hebrides (1830).|$|E

2500|$|The {{term was}} coined by the American critic Harold Rosenberg in 1952 and {{signaled}} {{a major shift}} in the aesthetic perspective of New York School painters and critics.
