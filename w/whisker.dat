5|$|Waxy {{produced}} four Epsom Derby winners: Waxy Pope (1809), Whalebone (1810), Blucher (1814) and <b>Whisker</b> (1815). He also sired three fillies {{that won}} The Oaks: Music (1813), Minuet (1815) and Corinne (1818). Corinne {{also won the}} 1,000 Guineas Stakes in 1818. His most productive offspring were produced by the mare Penelope (by Trumpator) and include Whalebone, <b>Whisker,</b> Web, Woful, Wire and Wilful. Penelope was bred and owned by the Duke of Grafton, and all of her foals were foaled at Euston Hall. <b>Whisker</b> was more notable for siring broodmares, and Whalebone was a good producer of colts. Waxy Pope was a leading sire in Ireland and Blucher was a marginally successful sire.|$|E

5|$|When the <b>Whiskers</b> first {{formed in}} 1998, their main rivals were Young Ones, Lazuli, Elveera and Vivian.

Over the next few years, Vivian {{moved away from the}} <b>Whiskers</b> and Commandos became the <b>Whiskers</b> new rivals. Soon Elveera and Lazuli moved away from the <b>Whiskers</b> and Aztecs form their territory next to the <b>Whiskers.</b> In 2007 <b>Whiskers</b> main rivals were Young Ones, Aztecs and Commandos. Then Young Ones died out, and Kung Fu formed next to <b>Whiskers,</b> Commandos moved away and the Sequoia formed. Today <b>Whiskers</b> main rivals are Toyota, Lazuli, Kung Fu and Sequoia.|$|R
30|$|<b>Whiskers</b> {{have several}} {{advantages}} over the wires, in particular, such as absence of defects {{due to the}} single-crystal structure of <b>whiskers</b> caused by their growth conditions. Despite their large dimensions (as compared with nanowires), <b>whiskers</b> are important objects of nanoscale studies taking into account their core-shell structures [11]. New physical effects were obtained when the whiskers’ doping concentration corresponded to metal-insulator transition, for instance, giant piezoresistance effect in Si <b>whiskers</b> [12], appearance of magnetophonon oscillations in Ge <b>whiskers</b> [13], and giant spin-orbit interaction with g-factor 60 in InSb <b>whiskers</b> [14].

50|$|The primary {{advantages}} of shaving soap over aerosol shaving creams is the additional hydration provided by shaving soaps. For optimal softening of <b>whiskers,</b> the natural oils {{on the face}} and <b>whiskers</b> must be removed.

40|$|Nanocellulosic-xylan {{films were}} {{prepared}} employing oat spelt xylan, cellulose <b>whiskers</b> and a plasticizer. The mechanical {{properties of the}} films were evaluated using tensile testing under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. The tensile data showed that the addition of sulfonated cellulose <b>whiskers</b> lead to a substantial improvement in strength properties. Addition of 7 wt% of sulfonated <b>whiskers</b> increased the tensile energy absorption of xylan films by 445 % and the tensile strength of the film by 141 %. Furthermore, films to which 7 % cellulose <b>whiskers</b> were added showed that nanocellulose <b>whiskers</b> produced with sulfuric acid (sulfonated <b>whiskers)</b> were significantly better at increasing film strength than cellulose <b>whiskers</b> produced by hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of cellulosic fibers.

40|$|Cellulose <b>whiskers</b> were {{isolated}} from kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) bast fibers via sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid hydrolysis. Raw kenaf bast, NaOH treated, bleached fibers, sulfuric acid <b>whiskers</b> (SAW) and hydrochloric acid <b>whiskers</b> (HClW) morphology, functional groups, crystallinity, and thermal stability were characterized. The TEM im ages {{showed that the}} sulfuric acid and HCl <b>whiskers</b> have average diameters and length range of 3 nm and 100 - 500 nm, respectively. The FTIR study indicated that during the conversion process, most of the hemicellulose and almost all the lignin were removed by the NaOH and subsequent bleaching treatments. The crystallinity of HCl <b>whiskers</b> {{was found to be}} higher (84 %) than that of sulfuric acid <b>whiskers</b> (72 %). Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that HCl <b>whiskers</b> had better thermal stability than the sulfuric acid ones.

In deprived cortex, neuronal responses to spared <b>whiskers</b> are enhanced and responses to deprived <b>whiskers</b> are weakened.

40|$|The ban on lead in {{electronic}} industry caused manufacturers {{to search for}} alternative ways to replace lead without affecting the performance of electronic products. Among lead-free alternative surface finishes, pure tin plating has attracted greater attention as potential candidate to replace hot air solder levelling (HASL) {{in electronic}} application. However, tin <b>whiskers</b> were reported to form on tin surface finishes and have caused the failure to electronic components. The study regarding <b>whiskers</b> phenomenon is important especially with the miniaturisation of electronic components in the electronic industry because <b>whiskers</b> from adjacent area may touch each other, causing short circuit. The main objective {{of this research is}} to study tin <b>whiskering</b> behaviour of immersion tin plating after being exposed under two different temperatures and relative humidity conditions: normal condition (30 oC/ 60 %RH) and severe condition (55 oC/ 85 %RH). Tin layer was deposited by using immersion process. The effect of external stress on <b>whiskers</b> growth was investigated by applying indentation at 2 N load on tin surface. In addition, a nickel underlayer on copper substrate was deposited by electroless plating prior to tin plating to investigate the effectiveness of nickel underlayer in mitigating <b>whiskers</b> formation. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to observe the behaviour of tin <b>whiskers</b> and intermetallic compound (IMCs), Energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) was used to determine chemical composition and image analyser was used to measure coating thickness of tin, nickel and <b>whiskers</b> length based on micrographs obtained from FESEM. The results showed that <b>whiskers</b> have formed on immersion tin surface finish exposed under normal and severe conditions. These <b>whiskers</b> formed in various types including straight, bent, kinked, and spiral with striations along their circumference. The tin <b>whiskers</b> length was directly proportional to the exposure time for both conditions; normal and severe. However, under normal condition exposure, <b>whiskers</b> have grown longer than severe condition due to formation of small and irregular shape of IMCs. Indented area of tin surface showed shorter <b>whiskers</b> formed than non-indented area indicating that the <b>whiskers</b> grow longer at lower external stress concentration. The deposition of nickel underlayer on copper was effective in mitigating <b>whiskers</b> formation as no <b>whiskers</b> were observed under both conditions up to 12 weeks...|$|R

25|$|Conversely, while {{enrichment}} {{and training}} {{are related to}} increases in spine formation and stability, long-term sensory deprivation leads {{to an increase in}} the rate of spine elimination and therefore impacts long-term neural circuitry.

In addition, other sensory deprivation paradigms—such as <b>whisker</b> trimming—have been shown to increase the stability of new spines.|$|E

Crystal radios have also been improvised from a variety of common objects, such as blue steel razor blades and lead pencils, rusty needles, and pennies In these, a semiconducting layer of oxide or sulfide on the metal surface is usually responsible for the rectifying action.|$|E
