2500|$|Some {{austenitic}} stainless steels and nickel-based alloys are prone to intergranular corrosion. When subjected to temperatures around [...] for too long a time, chromium reacts with carbon in the material, forming chromium carbide and depleting the crystal edges of chromium, impairing their corrosion resistance in a process called sensitization. Such sensitized steel undergoes corrosion in the areas near the welds where the temperature-time was favorable for forming the carbide. This kind of corrosion is often termed <b>weld</b> <b>decay.</b>|$|E

50|$|The early {{tanks were}} of welded {{aluminium}} structure with the sealing material applied as a composite layer on the outside. A major problem with welded aluminium tanks is <b>weld</b> <b>decay</b> and metal fatigue in the seams due to vibration in service. In response to this, the company started to develop flexible fuel bladders {{in the early}} 1940s. One of the earliest examples of this was a composite flexible fuel bladder with self-sealing coatings for the Supermarine Spitfire MkIX.|$|E
40|$|Trapped modes within elastic waveguides are {{investigated}} employing asymptotic and numericalmethods. The problems {{considered in}} this thesis concentrate on linear elastic wavesin thickened/thinned and curved waveguides. The localised modes are propagating withinsome region that {{is characterized by a}} small parameter but are cut-off for geometric reasonsexterior to that region, and thereafter exponentially decay with distance along the waveguide. Given this physical interpretation long wave theories become appropriate. The generalapproach is as follows: an asymptotic scheme is developed to analyse whether trappedmodes should be expected and to obtain the frequencies at which trapped modes are excited. The asymptotic approach leads to an ordinary differential equation eigenvalue problem thatencapsulates the essential physics. Then, numerical simulations based on spectral methodsare performed for this reduced equation and for the full elasticity equations to validate theasymptotic scheme and demonstrate its accuracy. The thesis begins with an investigation of trapping due to thickness variations. Thelong-wave model for trapped modes is derived and it is shown that this model is functionallythe same as that for a bent plate. Careful computations of the exact governing equations arecompared with the asymptotic theory to demonstrate that the theories tie together. Differentboundary conditions upon the guide walls and the importance of the sign of the groupvelocity are discussed in detail. Then, it is shown that boundary conditions also {{play a crucial role in}} the possible existenceof trapped modes. The possibility of trapped modes is considered in nonuniformelastic/ ocean/ quantum waveguides where the guide has one wall with Dirichlet (clamped) boundary conditions and the other Neumann (stress-free) boundary conditions. For bentwaveguides, with such boundary conditions, the sign of the curvature function is shown to play an important role in the possibility of trapping. Trapped modes in 3 D elastic plates are considered as a model of waves that are guidedalong, and localised to the vicinity of, welds. These waves propagate unattenuated alongthe <b>weld</b> and exponentially <b>decay</b> with distance transverse to it. Three-dimensional geometriesintroduce additional complications but, again, asymptotic analysis is possible. Thelong-wave model provides numerical values of the trapped mode frequencies and givesconditions at which trapping can occur; these depend on the components of the wave numberin different directions and variations of the plate thickness. To mimic the guide stretching out to infinity a perfectly matched layer (PML) techniqueoriginally developed by Berenger for electromagnetic wave propagation is employed. Themethod is illustrated on the example of topographically varying and bent acoustic guides,and numerically implemented in the spectral scheme to construct dispersion curves for atwo-dimensional circular elastic annulus immersed in infinite fluid. This numerical schemeis new and more efficient than direct root-finding methods for the exact dispersion relationinvolving the Bessel functions. In the final chapter, the influence of external fluid on trapping within elastic waveguidesis considered. A long-wave scheme for a curved and thickening plates in infinite fluid isderived, conditions of existence of trapping are analysed and compared with those for platesin vacuum.

50|$|These zones also act {{as local}} {{galvanic}} couples, causing local galvanic corrosion. This condition {{happens when the}} material is heated to temperature around 700 °C for too long time, and often happens during welding or an improper heat treatment. When zones of such material form due to welding, the resulting corrosion is termed <b>weld</b> <b>decay.</b> Stainless steels can be stabilized against this behavior by addition of titanium, niobium, or tantalum, which form titanium carbide, niobium carbide and tantalum carbide preferentially to chromium carbide, by lowering the content of carbon in the steel and in case of welding also in the filler metal under 0.02%, or by heating the entire part above 1000 °C and quenching it in water, leading to dissolution of the chromium carbide in the grains and then preventing its precipitation. Another possibility {{is to keep the}} welded parts thin enough so that, upon cooling, the metal dissipates heat too quickly for chromium carbide to precipitate. The ASTM A923, ASTM A262, and other similar tests are often used to determine when stainless steels are susceptible to intergranular corrosion. The tests require etching with chemicals that reveal the presence of intermetallic particles, sometimes combined with Charpy V-Notch and other mechanical testing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{stainless}} steels, microstructural {{damage is}} caused by precipitation of chromium carbides or sigma phase. These microconstituents are detrimental in stainless steel welds because they lead to <b>weld</b> <b>decay.</b> Nevertheless, they are prone {{to appear in the}} heat affected zone (HAZ) microstructure of stainless steel welds. This is particularly important for repairs of industrial components made of austenitic stainless steel. Non-destructive metallography can be applied in welding repairs of AISI 304 stainless steel components where it is difficult to ensure that no detrimental phase is present in the HAZ microstructure. The need of microstructural inspection in repairs of AISI 304 is caused because {{it is not possible to}} manufacture coupons for destructive metallography, with which the microstructure can be analyzed. In this work, it is proposed to apply in situ metallography as non-destructive testing in order to identify microstructural damage in the microstructure of AISI 304 stainless steel welds. The results of this study showed that the external surface micrographs of the weldment are representative of HAZ microstructure of the stainless steel component; because they show the presence of precipitated metallic carbides in the grain boundaries or sigma phase in the microstructure of the HAZ...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{casting rolls}} are {{subjected}} to extreme temperature fl uctuations and harsh environmental conditions during service. High slab contact pressures, high surface temperatures, adhesive or abrasive wear by slag or oxides and thermal fatigue all contribute towards deterioration of the roll surface. Rolls may also suffer surface degradation {{as a result of}} corrosion. The slab is cooled using water spray, often containing hydrofl uoric acid as product of the reaction between water and the mould fl ux powder used to keep the molten metal from adhering to the copper mould plate. This results in an aggressive low pH environment that may promote pitting or crevice corrosion and stress corrosion cracking failures. In order to prolong the life of continuous casting rolls in service, the rolls are surfaced using martensitic stainless steel weld cladding. After surfacing, the roll may be given a post-weld heat treatment to temper the martensite to the required hardness level, or to relieve thermally-induced stresses. This investigation examined the submerged arc cladding of continuous casting rolls using nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steel, and focused on the effect of the weld thermal cycle and post-weld heat treatment on carbide precipitation in the clad layer. The precipitation of chromium-rich carbides during welding or post-weld heat treatment may lead to <b>weld</b> <b>decay</b> due to chromium depletion, rendering the roll surface susceptible to pit nucleation and crack initiation...|$|E
