5000|$|Of the ten {{types of}} women in the poem, nine are {{delineated}} as destructive: the dirty <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from a pig; the cunning woman originates from a fox, the incessantly curious and high-maintenance <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from a dog, the lazy or apathetic <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from earth or soil, the capricious woman of mood swings comes from seawater, the stubborn <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from an ass, the untrustworthy and uncontrollable <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from a ferret, the overly proud <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from a mare, and the worst and ugliest type of <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from an ape or monkey.

25|$|Alexei's {{haemophilia}} was {{integral to}} the rise of Grigori Rasputin. One of the many things Rasputin did that unintentionally facilitated the fall of the Romanovs was to tell the Tsar that the war would be won once he (Tsar Nicholas II) took command of the Russian Army. Following this advice was a serious mistake as the Tsar had no military experience. The Tsarina, Empress Alexandra, a deeply religious <b>woman,</b> <b>came</b> to rely upon Rasputin and believe in his ability to help Alexei where conventional doctors had failed. This theme is explored in Robert K. Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra. It is possible that if Alexei had not suffered so terribly, Rasputin could never have gained such influence over Russian politics during World War I, which is generally seen to have at least hastened the collapse of Romanov rule.|$|E

The Giant finally tagged in after The Taskmaster delivered a belly to back suplex. As The Giant dominated Anderson in the ring, Benoit fought The Taskmaster outside.
