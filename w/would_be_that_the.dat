5|$|A more {{indirect}} effect <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) {{the charge of}} the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons {{are more difficult to}} extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E
5|$|While the EU's {{system of}} {{governance}} is largely unique, elements {{can be compared to}} other models. One general observation {{on the nature of the}} distribution of powers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> EU resembles the federalism of Germany. There, powers are predominantly shared (states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised them) between the levels of government, and the states participate strongly with decision making at the federal level. This is in contrast with other federations, for example the United States, where powers are clearly divided between the levels of government, and the states have little say in federal decision making.|$|E
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be no better than the current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E
5|$|According to Fitzgibbons, the rumours {{surrounding}} Cromwell's body {{immediately after}} his death are “merely good yarns born out of over-active imaginations”. One legend claims that he was conveyed secretly to Naseby, the site of his “greatest victory and glory”, for a midnight burial. The field was then ploughed over to hide evidence of the burial. Another legend, written in the 1730s by a John Oldmixon, claims that “a reliable Gentlewoman who attended Cromwell in his last sickness” had said the coffin was sunk in the deepest part of the River Thames the night following Cromwell's death. Fearful of royalists, “it was consulted how to dispose of his Corpse. They could not pretend to keep it for the Pomp of a publick burial...and to prevent its falling into barbarous hands, it was resolved {{to wrap it up}} in lead, to put it aboard a Barge, and sink it in the deepest part of the Thames, which was done the night following Cromwell's death.” In 1664, Samuel Pepys wrote of a story he had heard in which “Cromwell did, in his life, transpose many of the bodies of the Kings of England from one grave to another, and by that means it is not known certainly whether the head that is now set upon a post be that of Cromwell, or one of the Kings”. If this story had any accuracy, Fitzgibbons suggests the irony <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> posthumous act was possibly carried out on an English monarch rather than Cromwell himself. Another story even suggested that Cromwell's body was substituted for Charles I, adding what Fitzgibbons describes as “an even greater mockery of the events of 30 January 1649”. This story is known to be false; Charles' tomb was opened in 1813, and his remains, including the cut that severed his head, remained as they were in 1649.|$|E

25|$|Kasha's rule {{dictates}} that the quantum yield of luminescence {{is independent of}} the wavelength of exciting radiation.

25|$|In {{semantic}} priming, {{the prime}} {{and the target}} are from the same semantic category and share features.

When a person thinks of one item in a category, similar items are stimulated by the brain. Even {{if they are not}} words, morphemes can prime for complete words that include them. An example of this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> morpheme 'psych' can prime for the word 'psychology'.|$|E

In his request, he argued that strict application of the Law of Priority would lead to an undesirable name change of the species long known as Papilio xuthus, for which the name Papilio ajax would now have to be used. As this name had been in use for one or more American species, this would only add to the confusion already existing.

25|$|A genealogical DNA test {{examines}} the nucleotides at specific locations on a person's DNA for genetic genealogy purposes. The test {{results are not}} meant to have any medical value; they are intended only to give genealogical information. Genealogical DNA tests generally involve comparing the results of living individuals to historic populations. The general procedure for taking a genealogical DNA test involves taking a painless cheek-scraping (also known as a buccal swab) at home and mailing the sample to a genetic genealogy laboratory for testing. Genetic testing results showing specific sub-Haplogroups of Q, R1 and C3b implies that the individuals ancestry is, in whole or in-part, indigenous to the Americas.

25|$|Superposition in {{archaeology}} {{and especially in}} stratification use during excavation is slightly different as the processes involved in laying down archaeological strata are somewhat different from geological processes. Man made intrusions and activity in the archaeological record need not form chronologically {{from top to bottom}} or be deformed from the horizontal as natural strata are by equivalent processes. Some archaeological strata (often termed as contexts or layers) are created by undercutting previous strata. An example <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> silt back-fill of an underground drain would form some time after the ground immediately above it. Other examples of non vertical superposition would be modifications to standing structures such as the creation of new doors and windows in a wall. Superposition {{in archaeology}} requires a degree of interpretation to correctly identify chronological sequences and in this sense superposition in archaeology is more dynamic and multi-dimensional.|$|E
25|$|Sieges were costly {{in terms}} of {{manpower}} and more so if an assault was launched to take the city by force—the siege of Lachish cost the Assyrians at least 1,500 men found at a mass grave near Lachish.

However, with the reforms of Tiglath Pileser III Assyria's first standing army was forged and could therefore blockade a city until it surrendered instead. Nonetheless it is known that Assyrians always preferred to take a city by assault than to settle down for a blockade: the former method would be followed by extermination or deportation of the inhabitants and would therefore frighten the opponents of Assyria into surrendering as well.|$|E
25|$|The US {{effort to}} produce and ship war {{material}} to France was characterized by several factors. The US declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917 with only a small munitions industry, very few medium and heavy artillery pieces, and few machine guns. By June 1917 the US had decided that their forces would primarily operate alongside the French, and would acquire their artillery and machine guns by purchasing mostly French weapons in theater, along with some British weapons {{in the case of}} heavy artillery. Shipments from the US to France would primarily be of soldiers and ammunition; artillery equipment in particular occupied too much space and weight to be economical. These priorities combined with the short 19-month US participation in the war meant that few US-made weapons arrived in France, and the need for extensive training of artillery units once in France meant that fewer still saw action before the Armistice. A comparison with World War II <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> US started preparing for that war in earnest shortly after the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939; by the time the US entered the war following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 there had already been 27 months of mobilization.|$|E
