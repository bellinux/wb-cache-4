On April 7, he sent completed models to the Mint and photographs to the Fine Arts Commission. Both the Mint and Houston responded with criticism, the former that {{the relief of}} the coin was high and difficult to reduce to coin-sized hubs. On April 19, Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock wrote in a memorandum that the coin <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to produce because the area of greatest relief on each side {{was in the same}} part of the design. Beach agreed to lower any high points that might cause the Mint difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Though the album's {{release date}} was {{originally}} scheduled for November 26, 2013, Funk Volume announced on their Facebook page on November 18 that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to find Knock Madness in stores {{the first week}} of its release, due to a delay and few stores placing orders for the album. However, instead of pushing back the release date as announced, Funk Volume decided to release the album on its initial date of November 26, for digital download and compact disc format through their website. The album was then released in compact disc format in retail stores on December 3, 2013.|$|E
25|$|This {{rejected}} the Aguilar–Spinelli test {{and put in}} place a totality-of-the-circumstances standard. This was put into place because the court recognized that there was more evidence that the Gateses were involved in drug trafficking than just the letter standing alone. The court agreed that if the letter had just stood alone it would not be probable cause to get a warrant. The court also recognized that under the Aguilar–Spinelli two-pronged test, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for the “reliability” prong to ever be satisfied from an anonymous tip so it therefore should be abandoned.|$|E

25|$|When {{the polls}} {{around the country}} closed at 19:00 RTL and Nova TV {{published}} {{the results of the}} exit polls conducted by Ipsos PULS. They predicted a landslide win for Josipović, giving him an advantage of almost 30 percentage points, significantly larger than all of the second-round polls. This shifted much of the political commentary and rendered much of the expected drama moot. The Josipović headquarters started celebrating immediately after the polls closed claiming that the difference is too large for Bandić to overcome and the exit polls don't feature such a large statistical margin of error. The Bandić campaign said they'll wait for official results, but admitted it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for Bandić to overtake Josipović's 30 point lead even when the votes from abroad were tallied. The exit polls predicted the outcome well as the ratio between the two candidates was 9 to 1 for Bandić abroad, where there were no exit polls, which narrowed Josipović's victory to a final difference of 21 percentage points.|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Randall Woods {{argues that}} Social Gospel themes Johnson learned from {{childhood}} {{allowed him to}} transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice, as exemplified by the Great Society and his commitment to racial equality. The Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach {{to a sort of}} Christian internationalism and nation building. For example, in a 1966 speech he quoted at length from the Social Creed of the Methodist Church issued in 1940, adding [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for me to write a more perfect description of the American ideal." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{semiotic}} {{analysis by}} professor Peeter Torop of University of Tartu, ordered by Lihula police department to analyse the installation concluded that no Nazi or SS symbolics whatsoever {{appear in the}} bas-relief. He pointed out the monument's composition was [...] "unduly militaristic", concluding that the monument {{could be said to}} be [...] "rude or controversial" [...] given its resemblance to wartime mobilisation posters. He found no basis for the hypothesis that the installation of the monument would constitute an [...] "incitement of social hatred". Under Estonian law, such incitement is a crime punishable by a fine or imprisonment of up to three years. In any case, short of recasting, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to modify a bronze-cast statue.|$|E
60|$|Mr Pecksniff made {{reply that}} this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> also <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to bear, as reflecting, in some degree, on the {{discernment}} of Mr Chuzzlewit. Still {{he had a}} modest confidence that he could sustain the calumny, {{with the help of}} a good conscience, and that gentleman's friendship.|$|R

[...] "Sally," [...] he added, [...] "would you {{be afraid to}} take hold {{and see what you}} could make of the place and me?

2500|$|It was {{reported}} on January 31, 2008, that Redick asked his agent, Arn Tellem, {{to see about}} a possible trade. [...] "We want to see what's out there," [...] Redick told the Orlando Sentinel, [...] "I want to stay here, but it's been frustrating." [...] Magic coach Stan Van Gundy responded: [...] "Right now it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to fit him in. I know it's also hard to keep sitting him on the bench... Should we be playing him? Right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things." [...] The Orlando Magic confirmed Van Gundy's comments by stating that Redick would not receive more minutes or a trade before the Feb 21 trade deadline. In the last game of the season, with the playoff seed locked up, Redick received more time than he had all season and led the Magic with 18 points, {{for the first time}} in his career.|$|E

5000|$|The {{manner in}} which the evictions were carried out could be {{exceedingly}} harsh, particularly in the valley of Strathnaver. An eye witness, Angus Mackay, commented that [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> heart but would mourn to see the circumstances of the people... you would have pitied them, tumbling on the ground and greeting, tearing the ground with their hands...".|$|R

For all these days, my marro women are providing needed goods and services for my household.

60|$|After {{this the}} colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity {{with respect to}} the savages, till I came to revisit them, which was about two years after; not but that, now and then, some canoes of savages came on shore for their triumphal, unnatural feasts; but as they were of several nations, and perhaps had never heard of those that came before, or the reason of it, they did not make any search or inquiry after their countrymen; and if they had, it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to have found them out.|$|R
60|$|Ursula, on {{the other}} hand, had been relegated into the background. She knew this well and chafed at the restraint.
