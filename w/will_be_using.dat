5|$|In {{the past}} few years, many {{training}} exercises took place in Romania with other Balkan or Allied countries. Most of these exercises took place at Babadag, {{which is one of}} the largest and most modern training firing ranges and military facilities in Europe, with a total surface area of 270 square kilometres. It was announced on December 6, 2006 that 1,500 U.S. troops stationed at Mihail Kogălniceanu, which in time will form Joint Task Force East, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>using</b> Babadag as a training base.|$|E
5|$|Network Rail, in its July 2011 London & South East route {{utilisation}} strategy, {{recommended that}} all services from Herne Hill towards Blackfriars should terminate {{in the bay}} platforms at Blackfriars after London Bridge's redevelopment is completed in 2018 and the diverted Thameslink trains return there. Passengers from Herne Hill would then have had to change at Blackfriars to travel further north. Network Rail made this recommendation because more services <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>using</b> the route between St Pancras and London Bridge from 2018; sending trains from Herne Hill to the terminating platforms {{on the western side}} of Blackfriars (instead of the through tracks on {{the eastern side of the}} station) would have removed the need for them to cross in front of trains to/from Denmark Hill and trains to/from London Bridge at junctions south of Blackfriars.|$|E

25|$|Several methods {{exist to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of fossil fuel power plants. A frequently used and cost-efficient method is to convert a plant to run on a different fuel. This includes conversions of coal power plants to biomass or waste and conversions of natural gas power plants to biogas. Conversions of coal powered power plants to waste-fired power plants have an extra benefit in that they can reduce landfilling. In addition, waste-fired power plants can be equipped with material recovery, which is also beneficial to the environment. In some instances, torrefaction of biomass may be needed if biomass is the material the converted fossil fuel power plant <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>using.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a Quadrature Mirror Filter is {{implemented}} in VHDL, for wireless communication applications. The Quadrature Mirror Filter (QMF) basically is a parallel {{combination of a}} High Pass Filter (HPF) and Low Pass Filter (LPF), which performs the action of frequency subdivision by splitting the signal spectrum into two spectra. The QMF implementation is carried out on FPGA platform. The Xilinx IP Core generator <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for instantiating the standard Xilinx parts. Xilinx ISE <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> {{to carry out the}} synthesis and bit file generation.

25|$|In {{order to}} enter any section of line, the train crew must obtain {{permission}} from Control and the relevant token. Each section of {{line is a}} token block section. The WHR uses the traditional Staff and Ticket system in which trains can either be issued with the section token staff or a numbered ticket. Tickets allow multiple trains to pass one-at-a-time through a section in one direction. The Controller advises the train crew which method they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>using.</b> Tickets are kept in a locked box opened by a key on the token staff. This means the last train must use the token staff {{to pass through the}} section, so it can be used for trains to travel in the opposite direction. For additional protection, both the footplate crew and the guard must see the token or ticket before the train can depart.|$|E
25|$|Hantuchová {{also has}} {{endorsed}} four racquet brands. She first endorsed Babolat {{from the time}} she was a junior until late 2003, then Yonex until the 2007 Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, when she started using the Prince Ozone Seven Racquets in the 2007 Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships. Photos were released from Prince giving the impression that Hantuchová, from the start of the 2011 season, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>using</b> the Prince EXO3 Tour 100. However, she signed a deal with Volkl Tennis and then used the Volkl Power Bridge 9. Starting with the 2011 Fed Cup, she began using the Prince EXO3 Tour Team 100 again, with which she won her fourth career title. In spring of 2015, Hantuchová started using HEAD rackets and bags although the racket is not part of the current range and appears to be all black in color. During the 2015 Grass Court Season to now, Hantuchová started using the HEAD Graphene Instinct MP racket. In 2016, Hantuchová switched her racquet brand back to Babolat.|$|E
