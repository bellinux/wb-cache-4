2500|$|Seary's girlfriend <b>Wendy</b> <b>said</b> that Seary {{had told}} her that he had {{thought they were going to}} Robert Cameron's house to put up posters, and he had been {{surprised}} that explosives were brought along ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Wendy</b> <b>said</b> 'tea first' quickly, and Michael {{pressed her}} hand in gratitude, but the braver John hesitated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Wendy</b> Woods <b>said</b> of {{the closure}} {{at the time}} that Newsbytes [...] "was a long fun ride. I {{would like to think that}} we made a bit of the same history that we were writing about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Listen, then,' <b>said</b> <b>Wendy,</b> {{settling}} {{down to her}} story, with Michael at her feet and seven boys in the bed. 'There was once a gentleman----' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Peter,' <b>said</b> <b>Wendy</b> the comforter, 'I should {{love you}} in a beard'; and Mrs. Darling {{stretched}} out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ought I?' <b>Wendy</b> <b>said,</b> all shining. 'Of course it's frightfully fascinating, {{but you see}} I am only {{a little}} girl. I have no real experience.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You see,' <b>Wendy</b> <b>said</b> complacently, 'our heroine {{knew that}} the mother would always leave the window open for her {{children}} to fly back by; so they stayed away for years and had a lovely time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps I {{should have}} ironed it,' <b>Wendy</b> <b>said</b> thoughtfully; but Peter, boylike, was {{indifferent}} to appearances, {{and he was}} now jumping about in the wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. 'How clever I am,' he crowed rapturously, 'oh, the cleverness of me!' ...|$|E
25|$|In Dadaab Kenya, UN Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees, <b>Wendy</b> Chamberlin, <b>said</b> camps there {{accounted}} for 34,000 refugees fleeing {{the fighting and}} floods in Somalia, but that number {{is expected to grow}} to 80,000 if fighting continues. The World Food Programme (WFP) is attempting to provide relief, but floods and mud have hampered ground transportation.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh no,' <b>said</b> <b>Wendy,</b> rapidly {{thinking}} it out, 'it will only mean having a few {{beds in the}} drawing-room; they can be hidden behind screens on first Thursdays.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Children {{have the}} strangest adventures without being troubled by them. For instance, they may {{remember}} to mention, {{a week after}} the event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when <b>Wendy</b> <b>said</b> with a tolerant smile: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And now, Peter,' <b>Wendy</b> <b>said,</b> {{thinking}} {{she had put}} everything right, 'I am {{going to give you}} your medicine before you go.' She loved to give them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was only water, but it was out of a calabash, and she always shook the calabash and counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this occasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught, for just as she had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink.|$|E
6000|$|The meal {{happened}} to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the board, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and recriminations, the noise, as <b>Wendy</b> <b>said,</b> was positively deafening. To be sure, she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them grabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had pushed their elbow. There was a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying, [...] "I complain of so-and-so;" [...] but what usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much.|$|E
6000|$|... "Peter," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Wendy</b> the comforter, [...] "I should {{love you}} in a beard;" [...] and Mrs. Darling {{stretched}} out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.|$|R

50|$|When Six Flags {{announced}} which parks it {{was selling}} in January 2007, Magic Mountain {{was no longer}} one of them. The company decided not to sell Magic Mountain and its adjacent water park. Spokeswoman <b>Wendy</b> Goldberg <b>said</b> that upon further evaluation, the company decided that the Los Angeles parks remained too valuable to relinquish, as sales were increasing, and that the park would not be sold. Other parks were sold as a package and remained open.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let us now,' <b>said</b> <b>Wendy,</b> bracing {{herself for}} her finest effort, 'take a peep into the future'; {{and they all}} gave {{themselves}} the twist that makes peeps into the future easier. 'Years have rolled by; and who is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Northwest Territories premier Joe Handley {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} the new building would help his government work better with their federal counterparts. [...] "When I'm here, I'm in Ottawa," [...] he said. The city's deputy mayor, <b>Wendy</b> Bisaro, <b>said</b> the Greenstone Building would be [...] "a wonderful addition to our downtown." [...] First Nations elements were also included, with a Dene blessing and a Haida drumming ceremony. Most of the 15 agencies and their 200 employees moved in shortly afterwards. Several meeting rooms were made available {{for the use of}} community groups after hours.|$|R
50|$|At the elimination, after green screens {{appeared}} for Henry, Jennifer, Steven and Kathryn, {{the screen}} turned red when Afis name was typed in. <b>Wendy</b> <b>said</b> {{that she felt}} another one of her allies was eliminated. Jim said he didnt expect her to be eliminated. She thought Henry tried to make himself look like the mole.|$|E
5000|$|Steven McHone's stepbrother Wesley Adams Jr. and {{his wife}} Wendy were visiting Wesley Adams Sr. {{and his wife}}, Mildred. Just after midnight on June 3, McHone was heard arguing with the couple by Wesley Jr. and Wendy, who were in bed. Mildred Adams entered their room {{and asked if they}} had moved a handgun that was in the house. They replied that they hadn't and she left and closed the door. Before Wesley Jr. could get dressed, three shots were heard. <b>Wendy</b> <b>said</b> she heard the elder Wesley tell her husband to call 9-1-1. Wesley Jr. saw his father and stepbrother wrestling and McHone was holding a handgun. Wesley Jr. managed to disarm McHone but then when he {{returned}} to the phone, the wrestling resumed and then the two headed out of sight of him, up a hallway. His father returned about a minute later saying that his stepmother was [...] "facedown out back." [...] McHone reappeared carrying a shotgun, raising it into a firing position. His stepfather moved towards him and attempted to grab the gun, but McHone fired, throwing Wesley Sr. with such force that he hit and knocked down Wesley Jr. McHone and Wesley Jr. struggled again, with McHone cursing Wesley Jr. and crying, asking Wesley Jr. to shoot McHone for what he had done.|$|E

5000|$|Milkweed {{addresses}} {{the themes of}} survival, caring for others, and existence itself. Anna Rich wrote “Misha [...] [...] [...] survives the Warsaw ghetto, where hangings, beatings, and murders are daily occurrences”. [...] In The Houston Chronicle Marvin Hoffman described how “Misha contributes {{a portion of the}} meager booty from his forays under the wall to the ‘outside’-sometimes no more than a single potato-to Dr. K’s Korczak’s children.” This is an example of Misha caring for others. In The Bookseller, <b>Wendy</b> Cooling <b>said</b> the novel was “about people, about caring and about life itself”.|$|R

5000|$|Writing in 2015, the Los Angeles Review of Books invoked The Alchemy of Race and Rights as a [...] "seminal work" [...] on [...] "the {{logic of}} rights...state domination...and legal protection." [...] The New York Times {{said that with}} the book, [...] "Williams changed the voice of legal scholarship." [...] Writing for the Boston Review in 1991, <b>Wendy</b> Brown <b>said,</b> [...] "As a {{meditation}} on the searing injuries of racism, on hidden histories in the entrails of legal cases, or on the bankrupt character of contemporary American political life, the effect of Williams's alchemy is powerful beyond measure." ...|$|R

5000|$|Former chief {{commissioner}} of Victoria Police Christine Nixon {{has suggested that}} Cassidy's death prompted further community debate {{about the use of}} Tasers by Victoria Police. In 2010 Tasers were trialed in Bendigo and Morwell [...] "because of the high use of OC spray, incidents involving people with a mental illness, sieges and instances where offenders have used weapons." [...] In 2016 Tasers were made more widely available to Victoria Police. Deputy Commissioner <b>Wendy</b> Steendam <b>said</b> [...] "What Tasers do for our members is to actually offer them another option in resolutions of incidents where they're having violent confrontations or where people are attempting to self-harm." ...|$|R
50|$|In August 2017, NYCLASS {{announced}} {{the end of}} their crusade to ban the carriage horses from Central Park, instead re-focusing their efforts on proposals to improve the horses' working and living conditions. “We achieved nothing, except perhaps created some bad will which we have to address, so obviously our strategy had to change,” <b>said</b> <b>Wendy</b> Neu, a main partner behind the effort, adding the group had been too antagonistic.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2014, {{a former}} detective {{investigating}} 16 unsolved murders and possible {{links to the}} Yorkshire Ripper, obtained a pathology report which he claimed was buried' by the police in 1973 {{within a few days}} of the attack on <b>Wendy</b> Sewell. He <b>said</b> it would have completely contradicted the so-called confession, exonerated Downing and prevented a miscarriage of justice. This new evidence sparked a new submission to the Home Secretary claiming that Derbyshire Police's investigations in 1973 had been potentially biased and unsatisfactory.|$|R
500|$|The song {{is carried}} by an [...] "anthemic" [...] {{sound and the}} [...] "riveting vocals" [...] of lead vocalist Dawn Michele. Bassist <b>Wendy</b> Drennen <b>said</b> that [...] "Unbreakable" [...] was about [...] "overcoming a {{defeated}} mentality and finding the power to remain strong amid the landscape, not allowing fear to hold us back from having victory over the things that used to control us". It is also lyrically based on the Biblical account of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery; the song's first line states, [...] "Where {{are the people that}} accused me?" [...] Richardson said, [...] "The people in charge were ready to kill her, and Jesus speaks up for her, changes their minds and makes them feel ashamed for accusing her ... She knows she’s guilty, and yet she’s suddenly free and given a second chance." ...|$|R
