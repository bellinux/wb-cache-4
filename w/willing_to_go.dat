5|$|Asher Levi is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from , an Internet spin-off of the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Played by Heshima Thompson, Asher is a main character in series two. He is a charismatic street dancer, who uses his talent {{to escape from}} his criminal past. As a father-figure to his younger brother Sol Levi (Tosin Cole), Asher occasionally resorts to stealing {{in order to provide}} for them both. He is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to extreme lengths to protect Sol, including being stabbed by their schizophrenic mother. Over the course of the series, Asher betrays Sol by sleeping with his girlfriend, Naz Mehmet (Emaa Hussen). The two are ultimately able to reconcile, and Asher makes amends by encouraging his brother's dancing talent.|$|E
5|$|During {{the letters}} scandal, Charlotte lost her diary which {{contained}} both family secrets and critical thoughts on {{various members of}} her family; the diary was eventually given to Wilhelm, who never forgave her for its contents. Bernhard was transferred to a regiment in the quiet town of Breslau, effectively exiling him and his wife. As controller of Charlotte's allowance, Wilhelm also limited their ability to travel outside of the country unless they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> without royal honours. In 1896, Dona accused Charlotte of engaging in an affair with Karl-August Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, a court official. Charlotte fiercely denied the allegations. Bernhard defended his wife and criticised the Hohenzollerns for attempting to keep every Prussian princess {{under the control of}} the family. Bernhard considered resigning his army position and leaving with his wife for Meiningen, though the dispute eventually resolved itself when von Diersburg returned to court with his wife. The scandal was considered to have seriously damaged the reputation of the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the individual military punishments, the army took further internal measures to {{lower the risk of}} another insurrection. According to Maurice Rives, 10,000 Vietnamese troops were given transfers to different zones. This meant that more than 80% of Tonkin's approximately 12,000 Tirailleurs Tonkinois were moved, a transfer of enormous proportions, indicating the extent of insecurity among French commanders towards Vietnamese troops, {{and the extent to which}} they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to make future Yen Bays impossible. One possible rationale for this measure was to break up any undiscovered VNQDĐ cells and to sever personal ties, within units and between soldiers and civilians in their local district. The mass transfer of soldiers also had the effect of creating a state of constant mobilisation, denying troops the time and opportunity for anti-colonial organisation.|$|E

5|$|A {{legacy of}} the Manhattan Project was the network of {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, {{he set up a}} rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, who was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced the Manhattan Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E

25|$|Attitudes to German rule {{changed as}} the Occupation went on. At first, the Germans {{followed}} {{a policy of}} presenting a non-threatening presence to the resident population for its propaganda value ahead of an eventual invasion and occupation of the United Kingdom. Many Islanders were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with the necessities of Occupation {{as long as they}} felt the Germans were behaving in a correct and legal way. Two events particularly jolted many Islanders out of this passive attitude: the confiscation of radios, and the deportation of large sections of the populations.|$|E
25|$|Preparations {{for the war}} {{continued}} into {{the spring and summer}} of 1AD, at which point there had been a successful breakthrough in negotiations. As Phraates was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war, he agreed to evacuate Armenia and abandon his brothers who were still in Roman captivity. In the second half of the year, Gaius had advanced with his army to the Pharthian frontier to an unknown spot and brought Phraates to a final agreement on the proposals, in which he renounced all claims to Armenia and all power over his half-brothers.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on whether}} selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer {{that is not}} achievable. The {{theory is that the}} extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (as far as you are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{uncertainties}} {{in the text}} comes in the word , which indicates that the seaweed has a hold on the castaway. Some scholars prefer to read , indicating that he spews out seaweed. Scholars often contrast the poem's realism with the artificiality of Horace's Epode 10, but not all scholars are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with this view, citing the Homeric diction as a literary device {{and the absence of}} proof that the oath-breaker was ever a real man rather than just a scapegoat or imaginary exemplar. Yet the poet has made the context seem real.|$|E
25|$|While {{some of his}} men thought Oates to be too {{aggressive}} {{for his own good}} and theirs, most admired his courage and affirmed that he was always to be found at the front of his men, in the thick of combat, and that he never asked them to go anywhere that he was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> himself. A political rival, Alexander Lowther, would replace Oates as regimental commander in July 1864 after allegedly engineering Oates' removal from command. It was Oates, however, who led the 15th Alabama into its most noted engagement of the war, at Little Round Top on July 2, 1863, during {{the second day of the}} Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Hillary Clinton ran to {{the left}} of Barack Obama on {{economic}} issues. On the issue of health care, Clinton was willing to include an individual mandate to buy health insurance as part of a program for universal coverage. Obama was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> so far, and came in for substantial criticism from liberals for it. Clinton proposed a Cabinet-level poverty czar position. Clinton secured more labor union backing than Obama, and Obama did better than Clinton at gaining primary votes from self-identified independents. However, on foreign policy issues, Hillary Clinton was more hawkish than Barack Obama. However, Hillary has opposed certain liberal aspects of Obamacare such as the cadillac tax.|$|E

25|$|The {{strength}} of Munster's support was demonstrated during Munster's 2006 and 2008 Heineken Cup final wins. News reports detailed the lengths that fans were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to secure {{tickets to the}} game, with some Munster fans travelling to Biarritz to buy up the French allocation of tickets. On {{the day of the}} game the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was filled with a capacity crowd of 74,500. Of those numbers it is estimated that somewhere between 55,000 and 65,000 were Munster fans with the remainder being neutrals and Biarritz supporters. The Millennium Stadium was intended to be a neutral venue but commentators on the day remarked that it could hardly be counted as such. In North America there is an official supporters club called Munster Rugby USA.|$|E
25|$|When Megan Reeves was kidnapped, Don {{pushed his}} ethics {{to the limit}} to get her back. While he did not {{personally}} beat a suspect, he had Special Agent Ian Edgerton interrogate the teenager for information on where Megan was being held. It is never shown or said what Edgerton did during the interrogation, but it is heavily implied {{that he may have}} used physical force, up to and including applying pressure to the gunshot wound through the teen's wrist; Don expressed concern to his father over being <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> that far, even if he wasn't doing it himself. After this discussion, he convinced his father that it is good to have someone to come home to, and that is why he comes around the Craftsman house so often rather than staying at his apartment.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{research}} has shown that fusion could also be a strong predictor of group-directed helping behaviors. In some studies, individuals donated money to the group. In others, they provided social and emotional support to fellow group members. Other {{research has}} also suggested that strongly fused individuals are especially <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{out of their way to}} protect the group and maintain its integrity. For instance, strongly fused employees were more likely to report having “blown the whistle” sometime during their employment. Presumably, such whistle-blowing activity was motivated by a conviction that their actions would ultimately benefit the group. Another study found that students who were strongly fused with their university were willing to whistle-blow against a cheating fellow student despite the cost of time, energy, and the possibility of retaliation from the cheater.|$|E

25|$|Ava {{was not yet}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to {{war with}} Pegu over Toungoo. Instead, the king sought another way, and {{enlisted the help of}} his brother Gov. Saw Yan Naung of Prome. In 1375, Yan Naung {{proposed}} a marriage of state between his daughter and Pyanchi's son, Pyanchi II, with the marriage ceremony to be held in Prome (Pyay). Pyanchi understood the proposal of marriage to be the first step toward joint rebellion against Ava. A Toungoo−Prome axis backed by Pegu would form a formidable Lower Burma bulwark against Central Burma-based Ava. Pyanchi I agreed to the proposal, and went to Prome with a small battalion. It was a trap. The Toungoo contingent was ambushed near Prome, and Pyanchi was killed although his son and son-in-law Sokkate both escaped.|$|E
25|$|Under {{pressure}} from the European Americans, in the late 19thcentury the Nez Perce split into two groups: one side accepted the coerced relocation to a reservation and the other {{refused to give up}} their fertile land in Idaho and Oregon. Those <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a reservation made a treaty in 1877. The flight of the non-treaty Nez Perce began on June15, 1877, with Chief Joseph, Looking Glass, White Bird, Ollokot, Lean Elk (Poker Joe) and Toohoolhoolzote leading 2,900 men, women and children in an attempt to reach a peaceful sanctuary. They intended to seek shelter with their allies the Crow but, upon the Crow's refusal to offer help, the Nez Perce tried to reach the camp in Canada of Lakota Chief Sitting Bull. He had migrated there instead of surrendering after the decisive Indian victory at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.|$|E

They proposed that the rescuers should leave on Sunday evening, so as to arrive upon the plateau at daybreak on Monday. Whymper and J. M'Cormick decided to start on Sunday morning. The guides of Zermatt, threatened with excommunication by their priests if they failed to attend the early mass, were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> Other people came to help: J.
