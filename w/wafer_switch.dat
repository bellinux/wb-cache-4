5000|$|However, {{the change}} was not popular with long-time customers. The company {{received}} [...] "stacks and stacks of letters and e-mails that said, 'Why did you do this? You ruined it,'" [...] according to {{vice president of sales}} Steve Ornell. [...] Less than two years after the change, sales of Necco Wafers had fallen by 35 percent. [...] In response to these concerns, Necco <b>Wafer</b> production <b>switched</b> back to the original formula in the summer of 2011.|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} a robust two-state filter for infrared gas measurement, where the filter transmittance alternates between a single bandpass function, and a double-band offset reference. The device consists of fixed and movable diffractive sub-elements, micromachined in the device layer of a bonded {{silicon on insulator}} (BSOI) <b>wafer.</b> <b>Switching</b> between the two states of the filter is obtained by actuation of the movable sub- elements between idle and pull-in positions, which affects the interference of reflected light The characteristics of the filter are defined by a diffractive microrelief pattern etched {{on top of the}} sub-elements and by the position of the movable sub-elements at pull-in, the latter mechanically defined by the buried oxide layer. Thus, no accurate electrical control is needed to operate the filter. The first test components operate at 2 mum wavelength using a displacement of 500 nm and an actuation voltage of 5 V. No sticking or change in filter characteristics have been observed after repeated pull-in operations. The simplicity of fabrication and operation is likely to make the two-state filter an attractive component for sensors such as non-dispersive infrared gas detector...|$|R
40|$|Pratt & Whitney, USA of United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) {{designed}} the Large Scale Rotating Rig (LSRR) to perform experimental research with turbo machinery. After executing numerous aerodynamic research activities on compressor and turbine modules, the rig {{was transferred to}} National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) under a collaborative project in the year 2004. The rig is now installed, commissioned and benchmarked at NAL. The rig currently incorporates a single stage reaction turbine module which was earlier used by Pratt & Whitney, USA to carry out few aerodynamic investigations. A sophisticated indigenous data acquisition system was designed and developed to aid the experimental tasks in the rig. It is a fully automatic PC based data acquisition system, incorporating hardware such as ZOC pressure scanners, individual pressure transducers, Scanivalve mechanical multiplexers, <b>wafer</b> <b>switches,</b> thermocouples, digital temperature scanner, DC motors, control actuators, dead weight testers and other accessories. The various hardware units are monitored and controlled by a GUI based software program developed using National Instruments Labview. The instrumentation and data acquisition system is designed to cater various requirements of the rig. These requirements include vane, blade, casing / hub platform surface pressure measurement, vane / blade exit wake flow measurement, temperature measurements and online calibration of pressure transducers...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design and a proof of {{principle}} experimental results of an optically controlled high power rf pulse compression system. The design should, in principle, handle few hundreds of Megawatts of power at X-band. The system {{is based on the}} switched resonant delay line theory [1]. It employs resonant delay lines as a means of storing rf energy. The coupling to the lines is optimized for maximum energy storage during the charging phase. To discharge the lines, a high power microwave switch increases the coupling to the lines just {{before the start of the}} output pulse. The high power microwave switch, required for this system, is realized using optical excitation of an electron-hole plasma layer on the surface of a pure silicon <b>wafer.</b> The <b>switch</b> is designed to operate in the TE 01 mode in a circular waveguide to avoid the edge effects present at the interface between the silicon wafer and the supporting waveguide; thus, enhancing its power handling capability. ...|$|R
40|$|Foragers of the Formosan {{subterranean}} termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, {{were allowed}} to tunnel in two dimensional, sand filled arenas containing Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb. ] Franco) wafers pressure treated with disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT) to an average retention of 1. 77 % BAE {{on one side of}} each arena, and untreated wafers of Douglas-fir on the other side. Arenas were established both in the laboratory and in the field. Initial tunnel formation was unaffected by the presence of borate treated wood. Avoidance of borate treated wood developed after ca. 3 - 5 days. Termites did not avoid borate treated wood as a result of necrophobic behavior. Termite responses when the locations of the treated and untreated <b>wafers</b> were <b>switched</b> within the arenas indicated that the delayed avoidance was related to the location of the treated wood rather than to recognition of the chemical treatment.

30|$|Porous silicon was {{prepared}} by anodic etching of p ++ type boron-doped (0.001 – 0.003 Ω·cm) double-side polished (100)-oriented silicon wafers. The anodization {{was performed in}} a Teflon®; cell with an Au counter electrode and backside Cu electrode. Silicon samples were etched for 10 min within 150 mA ·cm− 2 anodic current density in a solution containing 1 : 1 volume mixture of HF (49 %) and ethanol. A permanent stirring of the etching solution was used to evacuate hydrogen bubbles formed during the anodization process. Two-second etch stop intervals (2 s etch + 2 s stop) were introduced during the anodization in order to replenish the electrolyte in depth of the nano-pores and thus to avoid a porosity gradient along the layer thickness. At {{the end of the}} anodization process, formed PS layers were removed from the bulk silicon <b>wafer</b> by <b>switching</b> anodization current to electropolishing regime (0.5 A ·cm− 2 current density pulse during 5 s) to form so-called free-standing PS layer, further referenced as PS sample. Values of thickness and gravimetric porosity for all PS layers used in this work were found to be 37 ± 1 μm and 64 ± 2 %, respectively.|$|R
40|$|We present 3 {{different}} types of interconnection vias fabricated by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) on silicon substrates. One type of vertical vias with 30 µm diameter mask opening are etched through 400 µm thick <b>wafer</b> by <b>switched</b> Bosch process, featured by very fast etch rate at about 6 µm/min and over 12 : 1 aspect ratio. The other type of vertical vias are tested on smaller diameters ranging from 1 - 9 µm and etched to 20 - 50 µm deep. Those vias have the minimum undercut and smooth sidewalls achieved by non-switched etching. Another type of tapered vias with 75 µm mask opening are etched isotropically in DRIE resulting in over 150 µm deep vias with 70 - 80 degree tapering. Silicon etch selectivity against different mask materials are studied and compared for the vertical vias. Thick resist {{is thought to be}} better mask to minimize undercut and via top erosion by reflected ions. Tapered vias have the problem of sidewall roughness from the isotropic etch. Both plasma cleaning and argon annealing methods are tested to smooth the silicon sidewalls in the tapered vias...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the pressures {{on the bottom of}} vessels sailing at high speeds is essential for the design bottom plate and its scantlings. However, only a few semi-empirical methods based on scarce full or model scale experimental results {{can be found in the}} open literature. The shortage of measured data is partly due to the complexity of the measurements. This kind of data is valuable for validating the proposed analytical methods and for providing background to the rules issued by the classification societies. Two methods are reviewed in this paper to measure the pressure distribution on the bottom of fast ships. In the former, membrane-type pressure sensors are fitted on a grid of points on the bottom of the vessel, while in the latter Pitot-tubes are connected to digital pressure transducer through a 48 -channel fluid <b>switch</b> <b>wafer.</b> The pros and cons of both methods, which were tested in the Towing Tank of the Laboratory for Ship and Marine Hydrodynamics of the National Technical University of Athens, are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{long term}} experience, {{collected}} mainly with military applications like Rail Guns and Active Armour, {{a range of}} optimized semiconductor devices for pulsed applications was developed by ABB Switzerland Ltd and described in this presentation. The presented devices are optimized for pulsed discharge and fit very well for switching the short but high electrical power demand used for magnetic forming. Devices are available in different versions with silicon wafer diameters up to 120 mm and blocking voltages of over 6500 V. Because of the different application requirements a differentiation is made in device technology. Depending on the discharge circuit, devices for low, medium, or high di/dt can be selected and the difference in advantages and disadvantages between both technologies will be described. To minimize the inductance between switching device and freewheeling diode, ABB can integrate this diode monolithic on the <b>switching</b> <b>wafer.</b> These so called reverse conducting devices are very common for magnetic forming applications. Thyristor structures are commercially available up to 8500 V with 120 mm silicon wafers and GTO-like structures are available up to 4500 V with 91 mm silicon wafers. For higher voltages or higher currents a combination of devices in series and/or parallel connection is required. The presentation will also describe the evolution of complete discharge switching modules {{in the range of}} 10 kV / 50 kJ, a large discharge system of 21 kV / 200 kA, and a newly designed high current switch in the range of 15 kV / 3 MJ. The solid state switch solutions offered today and those shown in the presentation are based on a standard platform of components existing already for several years. For reliability reasons it is of great importance that the switch assemblies for high current pulsed applications are designed in cooperation with the device manufacturer who has in-depth knowledge of the switching behavior of the semiconductor components under pulsed conditions. The advantage of a complete switch assembly is that the whole unit can be tested under application conditions. ABB has a test capability up to 65 kV and 85 kJ stored energy...|$|R
