All possible research institutes interested in participating in the Project presented themselves and a lively debate, also attended by Prof. Dr. Alberto Bally [...] who {{had worked in the}} area in the late forties and fifties, initiated the organisation of the <b>working</b> <b>plan.</b> Following that, the official start date was May 2000 when the project work plan was defined. Initial sponsor was Eni E Division (former Agip), followed by NorskHydro (After that Hydro O and now Statoil) which entered the Project in February 2001.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 May 1939, Blumentritt {{submitted}} to his superiors a <b>working</b> <b>plan</b> for the German Invasion of Poland. At this time, {{he was assigned}} to the Oberkommando des Heeres (Army High Command; OKH), and formed along with Manstein and Generalfeldmarshall Gerd von Rundstedt a [...] "Working Staff" [...] {{for the development of a}} plan for the invasion. The plan he submitted was called Fall Weiss (Case White) and was subsequently put into action with little alteration. Then on 2 September 1939, Blumentritt was transferred to the general staff of Army Group South (one of the two German Army Groups to carry out the invasion) in Silesia under Rundstedt. This collaboration began his long and intimate friendship with Rundstedt, which was to last for many years. Blumentritt was Rundstedt′s Chief of Operations, while Manstein was Chief of Staff. The invasion was put into motion, after some delays, on 1 September 1939, and by 6 October the entire country of Poland was subdued.|$|E

60|$|It {{may seem}} very {{reasonable}} {{to ask how}} the result proposed in the last paragraph is to be attained, and to add that the difficulty of carrying so laudable a proposal into effect lies wholly in the details, and therefore that until some <b>working</b> <b>plan</b> is suggested, the consideration of improving the human race is Utopian. But this requirement is not altogether fair, because if a persuasion {{of the importance of}} any end takes possession of men's minds, sooner or later means are found by which that end is carried into effect. Some of the objections offered at first will be discovered to be sentimental, and of no real importance--the sentiment will change and they will disappear; others that are genuine are not met, but are in some way turned or eluded; and lastly, through the ingenuity of many minds directed for a long time towards the achievement of a common purpose, many happy ideas are sure to be hit upon that would not have occurred to a single individual.|$|E
6000|$|It has {{sometimes}} been made a matter of blame by friends no less than foes, {{that he should have}} undertaken the task of government, depending on a majority not large enough to coerce the House of Lords. One or two short observations on this would seem to be enough. How could he refuse to try to work his Irish policy through parliament, after the bulk of the Irish members had quitted their own leader four years before in absolute reliance on the sincerity and good faith of Mr. Gladstone and his party? After all the confidence that Ireland had shown in him at the end of 1890, how could he in honour throw up the attempt that had been the only object of his public life since 1886? To do this would have been to justify indeed the embittered warnings of Mr. Parnell in his most reckless hour. How could either refusal of office or the postponement of an Irish bill after taking office, be made intelligible in Ireland itself? Again, the path of honour in Ireland was equally the path of honour and of safety in Great Britain. Were British liberals, who had given him a majority, partly from disgust at Irish coercion, partly from faith that he could produce a <b>working</b> <b>plan</b> of Irish government, and partly from hopes of reforms of their own—were they to learn that their leaders could do nothing for any of their special objects? ...|$|E

40|$|The forest {{planning}} {{understood as}} mere management of stands for wood production has currently lost, {{compared to the}} past, its relevance and application possibilities; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} focus on the multifunctional services of forests. Here we present a synthesis of a district forest plan which has been developed through five pillars: (a) mapping of potential forest ecosystem services, (b) involving local stakeholders and experts, (c) exploring strategic scenarios of forest yield, (d) mapping homogeneous forest zones, and (e) capitalising the knowledge of forest <b>working</b> <b>plans.</b> The experts contributed through a decision support system NetSyMoD (Network Analysis-Creative System Modelling-Decision Support) which helps the decision process in the assessment of the scenarios of forest yield. It was possible to appreciate that an increase of yield suits well to climate adaptation in some forest zone and with the contents of forest <b>working</b> <b>plans.</b> This approach may be replicated in other forest districts where there is an history in the application of silvicultural control methods...|$|R
