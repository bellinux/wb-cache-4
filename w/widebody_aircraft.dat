5|$|Beginning in March 2013, the {{majority}} of the airline's fleet will be retrofitted with new Business and Economy Class seats. The seats are nearly identical to the new Regional Business Class and new Long-haul Economy Class products offered by parent company Cathay Pacific. Seats in both classes will be fitted with StudioKA (a rebranded version of the StudioCX inflight entertainment system on board Cathay Pacific aircraft), which features a 12.1-inch (Business Class) or 9-inch (Economy Class) touchscreen display, Audio/Video on Demand (AVOD), support for iOS devices, and a USB port for connectivity to other devices. In-seat power outlets will be available to all passengers. The new Business Class will feature a 21-inch wide recliner seat with 45 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 47 inches (<b>widebody</b> <b>aircraft)</b> of pitch, while the new Economy Class will be 18.1 inches wide with 30 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 32 inches (<b>widebody</b> <b>aircraft)</b> of pitch.

25|$|ANA bought {{its first}} <b>widebody</b> <b>aircraft,</b> six Lockheed L-1011s, in November 1971, {{following}} a lengthy sales effort by Lockheed which had involved negotiations between US president Richard Nixon, Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka and UK prime minister Edward Heath (lobbying {{in favor of}} engine maker Rolls-Royce).

The carrier had ordered McDonnell Douglas DC-10s but cancelled the order at the last minute and switched to Lockheed. It was later revealed that Lockheed had indirectly bribed Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka to force this switch: the scandal led to the arrest of Tanaka and several managers from ANA and Lockheed sales agent Marubeni for corruption.|$|E
25|$|As a result, z of the {{increasing}} number of passengers going into and out of Kuching, a completely new and larger terminal was needed. Construction started in the early 2000s, and progressed at an incredible pace. The new terminal was literally constructed from the inside out, with the old terminal slowly being chipped away and replaced by new sections of the new terminal. The new terminal complex was finally opened on Monday, the 16th of January 2006 by the Chief Minister of Sarawak Pehin Sri Haji Abdul Taib Mahmud and the then Malaysian Minister of Transport Dato' Sri Chan Kong Choy. The full work on the terminal, however, was only completed in April 2006.

40|$|DA has {{worldwide}} {{reputation for}} its comprehensive {{experience in the}} use of fiber reinforced composite parts in primary structures (flaps and stabilizers) of transport aircraft. However, similar assemblies (stabilizers) made of CFRP are by now manufactured in the United States {{as well as in the}} CIS. Therefore, it can be assumed that competitors have meanwhile reached a standard comparable to the Airbus standard. Development and incorporation of a CFRP pressure bulkhead in a major assembly as sensitive as the pressurized zone of a <b>widebody</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> with its high safety requirements concerning damage tolerance and behavior in fire is feasible as DA has long-standing positive experience with series CFRP laminate components. Our experience gained with these series components in more than 15 years allows us to prepare the next step towards preparing a CFRP fuselage. A Design Build Team (DBT) was established in the Stade plant to ensure an optimal cooperation between all task areas. This team incorporated all specialist departments which have contributed to the development of the CFRP pressure bulkhead during the entire development phase. The new concept of static tests including simulation of horizontal stabilizer forces involved the static demonstration of a discretely stiffened pressure bulkhead and an additional second test sequence with a monolithic pressure bulkhead. The majority of the targets defined in the project was reached. We have succeeded in developing a CFRP pressure bulkhead, which - compared to the conventional bulkhead design - allows a more cost-effective manufacture and accounts for a weight reduction of approx. 27 %.
