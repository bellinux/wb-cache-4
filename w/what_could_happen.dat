5|$|In January 1748, Adams {{and some}} friends were {{inflamed}} by British impressment and launched The Independent Advertiser, a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams. His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and they emphasized many of the themes that characterized his subsequent career. He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights. He cited {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire as an example of <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to New England if it were to abandon its Puritan values.|$|E
5|$|The film {{includes}} segments {{intended to}} refute {{critics who say}} {{that global warming is}} unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there. It also contains various short animated projections of <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to different animals more vulnerable to global warming.|$|E

25|$|The party {{came close}} to expressing support for the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War – on grounds of {{supporting}} defence of democracy (some writers initially took Spain {{as an example of}} <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> if the capitalists class tried to use force to overturn the result of a socialist electoral revolution). This led to a debate within the party and resulted in an official statement that fell short of supporting the pro-capitalist republican government, but offering general support to workers in their struggle for democracy.|$|E

She is jealous of Bell's involvement with other girls' affairs, including Ais', but is still in love with him, devoted to protecting him, and helping with his growth, even after learning that he only views her as family. She and Bell live in a room under an abandoned church, and she works part-time for the Guild as a clerk, and also some food stands to help Bell with day-to-day living expenses, until moving to the former palace of the Apollon Familia upon defeating them in the War Game and claiming their assets.

25|$|When {{a serial}} killer dubbed The Salem Stalker starts wreaking havoc around town, killing many friends, {{including}} Roman, John and Marlena are worried about <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to them. The killer, though, is later revealed to be Marlena, though John believes {{she was forced to}} by someone else. Marlena is arrested, and sent to prison, while John tries to clear her name. Marlena tries to escape, and is killed by police fire. However, she's later found alive with all of her victims on Melaswen Island, and it's revealed she was brainwashed by Andre DiMera into committing the murders. She reunites with John, but soon after, Marlena finds out she's pregnant with Roman's child, conceived when they were stranded on the island. During an argument between John and Roman, Marlena falls down the stairs and miscarries. She wakes up with amnesia, {{as a result of the}} miscarriage. Amnesiac specialist Alex North is brought in to care for Marlena, and she appears to fall in love with him. Alex later reveals that he is Marlena's first husband, and was presumed dead in Vietnam. Since Alex and Marlena's marriage has never been dissolved, Marlena's subsequent marriages are all invalid. Suspicious, John investigates, and finds out that Alex is an abusive husband. John uncovers that Alex is planning to kill Marlena. By the time that Alex is proven to be a fraud, he and Marlena have renewed their vows, and left on a honeymoon. Alex takes Marlena to Morgan Island, but John soon finds them and, after a shootout and scuffle, Alex falls over a cliff and is presumed dead.|$|E

500|$|Heroes creator Tim Kring and {{the writers}} {{had created the}} {{character}} of Elle {{with the idea that}} she was a [...] "cautionary tale" [...] of <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> if the other characters had known of their abilities for the duration of their lives as Elle did. Kring pitched Bell the idea for the character [...] "which she loved" [...] and soon they were [...] "off and running." [...] The casting of Bell, as Kring explains, [...] "was not easy to pull off," [...] but because of the large ensemble cast of the series and multiple story arcs, [...] "we found a way to jump into a small window in [...] schedule." [...] Originally, Elle was only meant to be Bob's stepdaughter and Meredith Gordon's daughter, making her Claire Bennet's sister, however this idea was dropped due to [...] "lack of storyline and plot holes".|$|E

However, they maintained a friendship, and Cecil later contacted Gibbons to ask him to work on Revolution's second game. Seeing his son play video games, Gibbons became interested and realized that his skills in drawing, writing and conceptualizing could be useful in a gaming environment. Joining the team just before the release Lure of the Temptress, Gibbons was sent a rudimentary outline of <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> in the hypothesised game, and wrote a longer story with new characters and scenarios, to which Revolution then further added.

500|$|Fraser Nelson, {{editor of}} The Spectator, {{suggested}} the programme had highlighted {{a section of}} society who have been forgotten by the politicians: [...] "These people are people who otherwise don’t have a voice. They don’t vote, so for many years they have just not mattered". Nelson's comments were echoed by Dominic Sandbrook in the Daily Mail, who felt the programme portrayed its participants sympathetically: [...] "The real scandal of Benefits Street, in fact, is what it tells us about a welfare system that abandons thousands of people – {{through no fault of}} their own – to a life without hope or ambition, effectively turning them into an underclass, dependent on the charity of the State." [...] Charlie Brooker also felt the programme had been [...] "broadly sympathetic" [...] to those it portrays. In the Daily Mirror, entrepreneur John Bird, founder of The Big Issue, wrote that although Benefits Street did not fully represent the spectrum of people who claim benefits, it did show <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> to those forgotten by the system [...] "who get caught in a kind of social suicide".|$|E

I develop some of my own models for <b>what</b> <b>could</b> be <b>happening</b> and a set of questions for in-depth interviews.

[...] Making reference to Beyoncé long-time relationship with Jay-Z and then recent rumors about them possibly getting married, Nero added that the song might leave several numerous fans wondering <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> next. Marc Anthony Neal of the international webzine PopMatters considered [...] "Daddy" [...] to be the [...] "most affecting song on Dangerously in Love." [...] He went on writing that the song is an extraordinary tribute to her father Mathew Knowles, stating that Beyoncé [...] "embraces [...] the man that has helped take the kind of artistic leap that Dangerously in Love represents." [...] He ended up by adding that [...] "By the time listeners get to the fifteenth and final track, they will have been so pleasantly surprised and impressed by Beyoncé's performance throughout, that 'Daddy' seems less corny" [...] {{but it is in}} this song that she finally accepts the state of being a woman, rather than a girl. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine described the song as an ode dedicated to the man that [...] "instilled perseverance".|$|E

Eventually, Brian agrees to pay off the bet. After Stewie's bet is satisfied, he offers Brian an opportunity to get one [...] "free revenge shot" [...] to make up for all the torture he caused. Brian accepts the offer, but leaves Stewie in suspense as to when the free hit will be delivered, until Stewie is overcome with paranoia and starts beating himself up in an attempt to satisfy Brian.

500|$|Oswald's {{head was}} interred in Durham Cathedral {{together}} with the remains of Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (a saint with whom Oswald became posthumously associated, although the two were not associated in life; Cuthbert became bishop of Lindisfarne {{more than forty years}} after Oswald's death) and other valuables in a quickly made coffin, where it is generally believed to remain, although there are at least four other claimed heads of Oswald in continental Europe. One of his arms is said to have ended up in Peterborough Abbey later in the Middle Ages. The story is that a small group of monks from Peterborough made their way to Bamburgh where Oswald's uncorrupted arm was kept and stole it under the cover of darkness. They returned with it to Peterborough and in due time a chapel was created for the arm - Oswald's Chapel. This - minus the arm - can be seen to this day in the south transept of the cathedral. When creating this chapel the monks of Peterborough had thought of how they had acquired it and built into the chapel a narrow tower - just big enough for a monk to climb to the top by an internal stair and stand guard over Oswald's Arm 24 hours a day, every day of the year. [...] The monk had to stand because the tower is not large enough for him to sit - sitting could lull him to sleep - and they knew <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> when no-one was watching.|$|E
