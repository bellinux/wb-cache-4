Curly lays the wood on top of a wooden table, which Moe happens to be standing on. Curly then proceeds to buzzsaw both the wood and table in half, <b>with</b> the <b>table</b> <b>splitting</b> in two. However, the <b>table</b> <b>split</b> inward on Moe's half of it, and Moe came crashing down on his left side, breaking three ribs. He was able to pull himself up and deliver a double slap to Larry and Curly before fainting. Moe was then rushed to the hospital while production ceased briefly.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} splitting an order for R goods, R ≥ 1, among a set of sellers, each having bounded amounts of the goods, so as to minimize {{the total cost of}} the deal. In deal <b>splitting</b> <b>with</b> packages (DSP), the sellers offer packages containing combinations of the goods; in deal <b>splitting</b> <b>with</b> price <b>tables</b> (DST), the buyer can generate such combinations using price tables. Our problems, which often occur in online reverse auctions, generalize covering integer programs with multiplicity constraints (CIP), where we must fill up an R-dimensional bin by selecting (with bounded number of repetitions) from a set of R-dimensional items, such that the overall cost is minimized. Thus, both DSP and DST are NP-hard, already for a single good, and hard to approximate for arbitrary number of goods. In this paper we focus on finding efficient approximations for DSP and DST instances where the number of goods is some fixed constant. In particular, we develop polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) for several subclasses of instances of practical interest. Our results include a PTAS for CIP in fixed dimension, and a more efficient (combinatorial) scheme for CIP∞, where the multiplicity constraints are omitted. Our approximation scheme for CIP ∞ is based on a non-trivial application of the fast scheme for the fractional coverin...|$|R

We introduce a model of multimedia database based on tables containing feature types, {{and the concept of}} schema design, which is based on <b>splitting</b> <b>tables</b> depending on the functional relations between different parts of the features. We show that certain relations between substructures of a same feature structure can lead to schemas for which efficient algorithms for-nearest neighbor and range searches can be defined. I...|$|R
