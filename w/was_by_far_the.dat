5|$|At the time, it <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> largest battle ever {{fought in}} North America. If the Royal Navy is included, over 40,000 men {{took part in}} the battle. Howe {{reported}} his losses as 59 killed, 268 wounded and 31 missing. The Hessian casualties were 5 killed and 26 wounded. The Americans suffered much heavier losses. About 300 had been killed and over 1,000 captured. As few as half of the prisoners survived. Kept on prison ships, then transferred to locations such as the Middle Dutch Church, they were starved and denied medical attention. In their weakened condition, many succumbed to smallpox.|$|E

The tornado lifted just a few minutes later at 5:45.

5|$|The Teamsters Union <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> {{largest and}} most notable {{contributor}} of workers to the pipeline project. Teamsters worked in the transportation and supply aspects of the project. All trucks were driven by Teamsters, supply warehouses were run by Teamsters, and the buses that transported workers from camps to job sites were run by Teamsters. Teamsters Local 959, with more than 23,000 employees at its peak, <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> most dominant labor force on the pipeline project. There were frequent allegations of corruption by Teamsters on the project, and the Anchorage Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize for a 15-part series on the rise of Local 959 and its influence on state politics. Repeated allegations of links to organized crime were never backed up by evidence, but two Teamsters leaders were murdered in 1976 while investigating drug activity on the pipeline project. Teamsters workers strongly denied any involvement with organized crime, {{and pointed to the}} fact that 80 percent of the Teamsters in the project had college degrees or professional and management experience.|$|E

Independiente was his first release as an independent artist, appearing on his Metamorfosis label, a company he created to refocus his career. The album was distributed by Warner.

5|$|During {{his long}} and {{productive}} career, Arcadelt wrote music both sacred and secular, {{all of it}} vocal. He left a total of 24 motets, 125 French chansons, approximately 250 madrigals (about fifty of which are of uncertain attribution), three masses, as well as settings of the Lamentations of Jeremiah and the Magnificat. There may {{be as many as}} 250 more madrigals by Arcadelt which survive anonymously in manuscript sources. Influences on his music ranged from the chanson and polyphonic style of his northern homeland, the native secular music of Italy such as the frottola, and the music he heard while he served in the Sistine Chapel choir. Of all the early madrigalists, he <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> most universal in his influences as well as his appeal; and his influence on others was enormous. Arcadelt brought the madrigal form to its early maturity.|$|E
5|$|From there on, Harvey's {{series was}} unproductive, failing to pass 31 {{in the six}} innings of the final three Tests. Australia's form slumped along with that of Harvey, losing the next two Tests and the series 3–1. Harvey ended with 354 runs at 44.25 for the series. Despite this, he {{continued}} to productive in the other first-class matches and <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> most productive batsman in the 1954–55 Australian season, accumulating 1100 at 47.83 runs ahead of Les Favell's 663. He scored a pair of 62s in a 36-run win over New South Wales, 95 and 66 against Queensland and 82 and 47 in a match for a Tasmania Combined XI against England.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{regarded}} as the greatest batsman {{in the history of}} cricket, the right-handed Bradman played in all five Tests as captain at No. 3. Bradman was more influential than other Australian captains because he {{was also one of the}} three selectors who had a hand in choosing the squad. He was also a member of the Australian Board of Control while still playing, a privilege that no other person has held. At the age of 40, Bradman <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> oldest player on the team; three-quarters of his team were at least eight years younger, and some viewed him as a father figure. Coupled with his status as a national hero, cricketing ability and influence as an administrator, this associated the team more closely to him than other teams to their respective captains. Bradman's iconic stature as a cricketer also led to record-breaking public interest and attendances at the matches on tour.|$|E
