50|$|A {{simplified}} {{hydraulic ram}} {{is shown in}} Figure 2. Initially, the waste valve 4 is open, and the delivery valve 5 is closed. The <b>water</b> in the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> 1 starts to flow under {{the force of gravity}} and picks up speed and kinetic energy until the increasing drag force closes the waste valve. The momentum of the water flow in the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> against the now closed waste valve causes a water hammer that raises the pressure in the pump, opens the delivery valve 5, and forces some water to flow into the delivery pipe 3. Because this water is being forced uphill through the delivery pipe farther than it is falling downhill from the source, the flow slows; when the flow reverses, the delivery check valve closes. Meanwhile, the water hammer from the closing of the waste valve also produces a pressure pulse which propagates back up the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> to the source where it converts to a suction pulse that propagates back down the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe.</b> This suction pulse, with the weight or spring on the valve, pulls the waste valve back open and allows the process to begin again.|$|R

It helps to check the disadvantage of using seed scorchers which produces burnt or unevenly heated seeds which results in black oil formation. The equipment consists of an insulated heating unit, roaster, seed inlet unit, seed discharge outlet, power transmission unit and the frame work. A gear motor of 0. 25 kW was selected to supply power to the shaft whose end was welded to the stirrer. The roasting unit consists of three compartments: roasting chamber, steam chamber and insulator chamber. The insulated heating unit has two pipes: <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> and steam delivery pipe. Also, two electric heating elements of 2. 75 kW each were installed in the heating unit to help boil the water for steam to form; this steam will then be transported by the steam delivery pipe to the steam chamber which in turn heats up the outer surface of the roasting chamber and thus the seeds inside are roasted through the heat being supplied. The machine was fabricated with about 90 % local materials. Test results of the seed roaster using neem seeds indicate successful heating/roasting, the seeds were not scorched or burnt, rather they were looking dry but fresh, this indicates that the design of the machine suits its purpose for heating neem seeds prior to oil expelling.

A mixture of water and air at ambient temperature and pressures up to 2. 4 bar flows through the T-junction, with different splitting of flow rates in the two outlet branches; superficial velocities of air and <b>water</b> in the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> are varied up {{to a maximum of}} 35 m/s and 3. 5 m/s respectively.

The pressure drops along the branches have been measured relatively to different splitting of the flow rate through the two branches and the pressure loss coefficients in the junction have been evaluated. Friction pressure drops have allowed us to evaluate two-phase friction multipliers, which have then been compared to the predictions of Lockhart-Martinelli, and Friedel correlations.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. November 2012. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisors: Omid Mohseni, John Gulliver. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 51 pages. The SAFL Baffle is a stormwater treatment device created at the University of Minnesota's St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. Previous research by Howard et al. 2011 showed {{that when the}} SAFL Baffle is retrofitted into a sump manhole, it improves {{the ability of the}} sump to collect sediment at low flow rates and retain captured sediment at high flow rates. The purpose of this research was to know how a SAFL Baffle performs when: 1. Clogged with debris like trash and vegetation 2. Installed in a sump manhole with an outlet pipe 90 degrees to the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> 3. Installed in a sump manhole with water entering through an inlet grate and <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> Tests were performed at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory on a 6 -ft (1. 8 m) diameter by 6 -ft (1. 8 m) deep sump, a 6 -ft (1. 8 m) diameter by 3 -ft (0. 9 m) deep sump, a 1 -ft (0. 3 m) diameter by 1 -ft (0. 3 m) deep scale model sump, and a 1 -ft (0. 3 m) diameter by 0. 5 -ft (0. 15 m) deep scale model sump. All of the sumps were equipped with the SAFL Baffle, and were evaluated using two metrics: 1. How well the system captures sediment at low flow rates (Removal Efficiency Testing) 2. How well the system retains the previously captured sediment at high flow rates (Washout Testing) When a SAFL Baffle was clogged with stormwater debris, water traveled underneath of the SAFL Baffle. If the sump was deep, performance of the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle did not change significantly. However, if the sump was shallow, significant washout was exhibited in the sump. This washout problem in shallow sumps was mitigated when a SAFL Baffle with hole diameters equal to 5 -in (12. 7 cm) was installed in the sump. Sumps with outlet pipes located 90 degrees to the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> exhibited significant washout of previously captured sediment during high flow rates. With a SAFL Baffle installed at an angle between 90 - 120 degrees of the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe,</b> washout sharply decreased. At low flow rates, a SAFL Baffle installed at a 113 degree angle with respect to the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> captured more sediment than a SAFL Baffle installed in a standard, straight flow-through sump. In the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle that received <b>water</b> from an <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> and an <b>inlet</b> grate from above, washout rates were highest when the flow rate from the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> was less than the flow rate from the inlet grate. Similarly, the ability of the device to capture sediment decreased when the flow rate from the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> was less than three times greater than the flow rate from the inlet grate. Through extensive testing, it was determined that the standard sumps equipped with the SAFL Baffle should be used downstream of stormwater sewers such that the drainage basin of the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> is at least three times the drainage basin of the inlet grate. Under this condition, the flow from an inlet grate from above does not impact the performance of the sump equipped with a SAFL Baffle...|$|R

A mixture of air and water at ambient temperature and pressures up to 1. 5 bar is generated inside a mixer, which is fed by a compressed air system and a centrifugal pump. Superficial velocities of air and <b>water</b> in the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> are varied up {{to a maximum of}} 35 m/s and 3. 5 m/s respectively. Each branch has got four pressure taps which can be connected to both differential and absolute pressure transducers.

Pressure drops, that are extrapolated in the junction, are analysed and the irreversible component (pressure loss) is evaluated. The two-phase pressure losses are compared with the Chisholm two - phase multiplier and with the prediction of the El-Shaboury et al. model, and several correlations for the pressure loss coefficients are tested: the loss coefficients are expressed {{as a function of the}} Reynolds number, as in the El-Shaboury et al. approach, and the dependence of loss coefficients on the inlet void fraction, flow quality and Martinelli parameter is also analysed...|$|R

However, surprisingly little attention {{is given to}} the nutrient composition of the water flowing through these systems, which is generally assumed to equal in situ conditions, but may change due to the presence of biofouling organisms. Significantly lower bacterial abundances and higher inorganic nitrogen species (nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium) were measured in aquarium water when biofouling organisms were present within a 7 -year old <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> feeding a tropical reef running seawater aquaria system, compared with aquarium water fed by a new, biofouling-free <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe.</b> These <b>water</b> quality changes are indicative of the feeding activity and waste production of the suspension- and filter-feeding communities found in the old pipe, which included sponges, bivalves, barnacles, and ascidians. To illustrate the physiological consequences of these water quality changes on a model organism kept in the aquaria system, we investigated the influence of the presence and absence of the biofouling community on the functioning of the filter-feeding sponge Halisarca caerulea, by determining its choanocyte (filter cell) proliferation rates. We found a 34 % increase in choanocyte proliferation rates following the replacement of the <b>inlet</b> <b>pipe</b> (i. e., removal of the biofouling community).
