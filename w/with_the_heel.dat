5|$|The early Buddhist texts {{describe}} meditative {{practices and}} states, {{some of which}} the Buddha borrowed from the śramaṇa tradition. The Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate {{for the purposes of}} controlling hunger or the mind, depending on the passage. However, {{there is no mention of}} the tongue being inserted into the nasopharynx as in true khecarī mudrā. The Buddha used a posture where pressure is put on the perineum <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel,</b> similar to even modern postures used to stimulate Kundalini.|$|E
5|$|Nick Dalton, an {{attorney}} and key-holder for the Playboy Club, introduces himself to newly hired Bunny Maureen and asks her for cigarettes. Maureen notifies to him that she is out of cigarettes, {{and goes to the}} storeroom to resupply. Bruno Bianchi, who previously tried to dance with her, is at the premises and attempts to seduce her. A terrified Maureen begins to resist his attempts; the two later get into a scuffle. Dalton—checking on his order—witnesses the attack and gets into an altercation with Bianchi. Maureen stabs Bruno Bianchi in the neck <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> of her shoes, killing him. Nick Dalton later informs her that Bianchi is the head of a local chapter of the Chicago Outfit. They dispose of his body in the Chicago River, and Dalton provides refuge for Maureen at his condominium.|$|E

Juventud won a Cruiserweight Battle Royal that {{included}} all three Mexicools, thus earning {{a match for}} the Cruiserweight Title at the 2005 No Mercy event. Juventud would win the match at No Mercy and the title.|$|E

25|$|Human {{walking is}} {{accomplished}} with a strategy called the double pendulum. During forward motion, the leg {{that leaves the}} ground swings forward from the hip. This sweep is the first pendulum. Then the leg strikes the ground <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> and rolls through to the toe in a motion described as an inverted pendulum. The motion of the two legs is coordinated so that one foot or the other is always {{in contact with the}} ground. The process of walking recovers approximately sixty per cent of the energy used due to pendulum dynamics and ground reaction force.|$|E
25|$|In April 2000, with ratings hitting new lows, Russo and Bischoff were {{reinstated}} by WCW, where, {{in another}} attempt to get WCW's creative product turned around, they decided to reboot WCW into a more modern, streamlined company. They formed an on-screen union that stood up for the younger talent in the company (which they dubbed the New Blood) in their battle against the Millionaire's Club, which consisted of the older, higher-paid, and more visible stars such as Hogan, Sting, and Diamond Dallas Page. Though initially well-received, the storyline quickly degenerated into yet another nWo rehash, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> nWo recast as the New Blood and the face WCW embodied in the Millionaire's Club. Had the reverse been done, with the New Blood as faces and Millionaire's Club as heels, the angle may have worked but many saw the casting as an attempt for sympathy towards the veterans who had already gained bad reputations behind the scenes. Oddly, the New Blood was disbanded before the New Blood Rising pay-per-view began.|$|E
500|$|Several of the {{earliest}} sources refer to the structure as [...] "Wade's Causeway", [...] "Wade's Causey", and [...] "Wade's Wife's Causey". The word causeway derives from the earlier English causey way or simply causey. Causey derives from the Middle English cauci, which derives from the Anglo-French causee, itself derived from the Medieval Latin calciata ("paved highway"), which ultimately may derive from the Latin calx (meaning [...] "heel"). The derivation from calx can most likely {{be explained by the}} practice in the Ancient Roman era of consolidating earthworks through trampling <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> of the foot.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pott {{read the}} paragraph, uttered a loud shriek, and threw herself at full length on the hearth-rug, screaming, and tapping it <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> of her shoes, {{in a manner}} which could leave no doubt of the propriety of her {{feelings}} on the occasion.|$|R
5000|$|The Epic of Gilgamesh {{mentions}} that Mount Hermon split after Gilgamesh kills Humbaba, the Guardian of the Cedar Forest.

5000|$|Shavasana, Savasana ( [...] शवासन; IAST: śavāsana), or Corpse Pose is an asana usually {{done at the}} end of a yoga {{practice}} in which practitioners lie flat on their backs <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> spread as wide as the yoga mat and the arms at the sides of the body, palms facing upward.|$|R
500|$|After {{noticing the}} hostile fan {{reaction}} and witnessing Carly's heel tactics from the public, Eddie Colón sneaked and waited by the locker rooms and confronted him, {{which resulted in}} a faceoff that concluded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> locker jumping him. Upon learning this, Colón Sr. travelled to Kentucky and interrupted an OVW scrimmage, which resulted in Carly Colón asking for his expulsion from the building. This served as setup for a feud between brothers, which saw Carly Colón return to Puerto Rico and mock the fans by stating that they would be [...] "buying PPVs to see [...] " [...] and using the recent Puerto Rico national basketball team's 19-point victory over the United States national basketball team to claim that they were [...] "conformists" [...] for celebrating a single win. The first match between brothers headlined Aniversario on August 21, 2004. Carly Colón won the match by faking a knee injury and then shoving his sister into Eddie Colón when she entered the ring to help, using the distraction to score the pinfall. Two rematches were held the following month at Fase 3, the first of which ended in a time limit draw. He lost the rubber match, which concluded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> factions assaulting both brothers and Colón, Sr. futilely asking them to join forces.|$|E
2500|$|The frog is a V shaped {{structure}} that extends forwards across {{about two-thirds of}} the sole. Its thickness grows from the front to the back and, at the back, it merges <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> periople. In its midline, it has a central groove (sulcus), that extends up between the bulbs.|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally, {{the term}} 'flipper' {{has been used}} to {{describe}} other types of deliveries. The Australian leg spinner Bob Holland employed a back spinning ball that he simply pushed backwards <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> of his palm. Sometimes this form of front-hand flipper is called a [...] "zooter". It is easier to bowl but not as effective as the amount of backspin is much less.|$|E

5000|$|The Earl of Wiltshire was {{described}} as the most handsome man in the Kingdom and as Gregory records, at the First Battle of St Albans in 1455, Wiltshire [...] "fought mainly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels,</b> for he was frightened of losing his beauty"; prudently he had taken off his armour and hidden it in a ditch, donning a monk's habit.|$|R
2500|$|On {{his return}} Miller brought some {{association}} football equipment and a rules book with him. He {{then went on}} to develop the new rules of the game amongst the community in São Paulo. In 1888, six years before his return, the first sports club was founded in the city, São Paulo Athletic Club. São Paulo Athletic Club won the first three years championships. Miller's skills were far and above his colleagues at this stage. He was given the honour of contributing his name to a move involving a deft flick of the ball <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> [...] "Chaleira".|$|E
2500|$|A true {{direction}} change involving the feet {{moving in a}} new direction requires either a prep step or a pivot, both of which are sometimes referred to as a flank. To perform a prep step, on the last count of movement in the first direction a marcher plants the foot <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> turned outward at half the angle of the turn desired, with the upper body still facing forward. On the next count, the other foot snaps into position completing the turn. The upper body may or may not turn with the lower body. Some bands plant the heel on the prep step rather than the toe, but preserving the angle of the foot. [...] To perform a pivot, the marcher pivots between directions over the ball of the foot on the last count instead of using a prep step.|$|E
2500|$|The {{night after}} WrestleMania, Triple H ejected the absent Michaels for [...] "dropping the ball" [...] over the Tyson {{incident}} (In reality, Michaels {{had suffered a}} back injury during his Casket Match with The Undertaker at the Royal Rumble, and started a four-year hiatus from wrestling to recuperate). Triple H assumed full leadership of D-X and recruited X-Pac, who had been recently fired from WCW, and the WWF Tag Team Champions The New Age Outlaws ("Bad Ass" [...] Billy Gunn and [...] "The Road Dogg" [...] Jesse James) into the stable. While the intent was for the stable to remain heels, they became hugely popular and were eventually pushed as fan favorites. During this time, they feuded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> gimmick of The Rock and his group the Nation of Domination and then later, Vince McMahon's Corporation. The group remained united and hugely popular throughout 1998 and into early 1999.|$|E
50|$|He {{would make}} his return as Bakery Yagi, costing Crazy MAX a match against the Italian Connection by whacking SUWA in <b>the</b> knee <b>with</b> a baguette. At this point, the Italian Connection was full of {{internal}} strife {{as to whether the}} stable was to be face or heel. As Bakery, he came down on <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> side. He began carrying loaves of bread to the ring, and using them as weapons in matches. When the ItaCon split, Yagi sided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Craven {{transferred}} to the University of North Carolina. In his first season <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Tar <b>Heels,</b> he made 22 appearances and tallied six goals and five assists. In 2013, he redshirted his senior year after suffering a season-ending injury during preseason. In his final year <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Tar <b>Heels,</b> he made 22 appearances and finished <b>the</b> year <b>with</b> 15 goals and 5 assists.|$|R
25|$|The {{lower leg}} should remain still when sitting the canter. If it moves, the rider is tense, or {{gripping}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> thigh. <b>The</b> <b>heel</b> will sink down slightly and the knee angle may open <b>with</b> <b>the</b> footfalls, absorbing {{the shock of}} the gait.|$|R
2500|$|The glide step, also {{commonly}} known as the roll step, involves bringing the heel gently to the ground with the toe pointed up, and then rolling forward onto the toes before lifting the foot to continue forward. [...] While marching to the rear, the weight is placed continually on the ball of the foot <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> elevated. This style is used by both marching bands as well as drum and bugle corps. [...] The style, in comparison to high step, gives drill formations a more fluid appearance, allowing for better control of more difficult formations and various styles of music. With this control also comes the ability to perform a much broader range of tempos. Proper execution of a roll step gives a player marching at 40 beats per minute the same smooth tone as a player marching at 180. The roll step allows for much better control of the upper body, and thus better control of the air support needed for playing.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{tomato ketchup}} has an additive, usually xanthan gum, {{which gives the}} {{condiment}} a pseudoplastic or [...] "shear thinning" [...] property - more commonly known as thixotropic. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added—usually 0.5%—which can {{make it difficult to}} pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup it will lower the viscosity enabling the sauce to flow. A common method to getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> of the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. A technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.|$|E
2500|$|Hand {{planes are}} ancient, {{originating}} {{thousands of years}} ago. Early planes were made from wood with a rectangular slot or mortise cut across {{the center of the}} body. The cutting blade or iron was held in place with a wooden wedge. The wedge was tapped into the mortise and adjusted with a small mallet, a piece of scrap wood or <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> of the user's hand. Planes of this type have been found in excavations of old sites as well as drawings of woodworking from medieval Europe and Asia. The earliest known examples of the woodworking plane have been found in Pompeii although other Roman examples have been unearthed in Britain and Germany. The Roman planes resemble modern planes in essential function, most having iron wrapping a wooden core top, bottom, front and rear and an iron blade secured with a wedge. [...] One example found in Cologne has a body made entirely of bronze without a wooden core. [...] A Roman plane iron used for cutting moldings was found in Newstead, England. Histories prior to these examples are not clear although furniture pieces and other woodwork found in Egyptian tombs show surfaces carefully smoothed with some manner of cutting edge or scraping tool. [...] There are suggestions that the earliest planes were simply wooden blocks fastened to the soles of adzes to effect greater control of the cutting action.|$|E

50|$|To sit in seiza {{requires}} {{coming to}} a kneeling position momentarily, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> propped up; if one remains seated on <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> balls of the feet touching the floor and toes flexed forward, it is called kiza (跪座 / 跪坐). If one then lowers {{the tops of the}} feet to the floor, one then will be in the seiza position. In some schools of iaido, practitioners stand up to draw the sword and cut after momentarily assuming kiza, so as not to sprain the instep jumping up directly from seiza.|$|R
