To allow for {{the extension of the}} line south from Times Square, the entire western wall of the subway between 43rd Street and 44th Street was removed, all while service continued uninterrupted. The line was mostly built in an open-cut, excluding the segments <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> Battery Park, the widened portions of Varick Street, and the new Varick and Seventh Avenue Extensions. Filled in ground was found south of Varick Street along Greenwich Street, which approximately marked the old shore line of the Hudson River {{during the time of the}} American Revolution. Many buildings had to be underpinned during the construction of the line, especially those on the lower sections through Greenwich Street.|$|E

5|$|Management of {{low back}} pain depends on which of the three general {{categories}} is the cause: mechanical problems, non-mechanical problems, or referred pain. For acute pain that is causing only mild to moderate problems, the goals are to restore normal function, return the individual to work, and minimize pain. The condition is normally not serious, resolves without much being done, and recovery is helped by attempting to return to normal activities {{as soon as possible}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> pain. Providing individuals with coping skills through reassurance of these facts is useful in speeding recovery. For those with sub-chronic or chronic {{low back pain}}, multidisciplinary treatment programs may help. Initial management with non–medication based treatments is recommended, with NSAIDs used if these are not sufficiently effective.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by Swedish mycologist and botanist Elias Magnus Fries as Agaricus gemmatus in 1838. It {{was transferred to}} the genus Amanita in 1866 by the French statistician Louis Bertillon. The species has been transferred to several genera in its history, resulting in a number of synonyms, including Amanita muscaria var. gemmata (1886, Lucien Quélet), Amanitopsis gemmata (1887, Pier Andrea Saccardo), Amanitaria gemmata (1940, Jean-Edouard Gilbert), and Venenarius gemmatus (1948, William Murrill). Amanita authority Rodham E. Tulloss considers A.amici (published by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1891) to be synonymous with A.gemmata, as the macroscopic characteristics of the former fall <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the range expected for the latter.|$|E
5|$|The old Jewish Quarter (Mellah) is {{situated}} in the kasbah area of the city's medina, east of Place des Ferblantiers. It was created in 1558 by the Saadians at {{the site where the}} sultan's stables were previously located. At the time, the Jewish community consisted of {{a large portion of the}} city's bankers, jewelers, metalworkers, tailors and sugar traders. During the 16th century, the Mellah had its own fountains, gardens, synagogues and souks. Until the arrival of the French in 1912, Jews could not own property outside of the Mellah; all growth was consequently contained <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> the neighborhood, resulting in narrow streets, small shops and higher residential buildings. The Mellah, today reconfigured as a mainly residential zone renamed Hay Essalam, currently occupies an area smaller than its historic limits and has an almost entirely Muslim population. The Alzama Synagogue, built around a central courtyard, is located in the Mellah. The Jewish cemetery here is the largest of its kind in Morocco. Characterized by white-washed tombs and sandy graves, the cemetery is located within the Medina on land adjacent to the Mellah.|$|E
