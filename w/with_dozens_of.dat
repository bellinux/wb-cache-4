5|$|By {{the winter}} of 1894–1895, {{the last of the}} four s had been commissioned; these ships were {{assigned}} to the I Division, which displaced Baden and her three sisters to the II Division.

5|$|Nicole and its {{precursor}} disturbance brought great rainfall {{to much of}} Jamaica over {{a period}} of several days. A maximum of 37.42inches (940mm) was recorded in Belleisle, Westmoreland Parish, from September26 to 30; most other parishes received more than 12in (300mm) during the same period. With a return period of 30years, these quantities tripled the monthly rainfall average for September at several locations. Though the broad-scale wind regime over the island remained gentle, the storm's intense convective bands produced three microburstssmall downdrafts of intense winds. <b>With</b> <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> river banks and waterways blocked, the worst effects were due to landslides and particularly severe flooding across numerous communities primarily in southern parishes.|$|E

5|$|By 1846 Honoré de Balzac had {{achieved}} tremendous fame as a writer, but his finances and health were deteriorating rapidly. After writing {{a series of}} potboiler novels in the 1820s, he published his first book under his own name, Les Chouans ("The Chouans"), in 1829. He followed this <b>with</b> <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> well-received novels and stories, including La Peau de chagrin ("The Magic Skin"), in 1831, Le Père Goriot ("Father Goriot") in 1835, and the two-volume Illusions perdues ("Lost Illusions"), in 1837 and 1839. Because of his lavish lifestyle and penchant for financial speculation, however, {{he spent most of}} his life trying to repay a variety of debts. He wrote tirelessly, driven as much by economic necessity as by the muse and black coffee. This regimen of constant work exhausted his body and brought reprimands from his doctor.|$|E
5|$|Forming an {{alliance}} with Ptolemy, Antigonus, and Lysimachus, Cassander had his officer Nicanor capture the Munichia fortress of Athens' port town Piraeus in defiance of Polyperchon's decree that Greek cities should be free of Macedonian garrisons, sparking the Second War of the Diadochi (319–315 BC). Given a string of military failures by Polyperchon, in 317 BC Philip III, by way of his politically-engaged wife Eurydice II of Macedon, officially replaced him as regent with Cassander. Afterwards Polyperchon desperately sought the aid of Olympias, mother of Alexander III who still resided in Epirus. A joint force of Epirotes, Aetolians, and Polyperchon's troops invaded Macedonia and forced the surrender of Philip III and Eurydice's army, allowing Olympias to execute the king and force his queen to commit suicide. Olympias then had Nicanor killed along <b>with</b> <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> leading Macedonian nobles, yet {{by the spring of}} 316 BC Cassander defeated her forces, captured her, and placed her on trial for murder before sentencing her to death.|$|E

5|$|Legends {{describing}} Cofresí as malevolent generally link him to supernatural elements {{acquired through}} witchcraft, mysticism or {{a deal with}} the Devil. This horror fiction emphasizes his ruthlessness while alive or his unwillingness to remain dead. Cofresí's ghost has a fiery aura or extraordinary powers of manifestation, defending the locations of his hidden treasure or roaming aimlessly. Cofresí has been vilified by merchants. Legends portraying him as benign figure are more prevalent near Cabo Rojo; in other areas of Puerto Rico, they focus on his treasure and depict him as a cutthroat. Most of the hidden-treasure stories have a moral counseling against greed; those trying to find the plunder are killed, dragged to Davy Jones' Locker or attacked by the ghost of Cofresí or a member of his crew. Rumors about the locations of hidden treasure flourish, <b>with</b> <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> coves, beaches and buildings linked to pirates in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|Run privately for profit, as {{were all}} English prisons until the 19th century, the Marshalsea {{looked like an}} Oxbridge college and functioned as an {{extortion}} racket. Debtors in the 18th century who could afford the prison fees had access to a bar, shop and restaurant, and retained the crucial privilege of being allowed out during the day, which gave {{them a chance to}} earn money for their creditors. Everyone else was crammed into one of nine small rooms <b>with</b> <b>dozens</b> <b>of</b> others, possibly for years for the most modest of debts, which increased as unpaid prison fees accumulated. The poorest faced starvation and, if they crossed the jailers, torture with skullcaps and thumbscrews.
