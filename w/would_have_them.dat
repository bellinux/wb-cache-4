5|$|With Romanos I {{approaching}} {{the end of}} his life, the matter of his succession became urgent. In 943, Romanos drafted a will which would leave Constantine VII as the senior emperor following his death. This greatly upset his two sons, who feared that their brother-in-law <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> deposed and force them to take monastic vows. Motivated, in the opinion of Steven Runciman, partially by self-preservation and partially from genuine ambition, they started planning to seize power through a coup d'état, with Stephen apparently the ringleader and Constantine a rather reluctant partner.|$|E
5|$|The two armies met at Alton where peace {{negotiations}} began, possibly initiated by either Henry or Robert, and probably supported by Flambard. The brothers then {{agreed to the}} Treaty of Alton, under which Robert released Henry from his oath of homage and recognised him as king; Henry renounced his claims on western Normandy, except for Domfront, and agreed to pay Robert £2,000 a year for life; if either brother died without a male heir, the other would inherit his lands; the barons whose lands had been seized by either the King or the Duke for supporting his rival <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> returned, and Flambard would be reinstated as bishop; the two brothers would campaign together to defend their territories in Normandy. Robert remained in England {{for a few months}} more with Henry before returning to Normandy.|$|E

25|$|Forces may operate {{surveillance}} cars. These cars can {{be marked}} or unmarked, {{and are there}} to gather evidence of any criminal offence. Overt marked cars may have CCTV cameras mounted on the roof to discourage wrongdoing, whereas unmarked cars <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> hidden inside. This type of vehicle is particularly common in the United Kingdom. In the United States, some police departments' vice, narcotics, and gang suppression units utilize vehicles that contain no identifiable police equipment (such as lights, sirens or radios) to conduct covert surveillance.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, More Fun Comics #101 {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} Superboy, establishing that Superman began his superhero career as a child. This issue showed Krypton in much greater detail than before, as a scientifically advanced world. Kryptonians {{did not appear to}} possess superhuman powers on Krypton but were aware that a Kryptonian on Earth <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>them.</b> In this story, Superman's biological parents were named Jor-El and Lara. Jor-El attempted to convince the Supreme Council that their world was doomed and that they must take action. The Council scoffed at Jor-El's warnings, so he returned home to save his family, if nobody else. But Jor-El was only able to save his son.|$|E
25|$|In 1939 Willis L. Teeter—who {{also worked}} for A, at its Mooresville, North Carolina store—and his brother Paul, who was also working for A {{borrowed}} $1,700 to open Teeter's Food Mart on Main Street in Mooresville, North Carolina. A was closing their doors and agreed to lease the location to the Teeter brothers. The first Teeter Food Mart opened on July 15, 1939. Teeter's was a family-run operation as Teeter was the manager, Paul (Bill), his brother was the produce manager and Teeter's wife, Sylvia, also worked at the store. Paul's wife, Mildred, also joined the staff as bookkeeper as the Teeter stores expanded. The Teeter brothers believed in exceptional customer service, even having home delivery service. Because of their foresight of providing great customer service and only the best products, they saw sales rise quickly. Teeter based all he would do on the Golden Rule—treat others as you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> treat you.|$|E

25|$|Sex Trafficking/San Antonio: On June 1, 2007, a San Antonio {{woman and}} her two daughters were ordered {{detained}} without bond for engaging in sex trafficking of children. The woman, age 59, and her daughters, ages 32 and 29, were {{arrested and charged with}} sex trafficking of children by force, fraud or coercion. Based on the ongoing investigation and the victims’ statements, it is alleged that the defendants traveled to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, to recruit young girls to work as prostitutes in the San Antonio area. The victims in this case were 15, 17, and 22 years old. After arriving in the United States, the victims were told they would have to work as prostitutes for five years to repay the money the defendants had spent. Allegedly the money was spent on smuggling and other expenses they incurred to prepare the young women to be prostitutes. The victims told ICE agents that they were scared to leave because a male associate of the Ochoa’s had threatened them with a gun; he also stated that he could find them and their families back in Mexico, and he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> killed. The female violators in this case received sentences of time served to 18 months in prison for their convictions for harboring and transporting aliens for financial gain. One of the male defendants was sentenced to 120 months in prison for conspiracy to transport aliens for financial gain and for aiding and abetting sex trafficking of a child. One remaining defendant is scheduled for jury trial in February 2009.|$|E

500|$|LaVey {{rejects the}} idea of prayer, instead urging Satanists {{to take action to}} fix a {{situation}} instead of asking for a solution. The seven deadly sins are advocated, on the basis that they all lead to personal pleasure. He says that Satanism is a form of [...] "controlled selfishness", in the sense that doing something to help another will in turn make one happy. The Golden Rule is again mentioned, and LaVey suggests altering it from [...] "Do unto others as you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> do unto you" [...] to [...] "Do unto others as they do unto you" [...] so that if someone is treated poorly, he or she can respond viciously. The Book of Lucifer also contains a list of [...] "The Four Crown Princes of Hell" [...] (Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathan) and of seventy-seven [...] "Infernal Names", representations of Satan from various cultures and religions. They are the names that, according to LaVey, are most useful in Satanic rituals.|$|E

[...] A few days later, Phips began making preparations but was detained by problems with the Boston government and the ongoing search for victuals. [...] In a discussion with Phips, Knepp allows, as a purser, that many of the crew owe him money, and says that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> thrown into jail except that it would hinder His Majesties treasure hunt. Phips finally sailed clear of the Boston Harbor on January 19, 1684 but unfortunately not before some of his rogue-ish crew could cause a small riot in Boston and perpetrate a despicable assault in Hull, according to Knepp. [...] Knepp was not on board, meaning he had effectively deserted according to the Articles, [...] "though I should be almost undone by it" [...] and so it became all the more important for Knepp to show Phips in a bad light.|$|E
500|$|Joseph P. Kennedy {{had been}} a patron of Le Pavillon, but after Decré and Meyzen opened their new restaurant, Kennedy {{switched}} his patronage to La Caravelle, dining there regularly when in New York. [...] It became a popular place for the Kennedy family to visit. Fessaguet chose and trained René Verdon to be chef at the White House when John F. Kennedy was elected president the year after opening. Verdon spent some weeks working with Fessaquet on the Kennedy family's favorite dishes. President Kennedy was especially fond of La Caravelles vichyssoise and chicken in champagne sauce. [...] He often requested them as [...] "take out" [...] orders and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> heated up on the plane as he traveled. Decré and Meyzen renamed the dish on their menu; Poularde Maison Blanch then became [...] "White House Chicken". In 1964, the Kennedys held a family reunion at La Caravelle; one of the subjects of discussion at the reunion {{was said to be}} whether Robert F. Kennedy should ask to be nominated as vice president at the upcoming 1964 Democratic National Convention. Joseph P. Kennedy was in attendance and walked into the restaurant {{with the aid of a}} cane.|$|E
500|$|The first {{message to}} reach Bonaparte {{regarding}} the disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 August at his {{camp on the}} road between Salahieh and Cairo. The messenger was a staff officer sent by the Governor of Alexandria General Jean Baptiste Kléber, and the report had been hastily written by Admiral Ganteaume, who had subsequently rejoined Villeneuve's ships at sea. One account reports {{that when he was}} handed the message, Bonaparte read it without emotion before calling the messenger to him and demanding further details. When the messenger had finished, the French general reportedly announced [...] "Nous n'avons plus de flotte: eh bien. Il faut rester en ces contrées, ou en sortir grands comme les anciens" [...] ("We no longer have a fleet: well, we must either remain in this country or quit it as great as the ancients"). Another story, as told by the general's secretary, Bourienne, claims that Bonaparte was almost overcome by the news and exclaimed [...] "Unfortunate Brueys, what have you done!" [...] Bonaparte later placed much of the blame for the defeat on the wounded Admiral Blanquet, falsely accusing him of surrendering Franklin while his ship was undamaged. Protestations from Ganteaume and Minister Étienne Eustache Bruix later reduced the degree of criticism Blanquet faced, but he never again served in a command capacity. Bonaparte's most immediate concern however was with his own officers, who began to question the wisdom of the entire expedition. Inviting his most senior officers to dinner, Bonaparte asked them how they were. When they replied that they were [...] "marvellous," [...] Bonaparte responded that it was just as well, since he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>them</b> shot if they continued [...] "fostering mutinies and preaching revolt." [...] To quell any uprising among the native inhabitants, Egyptians overheard discussing the battle were threatened with having their tongues cut out.|$|E

2500|$|On May 15, the Convention {{declared}} {{that the government of}} Virginia as “formerly exercised" [...] by King George in Parliament was “totally dissolved” in light of the King’s repeated injuries and his “abandoning the helm of government and declaring us out of his allegiance and protection”.

[...] Virginia's congressional delegation was thus the only one under unconditional positive instructions to declare independence; Virginia was already independent of Parliament as the [...] "fourth realm" [...] of British Empire, but its convention did not want their state, in the words of Benjamin Franklin, to [...] "hang separately." [...] According to James Madison's correspondence for that day, Williamsburg residents marked the occasion by taking down the Union Jack from over the colonial capitol and running up a continental union flag, keeping the Union Jack of the British Empire in the canton and adding the thirteen red and white stripes of the self-governing British East India Company.|$|E

[...] The Charter's founder, Karen Armstrong, quotes the ancient Rabbi Hillel who suggested that `the rest is commentary'.

2500|$|In 1688, {{five years}} after its founding, Germantown became {{the birthplace of the}} anti-slavery {{movement}} in America.
