5|$|Kepler {{began by}} {{exploring}} regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures {{that would come}} to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the <b>work</b> (<b>Book</b> V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} mainly {{intended}} {{to find out}} the extent to which tasks in English <b>work</b> <b>books</b> are designed to develop the students’ communicative competence. The objective {{of this study is to}} describe how the tasks in Edukatif <b>work</b> <b>books</b> are designed to develop students’ discourse competence, linguistic competence, actional competence, sociolinguistic competence, and strategic competence. This study is a qualitative research which involves content analysis approach. The data are the tasks in Edukatif <b>work</b> <b>books</b> used by eight grade students of the first and second semester. In collecting the data, the writer uses documentation method. The data analysis used Huberman and Miles’ concept which involves data reduction, data display and verification. The findings show that among the five competences and its components of communicative com- petence, some components are not well developed in the <b>work</b> <b>books.</b> The tasks develop all components of discourse competence except one aspect in linguistic competence, that is, phonology. The tasks develop all components of actional competence except the speech act. The tasks develop components of sociolinguistic competence except the cultural and non-verbal communicative factor. The tasks develop only one component of strategic competence, that is, time gaining strategy. The conclusion is that the tasks in Edukatif <b>work</b> <b>books</b> are sufficient to develop the students’ discourse, linguistic, and actional competence. The tasks, however, are not sufficient to develop students’ sociolinguistic and strategic competence...|$|R
