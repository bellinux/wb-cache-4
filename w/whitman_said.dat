Other {{aspects of}} the album, though, were seen in a more negative light. musicOMH said songs like [...] "Wash Me Clean" [...] "simply lack a strong enough melody", while the BBC wrote that Fanning [...] "might have {{to be happy with}} 'straight in at 101,' in the UK" [...] despite topping the ARIA Albums Chart. The Age concluded its review by calling Tea & Sympathy [...] "a low-key but worthy personal offering".|$|E
500|$|Booth {{embarked}} {{on his first}} national tour as a leading actor after finishing the 1859–1860 theatre season in Richmond, Virginia. He engaged Philadelphia attorney Matthew Canning to serve as his agent. By mid-1860, he was playing in such cities as New York, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, Columbus, Georgia, Montgomery, Alabama, and New Orleans. Poet and journalist Walt <b>Whitman</b> <b>said</b> of Booth's acting, [...] "He would have flashes, passages, I thought of real genius." [...] The Philadelphia Press drama critic said, [...] "Without having [...] Edwin's culture and grace, Mr. Booth has far more action, more life, and, we are inclined to think, more natural genius." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{attorney}} general, Brown {{represented the}} state in fighting death penalty appeals and stated that he would follow the law, regardless of his personal beliefs against capital punishment. Capital punishment by lethal injection was halted in California by federal judge Jeremy D. Fogel until new facilities and procedures were put into place. Brown moved to resume capital punishment in 2010 with the execution of Albert Greenwood Brown after the lifting of a statewide moratorium by a California court. Brown's Democratic campaign, which pledged to [...] "enforce the laws" [...] of California, denied any connection between the case and the gubernatorial election. Prosecutor Rod Pacheco, who supported Republican opponent Meg <b>Whitman,</b> <b>said</b> {{that it would be}} unfair to accuse Jerry Brown of using the execution for political gain as they never discussed the case.|$|E

The drive passes by the Central Park Zoo around 63rd Street and the Metropolitan Museum of Art around the 80th to 84th Street area. The drive is also one of the legs of the New York Marathon. It is known as the [...] "Elite Carriage Parade", because at the time of the park's opening, only 5 percent of the city was able to afford the carriage; of this, Walt <b>Whitman</b> <b>said</b> that the carriage parade was [...] "an impressive, rich, interminable circus on a grand scale, full of action and color." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whitman {{appeared}} {{twice in}} New York City after the September 11 attacks to inform New Yorkers that the toxins {{released by the}} attacks posed no threat to their health. On September 18, the EPA released a report in which <b>Whitman</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Given {{the scope of the}} tragedy from last week, I am glad to reassure the people of New York and Washington, D.C. that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink." [...] She also said, [...] "The concentrations are such that they don't pose a health hazard...We're going to make sure everybody is safe." [...] A 2003 report by the EPA's Inspector General determined that the assurance was misleading, because the EPA [...] "did not have sufficient data and analyses" [...] to justify it.|$|E

50|$|Kosmos {{influenced}} several American authors, including Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson read Humboldt's work {{throughout his}} life, and for him, Kosmos capped Humboldt's {{role as a}} scientific revolutionary. Edgar Allan Poe was also an admirer of Humboldt, even dedicating his last major work, Eureka: A Prose Poem, to Humboldt. Humboldt's attempt to unify the sciences was a major inspiration for Poe's work. Walt <b>Whitman</b> was <b>said</b> to have kept a copy of Kosmos on his desk for inspiration as he wrote Leaves of Grass, and Henry David Thoreau's Walden, like Eureka, {{was a response to}} Humboldt's ideas.|$|R
50|$|All of the Pentagon's entrances were secured {{after the}} attack except the one leading from the Metro. All were reopened {{according}} to Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman.

5000|$|James Q. <b>Whitman</b> <b>said</b> {{that in its}} day-to-day {{operations}} the NRA only had limited resemblance to fascist corporatism. American corporatism was of an indigenous nature that traced back to nineteenth century German theorists of corporatism. It was also built on America's World War I experience, which used corporatism to manage the economy. European corporatism was an ideology of political economy, built on conflicts between labor and capital. It appealed to [...] "thuggish anti-parliamentarians who were the fascists." [...] America's corporatism was only an economic ideology. Americans viewed Congress as a [...] "place full of incompetents, not rogues." [...] <b>Whitman</b> <b>said</b> {{that there were two}} main differences between the NRA's corporatism and European fascism. One was that in America class warfare never reached the level of intensity that it did in Europe. The other reason was that unlike Italy and Germany, America had a long tradition of representative government.|$|E
5000|$|After graduating with {{a degree}} in journalism from Boston University in 1935, Whitman struck out on what he called his “hobo adventures,” train-hopping, hitchhiking, and walking on foot through the U.S., Mexico, and Central America. It was the middle of the Great Depression, but {{wherever}} he went, <b>Whitman</b> <b>said</b> he was met with kindness and generosity. This experience would form the founding ethos of his bookstore: “Give what you can; take what you need.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{academics}} and biographers believe that Hughes was homosexual and included homosexual codes {{in many of}} his poems, as did Walt <b>Whitman,</b> whom Hughes <b>said</b> influenced his poetry. Hughes's story [...] "Blessed Assurance" [...] deals with a father's anger over his son's effeminacy and [...] "queerness". The biographer Aldrich argues that, in order to retain the respect and support of black churches and organizations and avoid exacerbating his precarious financial situation, Hughes remained closeted.|$|R
5000|$|He had {{a change}} of pace when he {{replaced}} Stephen Boyd as Boaz in a Biblical drama, The Story of Ruth (1960). He followed this with a gangster tale, Murder, Inc. (1960). [...] "I've done lots of different parts since I left Hollywood High School and City College", <b>said</b> <b>Whitman</b> in a 1960 interview, [...] "so the sudden switch didn't bother me too much. I hope 20th Century Fox will keep the roles varied and interesting." ...|$|R
2500|$|Her {{early work}} {{was devoted to}} family and romance. After her {{marriage}} to Menken and her study of Judaism, her poetry and essays for years into the 1860s featured Jewish themes. After her marriage and divorce from Heenan and meeting with writers in New York, she changed her style, adopting some influence from Walt <b>Whitman.</b> She was <b>said</b> to be the [...] "first poet and the only woman poet before the twentieth century" [...] to follow his lead in using free verse. However, the New York Times reported the Walt Whitman had disassociated himself from Menken's work, implying he thought little of it.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Whitman</b> <b>said</b> that Arizona's {{approach}} to illegal immigration with Arizona SB 1070 {{is wrong and}} that there are better ways to solve the problem. She said that, if she had lived in California in 1994, she would have voted against Proposition 187 concerning illegal immigrants. In an op-ed during her gubernatorial campaign, Whitman wrote, [...] "Clearly, when examining our positions on immigration, there is very little over which Jerry Brown and I disagree".|$|E
50|$|She {{attended}} the Hockaday School, an all-girl {{boarding school in}} Dallas, from 1952 to 1960. Former Hockaday Headmistress Jeanne <b>Whitman</b> <b>said</b> that Hill’s “tenure at Hockaday was marked by early acumen in mathematics and polite distaste for the classroom.” She entered Stanford University in 1960, but soon left to attend Hollins University, a small liberal arts college for women in Virginia. She {{earned a degree in}} mathematics from Hollins in 1964 and received its Outstanding Alumnae Award in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|She {{stated that}} illegal {{immigrant}} {{students should be}} prohibited from attending state-funded institutions of higher education. [...] Currently, California state law permits this. In 2009, Whitman called for [...] "a path to legalization" [...] of illegal immigrants. In a 2010 interview on television station KTLA, <b>Whitman</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I want to hold employers accountable for hiring only documented workers." [...] Meg Whitman came under fire for hiring an illegal immigrant herself (see [...] "Housekeeper Controversy" [...] above).|$|E
5000|$|The {{first edition}} was very small, {{collecting}} only twelve unnamed poems in 95 pages. <b>Whitman</b> once <b>said</b> he intended {{the book to}} be small enough to be carried in a pocket. [...] "That would tend to induce people to take me along with them and read me in the open air: I am nearly always successful with the reader in the open air", he explained. About 800 were printed, though only 200 were bound in its trademark green cloth cover. The only American library known to have purchased {{a copy of the}} first edition was in Philadelphia. The poems of the first edition, which were given titles in later issues, were [...] "Song of Myself", [...] "A Song for Occupations", [...] "To Think of Time", [...] "The Sleepers", [...] "I Sing the Body Electric", [...] "Faces", [...] "Song of the Answerer", [...] "Europe: The 72d and 73d Years of These States", [...] "A Boston Ballad", [...] "There Was a Child Went Forth", [...] "Who Learns My Lesson Complete?", and [...] "Great Are the Myths".|$|R
5000|$|He {{changed his}} mind when offered the role of US Marshal Jim Crown in Cimarron Strip (1967). At $350,000-$400,000 per episode, {{it was the most}} {{expensive}} drama series made til that time. [...] "A lot of big people told me I was the number one man the networks wanted," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Whitman.</b> The series was produced by Whitman's own company. [...] "I always wanted to play a cop with a heart, a guy who would use every possible means not to kill a man," [...] he said. [...] "TV has needed a superhero... and I think Crown can be the guy." [...] However, the series only lasted one season.|$|R
5000|$|The RLC was {{inactive}} {{for several}} years after 2003, but was revived after the 2006 midterm elections by Whitman, former Missouri Senator John Danforth and former Maryland Lieutenant Governor Michael Steele. <b>Whitman</b> <b>said</b> that the Republicans' loss of control of Congress signaled a need for the party to return to its [...] "fiscally conservative roots" [...] and to be [...] "less judgmental." [...] In March 2007, Whitman's political action committee, [...] "It's My Party, Too" [...] (IMP-PAC), was merged into RLC-PAC.|$|E
