40|$|A growing {{stream of}} {{research}} is investigating how choices people make for themselves are different from choices people make for others. In this paper, I propose that these choices vary according to regulatory focus, such that people <b>who</b> <b>make</b> choices for themselves are prevention focused, whereas people <b>who</b> <b>make</b> choices for others are promotion focused. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, in particular work on errors of omission and commission, I hypothesize that people <b>who</b> <b>make</b> choices for others experience {{a reversal of the}} choice overload effect. In 6 studies, including a field study, I found that people <b>who</b> <b>make</b> choices for themselves are less satisfied after selecting among many options compared to few options, yet, people <b>who</b> <b>make</b> choices for others are more satisfied after selecting among many options compared to few options. Implications and suggestions for other differences in self–other decision making are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In both {{organizational}} and social arenas, people {{make decisions for}} themselves and for other people. But research in decision making has provided little input into how these decisions are psychologically different. In this paper, I propose that decisions- depending on whether people are deciding for themselves or others-vary according to regulatory focus, such that, people <b>who</b> <b>make</b> decisions for themselves are in a prevention focus, whereas people <b>who</b> <b>make</b> decisions for others are in a promotion focus. Drawing on regulatory focus, in particular work on errors of omission and commission, I hypothesize that people <b>who</b> <b>make</b> decisions for others experience {{a reversal of the}} choice overload effect. In seven studies, including a field study and a mini meta-analysis, I found that people <b>who</b> <b>make</b> decisions for themselves are less satisfied after selecting among many compared to few options, yet, people <b>who</b> <b>make</b> decisions for others are more satisfied after selecting among many compared to few options.

5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> the Joker {{feel better about}} himself, and who can do the work {{that he does not}} want to do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E
