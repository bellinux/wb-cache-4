40|$|Editor: We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the article by Fukunaga et al 1 entitled “Thermodilution-derived coronary blood flow pattern immediately after coronary intervention {{as a predictor of}} microcirculatory damage and midterm clinical outcomes in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction. ” We congratulate the authors for this interesting approach to assess myocardial damage during ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction and would appreciate very much their views on several methodological aspects that seem to us of key importance for the correct interpretation of their results. First, the variability of thermodilu-tion data refers to inter- and intra-observer classification of the obtained waveform patterns, not to variability between separate thermodilution. Experienced operators in this technique will acknowledge changes in waveform morphology intrinsically related to handmade injections. Thus, information on pattern reproducibility across several different measurements is key before clinical consideration of this index. Second, although the wide unimodal and bimodal patterns showed high mean transit time values (indicating lower myocardial flow), 2 the mean transit time of these 2 patterns was not reported. This raises a major clinical question: were the worse MRI findings and the higher rate of major adverse cardiac events truly related to the bimodal pattern or, alterna-tively, to a lower myocardial flow reflected in longer mean transit time? Importantly, compared with the wide unimodal group, the bimodal pattern exhibited higher index of microcirculatory resistance values (65 ± 41 and 76 ± 38 U; P=NS). Although statistical significance was not reached, the authors reported Bonferroni-adjusted significance level for post hoc corrections, which is known to overcorrect for type I error. 3 We <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>if</b> the authors provide both the adjusted and unadjusted P values stated in figures as NS, because statistical trends are of utmost importance for future study designs. In addition to the reply of the authors, we think that larger studies, addressing the above-mentioned issues, are required to accurately assess the potential value of the bimodal pattern over that of IMR estimation...|$|E

40|$|As {{the price}} of {{computing}} devices drops, the number of machines managed by an in-dividual PC user has been increased. In many cases, a user with multiple computers wants to use an exact desktop environment across machines. For personal data replica-tion, there are several tools like DropBox, Live Mesh and Tonido. However, these tools can not provide software environment replication. Without a tool to replicate software environment, users have to manage each device's desktop environment separately which is hassling and dicult task to do manually. In this work, we explore the solution to help modern day PC users to perceive the consistent view of not only personal data but also a whole desktop environment. Our approach automatically replicates modications made on the desktop environment of one machine to other devices using dierent replication policies for dierent network properties. Moreover, users can switch machines instantly and still see the exact environment. ii Acknowledgements First and foremost, I <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>appreciate</b> to Professor David Lie for his patient men...|$|R

40|$|The {{ethics of}} boxing EDITOR,—I {{read the article}} on sport {{medicine}} and the ethics of boxing 1 with disappointment this month. It rehearsed arguments that are already familiar to sports physicians faced with diYcult decisions about how to approach box-ing, without taking things further on. In addition, there are medical, social, and ethical points that are not fully addressed in the article. Medically, epidemiological studies have established {{that there are a}} number of popu-lar sports in which the injury and mortality statistics are greater than in boxing. A ban or boycott in rugby, equestrianism, or formula one car racing has not been contemplated by the medical profession. Socially, the background of most doctors ensures that, unlike some other high risk sports, the cultural significance of boxing in some parts of our society is extremely poorly understood. Boxing represents a relatively safe and desirable alternative to other possi-ble activities for some young people, and it is often the continuation of a family heritage. Ethically, one cannot separate the desire of boxers to succeed from the financial and social encouragement that is widely oVered to those at the top level by people with money and influence. These individuals, and not the boxers, are the ones who should be targeted by those who want to change the status quo. Personally, the boxers with whom I have been privileged to work have been among the most honest, friendly, and unassuming of the athletes I have encountered. They have a strong tradition of self discipline and decency that puts some other sports, and sometimes the politics of their own sport, to shame. I do not believe that any sports physician can approach boxing feeling totally at ease with the ethics of their position, but a practi-cal, sensitive, and informed debate is what I, for one, <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>appreciate...</b>|$|R
40|$|Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the role of midwife in {{education}} about the prevention of breast cancer, which is necessary. This thesis is focused on all types of prevention, from primary to quaternary. The greatest emphasis is placed on primary and secondary prevention. Primary prevention mainly consists of the healthy lifestyle, elimination of risk factors, posibility of genetic testing and chemoprevention for high-risk women, etc. Secondary prevention is focused on the search for women with a risk of developing breast cancer. The best known methods are mammographic screening, ultrasound examination or breast self-examination. The objective of mentioned options is to detect the cancer disease in the stage, when is possible the most effective treatment with the greatest chance of a complete healing. The task of the midwife is {{on the basis of their}} knowledge to educate women about the disease itself, but also about preventive options. Midwife has to follow the principles of proper management during this education. The most important thing is to established friendly and trustful relationship in a peaceful environment. The essential task of the midwife is to motivate a "woman" to be really interested in her health condition and convince her to not underestimate prevention of this disease. The objective of this thesis was to investigate how women evaluate the education from midwife about the prevention of breast cancer. The research was conducted on the basis of a qualitative survey using techniques of interviews. The examined group was based on 8 women in age from 18 to 70 years. All the interviews were made anonymously with the preservation of their privacy. With the agreement of respondents were all interviews recorded on tape, transcribed and subsequently analyzed by the method of "pencil paper". The results were processed into three main categories, which were further divided into subcategories. The first question of research was adressed to how are women educated about the prevention of breast cancer. None of the respondents has never been educated from midwife, like the main source of information were described doctors or internet. The second question of research examined which information are received by women from midwives. It was found that none of the respondents were never been educated and it means that they never received any information. Most of women <b>would</b> <b>really</b> <b>appreciate</b> the information from midwife, specially about self-examination of the breast. The third question of research was dedicated to the preview of women on the prevention of breast cancer. Each of the respondents has same opinion that prevention is really important. Most of them are trying to follow it, but in fact insufficiently. The results of research revealed that women should be more educated by midwives about preventive possibilities, especially in self-examination of the breast. This examination is performed by most of the respondents, but not always in the right way. The research work shows that women are unsufficiently informed from the side of midwife. For this reason it is necessary to motivate midwives to educate their patients about the prevention of breast cancer. Mentioned information <b>would</b> be <b>really</b> <b>appreciated</b> by respondents, particularly about the self-examination of the breast. Based on the results of this research was created information leaflet for women about self-examination of the breast. These instructions should help them to perform self-examination correctly...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this talk}} is to discuss a {{possibility}} to extend the following controlled surgery exact sequence: Theorem [PQR] (simplified version) Suppose B is a finite dimensional compact metric ANR, and a dimension n ≥ 4 is given. Then there exists a number 0 > 0 which depends on B and n so that for any 0 > > 0 there is δ> 0 with the following property: If p: X → B is UV 1 and X is a closed topological n-manifold {{then there is a}} controlled surgery exact sequence Hn+ 1 (B,L) → S,δ(X, p) → [X,G/TOP] → Hn(B,L). For n ≥ 5, it seems that the above should hold true for reasonably good control maps (e. g. stratified systems of fibrations) p: X → B, if one replaces the homology groupsHi(B,L) with the controlled L-groups Lci (B, p). This may be obvious for experts, but not for me. I will <b>really</b> <b>appreciate</b> it <b>if</b> someone can help me writing down the detailed proof of the controlled surgery exact sequence in this generality.

From June this year, 29 -year-old student Isabelle Jose has been working tirelessly, with support from Caritas Australia and UNDA, to raise awareness about the systematic kidnapping, raping and mutilating of women and girls by local and foreign militias in the DRC. The 2008 multi-award winning documentary, The Greatest Silence: Rape in the Congo, directed by former gang rape victim Lisa F. Jackson, will be screened at the Tannock Hall of Education in Fremantle on Saturday, 3 September 2011. Throughout the movie, Ms Jackson speaks with victims of sexual violence to hear their remarkable stories of survival, {{as well as some}} of the perpetrators of these crimes. Prior to the film’s screening there will be a special video recording from Caritas Australia Africa Program Officer, Lulu Mitshabu, about the organisation’s work in the DRC. Ms Jose, who is hoping to complete a photo journalism project in the DRC next year, says the funds raised will help to mitigate cases of HIV and AIDS in the large African community, and assist with trauma counselling and medical aid for rape victims. Funds raised will also be used to cover the reintegration of child soldiers into a non-violent lifestyle. “I feel that the movie screening will generate more awareness about the atrocities going on in central Africa,” Ms Jose said. “The biggest realisation I’ve had through the fundraising process is that you cannot save the world, but you can help the people who are experiencing this hurt right now. “I’m really hoping to raise the full $ 10, 000 and if anyone would like to contribute funds to the cause, it <b>would</b> be <b>really</b> <b>appreciated.</b> ” Event Details Date: Saturday, 3 September 2011 Location: Tannock Hall of Education – Cnr Croke and Cliff Streets, Fremantle.
