5000|$|In 2006 Bluegrass {{created an}} {{underwater}} saw {{and had it}} patented for its use of hydraulic motors in combination with diamond wire {{to create a new}} sawing platform which was operational underwater. The continuous loop, four wheel drive diamond wire saw reduced cut times by providing greater torque and consistent <b>wire</b> <b>grip.</b> These improvements reduced slippage and subsequent wire breaks.Since then the patented underwater saw has been used domestically and globally on offshore decommissioning jobs including cutting single- and multi-string conductors, pipelines, seabed umbilicals, pilings, mooring chains, wellheads, risers, slot recovery and jacket lets. On platforms this technology can be applied to perform modifications, maintenance upgrades, to remove crane pedestals, compressors and topsides, and for hurricane remediation.Sub-sea saws can be installed by divers while being monitored and powered from a barge or platform, or they can be installed and powered by working class ROVs.The robust characteristics of these four wheel drive bespoke underwater wire saws, combined with remote control functionality, makes them suitable to extreme offshore decommissioning conditions such as the North Sea.|$|R

The {{current study was}} conducted to study the effect of physical or psychological prenatal stress on addictive and anxiety-like behavior of male and female offspring during their adolescence period (postnatal day (PND) 40). Adult female rats were exposed to physical (swimming) or psychological (observing another female rat swimming) stress from day six of gestation for 10 days. Male and female offspring were assayed for anxiety-like behavior, motor and balance function and morphine conditioned place preference using the open field, elevated plus maze (EPM), rotarod and <b>wire</b> <b>grip</b> assay and conditioned place preference. Offspring in both physical and psychological prenatal stress groups demonstrated significant increase in anxiety-like behavior in EPM paradigm, but no alterations were observed in motor and balance function of animals. Offspring in the psychological prenatal stress group had an increased preference for morphine in comparison to control and physical prenatal stress groups. Results of the current study demonstrated that animals exposed to psychological stress during fetal development are at a higher risk of developing addictive behaviors. Further research might elucidate the exact mechanisms involved to provide better preventive and therapeutic interventions...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityA {{number of}} studies have cited immune cell {{infiltration}} as a mechanism for secondary injury following intracerebral hemorrhage. However, the role of monocytes remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that monocytes are a beneficial cell type that help remove extravasated blood and other pathogenic substances that enter brain parenchymal tissue during a hemorrhagic stroke. Using macrophage Fas-induced apoptosis (MAFIA) mice, this study documents a time course of monocyte infiltration into brain tissue. We then systemically knocked down monocytes prior to initiating an intracerebral hemorrhage, and studied the motor and cognitive outcomes relative to a vehicle treated group. The genetic alteration present in MAFIA mice causes the co-expression of green fluorescent protein and a suicide protein, exclusively in monocytes and dendritic cells. We established a time course of monocyte infiltration by counting cells expressing green fluorescent protein in brain parenchymal tissue at four time points after initiating a severe collagenase-induced hemorrhage. We found that at the 48 -hour time point there was a significant increase of immune cells infiltrating the core of the lesion relative to that observed at 6 hours and 24 hours, and non-significant decline at the 7 -day time point. Furthermore, the administration of AP 20187 to MAFIA mice causes the dimerization of the suicide proteins, which initiates Fas-induced apoptosis selectively in cells expressing the suicide protein. By administering 10 uL of AP 20187 per animal for four consecutive days, we were able to knockdown monocytes both systemically and in brain parenchymal tissue following hemorrhage. To investigate the role of monocytes following intracerebral hemorrhage, we compared a monocyte-depleted group of MAFIA mice to a vehicle-treated group. Both groups underwent a collagenase-induced hemorrhage, and then were subjected to <b>wire</b> <b>grip</b> testing and Morris Water Maze. The group of monocyte-depleted MAFIA mice performed worse in <b>wire</b> <b>grip</b> testing (p < 0. 02), {{as well as in the}} Morris Water Maze test (p < 0. 01). Through the course of the 3 - week experiment there was 50 % mortality in the monocyte-depleted group, while no animals died in the vehicle treated group. Both of the functional studies and the mortality data suggest that monocytes play an important role following intracerebral hemorrhage. The infiltration data suggests that monocytes are recruited to parenchymal tissue after 6 and 24 hours following hemorrhage and remain present for at least one week. This time fame offers a large window for therapeutic modulation of monocyte recruitment and/or function. Future studies should focus on identifying monocytes’ mechanisms of action, as well as improving the MAFIA mouse model by controlling for the weight loss and the cause of profound splenomegaly observed in the monocyte-depleted group...|$|R

To investigate if Bax {{plays a role in}} neuronal cell death and functional outcome after TBI, Bax gene disrupted (null) mice and wild-type (WT) controls were subjected to the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI. Motor function in WT and Bax null mice was evaluated using the round beam balance and the <b>wire</b> <b>grip</b> test on days 0 – 5. Spatial memory was assessed using a Morris Water Maze adopted for mice on days 14 – 18 post-injury. For histopathological analysis, animals were sacrificed 24 [*]h and 21 days post-injury. In all three behavioral tests, the sham and TBI-injured Bax null mice performed significantly worse than their WT sham and TBI-injured counterparts. However, Bax null mice exhibited a higher percentage of surviving neurons in the CA 1 and CA 3 regions of hippocampus measured at 21 days post-injury. At 24 [*]h after trauma, Bax null mice had fewer TUNEL positive cells in the CA 1 and dentate regions of hippocampus as compared to WT mice, suggesting that deletion of the Bax gene ameliorates hippocampal cell death after TBI. Sham-operated Bax null mice had significantly greater brain volume as compared to WT mice. Thus, it is possible that Bax deficiency in the transgenic mice produces developmental behavioral effects, perhaps due to Bax's role in regulating cell death during development...|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and Fas receptor induce acute cellular injury, tissue damage, and motor and cognitive deficits after controlled cortical impact (CCI) in mice (Bermpohl et al. 2007); however, the TNF receptors (TNFR) involved are unknown. Using a CCI model and novel mutant mice deficient in TNFR 1 /Fas, TNFR 2 /Fas, or TNFR 1 /TNFR 2 /Fas, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that the combination of TNFR 2 /Fas is protective, whereas TNFR 1 /Fas is detrimental after CCI. Uninjured knockout (KO) mice showed no differences in baseline physiological variables or motor or cognitive function. Following CCI, mice deficient in TNFR 2 /Fas had worse post-injury motor and Morris water maze (MWM) performance than wild-type (WT) mice (p[*]<[*] 0. 05 group effect for <b>wire</b> <b>grip</b> score and MWM performance by repeated measures ANOVA). No differences in motor or cognitive outcome were observed in TNFR 1 /Fas KO, or in TNFR 2 or TNFR 1 single KO mice, versus WT mice. Additionally, no differences in propidium iodide (PI) -positive cells (at 6 [*]h) or lesion size (at 14 days) were observed between WT and TNFR 1 /Fas or TNFR 2 /Fas KO mice. Somewhat surprisingly, mice deficient in TNFR 1 /TNFR 2 /Fas also had PI-positive cells, lesion size, and motor and MWM deficits similar to those of WT mice. These data suggest a protective role for TNFR 2 /Fas in the pathogenesis of TBI. Further studies are needed to determine whether direct or indirect effects of TNFR 1 deletion in TNFR 2 /Fas KO mice mediate improved functional outcome in TNFR 1 /TNFR 2 /Fas KO mice after CCI...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{transcranial}} low-level laser (light) therapy (tLLLT) {{to treat}} stroke and {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) is attracting increasing attention. We previously showed that LLLT using an 810 -nm laser 4 h after controlled cortical impact (CCI) -TBI in mice could significantly improve the neurological severity score, decrease lesion volume, and reduce Fluoro-Jade staining for degenerating neurons. We obtained some evidence for neurogenesis {{in the region of}} the lesion. We now tested the hypothesis that tLLLT can improve performance on the Morris water maze (MWM, learning, and memory) and increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVZ) after CCI-TBI in mice. One and (to a greater extent) three daily laser treatments commencing 4 -h post-TBI improved neurological performance as measured by <b>wire</b> <b>grip</b> and motion test especially at 3 and 4 weeks post-TBI. Improvements in visible and hidden platform latency and probe tests in MWM were seen at 4 weeks. Caspase- 3 expression was lower in the lesion region at 4 days post-TBI. Double-stained BrdU-NeuN (neuroprogenitor cells) was increased in the dentate gyrus and SVZ. Increases in double-cortin (DCX) and TUJ- 1 were also seen. Our study results suggest that tLLLT may improve TBI both by reducing cell death in the lesion and by stimulating neurogenesis. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)

40|$|McArdle disease (glycogenosis type V), {{the most}} common muscle glycogenosis, is a {{recessive}} disorder caused by mutations in PYGM, the gene encoding myophosphorylase. Patients with McArdle disease typically experience exercise intolerance manifested as acute crises of early fatigue and contractures, sometimes with rhabdomyolysis and myoblobinuria, triggered by static muscle contractions or dynamic exercises. Currently, there are no therapies to restore myophosphorylase activity in patients. Although two spontaneous animal models for McArdle disease have been identified (cattle and sheep), they have rendered {{a limited amount of}} information on the pathophysiology of the disorder; therefore, there have been few opportunities for experimental research in the field. We have developed a knock-in mouse model by replacing the wild-type allele of Pygm with a modified allele carrying the common human mutation, p. R 50 X, which is the most frequent cause of McArdle disease. Histochemical, biochemical and molecular analyses of the phenotype, as well as exercise tests, were carried out in homozygotes, carriers and wild-type mice. p. R 50 X/p. R 50 X mice showed undetectable myophosphorylase protein and activity in skeletal muscle. Histochemical and biochemical analyses revealed massive muscle glycogen accumulation in homozygotes, in contrast to heterozygotes or wild-type mice, which did not show glycogen accumulation in this tissue. Additional characterization confirmed a McArdle disease-like phenotype in p. R 50 X/p. R 50 X mice, i. e. they had hyperCKaemia and very poor exercise performance, as assessed in the <b>wire</b> <b>grip</b> and treadmill tests (6 % and 5 % of the wild-type values, respectively).

40|$|Osteopontin (OPN) {{is one of}} {{the most}} highly up-regulated genes in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) {{patients}} and also in the mdx mouse. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SPP 1 gene (OPN gene) are associated with changes in muscle strength and age of loss of ambulation in DMD patients. Previous work in the lab has shown that ablation of OPN in mdx mice significantly ameliorates their dystrophic phenotype by decreasing muscle fibrosis and increasing muscle regeneration and strength in young mice. These changes in the pathology of mdx mice were associated with a decrease in NKT and Gr- 1 + cell populations, and decreased intramuscular TGF-β. In this project, we expanded on these previous observations and further explored the ways in which OPN exerts its regulatory role in the dystrophic pathology. Our current study shows that OPN ablation in mdx mice induces long term benefits on dystrophic muscles. OPN-/-mdx (up to more than one year old) display increased muscle mass and myofiber size, which translates to an improved performance in <b>wire,</b> <b>grip</b> and pulmonary function tests in dystrophic mice. We show here that OPN expression in dystrophic muscle impairs muscle regeneration indirectly, by skewing the macrophage population toward a pro-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic phenotype. OPN ablation in mdx mice leads to reductions in M 1 and M 2 a macrophages and increases in M 2 c. These changes were also associated with increased macrophage expression of pro-regenerative factors, without significantly changing pro-fibrotic factor expression. Moreover, OPN may impact regeneration directly by impairing terminal differentiation of myoblasts. In addition, we showed that OPN may promote muscle fibrosis in dystrophic muscle by directly interacting with fibroblasts and increasing collagen expression. This effect of OPN in fibroblast cultures is likely dependent in cell-type specific post-translational modifications. This study validates OPN as a therapeutic target in DMD and lays a foundation for therapies involving pharmacological targeting of OPN, by providing a mechanistic understanding of OPN’s relationship to the processes of immune response, regeneration and fibrosis in dystrophic muscle...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{applications}} to sensors, actuators, guide <b>wires,</b> special <b>grips</b> for handicapped people, a {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) or shape memory polymer (SMP) are used as working elements that perform cyclic motions. In order to evaluate {{the reliability of the}} shape memory materials (SMM), cycling and fatigue deformation properties are investigated. Since the SMM are very sensitive to temperature, not only mechanical properties but also their related temperature changes accompanying the deformation process should be taken into account. The presented paper embraces experimental investigation of effects of thermomechanical couplings occurring in shape memory alloy and shape memory polymer subjected to various kinds of cycling loading. The deformation was carried out on MTS 858 Testing machine. The strain was measured by a mechanical extensometer, so the stress-strain characteristics were elaborated with high accuracy. Furthermore, a fast and sensitive FLIR Co Phoenix infrared (IR) measurement system was used in order to record infrared radiation from the sample surface. It enables obtaining temperature distribution of the sample {{as a function of the}} deformation parameters. For each strain cycle, an increase in temperature during the loading and the temperature decrease during the unloading processes was observed. It was found that the temperature increment recorded during the cyclic deformation depends on the strain rate, the kind of the material and the test conditions. The higher the strain rate the higher the stress and temperature changes were obtained, since the deformation process was more dynamic and has occurred in almost adiabatic conditions. It was shown that various deformation mechanisms are active during various loading stages...|$|R

A sciatic nerve gap of 15 mm was bridged in 12 rats using autologous nerve grafts. The rats were housed either in an enriched environment or in standard cages. In the enhanced housing environment, the rats were forced to move by dissociating food and water sources, including <b>wire</b> for foot <b>gripping</b> instead of flat plastic floors, and wooden play toys. Locomotor behavior was recorded on tape with a digital videorecorder and behavioral data were {{compared with those of}} a group of six unoperated rats. The video-recordings were analyzed for the stance factor (SF) as well as several other aspects of the rat's walking pattern. Walking was evaluated between 10 and 21 weeks after the operation. Differences in walking behavior between rats raised in an enriched environment and rats raised in standard cages could not be demonstrated. Differences in walking behavior between male and female rats were not found either. But data differed significantly at all ages with rats of the control group. Automutilation of parts of the denervated foot revealed a significant difference in both experimental groups, occurring less often in the enriched environment group. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.
