25|$|I {{would like}} to take this {{opportunity}} to express my personal thanks and that of the American people for the services <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> performed over a period of the last six years. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization represents an endeavor on the part of fifteen free nations, the success of which is vital to the security and well-being of the United States. Thus, the position of Commander of one of the major commands of this organization {{is one of the greatest}} responsibility. The leadership and judgment <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> displayed in this capacity have been a source of deep satisfaction to me personally, and I know has won the great admiration not only of the nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but of all the Free World.|$|E
25|$|By {{the captain}} of the port in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> cast anchor I have been courteously requested, as a soldier, and, above all, as a gentleman, to hold a conference with you, adding that you have advised him that war has been {{declared}} between our respective nations, and that you have come for the purpose of occupying these Spanish islands.|$|E
25|$|Since {{many have}} {{undertaken}} {{to set down}} an orderly account {{of the events that}} have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word, I too decided, after investigating everything carefully from the very first, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the truth concerning the things about <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been instructed.|$|E

25|$|The visuo-spatial sketchpad {{is part of}} Baddeley and Hitch’s {{model of}} working memory. It is {{responsible}} for temporarily storing visual and spatial information, which is currently being used or encoded. It is {{thought of as a}} three-dimensional cognitive map, which contains spatial features about where the person is and visual images of the area, or an object being concentrated on. It is used in tasks such as mental image manipulation where a person imagines how a real object would look if it were changed in some way (rotated, flipped, moved, change of colour, etc.). It is also responsible for representing how vivid an image is. A vivid image is one <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a high potential for retrieving its sensory details. The visuo-spatial sketchpad is responsible for holding onto the visual and spatial qualities of a vivid image in your working memory, and the degree of vividness is directly affected by the limits of the sketchpad.|$|E
25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; {{it has to be done}} in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to start making payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E
25|$|The subject upon <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{written to}} me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft's goal, she writes, is [...] "to shew you [...] to yourself, {{stripped}} of the gorgeous drapery in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> enwrapped your tyrannic principles." [...] However, she does also gesture towards a larger argument of her own, {{focusing on the}} inequalities faced by British citizens because of the class system. As Wollstonecraft scholar Barbara Taylor writes, [...] "treating Burke as a representative spokesman for old-regime despotism, Wollstonecraft champions the reformist initiatives of the new French government against his 'rusty, baneful opinions', and censures British political elites for their opulence, corruption, and inhumane treatment of the poor." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{doubtful}} {{whether it was}} possible for Speyer to resign from the Privy Council or as a baronet, there being no normal mechanism to do so, but the Prime Minister's response was supportive: [...] "I have known you long, and well enough to estimate at their true value these baseless and malignant imputations upon your loyalty to the British Crown. The King is not prepared to take any step such as you suggest in regard to the marks of distinction <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> received in recognition of public services and philanthropic munificence." [...] On 26 May 1915, Speyer and his family left for America.|$|E
500|$|Friedrich's written {{commentary}} on aesthetics {{was limited to}} a collection of aphorisms set down in 1830, in which he explained {{the need for the}} artist to match natural observation with an introspective scrutiny of his own personality. His best-known remark advises the artist to [...] "close your bodily eye so that you may see your picture first with the spiritual eye. Then bring to the light of day that <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards." [...] He rejected the overreaching portrayals of nature in its [...] "totality", as found in the work of contemporary painters like Adrian Ludwig Richter (1803–84) and Joseph Anton Koch (1768–1839).|$|E

500|$|During the two Zaca expeditions Beebe was {{accompanied}} by his longtime assistant John Tee-Van as well as Jocelyn Crane, a young carcinologist who had first worked for Beebe at Nonsuch Island in 1932, and who would subsequently be among Beebe's most cherished associates {{for the rest of}} his life. Like Hollister before her, Crane would eventually become Beebe's lover during the long expeditions that Beebe made without Elswyth's companionship. During this time Beebe was also forming a close friendship with Winnie-the-Pooh's creator A. A. Milne, who wrote of Half Mile Down [...] "I don't know which I envy you most: all those moral and physical qualities <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> and I lack, or all that wonder of a new world.

500|$|The Oliviers filmed That Hamilton Woman (1941) with Olivier as Horatio Nelson and Leigh as Emma Hamilton. With the United States not yet having {{entered the}} war, {{it was one}} of several Hollywood films made with the aim of arousing a pro-British {{sentiment}} among American audiences. The film was popular in the United States and an outstanding success in the Soviet Union. Winston Churchill arranged a screening for a party that included Franklin D. Roosevelt and, on its conclusion, addressed the group, saying, [...] "Gentlemen, I thought this film would interest you, showing great events similar to those in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> just been taking part." [...] The Oliviers remained favourites of Churchill, attending dinners and occasions at his request {{for the rest of his}} life; and, of Leigh, he was quoted as saying, [...] "By Jove, she's a clinker." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1886, {{when she}} agreed to open the Show of the Royal Horticultural Society of Southampton, the organisers sent her a {{proclamation}} of thanks, expressing their [...] "admiration of the affectionate manner in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> comforted and assisted your widowed mother our Gracious Sovereign the Queen". As a wedding present, Sir Moses Montefiore, a banker and philanthropist, presented Beatrice and Henry with a silver tea service inscribed: [...] "Many daughters have acted virtuously, but thou excellest them all." [...] The Times newspaper, shortly before Beatrice's marriage, wrote: [...] "The devotion of your Royal Highness to our beloved Sovereign has won our warmest admiration and our deepest gratitude.

500|$|In preparation, Johnson wrote a Plan for the Dictionary. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, was {{the patron}} of the Plan, to Johnson's displeasure. Seven years after first meeting Johnson {{to go over the}} work, Chesterfield wrote two {{anonymous}} essays in The World recommending the Dictionary. He complained that the English language lacked structure and argued in support of the dictionary. Johnson did not like the tone of the essays, and he felt that Chesterfield had not fulfilled his obligations as the work's patron. In a letter to Chesterfield, Johnson expressed this view and harshly criticised Chesterfield, saying [...] "Is not a patron, my lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water, and when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help? The notice <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been pleased to take of my labours, had it been early, had been kind: but it has been delayed till I am indifferent and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary and cannot impart it; till I am known and do not want it." [...] Chesterfield, impressed by the language, kept the letter displayed on a table for anyone to read.|$|E
500|$|In January or February 1943, Chevalier {{had a brief}} {{conversation}} with Oppenheimer {{in the kitchen of}} his home. Chevalier told Oppenheimer that there was a scientist, George Eltenton, who could transmit information of a technical nature to the Soviet Union. Oppenheimer rejected the overture, but failed to report it until August 1943, when he volunteered to Manhattan Project security officers that three men at Berkeley had been solicited for nuclear secrets on behalf of the Soviet Union, by a person he did not know who worked for Shell Oil, and who had Communist connections. He gave that person's name as George Eltenton. When pressed on the issue in later interviews at Los Alamos in December 1943 with Groves, who promised to keep the identity of the three men from the FBI, Oppenheimer identified the contact who had approached him as Chevalier, and told Groves that only one person had been approached: his brother Frank. Groves considered Oppenheimer too important to the ultimate Allied goals of building atomic bombs and winning the war to oust him over this suspicious behavior. He ordered that Oppenheimer be given a security clearance [...] "without delay, irrespective of the information <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> concerning Mr. Oppenheimer. He is absolutely essential to the project." ...|$|E
