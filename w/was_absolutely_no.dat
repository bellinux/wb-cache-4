25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as I entered, and they handed me my camera. Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E
25|$|In 1979 Edward Teller {{contributed to}} a Hoover Institution {{publication}} where he claimed that the US would be facing an emboldened USSR due to their work on civil defense. Two years later {{at a conference in}} Italy, he made the same claims about their ambitions, but with a subtle change; now he claimed that the reason for their boldness was their development of new space-based weapons. According to the popular opinion at the time, and one shared by author Frances FitzGerald; there <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> evidence that such research was being carried out. What had really changed was that Teller was now selling his latest nuclear weapon, the X-ray laser. Finding limited success in his efforts to get funding for the project, his speech in Italy was a new attempt to create a missile gap.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, a glitch was {{discovered}} on the Nurburgring track that allowed players {{to finish a}} lap or race faster than normal. By accelerating against any gap between walls, the player could take a 'shortcut' through the track and since there <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> collision detection beyond the walls, the player could race {{his way through the}} scenery and under the paved course and return to the finish line to complete the lap or the race by driving directly beneath the line {{in the direction of the}} intended racing path, as if he/she had driven across the entire track. Other tracks known for glitching are Special Stage Route 7, Daytona International Speedway, and Laguna Seca. All glitches were fixed within the first few weeks they were found. Also, the online server disallows glitching by reseting the car that has tried to glitch back on the track.|$|E

25|$|In the Mavericks' debut game, {{taking place}} in the brand-new Reunion Arena, the Mavericks {{defeated}} the Spurs, 103–92. But the Mavs started the season with a 6–40 record on their way to finishing 15–67. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a very important role {{in the early years of}} their franchise. Journeyman 6ft 3 in guard Brad Davis, who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association, was tracked down and signed by the Mavs in December. At the time, there <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> reason to expect that Davis would be any better than the expansion-level talent the Mavs had. But he started the Mavs' final 26 games, led the team in assists, and his career soared. He spent the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually his number 15 jersey was retired. The Mavericks also marked the first NBA team to have a profitable debut season, with an average of 7,789 spectators.|$|E

[...] After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.|$|E
500|$|In July 2003, Goodrem was {{diagnosed}} with Hodgkin's lymphoma {{and was forced to}} leave the show to begin treatment. Goodrem was written out of Neighbours, and script producer, Luke Devenish, said: [...] "She had to concentrate on her health, so there was no getting around it. There <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> question of attempting to keep her working." [...] Nina departed in October 2003, with an exit storyline that allowed for a return in the future. Three months' worth of scripts were rewritten, and a new character, Carmella Cammeniti (Natalie Blair), was created and introduced to cover Nina's planned storyline with Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey).|$|E

500|$|More importantly, the NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} to [...] "ensure the representation in Parliament of a minimum number of Members from a political party or parties not forming the Government". The PAP possessed [...] "unbroken hegemony" [...] in Parliament from 1968 until 1981 when J. B. Jeyaretnam won {{a seat in the}} Anson by-election. As a result of his sole opposition presence in the Parliament, he could not initiate a meaningful debate in Parliament, being unable to find another MP to second his motions. The fact that there <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> opposition representation in Parliament in the four general elections before 1984 (as indicated in the table below) added to the impetus for the inception of the scheme.|$|E
500|$|The {{promotion}} {{met with}} some positive reviews. Time called it [...] "clever", and {{a columnist for}} the Chicago Tribune stated that Herb was [...] "one of the most famous men in America". Ultimately, however, the Herb promotion {{has been described as a}} flop. The advertising campaign lasted three months before it was discontinued. [...] One Burger King franchise owner stated that the problem was that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> relevant message". Although some initial results were positive, the mystique was lost after Herb's appearance was revealed during the Super Bowl. Burger King's profits fell 40% in 1986. As a result of the poorly received campaign, Burger King dropped J. Walter Thompson from their future advertising. The US$200 million account was initially given to N. W. Ayer. After 18 months it went to another agency, as Ayer was having problems, and Burger King wanted to improve the bottom line.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the seventh season, the {{producers}} sought to re-introduce Dax but with a new host. They decided immediately that it had to be a female character, as otherwise Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor, would be the only female main character. There were some difficulties in finding an actress who met the requirements of the part; Ira Steven Behr said [...] "So we started the casting process, and all I saw was a lot of people who couldn't play the part. There <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> one in the running." [...] The initial casting call required an actress with a [...] "spooky" [...] quality, but following the failure to find someone adequate, co-supervising producer René Echevarria suggested that the character instead should be someone who was unprepared to be joined with Dax and only did so because of an unexpected occurrence.|$|E

500|$|Kruger {{resolved}} {{that war}} was inevitable, comparing the Boers' position {{to that of}} a man attacked by a lion with only a pocketknife for defence. [...] "Would you be such a coward as not to defend yourself with your pocketknife?" [...] he posited. Aware of the deployment of British troops from elsewhere in the Empire, Kruger and Smuts surmised that from a military standpoint the Boers' only chance was a swift pre-emptive strike. Steyn was anxious that they not be seen as the aggressors and insisted they delay until there <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> hope of peace. He informed Kruger on 9 October that he also now thought war unavoidable; that afternoon the Transvaal government handed the British envoy Conyngham Greene an ultimatum advising that if Britain did not withdraw all troops from the border within 48 hours, a state of war would exist. The British government considered the conditions impossible and informed Kruger of this on 11 October 1899. The start of the Second Boer War was announced in Pretoria that day, at 17:00 local time.|$|E
500|$|One evening, Starr took Carey to {{a record}} {{industry}} gala with hope of convincing a record executive to listen to Carey's demo. Jerry L. Greenberg, the president of Atlantic Records, was interested in Carey; as she handed him the tape, Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola grabbed it from him, {{and said that he}} would tend to [...] "the project". Mottola left the event later that evening, and got into his limousine and listened to the tape. He quickly realized that he had found a talented vocalist, turned the car around and returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. After a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and invited her to go to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, [...] "When I heard and saw Mariah, there <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom."

500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took {{a bit of time}} for us to realize {{that we were going to}} make an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there <b>was</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying.
