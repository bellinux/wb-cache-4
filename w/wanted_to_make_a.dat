5|$|Another story {{involving}} Kaali is her escapade {{with a band}} of thieves. The thieves <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> {{human sacrifice}} to Kaali, and unwisely chose a saintly Brahmin monk as their victim. The radiance of the young monk was {{so much that it}} burned the image of Kaali, who took living form and killed the entire band of thieves, decapitating them and drinking their blood.|$|E
5|$|Gilroy {{originally}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> {{film about}} the life of American photographer Weegee, but switched focus after discovering the unique narrative possibilities surrounding the stringer profession. He wrote Lou as an antihero, based on the ideas of unemployment and capitalism. Gyllenhaal played a pivotal role in the film's production, from choosing members of the crew to watching audition tapes. Filming took place over the course of four weeks, and was a challenging process that included over eighty locations.|$|E
5|$|Hard Boiled was John Woo's last Hong Kong film {{before his}} {{transition}} to Hollywood. After making films that glamorized gangsters (and receiving criticism for doing so), Woo <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> Dirty Harry styled film to glamorize the police. After {{the death of}} screenwriter Barry Wong, the film's screenplay underwent constant changes during filming. New characters such as Mad Dog and Mr. Woo were introduced, while the original plotline of a baby poisoning psychopath was cut.|$|E

5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E
5|$|Jon Favreau, the writer, {{director}} and star of Chef, wrote the film's script {{in about two}} weeks. He had long <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film about food and chefs, and felt that the subject was suited to a small-scale independent film rather than a big-budget production. He cited Jiro Dreams of Sushi, Eat Drink Man Woman and Big Night as inspirations for creating a food-centric film.|$|E
5|$|Not feeling {{qualified}} {{to write the}} script herself, Babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of USC School of Cinematic Arts Brian Wayne Peterson. Peterson had experience with reparative therapy while working at a prison clinic for sex offenders.

5|$|As aforesaid, SVT <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> {{good use}} of Malmo Arena's space to {{highlight}} the performances and increase the audience's visibility compared to previous years. SVT created a main stage and a smaller stage with higher-lower shifted floors, connected by a trail closely surrounded by a standing crowd {{from both sides of}} it and around the small stage. The main stage mobility was expressed as a main artistic medium at the opening act of the second semifinal and with highlighting Moldova's performance towards its finish, as a movable part beneath the singer's dress making her look gradually taller. The small stage mobility highlighted United Kingdom's performance towards its finish, lifted above the close-standing audience.|$|E
5|$|Audition was {{originally}} {{started by the}} Japanese company Omega Project, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> horror film after the great financial success of their previous production Ring. To create the film, the company purchased the rights to Ryu Murakami's book Audition, and hired screenwriter Daisuke Tengan and director Miike to film an adaptation. The cast and crew consisted primarily of people Miike had worked with on previous projects, {{with the exception of}} Shiina, who had worked as a model prior to beginning a career in film. The film was shot in about three weeks in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Because Eastern European Romani {{communities}} were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos {{was not well}} documented. There also existed a trend to downplay the actual figures, according to Ian Hancock, director of the Program of Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Tony Gatlif, whose films mostly have Romani people as subjects, had long <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> documentary on this less well-known subject, {{but the lack of}} enough documented evidence coupled with the absence of accurate pre-war census figures for the Romani made it difficult.|$|E

5|$|Bishop Lépes and his brother, the vice-voivode, {{started to}} {{assemble}} their troops near the peasants' camp. The absent voivode, Ladislaus Csáki, hurried to Transylvania. The counts of the Székelys, Michael Jakcs and Henry Tamási, also joined the united armies of the voivode and the bishop. The young noblemen {{who joined the}} campaign <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sudden assault on the peasants, but the bishop suggested that the peasants should be pacified through negotiations. The delay enabled the rioters to complete the fortification of their camp.|$|E

I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear weather greeted {{the players on}} the second day. After only four overs had been bowled in total the previous afternoon, Edrich was relieved of the new ball, which was given to Barnett, who accompanied Bedser. Both bowlers swung the ball into the right-handed Barnes and away from the left-handed Morris. Not a frontline bowler, Barnett focused on bowling defensively at medium pace, and the Australians <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> safe start, so they decided to play him watchfully. This prompted some commentators to claim Barnett had allowed the Australians to settle into their rhythm by not trying to pressure them.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Warner Bros. {{bought the}} rights to the Nancy Drew book series from the Stratemeyer Syndicate, for a {{reported}} $6,000. Warner Bros. <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> series of B-films based on the character, to serve as a companion to their popular Torchy Blane B-film series, which starred Glenda Farrell, Barton MacLane, and Tom Kennedy. Adams sold {{the rights to}} Jack L. Warner without an agent or any consultation; thus, she sold all and any film rights to Warner Bros., a move that would later come into question following the rise of television.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, MGM was keen on remaking Grand Hotel (1932), {{and hoped}} to lure Grant into {{coming out of}} {{retirement}} to star. Hitchcock had long <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film {{based on the idea}} of Hamlet, with Grant in the lead role. Grant stated that Warren Beatty had made a big effort to try to get him {{to play the role of}} Mr. Jordan in Heaven Can Wait (1978), which eventually went to James Mason. Morecambe and Stirling claim that Grant had also expressed an interest in appearing in A Touch of Class (1973), The Verdict (1982) and a film adaptation of William Goldman's 1983 novel Adventures in the Screen Trade.|$|E
5|$|Poole and Donovan {{had long}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sequel to Boys in the Sand. In 1984, they finally shot Boys in the Sand II. Also filmed on Fire Island, the film {{featured}} Donovan, the only cast member {{from the original}} to return. The original opening sequence, Bayside, was recreated for the sequel, with Pat Allen performing the run from the water. Litigation tied up the release of Boys in the Sand II until 1986 and {{with the advent of}} the home video market, there was a glut of gay porn titles available. Boys in the Sand II did not distinguish itself from the competition and was not particularly successful.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{staff from}} previous Metroid games – including Yoshio Sakamoto, Makoto Kano and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Super Metroid {{over the course}} of two years, with half a year earlier to gain approval for the initial idea. The developers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> true action game, and to set the stage for Samus's reappearance. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It features new concepts to the series, such as the inventory screen, an automap, and the ability to fire in all directions.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} developed in 1990. After creating films {{which focused on}} the lives of gangsters, director John Woo <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film that glorified the police instead. Woo admired Clint Eastwood's and Steve McQueen's characters from their films Dirty Harry and Bullitt respectively, and wanted to make his own Hong Kong-style Dirty Harry police detective film. While creating this character, Woo was inspired by a police officer who was a strong-willed and tough member of the police force, as well as being an avid drummer. This led to Woo having Tequila's character be a musician as well as a cop.|$|E
5|$|Capcom began {{development}} knowing they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> survival horror {{game with a}} lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not bode well with retailers and players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the motion capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. Takenaka played the motion capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay.|$|E
