5|$|Loss of cell {{viability}} in the jack jumper's venom was researched through cytometry, which measures {{the proportions of}} cells that glow {{in the presence of}} fluorescent dye and 7-Aminoactinomycin D. Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering {{cell viability}}; the residue 22 N-terminal plays a critical role in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E

5|$|Chloroacetone turns brown-orange <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> to light, while {{ethyl bromoacetate}} is a yellow liquid at {{tropical}} outdoor temperatures.

50|$|A similar problem {{exists in}} holography. The total energy {{required}} <b>when</b> <b>exposing</b> holographic film using a {{continuous wave laser}} (i.e. for several seconds) is significantly less than the total energy required <b>when</b> <b>exposing</b> holographic film using a pulsed laser (i.e. around 20 - 40 nanoseconds) due to a reciprocity failure. It can also be caused by very long or very short exposures with a continuous wave laser. To try to offset the reduced brightness of the film due to reciprocity failure, a method called latensification can be used. This is usually done directly after the holographic exposure and using an incoherent light source (such as a 25-40 W light bulb). Exposing the holographic film to the light {{for a few seconds}} can increase the brightness of the hologram by an order of magnitude.|$|R

5|$|Plutonium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> to air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. <b>When</b> <b>exposed</b> to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, {{which in turn}} flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium forms {{a number}} of oxides <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> to air, {{including}} rubidium monoxide (Rb2O), Rb6O, and Rb9O2; rubidium in excess oxygen gives the superoxide RbO2. Rubidium forms salts with halides, producing rubidium fluoride, rubidium chloride, rubidium bromide, and rubidium iodide.|$|E
5|$|The metal {{takes on}} a bluish tinge <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> to air at room {{temperature}} for extended periods.

5|$|When {{placed over}} a flame, lithium {{compounds}} give off a striking crimson color, {{but when it}} burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> to water or water vapors. Lithium is flammable, and it is potentially explosive <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> to air and especially to water, though less so than the other alkali metals. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent because the hydrogen produced does not ignite on its own. As with all alkali metals, lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring dry powder fire extinguishers (Class D type). Lithium {{is one of the}} few metals that react with nitrogen under normal conditions.|$|E

5|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} an RNA thermometer motif is the FourU thermometer found in Salmonella enterica. <b>When</b> <b>exposed</b> to temperatures above 45°C, the stem-loop that base-pairs opposite the Shine-Dalgarno sequence becomes unpaired and allows the mRNA to enter the ribosome for translation to occur. Mg2+ ion concentration {{has also been shown}} to affect the stability of FourU. The most well-studied RNA thermometer is found in the rpoH gene in Escherichia coli. This thermosensor upregulates heat shock proteins under high temperatures through σ32, a specialised heat-shock sigma factor.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical device that ruptures the cigar <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E

5|$|Because sugars burn easily <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
5|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{machining}} hafnium because it is pyrophoric—fine particles can spontaneously combust <b>when</b> <b>exposed</b> to air. Compounds that contain this metal are rarely encountered by most people. The pure metal is not considered toxic, but hafnium compounds should be handled as if they were toxic because the ionic forms of metals are normally at greatest risk for toxicity, and limited animal testing has been done for hafnium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ce and atomic number 58.

50|$|<b>When</b> <b>exposing</b> {{asynchronous}} I/O to applications {{there are}} a few broad classes of implementation.

Furthermore, more than one method may be used by a single application, depending on its needs and the desires of its programmer(s). Many operating systems provide more than one of these mechanisms, it is possible that some may provide all of them.|$|R
