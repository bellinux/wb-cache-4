500|$|Following {{their worst}} weekend in almost ten years, Ferrari were self-critical. Sebastian Vettel {{was quoted as}} {{describing}} his race as [...] "a shit job", and later took full responsibility for his race ending crash, saying that he [...] "probably just ask or <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit too much". Speaking about the collision between Kimi Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas, Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene said: [...] "It's an accident, it's part of the show. I don't want to blame anybody." [...] He went on to describe the weekend as [...] "a good lesson" [...] for the team, taking positive things from the race, such as the good race pace shown by both cars. As {{a result of their}} double retirement, both Ferrari drivers lost their respective positions in the Drivers' Championship. While Vettel was overtaken by Rosberg into second place, Räikkönen lost fourth position to Valtteri Bottas. In the Constructors' Standings, Williams moved closer to Ferrari in second place, now trailing them by 131 points. At the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony on 3 December 2015, the organizers were awarded the prize as Best Promoter.|$|E

Man, anal retentive, A Consumer's Guide to Rock, what a moron: 'A Study' by, y'know, Robert Christgau. Nice little boxes: B-PLUS. Can you imagine working for a fucking year, {{and you get a}} B+ from some asshole in The Village Voice?" [...] Christgau rated the album C+ and wrote in his review, [...] "I thank Lou for pronouncing my name right." [...] In December 1980, Christgau provoked angry responses from Voice readers when his column approvingly quoted his wife Carola Dibbell's reaction to the murder of John Lennon: [...] "Why is it always Bobby Kennedy or John Lennon? Why isn't it Richard Nixon or Paul McCartney?" [...] Similar angst came from Sonic Youth in their song [...] "Kill Yr Idols" [...] (at the time known as [...] "I Killed Christgau with My Big Fucking Dick"), in which they sing [...] "I don't know why / You wanna impress Christgau / Ah let that shit die / And find out the new goal"; Christgau responded by saying [...] "Idolization is for rock stars, even rock stars manqué like these impotent bohos—critics just <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> respect. So if it's not too hypersensitive of me, I wasn't flattered to hear my name pronounced right, not on this particular title track." ...|$|E
