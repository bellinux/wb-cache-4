40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric {{differences}} between patients <b>with</b> probable <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease and patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia. METHODS: Thirty three patients <b>with</b> probable <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease and 33 patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia were matched for age, sex, and mini mental state examination scores {{and given a}} battery of neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric tests. RESULTS: Patients with Parkinson's disease with dementia had a significantly higher prevalence of major depression than patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease; patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease showed more severe anosognosia and disinhibition than patients with Parkinson's disease.

40|$|Background: Recently, {{conflicting}} reports {{have been published}} on the potential role of genetic variants in the a-T catenin gene (VR 22; CTNNA 3) on the risk for Alzheimer’s disease.

Methods: After sequencing VR 22 in multiplex families <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer’s</b> disease linked to chromosome 10 q 21, we identified a novel non-synonymous (Ser 596 Asn; rs 4548513) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The epsilon 4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a {{risk factor}} for late onset Alzheimer's disease. ApoE is present in senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and {{cerebrovascular}} amyloid, and it is implicated in synaptogenesis. The effect of ApoE polymorphism on the volumes of hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal lobe was studied. The hypothesis was that the patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease carrying the epsilon 4 allele have more pronounced atrophy. The relation of ApoE and cerebral blood flow on cortical areas was also assessed. METHODS [...] Fifty eight patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease at the early stage of the disease and 34 control subjects were studied. Patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease were divided into subgroups according to the number of the epsilon 4 alleles. Volumes were measured by MRI and regional cerebral blood flow ratios referred to the cerebellum were examined by 99 mTc-HMPAO SPECT. ApoE genotypes were determined by digestion of ApoE polymerase chain reaction products with the restriction enzyme Hha 1. RESULTS [...] patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease had smaller volumes of hippocampi and amygdala compared with control subjects, and the patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease homozygous for the epsilon 4 allele had the most prominent volume loss in the medial temporal lobe structures. The frontal lobe volumes did not differ significantly. All patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease had bilateral temporoparietal hypoperfusion and the subgroups with one or no epsilon 4 alleles also had frontal hypoperfusion compared with control subjects. The occipital perfusion ratios tended to decrease with increasing number of epsilon 4 alleles. CONCLUSIONS [...] Patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease homozygous for the epsilon 4 allele seem to have severe damage in the medial temporal lobe structures early in the disease process and differ from the patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease <b>with</b> one or no epsilon 4 alleles...|$|R
50|$|Results {{from the}} new study (november 2016) suggest that a {{specific}} phosphorylation of tau (at threonine-205) has a protective effect on neurons (so that not all tau phosphorylation is damaging). It is a completely new mindset that the reason tau becomes modified is actually to protect from damage. A protein called kinase p38γ assist the protective phosphorylation of tau (at the site threonine-205). The activity of p38γ (p38 gamma kinase enzyme protein) is mostly lost as Alzheimer Disease progresses. p38γ, which initially offers protection, fades away early in the brains of people <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> Disease, suggesting a loss of protection. Reintroducing p38γ and increasing its activity, prevented memory deficits from happening in a mouse model, so it has true therapeutic potential (if one can increase the activity of this enzyme; however increasing the activity of kinases {{has been shown to}} be difficult).|$|E
50|$|Alzheimer disease {{presents}} specific {{challenges for}} caregivers, {{who need to}} make the home as accessible as possible to the elderly resident, while keeping safety features in mind. Removable stove switch knobs, locks on kitchen cabinets, electric kettles with automatic shut-off, and adding lighting to eliminate shadows in the house can all help caregivers to reduce dangers to the person <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> disease. Other features that can improve the well-being of the elderly person can include marking doors with conspicuous and distinct signs or objects such as ribbons or wreaths, can assist memory. Adding a cot or bed to the main floor of the house to allow the elderly person to rest without climbing stairs to a bedroom can be helpful to the Alzheimer patient. Furniture and clutter can also be removed to make the house more safe for an elderly person inclined to pace or wander.|$|E

Gender-specificly, in women both hemispheres were equally involved, while men were left-lateralized.

This design was also employed for therapy follow-up studies. In the complex of themes “Smell, emotion, memory, words, faces“ an influence of the odorous substance PEA (N-Palmitoyl-ethanolamine) upon the encoding and recognition of faces was found, if these were to be classified into ’appealing’ and ’unappealing.’ Stuttering was investigated as well: 8 stutterers and 8 controls were faced with certain tasks and examined in the MEG. While stuttering in task 1 (silent reading) was not yet noticeable, it was strongly present in task 2 (immediate loud uttering of a word shown): Only the normal controls showed clear neuronal activity {{prior to the start}} of speaking. This brain activity is the Readiness Field (RF) or Bereitschaftsfield (BF) and in particular its left-lateralized component BF2 prior to the fluent speech production.

40|$|Background: Despite the {{outbreak}} in dental science, oral and dental complications in Alzheimer {{are of the}} unsolved problems. It is assumed that tumor necrosis factor-α, which is {{a key factor in}} Alzheimer, has a relation with periodontal complications in patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> disease. The present study evaluated the effect of chronic periodontitis on serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α in Alzheimer disease. Materials and Methods: This case-control study was performed on 80 patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> disease seeking medical care at Nour Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. Eighty patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> disease between 40 and 70 years old attended this study. Forty had chronic periodontitis (case group), and 40 patients had healthy periodontium (control group). Blood sample was taken, and serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α were measured by means of an ELISA Reader device. Independent T-Test was used to analyze data, and P < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: The mean of tumor necrosis factor-α was 749. 1 ng/μL in case group and 286. 8 ng/μL in control group. Independent t-test showed that the mean of tumor necrosis factor-α in patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> and periodontitis was approximately three folds higher than the patients only <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer,</b> and this difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 001).

The aim of this study was to clarify factors associated with the presence of psychosis in patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease.  METHODS—Psychiatric functioning was studied in 228 patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease based on the results of the behavioural pathology in Alzheimer's disease rating scale or the neuropsychiatric inventory. The effects of sex, education level, age, duration of illness, cognitive function, and apolipoprotein E genotype were investigated for dichotomous psychotic status with a multiple logistic regression analysis.  RESULTS—Of the 228 patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease, 118 (51. 8 %) showed evidence of delusions or hallucinations. Of these, 94 had delusions only, three had hallucinations only, and 21 had both. Older age, female sex, longer duration of illness, and more severe cognitive impairment were the factors independently associated with the presence of psychosis. The presence of psychosis was not significantly related to either educational level or apolipoprotein E genotype.  CONCLUSIONS—Age, sex, and severity of illness were independent factors associated with the presence of psychosis in patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease. The reason why some patients <b>with</b> <b>Alzheimer's</b> disease develop psychosis remains unclear. There may be distinctive subtypes of Alzheimer's disease or the presence of individual factors which affect the development of psychosis. ...|$|R
