The objectives of the study were: 1) To compare the differences of ethanol production between the normal and <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> using a cold-fermentation process; 2) To understand the effects of starch structure and properties on the ethanol production. Ethanol yields of the <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> ranged from 33. 1 % (33. 1 g/ 100 g dry grain) to 37. 6 % for 2009 grown corn, and ranged from 34. 8 to 37. 9 % for 2010 grown corn. Ethanol yields of the normal corn ranged from 34. 2 to 37. 2 % (2009) and from 34. 3 to 37. 5 % (2010). Ethanol yields positively correlated with the kernel starch contents of both normal and <b>waxy</b> <b>corn.</b> Average starch-ethanol conversion efficiency of the <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> (93. 2 %, 2009; 93. 0 %, 2010) was substantially {{greater than that of}} the normal corn (88. 0 %, 2009; 88. 4 %, 2010). This could be attributed to the greater starch hydrolysis rate of the <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> than that of the normal corn. Starch hydrolysis of uncooked dry-grind corn showed that more than 90 % of starch in the <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> was hydrolyzed, whereas less than 80 % of starch in the normal corn was hydrolyzed to glucose. It indicated that normal corn contained a significant portion of starch that was less readily hydrolyzed by the enzymes, which reduced the conversion efficiency. There were differences in starch physicochemical properties between the corn grown in 2009 and 2010 crop years.

The original soil salinity expressed as electrical conductivity of the saturation paste extract (ECe) averaged 28 dS/m in the 0 - 120 cm depth. The experiment included five soil matric potential (SMP) treatments in which the SMP at 20 cm depth below the drip emitters was controlled higher than - 5, - 10, - 15, - 20 and - 25 kPa after <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> establishment. The results showed that drip irrigation created a favorable soil condition for <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> growth through forming and maintaining a high moisture and low salinity region in the root zone when the SMP was maintained higher than - 25 kPa. <b>Waxy</b> <b>corn</b> growth and yield parameters increased with the increase of SMP from - 25 kPa to - 5 kPa, but their responses to SMP decreased with the prolonged period of cultivation. Irrigation frequency and irrigation amount decreased significantly as SMP decreased from - 5 kPa to - 25 kPa, and the highest irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) was available when the SMP was around - 15 kPa in 2005, and was between - 20 kPa and - 25 kPa in successive years. After years of cultivation and drip leaching, the highly saline soil gradually changed to a moderately saline soil. This research suggests that drip irrigation can be successfully used in growing <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> in dry and highly saline conditions after appropriate management strategies are adopted.

Mixture and extreme vertices design were used as experimental designs. Canonical models were applied to the optimization techniques. Blending different kinds of surimi showed linear trends for each functional property, so that LP was successfully employed to optimize surimi lots. Strong interactions were found between surimi and starch or in starch mixtures. Two optimum solutions, obtained from LP and NLP, were compared in this study. Corn starch and modified <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> starch greatly improved the functional properties...|$|E
40|$|Starch {{derivatives}} of taro (Colocasia esculenta L. Schott) {{and rice}} were characterized as wall materials of orange oil (d-limonene) by spray drying. Native starches were initially hydrolyzed with HCl and then esterified. Succinylated starches were modified using a conventional method in a slurry and were extruded; whereas, the phosphorylated starches were modified using the extrusion process. Viscosity and solubility of starches reduced after acid hydrolysis, derivatization, and extrusion. The particle {{size of the}} wall materials ranged between 20. 05 and 31. 81 µm. The encapsulation efficiency of the phosphorylated taro, rice, and <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> starches was 96. 9, 96. 8 and 97. 1 % respectively, and 98. 6, 98. 1, and 98. 8 % for succynilated taro, rice, and <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> starches, respectively. Starch derivatives of taro and rice could potentially be used as wall materials of orange oil d-limonene...|$|E

The reduction was fastest {{in the case}} of sucrose followed by <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> and soluble starch while stability of nanoparticles followed the order soluble starch[*]>[*]waxy corn starch[*]>[*]sucrose (data not shown). Thus, the size and molecular weight were important for stabilization of the nanoparticles.|$|E
40|$|Total {{anthocyanin}} {{content in}} different dried parts of purple <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> (Zea mays L. var. ceratina) genotype Fancy Muang 111 was investigated under subcritical solvent extraction. The highest total anthocyanin content of 991. 4, 1241. 5, and 1552. 1 µg cyanidin- 3 -glucoside per gram dry weight of sample {{were obtained from}} dried kernel extraction (water–ethanol at ratio 1 : 3 as solvent and sample–solvent at ratio 1 : 20), dried cob extraction (water–ethanol at ratio 1 : 1 as solvent and sample–solvent at ratio 1 : 20), dried silk extraction (water–ethanol ratio at 1 : 1 as solvent and sample–solvent ratio at 1 : 30), respectively. The extraction was conducted at 100 °C for 15 min with N 2 purging. Additionally, the antioxidant activities assessed by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2, 2 ′-azino-bis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays showed that the dried silk extract exhibited the greatest antioxidant activity in DPPH assay (IC 50 [*]=[*] 3. 2 mg/mL), ABTS assay (IC 50 [*]=[*] 1. 3 mg/mL), and FRAP assay (634. 8 mmol FeSO 4 / 100 g dry weight of sample). The extract powder had the total anthocyanin content of 632. 8 µg cyanidin- 3 -glucoside/g powder. Practical applications The anthocyanin extraction from different dried parts of purple <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> was investigated by subcritical solvent extraction method. The effect of different parameters such as weight ratio of purple <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> samples to water, extraction temperature, extraction time, water-to-ethanol ratio as solvent, and oxygen in the subcritical solvent extraction provided high total anthocyanin content in the extraction, and the dried silk extract containing the highest total anthocyanin content exhibited the greatest antioxidant activity. Therefore, subcritical solvent extraction of total anthocyanins from purple <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> {{has been shown to}} be feasible and could be applicable in food processing industries. The total anthocyanin extract obtained has the potential to be developed into new health foods and to be used for the production of value-added products...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} and compare the melting (T-m), glass transition (T-g) and mechanical relaxation (T-alpha) temperatures of a new waxy cassava starch. Thermal transitions measurements were obtained by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Dynamical Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA). The experimental data showed a high correlation between water volume fraction and melting temperature (T-m) indicating that the Flory-Huggins theory can be used to describe the thermal behavior of this starch. The T-m of waxy cassava starch-water mixes were lower than a <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> starch-water reference system, but differences were not statistically significant. The mechanical relaxation temperatures taken at tan delta peaks were found 29 - 38 degrees C larger than T-g. The T-alpha and T-g measured for waxy cassava starch exhibited similar properties to the ones of <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> starch, implying that waxy cassava starch can be used in food and materials industry...|$|E
40|$|Characteristics {{of native}} starch have limited its {{application}} in solid dosage forms as a sustained release agent. There is a growing interest in improving starch functionality for sustained release applications because of its non-toxicity and biodegradability. This study attempted to investigate extruded starch phosphates as an excipient in sustaining drug release. Starches from various botanical sources with different amylose contents, including <b>waxy</b> <b>corn,</b> common corn, Hylon V (similar to 50 % amylose), Hylon VII (similar to 70 % amylose), and potato, were used to prepare starch phosphates at pH 9. 0 or 11. 0 using a reactive extrusion method. Phosphorous content was higher for starch phosphates prepared at pH 9. 0 than at pH 11. 0, and varied with starch type when phosphorylated at pH 9. 0. Reactive extrusion produced starch extrudates that upon forming hydrogels were capable of sustaining release of metoprolol tartrate (MPT). The structural features of the hydrogel as modified by the phosphorylation reaction were found to alter the kinetics of drug release from the swellable matrices. The unmodified extrudates formed weaker gels as evidenced by their theological properties, and showed faster drug release. <b>Waxy</b> <b>corn</b> starch phosphorylated at pH 9. 0 as well as common corn and potato starches phosphorylated at pH 11. 0 were found to exhibit more case-II-like properties attributed to a high density of cross-links and stronger chain entanglement. <b>Waxy</b> <b>corn</b> starch phosphorylated at pH 9. 0 exhibited the lowest degree of drug release. The entanglement among amylopectin molecules and branch chains was suggested {{to play a role}} in governing MPT release...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the impact of}} starches on the properties of low fat rennet curd as measured by microstructural and instrumental analysis. In experiment 1, 17 starches were initially screened for swelling power, impact of curd yield at 5 g/L and 10 g/L in milk, and settling in rennet-induced partially acidified low fat curd. Starches examined were narrowed down to five in experiment 2; they included: modified <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> starch, waxy rice starch, instant tapioca starch, dextrin, and a modified tapioca starch. These starches were added to skim milk to make rennet-induced partially acidified milk gels. Gels were made by adding starch to skim milk, heating to gelatinize starch, followed by addition of rennet and glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) to induce gelation. Once gels were set they were cut and centrifuged to sediment the curd. The amount of starch lost in whey was quantified to estimate starch retention in the curd. Confocal laser scanning microscopy {{was used to determine}} starch impact on curd microstructure. Curds yields were 13. 1 %, 18. 4 %, 20. 7 %, 21. 5 %, 23. 5 %, and 13. 2 % for control gel, and gels containing <b>waxy</b> <b>corn,</b> waxy rice, instant tapioca, modified tapioca and dextrin starches, respectively. Estimated starch retentions in the curds were 71 %, 90 %, 90 %, 21 %, and 1 % for these curds. <b>Waxy</b> <b>corn,</b> waxy rice, and instant tapioca starches have the potential to improve the texture of low fat cheese because they are retained well in the protein network during coagulation and concentration of the milk proteins, and they generate interruptions in curd network that may help limit extensive protein-protein interactions. Modified tapioca starch causes the protein structure of the curd to be very loose, but it was not retained optimally in the curd. Also, because there were few distinct starch particles in the modified tapioca curd network, it is likely that when it is subjected to all the cheesemaking steps the same loose protein structure would not be observed. Dextrin was not retained well in the curd, nor did it disrupt the protein network, making it unsuitable for use in low fat cheese. 	In experiment 3, low fat cheddar cheeses were made with <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> starch, waxy rice starch, modified tapioca starch, and instant tapioca starch. Modified tapioca starch did not increase the moisture content of the cheese. <b>Waxy</b> <b>corn</b> starch, waxy rice starch, and instant tapioca starch all increased the moisture content of the cheeses significantly. However, when moisture contents of cheeses were over 61 %, the body of the cheese visibly softened during storage, making the cheese very pasty. When starch-containing cheeses had moisture levels lower than that, the curd did not knit together well...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} North China Plain, and saline water with salinity (EC(iw)) from 1. 1 to 10. 9 dS/m was applied to irrigate tomato, cucumber, oleic sunflower and <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> under mulched drip irrigation. Throughout crops growing seasons, the soil matric potential at 0. 2 m depth under emitters was kept higher than - 20 kPa. The experimental results revealed when three seeds per hole were planted, rate of emergence > 80 % can be obtained despite irrigation water salinity up to 10. 9 dS/m; yield reduction was 1. 4 % and 1. 7 % for <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> and oleic sunflower for each unit of increase of EC(iw) above 1. 6 dS/m, and was 7. 5 % for cucumber when ECiw was above 1. 1 dS/m; irrigation water salinity lower than 4. 9 dS/m didn't affect tomato yield, but yield reduced by 6. 7 % for each dS/m over 4. 9 dS/m; tomato, <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> and oleic sunflower, a relatively salt. -tolerant crops, showed a constant or slight increase WUE and IWUE, while cucumber, a relatively salt sensitive crop, showed a decrease of WUE and IWUE with increasing salinity; applying saline water under mulched drip irrigation with salinity as high as 4. 9 dS/m didn't result in soil salinization, and when salinity up to 6. 9 similar to 10. 9 dS/m, soil salinity increased, but could maintain a balance and don't increase year-to-year. Therefore, saline water with salinity from 1. 6 to 10. 9 dS/m can be applied for crop production with drip irrigation when soil matric potential at 0. 2 m depth tinder emitters is kept higher than - 20 kPa...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the crucial}} roles of {{oxidative}} stress and aldose reductase on diabetic complications and the protective effect against diabetic eye complication of purple <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> and ginger (PWCG) {{together with the}} synergistic effect concept, we aimed to determine anticataract and antiretinopathy effects of the combined extract of purple <b>waxy</b> <b>corn</b> and ginger (PWCG). The streptozotocin diabetics with the blood glucose levels > 250 [*]mg·dL− 1 were orally given the extract at doses of 50, 100, and 200 [*]mg/kg·BW− 1 for 10 weeks. Then, lens opacity and histopathology of retina were determined. The changes of MDA together with the activities of SOD, CAT, GPx, and AR in lens were also determined using biochemical assays. All doses of PWCG decreased lens opacity, MDA, and AR in the lens of diabetic rats. The elevation of CAT and GPx activities was also observed. The antiretinopathy property of the combined extract was also confirmed by the increased number of neurons in ganglion cell layer and thickness of total retina and retinal nuclear layer in diabetic rats. PWCG is the potential functional food to protect against diabetic cataract and retinopathy. However, further studies concerning toxicity and clinical trial are still essential...|$|E
