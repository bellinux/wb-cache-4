In data from cohort studies, the gender wage gap for full time workers in their early thirties fell between 1978 and 2000. This equalisation reflects improvements in women’s education and experience, rather more than a move towards equal treatment. Indeed, had the typical woman full-timer in 2000 been paid at men’s rates she would have actually received higher pay than the typical man. Women in one cohort faced increasing inequality as they aged from 33 to 42, partly {{due to differences in}} qualifications and experience.

In particular, (1) shorter paid (job-protected) family leave combined with institutional childcare availability; (2) support of flexible forms of work (such as part-time work, flexible working hours, or work from home); and (3) measures that help mitigate the consequences of leave-related skill depreciation (training or re-qualification programs designed for <b>women</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> after childbirth) are likely to reduce the high unemployment rates among mothers with children that, to a great extent, stand behind the observed gender unemployment gaps, at least in the temporary leave countries.|$|R

30|$|I {{display the}} results {{separately}} for Western Germans, women of foreign nationality, {{and women in}} Eastern Germany. Clearly, the shares of mothers who <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the labour market 2, 10, 12, 15, 18, 24 and 36 months after childbirth exceed those in any other months. These dates coincide with some important dates in German maternity leave legislation. Throughout the time period considered, the job-protection period was gradually increased from ten months in 1986 to 36 months in 1992. Moreover, after two months, maternity benefit drops sharply from the full salary to 300 Euros per month, which is about 25 % of the average salary. Furthermore, since 1993 (1988 in Baden-Wuerttemberg and 1989 in Bavaria), maternity benefits have been paid for 24 months, while the job-protection period is 36 months. Finally, two Eastern German states (Saxony and Thuringia) pay maternity benefits for an additional six months, which may explain the unusually large share of <b>women</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> 30 months after childbirth in Eastern Germany.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of family-friendly {{policies}} on women?s career breaks due to childbirth in Denmark and Sweden.

Sweden and Denmark are culturally similar and share {{the same type of}} welfare state ideology, but differ remarkably in pursued family policies. The impact of family policy variables on the probability of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> the labour market is estimated using a duration model approach. Our results show that economic incentives and leave periods of the fathers affect the behaviour of mothers in both countries. However, family policy instruments are found to have a much larger impact on Swedish mothers? behaviour compared to Danish women. We explain this finding by the fact that family-friendly policies in Sweden have focused much more on flexible leave schemes and on the shared responsibilities of the parents than in Denmark...|$|R
30|$|Third, I analyze how the child's {{month of}} birth that is {{inferred}} {{from the start}} of the leave spell in the social security data differs from the true month of birth in the Pension Register. I find that in most cases (70 %), the two coincide. In 25 % of the cases, the inferred birth month is over- or underestimated by one month. Measurement error in the birth month leads to measurement error in the time which the mother spends at home before <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> This may be a problem for instance if one wants to evaluate the impact of maternity leave legislation on women's decisions <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> One may expect that an unusually large share of <b>women</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> after exactly 36 months if the job-protection period is 36 months. Due to the particular type of measurement error in the child's birth month, however, one would also expect an especially large share 35 or 37 months after childbirth. I confirm this in Sect.  5.2.|$|R
30|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the IABS, {{compared to the}} GSOEP, is that the IABS does not contain direct information on childbirth. The data set does, however, include a variable that indicates an interruption of the employment relationship, so women who go on maternity leave can potentially be identified. This variable has two limitations. First, not all leave spells {{may be due to}} maternity leave. Alternative reasons include sick or disability leave. Second, since the IABS does not include direct information on childbirth, the month in which the child was born has to be inferred from the month in which the mother goes on leave. This is likely to lead to measurement error in the child's birth month and therefore in the time that mothers spend at home after childbirth. Both types of measurement error may bias findings regarding the determinants of when <b>women</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> after childbirth, or regarding the impact of the duration of the career interruption on subsequent wage growth.|$|R
