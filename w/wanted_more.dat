In the new words, Jorge González Rios criticized both {{economic}} groups and various right-wing politicians in the chorus: [...] "Quiero más Luksic, quiero más Angelini; quiero más UDI, quiero más Pinocheques; quiero más Büchi, quiero más Lavín; quiero más libras, quiero más dólares" [...] (I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Luksic, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Angelini, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> UDI, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Pinocheques, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Büchi, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Lavín, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> pounds, I <b>want</b> <b>more</b> dollars).

5|$|Despite his success, Cagney {{remained}} {{dissatisfied with}} his contract. He <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> {{money for his}} successful films, but he also offered to take a smaller salary should his star wane. Warner Bros. refused, so Cagney once again walked out. He held out for $4000 a week, the same salary as Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Kay Francis. Warner Bros. refused to cave in this time, and suspended Cagney. Cagney {{announced that he would}} do his next three pictures for free if they canceled the five years remaining on his contract. He also threatened to quit Hollywood and go back to Columbia University to follow his brothers into medicine. After six months of suspension, Frank Capra brokered a deal that increased Cagney's salary to around $3000 a week, and guaranteed top billing and no more than four films a year.|$|E
5|$|For Seiken Densetsu 3, Kikuta was {{assisted}} by a sound programmer, Hidenori Suzuki, which {{allowed him to}} compose over three {{times the amount of}} music he had created for Secret of Mana. The move to the PlayStation for Soukaigi allowed Kikuta to focus on creating live music for the soundtrack, rather than tweaking the synthesizer instruments to make the music files fit in the game cartridge as he had to for the Super Nintendo. He used the added audio processing power to expand his musical creativity, including pieces such as songs in unintelligible Thai and Malaysian by Japanese singers. The game itself, however, was not a success, and Kikuta decided that he <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> direct control over the next project he worked on.|$|E

5|$|The first {{plans for}} an airport serving Notodden were {{launched}} in 1954 by Reidar Hedwig-Dahl, director of the tourist office. In late 1954 or early 1955, he held a meeting with Ludvig G. Braathen, owner of Braathens SAFE, and representatives for his airline. They saw Notodden as a possible gateway to Telemark and Braathen promised to start flying to an airport serving Notodden, should one be built. At the time, Braathen had started flying to several smaller airports in Norway using a fleet of de Havilland Heron aircraft. Braathen had been traveling around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that he <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> but smaller airports than the central authorities were planning. He succeeded at having similar airports built in Hamar and Røros.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Robinson M. Yost {{explains that}} Darwinism went into eclipse during the 1890s. At that time, most zoologists felt that natural selection {{could not be}} {{the main cause of}} biological adaptation, and sought alternative explanations. As a result, many zoologists rejected both Batesian mimicry and Müllerian mimicry. Beddard, writes Yost, explained some problems in the theory of mimicry including that, given how many insect species there are, resemblances between species could arise by chance, and that mimicry was sometimes either useless or actually harmful. In Yost's view, Beddard <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> evidence that natural selection really was responsible. Yost cites the staunch Darwinist Poulton's hostile review of 1892, which asserts the pre-eminence of Darwin's theory. But, writes Yost, Beddard was not alone in being wary of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, Playford and the LCL's {{share of}} the vote {{declined}} continually despite the economic growth, and they clung to power mainly due to the Playmander. Playford became less assured in parliament as Labor became more aggressive, their leading debater Don Dunstan combatively disrupting the previously collaborative style of politics, targeting the injustice of the Playmander in particular. Playford's successful economic policies had fuelled a rapid expansion of the middle class, which <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> government attention to education, public healthcare, the arts, the environment and heritage protection. However, Playford was an unrelenting utilitarian, and was unmoved by calls to broaden policy focus beyond economic development. This was exacerbated by Playford and his party's failure to adapt to changing social mores, remaining adamantly committed to restrictive laws on alcohol, gambling and police powers. A turning point in Playford's tenure was the Max Stuart case in the 1950s, when Playford came under heavy scrutiny for his hesitation to grant clemency to a murderer on death row amid claims of judicial wrongdoing. Although Playford eventually commuted the sentence under heavy criticism of the judicial review process, the controversy was seen as responsible for his government losing its assurance, and he eventually lost office in the 1965 election. He relinquished the party leadership to Steele Hall and retired at the next election, serving on various South Australian company boards {{until his death in}} 1981.|$|E

5|$|Groth {{spent the}} 1949 {{season with the}} Kansas City Blues, {{finishing}} with a 12–9 record, a 4.28 ERA, and 162 innings pitched. When the 1950 season began, the New York Yankees had five holdouts (players who <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> money and would not sign their contracts). Groth was one of them, and was the only minor leaguer to hold out. He eventually signed his contract with Kansas City, and after spring training ended, Groth {{was sent to the}} Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, the Yankees' AAA minor league affiliate. The Yankees sent Groth to the Oaks to make up for sending over George Earl Toolson last season, who the Oaks had to return because his condition was poor. Groth finished the season with a 7–11 record and a 5.09 ERA. In January 1951, the Oaks sold Groth to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League, now a farm team of the Philadelphia Phillies. He struggled in ten appearances, finishing with an ERA of 7.58, and was sent to the Chattanooga Lookouts, the AA minor league team of the Washington Senators. He pitched in 26 games for the Lookouts, finishing with a 3–8 record and a 6.29 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Leto {{played his}} first video {{game at the}} age of five, playing Super Mario Bros. In his early teens he played and won local video game competitions. At the age of 17, he broke the world record for points scored in the video game Crazy Taxi, and when Twin Galaxies, which records video game records, <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> proof, he {{recorded}} a video of beating his own record. He then spent the next year focused on breaking video game records and eventually broke 742 of them. He had the highest number of records ever achieved until Tom Duncan surpassed him. Originally Zyos was interested in going to DigiPen Institute of Technology to learn how to create video games, but found it intense and that it was not his passion. Having dropped out of college, he later left his job at an ice cream shop at age 19 and began pursuing a career in professional gaming. In late 2002 Leto competed at AGP1, his first video game tournament, and though his team placed fifth, he ranked second individually out of three hundred players.|$|E
5|$|The Yakamas {{also have}} a legend {{attempting}} to explain Adams’ squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the Goat Rocks), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), Rainier, and St. Helens. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now {{the first to be}} greeted, but <b>wanted</b> <b>more,</b> so she crossed the Columbia and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee (the Three Sisters) convinced Wyeast (Hood) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken {{with the rest of the}} mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The Great Spirit had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.|$|E

5|$|The {{multiplayer}} gameplay {{itself was}} inspired by older strategy games, in particular, 1989's Herzog Zwei; in this game, the player controlled a transforming aircraft mecha that would normally fly about the field to issue orders for constructing new units, airlifting units to other areas, and directing combat, but the player could opt to transform the craft into a giant robot and engage directly in combat. For Brütal Legend, Schafer kept the same concept of a split-mode RTS, but <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> focus on the ground combat; instead of spending 90% of the time controlling units as in Zwei, the player would only spend about 30% in this fashion within Brütal Legend. This subsequently led {{to much of the}} action and combat-driven gameplay outside of the stage battles. In a 2015 interview, Schafer said that much of the gameplay outside of stage battles were to provide tutorials for the Stage Battles, and to make the game more of an action-adventure than an RTS to avoid the stigma that impacts sales of RTS games. This caused the production to expand considerably around the merger of Vivendi-Activision, and Double Fine had difficulties convincing the new publishers to fund the expanded game.|$|E
5|$|The second depot-laying party left Framheim on 22February, {{with eight}} men, seven sledges and forty-two dogs. Conditions on the Barrier had {{deteriorated}} sharply; average temperatures had dropped by 9°C (16°F), and rough snow had drifted across the previously smooth ice surface. In temperatures sometimes {{as low as}} , on 3March the party reached 81°S, where they established a second depot. Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Prestrud, Johansen and Wisting then continued with the strongest dogs, hoping to reach 83°S, but in difficult conditions they halted at 82°S on 8March. Amundsen {{could see that the}} dogs were exhausted; the party turned for home, and with light sledges travelled swiftly to reach Framheim on 22 March. Amundsen <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> supplies taken south before the impending polar night made travel impossible, and on 31 March a party of seven men led by Johansen left Framheim for the 80°S depot with six slaughtered seals— of meat. The party returned on 11 April—three days later than expected—after they strayed into a field of crevasses.|$|E
5|$|When Randall {{returned}} to Washington in 1881 {{to begin his}} term in the 47th Congress, the legislature was controlled by Republicans. After Garfield's assassination later that year, Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency. Arthur, like most Republicans, favored high tariffs, but he sought to simplify the tariff structure and to reduce excise taxes. Randall, who had {{returned to}} his seat on the Appropriations Committee, favored the president's plan, and was among the few Democrats in the House to support the it. The bill {{that emerged from the}} Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, provided for only a 10 percent reduction. After conference with the Senate, the resulting bill had an even smaller effect, reducing tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. It passed both houses narrowly on March3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law. Toward the end, Randall took less part in the debate, feeling the tension between his supporters in the House, who <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> reductions, and his constituents at home, who wanted less.|$|E
