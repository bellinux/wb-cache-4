50|$|Despite ploys such as telling Havok {{that his}} {{teammates}} are dead and it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>Alex's</b> fault, Havok remains defiant. Alex Summers {{was last seen}} displaying energy coming from his left hand proving that he had at least some power left.|$|R

50|$|In {{this extra}} episode, set just before Natalia meets Barry, Natalia {{wakes up in}} a dream like state, being greeted by Lottie, her {{favorite}} teddy bear. She goes on a search for Lottie after this. Joining her is 'Dark Natalia' who can sense the presence of monsters so that Natalia can sneak past them through a somewhat Silent Hill-esque atmosphere. They find various postcards sent by Lottie scattered around and eventually find him on a beach, but this <b>was</b> <b>all</b> a trick by Alex Wesker to lure Natalia there, as the other Natalia vanishes as well. At this point, Natalia snaps out of her dream and sees Barry's boat approaching. This <b>was</b> really <b>all</b> of <b>Alex's</b> plan to take her consciousness over Natalia's.|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Swindol, of Monsters and Critics {{said that}} [...] "the film is crap {{and that you}} get the {{impression}} that one or the other used the same screenplay and one was with spiders and the other with monkeys since the supporting players <b>are</b> <b>all</b> archetypes." [...] <b>Alex</b> Hanson, of Chud.com, said that it was a mistake that he watched the film, hoping to be at least a little entertained. Scott Weinberg, of FEARnet, said that the film is amazingly, stunningly bad in every possible respect—and is therefore frequently hilarious, and possibly worthy of a look the next time it pops up on the Sci-Fi Channel.|$|R

50|$|As appeared, Ashley remains {{upset that}} Jimmy has been shot, as does Craig Manning. Kate Kerwin, Spike, Snake, Joey and Caitin <b>all</b> seem to <b>be</b> in horror {{due to the}} {{previous}} events, Paige and Hazel are distraught as they look at Jimmy in the hospital bed from {{the window in the}} hospital. Also, Toby and Emma are upset but mostly shocked, Sean is honored as a hero but feels guilty and shocked, Ellie's feelings are unspecified, but it can be assumed that she is shocked as well, as she is later seen comforting Sean while they watch the news,Darcy Edwards is unseen in either episode therefore her feelings are unclear as well, seeing as she never knew why so many picked on Rick in the first place. JT Yorke and Danny Van Zandt are not seen after the shooting, just prior to it, so their reactions are unclear, Jay does not appear to <b>be</b> affected at <b>all,</b> <b>Alex's</b> feelings towards the event are not revealed yet, however, she tells Jay and Spinner that she should never have gotten involved in this, and Spinner is guilt-ridden for Jimmy, as he is seen crying many times.|$|R

50|$|In {{the pages}} of Infinite Crisis, it was {{revealed}} by Alexander Luthor, Jr. that he had sent Superboy-Prime to recover the black diamond and that the Psycho-Pirate delivered it to Loring on Alex's orders and manipulated Eclipso into manipulating the Spectre. This <b>was</b> <b>all</b> done {{in the interests of}} breaking magic down into raw magical energy, which Alexander could use for his own ends. The death of Shazam was particularly useful, as his various champions then became a tether of power. <b>All</b> <b>Alex</b> had to do was capture one of them, make them say 'Shazam' and they would summon their lightning bolt to power his machine.|$|R

5000|$|The film is {{not well}} regarded, being the last in the series before its cancellation, and barely a [...] "ghost story" [...] at <b>all.</b> <b>Alex</b> Davison, writing an essay for the BFI's 2012 release of the ghost stories states [...] "Although The Ice House boasts some eerie scenes, it never quite recauptures the chillls of Clark's set pieces" [...] but notes it is [...] "arguably the most daringly {{experimental}} film of the A Ghost Story for Christmas series".|$|R
