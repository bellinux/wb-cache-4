2500|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} to make desecration of the Australian flag a crime. In 1953, during the second reading debate on the Flags Act, {{the leader of the}} Opposition, Arthur Calwell, unsuccessfully called for provisions {{to be added to the}} bill to criminalise desecration. Michael Cobb introduced private member's bills in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 to ban desecration, but on each occasion the bill lapsed. In 2002, the leader of the National Party, John Anderson, proposed to introduce laws banning desecration of the Australian flag, a call that attracted support from some parliamentarians both in his own party and the senior Coalition partner, the Liberal Party. The Prime Minister, John Howard, rejected the calls stating that [...] "...in the end I guess it's part of the sort of free speech code that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country". In 2003, the Australian Flags (Desecration of the Flag) Bill was tabled in Parliament by Trish Draper without support from Howard and subsequently lapsed. In 2006, following a flag-burning incident during the 2005 Cronulla riots and a burnt flag display by a Melbourne artist, Liberal MP Bronwyn Bishop introduced the Protection of the Australian National Flag (Desecration of the Flag) Bill 2006. This bill sought to make it [...] "a criminal offence to wilfully destroy or otherwise mutilate the Flag in circumstances where a reasonable person would infer that the destruction or mutilation is intended publicly to express contempt or disrespect for the Flag or the Australian Nation." [...] The bill received a second reading but subsequently lapsed and did not go to vote in the House of Representatives.|$|E

30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Figure  2 a, because, in {{our initial}} approach, we are unable to {{partition}} data, we pin data to premise (account and holding) and so as expected, this forces significant amounts of code to stay on premise. However, as can also be seen from Figure  2 a, some code can be moved to the cloud and our initial investigation (reported in section  3) explores what flexibility <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> placement and the resulting performance and cost trade-offs.|$|R

In other words, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> shown <b>in</b> <b>this</b> note, every complete and atomic Boolean algebra can be represented by its own triangular norms. What <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not shown <b>in</b> <b>this</b> paper is our belief that τ_γ is not unique for B and that, for such a representation, B needs neither to be complete, nor to be atomic...|$|R

60|$|And I may {{add that}} another {{extraordinary}} {{feature of the}} Judge's conduct in this canvass--made more extraordinary by this incident--is, {{that he is in}} the habit, in almost all the speeches he makes, of charging falsehood upon his adversaries, myself and others. I now ask whether he is able to find in anything that Judge Trumbull, for instance, has said, or in anything that I have said, a justification at all compared with what <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> instance, for that sort of vulgarity.|$|E
6000|$|Now, I say, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world borne {{the image}} of our first father; so, at that day, we shall have {{the image of}} Jesus Christ, and be as he is--"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne {{the image of the}} earthy, we shall also, (at our resurrection,) bear the image of the heavenly" [...] (1 Cor 15:48,49).

In it there is an evident transfer of power with the transfer of each particle of the anion or cathion present, to the next particles of the cathion or anion; and {{as the amount of}} power is definite, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way a means of localizing as it were the force, identifying it by the particle and dealing it out in successive portions, which leads, I think, to very striking results.|$|E

That controversy necessarily springs from difference of opinion, and if we can learn exactly--can reduce to the lowest elements--what that difference of opinion is, we perhaps shall be better prepared for discussing the different systems of policy that we would propose in regard to that disturbing element.|$|E
