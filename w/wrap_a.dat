5|$|While blank {{variety is}} the {{defining}} demarcation between one Balabushka cue and another, {{there are some}} shared features spanning Balabushka's fleeting 16-year career. Cue forearms were characteristically made with straight-grained maple, based on Balabushka's belief that a single-direction maple grain provided superior integrity to that of curly maple or birdseye maple. He used stainless steel joints and delrin butt caps almost exclusively. A small number of his cues feature ivory joints and ivory butt caps, making them highly valued collector's items. Balabushka used a distinguishing reddish-brown bumper, and employed Cortland Irish linen for many of his wraps, with the highly sought after leather <b>wrap</b> <b>a</b> rare departure for him and a distinct value enhancer. Unless a different length was specified, Balabushka made all his cues to a standard 57½ inches in length.|$|E

25|$|The Blob is {{vulnerable}} to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears {{do not have the}} same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, Sleepwalker defeated the Blob by using warp beams to <b>wrap</b> <b>a</b> steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain. The Hulk once took the opposite approach, harming the Blob by grabbing and stretching his flab. While he is all but invulnerable to direct kinetic attacks, such as punches, kicks or gunshots, he is susceptible to concussions and other harm resulting from sufficiently powerful impacts, as Daredevil knocked him out by luring him underneath a massive bell and then having it dropped on him with the aid of a young female mutant.|$|E
25|$|With regular police {{raids on}} people {{known to be}} {{supportive}} of the Angry Brigade and with Mendleson a wanted person (although for cheque fraud only), the police were interested in finding any addresses where she might be found. Mendleson was keeping in regular touch with her family in Stockport and a police informer there passed the Amhurst Road address to police on 18 August 1971. An observation was set up and when Jim Greenfield was seen leaving the flat, a search warrant was obtained. At 4:15 PM on 20 August the police entered the flat and arrested Mendleson, Creek, Barker and Greenfield. Mendleson again gave her name as 'Nancy Pye'. The police reported that their searches of 359 Amhurst Road discovered not only duplicating equipment on which Angry Brigade publications had been produced, but a stick of gelignite, two submachine guns, a Browning pistol and 81 rounds of ammunition. Mendleson was remanded in custody at Holloway Prison and was eventually charged with possession of the armaments and conspiracy to cause explosions. Mendleson's fingerprints were found on a copy of Rolling Stone magazine used to <b>wrap</b> <b>a</b> bomb planted at the Italian consulate in Manchester, and she was also charged with attempting to cause this explosion.|$|E

25|$|KSTP-TV {{presently}} broadcasts 37 {{hours of}} locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours on weekdays, and 3½ hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). Combined with sister station KSTC's 16 hours of news weekly, KSTP produces the most local news {{content in the}} market. In addition, the station produces a political discussion show called At Issue, which is hosted by Tom Hauser, with former state governor Wendell Anderson as a regular guest; and Sports <b>Wrap,</b> <b>a</b> sports highlight program that airs on Sunday evenings at 10:45p.m. and on special occasions, such as when KSTP airs ESPN Monday Night Football telecasts featuring the Minnesota Vikings, or {{the final game of}} the NBA Finals. The station formerly ran a Friday night edition of the program focusing on high school sports that aired from September through May. These segments were usually hosted by Rod Simons and Anne Hutchinson, but Simons was later fired by the station in 2008 and Hutchinson also was let go in December of that year. A week prior to Hutchinson's departure, High School Sports Wrap was canceled due to low revenues. For much of the time since the 1980s, KQRS-FM morning show host Tom Barnard has served as the station's voice-over announcer.|$|E

A documentary in 1998 revealed tonnes of edible food being discarded at a Tesco store, provoking a renewed response on the issue of food waste. In 2000, the government created the Waste & Resources Action Programme (<b>WRAP),</b> <b>a</b> government-funded, not-for-profit company that advises on how to reduce waste and use resources efficiently. In 2007, WRAP launched the [...] "Love Food, Hate Waste" [...] campaign and returned food waste to the forefront of the news and public agenda.

The domain wall is constructed explicitly as an M 5 -brane <b>wrapping</b> <b>an</b> associative 3 -cycle. The tension is found to be the integral of a calibrating form.

Also in January, Cheadle confirmed that reshooting was taking place in Manhattan Beach. Shooting also took place on the week of January 23, 2013 at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. A major part of the content filmed in the reshoots regarded the Mandarin, with Drew Pearce saying that in early cuts, the character [...] "didn't feel real enough — there wasn't a sense of him being [...] the real world, mostly because he was just looking down a lens and threatening the world."

500|$|On the Confessions Tour, [...] "Lucky Star" [...] was {{performed}} with Madonna {{dressed in a}} purple and white leotard, designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier.

The intro to [...] "Lucky Star" [...] is heard, Madonna gets up and faces the audience. The lights go off and Madonna opens the cape to reveal {{the inside of the}} cape to be lit. Her backup singers join her and together they move around the stage, while singing the song. Towards the end of the song, Madonna also sings the chorus of the next performance, [...] "Hung Up". The performance was included on both the CD and the DVD version of The Confessions Tour, released in 2007. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine compared Madonna's performance of [...] "Lucky Star" [...] as [...] "a soul butterfly fluttering to the disco heavens during a remix of [...] that actually makes [...] sound good." [...] Thomas Inskeep from Stylus called the performance fresh. Christian John Wikane from PopMatters was not impressed with the performance; he felt that singing the song over the newly arranged chord progression, is cold and pairing the original arrangement with the ABBA sample is [...] " [...] match not made in heaven, though Madonna's skin-tight, ABBA-esque jump suit is an amusing intertextualization." ...|$|E

2500|$|Built between 1904 and 1905, the Martin House is {{distinguished}} from Wright's other prairie style houses by its unusually large size and open plan. On {{the ground floor}} an entry hall bisects the house. To the right, behind a large double sided hearth, is a central living room. The room is flanked by a dining room and library which together create a long continuous space. The other axis, centered on the hearth, continues the living room out to a large covered veranda. To {{the left of the}} entry hall, is a reception room similar in size to the living room, the kitchen, and several smaller rooms. A separate mass provides for a reception room hearth, and one to the level above. The wing completes with a porte-cochère balancing the veranda. Above the entry hall, stairs <b>wrap</b> <b>a</b> small covered light well opening to the second floor. This floor provides eight bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a sewing room. The entry hall continues on axis to the pergola and conservatory beyond.|$|E

He had a way he could <b>wrap</b> <b>a</b> melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that’s part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there’s not too many people that have that many options with their voice.
