5|$|As a diplodocid, it is {{probable}} that Dinheirosaurus possessed a whip-tail. If it did, it is likely that its tail could be used like a bullwhip, with supersonic speed. Being related to both Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, Dinheirosaurus probably possessed a squared snout. This means that it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> non-selective ground-feeding sauropod.|$|E
5|$|Chesney married Margaret de Lucy, who <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> {{relative}} of Richard de Lucy, another of Stephen's main supporters. He died sometime between 1172 and 1176. Chesney's heir was his niece Matilda, whom King Henry II married to Henry fitzGerold, a royal chamberlain.|$|E
5|$|Hygeberht (died after 803) was the Bishop of Lichfield from 779 and Archbishop of Lichfield {{after the}} {{elevation}} of Lichfield to an archdiocese some time after 787, {{during the reign of}} the powerful Mercian king Offa. Little is known of Hygeberht's background, although he <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> native of Mercia.|$|E
25|$|If the loops lie {{across the}} shoe (left to right), the knot <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> square knot. If they lie along the shoe (heel to toe), the knot <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> granny knot.|$|R
2500|$|... "Phyllonorycter" [...] fennicella Hering, 1924, {{this species}} was {{described}} from Finland. The larval hostplant <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> Salix species. The present taxonomic status is unknown, but <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> junior subjective synonym of Lithocolletis viminetorum or Lithocolletis salictella.|$|R
50|$|Bythinella bouloti <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> troglobite.|$|R
5|$|In 906, al-Muktafi {{married a}} {{daughter}} of the second Tulunid ruler, Khumarawayh. She <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> half-sister of the famous Qatr al-Nada, another daughter of Khumarawayh who was intended for him but ended up being married to his father in 893.|$|E
5|$|Like other catarrhine primates, Saadanius <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> tree-dweller (arboreal). During {{the time}} it would have lived, the Red Sea had not yet formed, and new {{plant and animal species}} would have been {{arriving}} from nearby Eurasia as it converged with the Afro-Arabian landmass.|$|E
5|$|Structure 54 {{is built}} upon Terrace8, {{to the north}} of Structure46, in the North Group. It is {{surrounded}} by an open area without mounds that <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> mixed residential and agricultural area. It dates from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.|$|E
50|$|The larva <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> case maker.|$|R
50|$|The name <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> Rhaeto-Romance term.|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> attack {{aircraft}} dispersal base.|$|R
5|$|Yagan {{is thought}} to have been born around 1795. His father was Midgegooroo, an elder of the Beeliar people; his mother was presumably one of Midgegooroo's two wives. Yagan <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> Ballaroke in the Noongar classification.|$|E
5|$|A watch post {{existed on}} Punta di Santa Maria (now known as Tigné Point after the fort) in 1417. The post <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> small unfortified structure, which was manned by three persons. The {{peninsula}} {{played a significant}} role during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, when the invading Ottomans built a battery on it in order to bombard Fort Saint Elmo. After the siege, the peninsula became known as Dragut Point after the Ottoman corsair Dragut.|$|E
5|$|Godwin's wife, and {{the mother}} of his {{children}} including Harold and Edith, was Gytha Thorkelsdóttir. Her father was Thorgils Sprakaleg, a Dane whose origin is unknown, although he <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> Dane from Scania, which was then in Denmark but is now part of Sweden. Gytha was very well connected as her brother Ulf married King Cnut's sister Estrith. Cnut probably arranged the marriage between Godwin and Gytha in about 1022.|$|E
50|$|This keratopathy <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> type of drug-induced lipidosis.|$|R
50|$|The diet of {{this species}} <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> ctenostome bryozoan.|$|R
50|$|The diet of {{this species}} <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> encrusting bryozoan.|$|R
5|$|II (Sturm)./JG 4 {{took off}} for Le Culot at 08:08. Getting lost, they {{stumbled}} upon Asch airfield and claimed one P-47 destroyed and two twin-engine aircraft damaged, {{as well as two}} trains and trucks destroyed. The unit claimed an Auster reconnaissance aircraft shot down. The machine <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> Stinson L-1 Vigilant of the 125th Liaison Squadron, U.S. Army. However, virtually the entire Gruppe of 17 Fw 190s was wiped out.|$|E
5|$|Lichton enjoyed an amicable {{relationship}} with the most powerful magnate in the area, Alexander Stewart, Lord of Badenoch and Earl of Mar, as Lichton appears to have suffered no harassment, attended the latter's marriage to Isabella, Countess of Mar back in 1404 and procured for him an annulment of that marriage when Stewart chose to remarry in 1415. Lichton <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> kinsman of Stewart, as he {{is described as a}} kinsman of Stewart's uncle, Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, the man who ruled Scotland as governor until his death in 1420.|$|E
5|$|Motul de San José {{was first}} settled between 600 and 300 BC, {{in the latter}} portion of the Middle Preclassic period, when it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> fairly small site. At this time some of its {{satellite}} sites were also settled, including La Trinidad de Nosotros and Buena Vista, both of {{which would have been}} small villages at this time, and they may have been settled even earlier in the Middle Preclassic, between 800 and 600 BC.|$|E
50|$|Wimanornis <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> synonym of {{this species}} (Jadwiszcak, 2006).|$|R
50|$|Hideo Nomo: Tezuka {{thinks that}} his fastball <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> gyroball.|$|R
50|$|The hostplant is unknown, but it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> Populus species.|$|R
5|$|New {{specimens}} {{were not}} described {{for many years}} following {{the activity of the}} early 1900s. In 1964 John Ostrom noted that an old species named by Othniel Charles Marsh, Hadrosaurus paucidens, based on USNM 5457, a partial maxilla and squamosal from the Judith River Formation of Fergus County, Montana, <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> specimen of Lambeosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Niobium was {{identified}} by English chemist Charles Hatchett in 1801. He {{found a new}} element in a mineral sample that {{had been sent to}} England from Connecticut, United States in 1734 by John Winthrop F.R.S. (grandson of John Winthrop the Younger) and named the mineral columbite and the new element columbium after Columbia, the poetical name for the United States. The columbium discovered by Hatchett <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> mixture of the new element with tantalum.|$|E
5|$|Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg {{described}} Lagrivea vireti in 2002 in {{a review}} of the ages and faunas of the Miocene fossil sites of La Grive-Saint-Alban in southeastern France. They suggested that it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> tree squirrel and related to the Sciurini. Lagrivea belongs to the squirrel family (Sciuridae), which first appears in the Late Eocene of North America and Early Oligocene of Europe. The specific name, vireti, honors Jean Viret for his work on the mammals of La Grive-Saint-Alban.|$|E
50|$|The species <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> {{hybrid of}} Belenois thysa and Belenois zochalia.|$|R
50|$|The larva <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> case-maker, {{and it may}} feed on lichens.|$|R
5000|$|... "Net River" [...] <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> English {{translation}} of the Ojibwe-language name.|$|R
5|$|Sanmee {{and colleagues}} {{mention that the}} eastern North American species A.frostiana resembles A.rubrovoltata {{slightly}}, but the former has short grooves {{at the edge of}} a yellowish-orange cap, slightly larger spores, a yellow volva, and clamps at the basidial bases. Roger Heim reported A.frostiana as occurring in Thailand, but this <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> misidentification of A.rubrovolvata.|$|E
5|$|The Bronze Age {{began in}} Scotland about 2000 BCE as new {{techniques}} of metalworking began to reach northern Britain. The creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued. There <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> fall in population in this period. There {{is evidence of}} cellular round houses of stone on Shetland and wooden crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on artificial islands. As elsewhere in Europe, hill forts were first introduced in this period.|$|E
5|$|The Persian strategy, on {{the other}} hand, was {{probably}} principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and no match for hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of Thermopylae and Plataea.) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> reluctance to attack the Athenians head-on.|$|E
5000|$|The diet of {{this species}} is unknown but <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> bryozoan.|$|R
50|$|Hanno I the Great <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> {{ancestor}} of Hanno II the Great.|$|R
50|$|In Norse mythology Beli <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> giant. He <b>was</b> {{killed by}} Freyr.|$|R
