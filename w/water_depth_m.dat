5000|$|River {{incision}} is {{the narrow}} erosion {{caused by a}} river or stream that is far from its base level. River incision is common after tectonic uplift of the landscape. Incision by multiple rivers result in a dissected landscape, for example a dissected plateau. River Incision is the natural process by which a river cuts downward into its bed, deepening the active channel. Though it is a natural process, it can be accelerated rapidly by human factors including land use changes such as timber harvest, mining, agriculture, and road and dam construction. The rate of incision {{is a function of}} basal shear-stress. Shear stress is increased by factors such as sediment in the water, which increase its density (Lague, et. al. 2005). Shear stress is defined as , where t= Shear Stress (N/m2), g= Weight Density of Water (N/m3, lb/ft [...] ), D = Average <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> (<b>m,</b> ft), and Sw = Water Surface slope (m/m, ft/ft). Increases in slope, depth, or density of water increase the water’s potential to cause erosion (Lague 2014).|$|E

From this study, we expected to know how far the influence of each factors as well as the mathematical models of it. This study results shows that the density of the bamboo platform lift net greatly affect the fishing gear productivity, that the higher the density number will lead to further decline in the fishing gear productivity. The water depth also has an effect, in which the deeper the waters of the fishing gear, the more catch result get. The other factors such as the time dummy and hauling time influence less on the catch. The optimum density number is < 5 unit/ha, as the optimum water depth is ? 26, 2 m...|$|E
40|$|Fukushima Daiichi nuclear {{disaster}} led to radioactive contamination crisis was {{resulted from a}} series of system failures, nuclear meltdown and radioactive material releases, following the 9. 0 magnitude of earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011. The objectives of this study were; to investigate the movement of radionuclides based on oceanography and morphology of Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia (Malaysia); to estimate the time for radionuclides to reach Malaysia and to calculate the amount of total absorbed dose rate for selected marine biotas namely benthic fish and pelagic fish. ERICA code system was used because it has the ERICA integrated approach to assess the radiation risk of biota. The estimations of radionuclide discharge from Fukushima Daiichi {{nuclear disaster}} were based on Cs- 137 (half-life of 30. 17 years), I- 131 (half-life of 0. 02 years). The parameters such as discharge rate of radionuclides (Bq/s), <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> (<b>m),</b> the distance between the target coast of Malaysia and radionuclide release point (m), the distance between the receptor and radionuclide release (m) and the velocity of the water/ocean currents (m/s) were studied. The results showed that the minimum estimated arrival time of radionuclides to reach Malaysia is located in Sandakan, Sabah, which is approximated at 4. 82 years (Dec 2015) with an average of 5. 039 ± 0. 310 years after the accident. Meanwhile, maximum estimated arrival time of radionuclides to Malacca is 5. 87 years (Jan 2017) with an average of 5. 527 ± 0. 480 years. The lowest estimated total absorbed dose rate by benthic fish is 0. 0583 μGy/h with an average of (6. 33 ± 0. 71) × 10 - 2 μGy/h in Malacca whereas the highest estimated total absorbed dose rate by benthic fish is 0. 0751 μGy/h with an average of (7. 11 ± 0. 57) × 10 - 2 μGy/h in Sandakan, Sabah. Pelagic fish in Malacca shows the lowest estimated total absorbed dose rate of 0. 00149 μGy/h with an average of (1. 62 ± 0. 18) × 10 - 3 μGy/h whereas Sandakan, Sabah showed the highest estimated total absorbed dose rate of 0. 00193 μGy/h with an average of (1. 83 ± 0. 15) × 10 - 3 μGy/h. The total absorbed dose rate and risk quotient of ERICA code system show that for all reference organisms, the probability of exceeding the selected screening dose rate of 400 μGy/h by aquatic biota is below the probability selected. Therefore, no measurable population of chronic exposure effects would occur at this stage. Nonetheless, a normal experimental analysis of fish samples should be performed in order to monitor the radiation effects to marine ecosystem...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{continuing}} program of organic-geochemistry studies of sediments recovered by the Deep Sea Drilling Project, we have analyzed the types, amounts, and thermal-alteration indices of organic matter in samples collected from the landward wall of the Japan Trench on Legs 56 and 57. The samples were canned aboard ship, enabling us to measure also their gas contents. In addition, we analyzed the heavy C 15 + hydrocarbons, NSO compounds, and asphaltenes extracted from selected samples. Our samples form a transect down the trench wall, from Holes 438 and 438 A (<b>water</b> <b>depth</b> 1558 <b>m),</b> through Holes 435 and 435 A (<b>water</b> <b>depth</b> 3401 <b>m),</b> and 440 (<b>water</b> <b>depth</b> 4507 <b>m),</b> to Holes 434 and 434 B (<b>water</b> <b>depth</b> 5986 <b>m).</b> The trench wall is the continental slope of Japan.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to study the {{community}} structure, in terms of species composition, abundance and spatial distribution, of fish larvae in a wide coastal area of Sicily facing the south-eastern Tyrrhenian Sea (central Mediterranean). This study analyses how species are assembled in relation to an inshore-offshore gradient and also how environmental conditions, determined by surface circulation patterns occurring in the Central Mediterranean at the local scale, determine the distribution patterns. Samples from a total of 63 stations were collected using a 60 cm Bongo net, during two ichthyoplanktonic surveys carried out in June 2006 and in April 2007. The physical and chemical features (temperature, salinity, oxygen and fluorescence) were continuously registered by a multiparametric probe Sea Bird 911 Plus equipped with a Seapoint fluorometer. Rough data of <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> (<b>m),</b> temperature (°C), salinity and fluorescence were processed with the ODV software to obtain vertical profiles in real time. Samples were fixed in 4 % borax-buffered formalin immediately after capture and then analyzed in the laboratory. The number of larvae collected for each station was standardized per 10 m 2 sea surface. Data of abundance were averaged and normalized and then mapped using the deterministic interpolation method Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). The species frequency of occurrence (in percentage) was estimated as the ratio between number of samples in which the species was found {{by the total number of}} samples collected. The use of a combination of a frequency index and abundance is important because certain species may be caught several times but with few specimens or they may be collected a few times but with a large number of specimens. All specimens were measured as Total length (TL), Notochord length (NL), for larvae in preflexion stage and standard length (SL), for flexion and postflexion larvae. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed to analyse species contribution to station ordination and the influence of environmental variables (temperature, salinity oxygen and fluorescence). Sixty-five taxa, representing thirty-six families, were identified. Cyclothone braueri (57. 5 %), and Engraulis encrasicolus (8. 9 %) were the most abundant species during the survey of June 2006, while Myctophum punctatum (22. 4 %) and Cyclothone braueri (11. 7 %) were the most abundant species during the survey of April 2007. Multivariate CCA analysis during June 2006 sampling showed that the CCA 1 axis accounted for the greatest percentage (79. 8 %) of total variance (Fig. 1). Of the different environmental parameters considered, temperature showed the highest negative score with the CCA 1 axis (- 0. 97), followed by Salinity (0. 82). Twenty-six larval fish species showed a negative or positive high score with the CCA 1 axis. Twenty-five stations showed a negative or positive high score with the CCA 1 axis. Regarding the species contribution to stations ordination, the aggregation of species was linked to the inshore and offshore stations. The species Trachinus draco, Diplodus annularis, Engraulis encrasicolus, Oblada melanura, Serranus cabrilla and Arnoglossus laterna, were mainly present at inshore stations and were influenced by temperature. The species Lampanyctus pusillus, L. crocodilus, Benthosema glaciale, Notoscopelus elongatus, Stomias boa, Cyclothone pygmaea, Myctophum punctatum, Lobianchia dofleini, Paralepis speciosa, Lestidiops jayakari, Trachurus mediterraneus and Nemichthys scolopaceus were mainly present at offshore stations and were influenced by Salinity and Fluorescence (Fig. 1). Multivariate CCA analysis during April 2007 sampling showed that the CCA 1 axis accounted for the greatest percentage (55. 4 %) of total variance (Fig. 2). Of the different environmental parameters considered, oxygen showed the highest negative score with the CCA 1 axis (- 0. 63), while salinity showed the highest positive score (0. 62). Fourteen stations showed a negative or positive high score with the CCA 1 axis. Regarding the species contribution to stations ordination, the species Nezumia aequalis, Spicara smaris, Glossanodon leioglossus, Ceratoscopelus maderensis, Paralepis speciosa, Arnoglossus thori, Synchiropus phaeton, Hygophum hygomi were mainly influenced by salinity, while the species Carapus acus, Boops boops, Diaphus holti e Cyclothone braueri, Gobius niger, Trachurus trachurus and Actozenus risso were mainly influenced by temperature and some mesopelagic species as Lampanyctus pusillus, Myctophum punctatum and Notoscopelus were mainly influenced by fluorescence, depth and oxygen (Fig. 2). The results showed that the highest abundance value was observed in the western part of the study area. MDS and CCA analyses revealed well-defined groups of stations and assemblages of larvae in accordance with an inshore-offshore gradient. The mesoscale circulation in the Tyrrhenian Sea is generally cyclonic along the Sicilian and Italian peninsula shelves, with a general W-to-E path interacting with a recirculation cell located on the northern side of Sicily. Our results show that the study area which is located at the southern border of this cell, close to the Sicilian coast, presents a water mass structure typical of the early summer season, thereby confirming the results reported by Azzaro et al. (2003). Temperature and salinity conditions, between the surface and the 150 m depth, show the typical features of the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea, where the fresher Modified Atlantic Waters (MAW) flowing from W to E along the Sicilian coast mix with Tyrrhenian Surface Waters (TSW). The Tyrrhenian Intermediate Waters (TIW) are formed here due to the input of Levantine Intermediate Waters, produced in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, that flow into the Tyrrhenian Sea offshore the Egadi Islands very close to the Sicily slope. Temperature and salinity conditions were directly related to the seasonal riverine inputs, which are under the influence of the productive industrial activities operating in the area. In spring, salinity showed strong oscillations at the mouth of the major rivers flowing into the Gulf. Also, in this season, an increase in temperature was observed in coastal and offshore surface waters due to the power plant in Milazzo. The existence of marked pycnoclines, frontal zones (shelf-slope fronts, plumes), upwelling and the effect of eddies may contribute to the concentration of larvae and their prey in aggregates where their survival is greater. The results of this study could have implications for the management of marine resources, because the investigated area has already been identified as a nursery area for many pelagic and coastal fishes and a natural habitat for many species of high commercial interest.
