5|$|The pitch {{invasion}} at the 1924 Paris Olympics {{had given}} rugby a poor image and this, together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> attracting sufficient teams {{to make it}} a viable sport and the desire to include more individual and women's events, spelled the death knell for rugby at the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg, Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese {{positions}} around Finschhafen. Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats, Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse, resulting in disease, malnutrition and privation for the Japanese soldiers. Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea.|$|E

5|$|The Rush vs. Trickett match {{attracted}} {{the largest number}} of spectators ever before gathered at a Sydney sporting event, and the event is part of Australian sporting history. Estimates {{of the size of the}} crowd range from 30,000 to 70,000. Shops and government offices closed for the event, special trains brought people into the city. Steam-ships carrying spectators accompanied the competing champions, and hundreds of smaller, private vessels crowded the river. Special Regulations were published by the Marine Board of the NSW Government to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> regulating maritime traffic during the event.|$|E
5|$|The lens {{exhibits}} significant distortion {{in keeping}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> wide-angle lenses. The complex barrel distortion is approximately 2.9% at 8mm focal length but is fairly insignificant as the focal length is raised above 12mm, according to Photozone.de. PC Magazine reports 3.1% distortion at 8mm and 0.7% at 12mm. It also reports that distortion switches to pincushion distortion of 1.4% at 16mm. SLAR Gear {{reports that the}} point of convergence between barrel and pincushion is about 13mm. Foreground subjects seem abnormally large compared to similar background subjects with this lens.|$|E
5|$|Anglo-Saxon kings ruled through ealdormen, who had {{the highest}} lay status under the king. In ninth-century Wessex they each ruled a single shire, but {{by the middle of}} the tenth they had {{authority}} over a much wider area, a change probably introduced by Æthelstan to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> governing his extended realm. One of the ealdormen, who was also called Æthelstan, governed the eastern Danelaw territory of East Anglia, the largest and wealthiest province of England. After the king's death, he became so powerful that he was known as Æthelstan Half-King. Several of the ealdormen who witnessed charters had Scandinavian names, and while the localities they came from cannot be identified, they were almost certainly the successors of the earls who led Danish armies in the time of Edward the Elder, and who were retained by Æthelstan as his representatives in local government.|$|E

5|$|Foliot {{was elected}} to the see of Hereford in late April 1173 and consecrated on 6 October 1174 at Canterbury by Archbishop Richard of Dover. Hereford had been vacant since the death of Robert of Melun in 1167, due to the Becket's exile and then death. Foliot was either elected by the cathedral chapter without {{guidance}} from the king, or was nominated to the cathedral chapter by King Henry at the urging of his relative Gilbert Foliot. Robert Foliot later attended the Third Lateran Council in 1179. While bishop, he became involved in a disupte with Hugh Parvus, a local baron, over the power of appointment to two churches. He also served as a judge-delegate for the papacy, serving with Roger, the Bishop of Worcester on cases including one between a Norman monastery and an English priory. He judged a number of other cases for the papacy during his time as bishop. He received over 40 surviving papal commissions and communications, some of which dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> married clergy in his diocese. From his ecclesiastical documents, almost 40 survive.|$|E

25|$|Neagle and Syms worked {{together}} again on No Time For Tears (1957), also starring Anthony Quayle and Flora Robson. As directed by Cyril Frankel, {{this was the}} first film for over 20 years where Neagle was directed by someone other than Herbert Wilcox. Set in a children's hospital, the film features Neagle as a matron dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> the patients and the staff, notably a nurse (Syms) infatuated with one of the doctors (George Baker).|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} years after the {{struggle}} for independence, Pramoedya wrote several works of fiction dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> the newly founded nation, as well as semi-autobiographical works based on his wartime memoirs. He was soon able {{to live in the}} Netherlands as part of a cultural exchange program.

Beetham's next appointment was as the Personal Staff Officer to Task Force Commander of Operation Buffalo in 1956.

25|$|Haroun and the Sea of Stories is {{an allegory}} for several {{problems}} existing in society today, {{especially in the}} Indian subcontinent. It looks at these problems {{from the viewpoint of}} the young protagonist Haroun. Rushdie dedicated this book to his son, from whom he was separated for some time. Many elements of the story deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> censorship: an issue particularly pertinent to Rushdie because of the fatwa against him backed by Ayatollah Khomeini. The book is highly allusive and puns in multiple languages. Many of the major character's names allude to some aspect of speech or silence.|$|E
25|$|Chalmers' ideas {{shaped the}} {{breakaway}} group. He stressed a social vision that revived and preserved Scotland's communal traditions {{at a time}} of strain on the social fabric of the country. Chalmers's idealised small equalitarian, kirk-based, self-contained communities that recognised the individuality of their members and the need for co-operation. That vision also affected the mainstream Presbyterian churches, and by the 1870s it had been assimilated by the established Church of Scotland. Chalmers's ideals demonstrated that the church was concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>of</b> urban society, and they represented a real attempt to overcome the social fragmentation that took place in industrial towns and cities.|$|E
