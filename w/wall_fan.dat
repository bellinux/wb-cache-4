2500|$|Approximately an {{hour before}} the Juventus-Liverpool final was due to kick off, Liverpool {{supporters}} charged at Juventus fans and breached a fence that was separating them from a [...] "neutral area". This came after a period of hostility between the two sets of fans which saw missiles thrown by both teams' supporters. The instigators of violence are still unknown, with varying accounts. Juventus fans ran back on the terraces and away from the threat into a concrete retaining <b>wall.</b> <b>Fans</b> already standing near the wall were crushed; eventually the wall collapsed. Many people climbed over to safety, but many others died or were badly injured. The game was played despite the disaster, with Juventus winning 1–0.|$|R

40|$|Summary A rig {{has been}} {{designed}} and constructed to measure the thermal transmittance (U-value) and conductance of test walls 2 m by 2 m in area. The rig is of the guarded hot-box type and is based in principle on details given in the ASTM C 236 - 66 standard. Special measures have been taken {{in the design and}} operation of the rig to improve the accuracy of measurement. The guard system is automatic and controlled from the output of a thermopile on the metering box <b>walls.</b> <b>Fans</b> are used to circulate the air in the metering box and the heat contribution from the fan blades is taken into account in the measurement. Validation tests have been made using a glass fibre panel and the results agree very closely with the calculated thermal transmittance and conductance.

The first row of seats is elevated eight feet above field level. Despite that unusual box seat elevation, those seeking the signatures of the next great BoSox players {{have found a way}} to contact their PawSox, using a technique more common to fans in bleacher seats behind an outfield <b>wall.</b> <b>Fans</b> wishing to have a scorebook, baseball, baseball card, or other souvenir signed by a player will go autograph [...] "fishing". Complete with hook and reel (or, often, a hollowed-out milk jug and a rope), autograph seekers lower their items over the front of the seats and dangle them down in front of the dugouts below. The ballplayers can sign the item, tug on the line, and the fan pulls up their newly autographed memorabilia.|$|R

40|$|Swine {{finishing}} facility ventilation has become relatively complex {{and is often}} mismanaged as a system. One of the few ways to truly understand these systems is to spend time systematically going through the many components {{of the building and}} how they work as a system. To learn to help producers better, a team of university Extension specialists that included agricultural engineers and animal scientists spent an extended period carefully documenting conditions in a deep-pit swine finishing building with two 1, 000 -head rooms. Exhaust fans connected to the manure pit and <b>wall</b> <b>fans</b> were operated at various stages as a negative-pressure ventilation system. A computerized controller activated exhaust fans, a ventilation curtain actuator, heaters, stir fans, and a spray cooling system. Gravity-controlled baffled ceiling inlets were evenly spaced in the building to provide good air distribution during cold and mild weather conditions. Following the review of current conditions and operating parameters, performance deficiencies were identified and recommendations were given regarding controller settings, inlet settings, and the transition to natural ventilation. Specific recommendations included changing minimum ventilation speed settings of fans based on animal size, removing inlet stops during warmer weather to avoid premature transition to natural ventilation, a change in how fans were staged, a change in setpoint, and the specific temperature at which the cooling system was engaged...|$|R
40|$|The ~ 150 km wide Holden crater lies {{in an area}} {{characterized}} by high density of valley networks implying conditions conducive to forming of water-related environments. We undertook geological mapping and a stratigraphic survey in order to probe the evolution of water-related landforms and their paleoenvironmental implications. Our investigations lead us to propose that the Holden area was subjected to a ``wet'' lacustrine phase of Hesperian age and an ``icy'' phase during the Amazonian. Deltaic, coastal, and lacustrine environments occurred during the ``wet'' phase, some displaying a cyclic depositional pattern presumably related to autogenic processes. Water was delivered to the basin by the Uzboi Vallis and by surface runoff channels {{from a series of}} drainage basins along the crater <b>walls.</b> <b>Fan</b> delta geometries and coastal onlap enabled estimation of major water levels. Two levels of major stand of the water have been recognized, possibly reflecting allogenic controls. Geologic units related to this ``wet'' lacustrine phase were subsequently eroded by glacial abrasion and plucking and were disconformably overlain by glacial deposits of Amazonian age, defining an ``icy'' phase. These features are consistent with a warm-based glacier entering the Holden crater through the wide Uzboi Vallis to form a proglacial lake in {{the central part of the}} crater. Changes in sedimentary units reflect changes of depositional environments probably connected with climatic variation...|$|R

50|$|Although {{the base}} is well {{insulated}} by its 0.5 m thick walls and triple-glazed windows, the internal areas have to be actively warmed. This is accomplished by three means. Firstly, the heat generated by the diesel generators is used to heat water for the taps and showers, which is then circulated through the base. Secondly, the same generator heat is used to heat air which is distributed by the climate control system. Thirdly, small electric <b>wall</b> and <b>fan</b> heaters are available in all indoor areas. Efforts are made to maintain the interior temperature at 18 C, although some areas (such as the hangar) do cool well below this in winter.|$|R

40|$|Five {{hundred and}} fifty-five acid workers were {{examined}} between March 1962 and October 1964. One hundred and seventy-six (31 · 7 %) {{were affected by}} industrial dental erosion at the first examinations. In 33 cases (6 · 0 %) the dentine was affected. During {{the period of the}} survey, 66 (20 · 4 %) of 324 workers examined more than once showed evidence that erosion was progressing. The prevalence and incidence of erosion were highest among battery formation workers, lower among picklers, and least among other processes covered by the survey. The age of workers did not appear to influence their susceptibility to erosion. The habit of working with the lips slightly parted had little effect. Erosion superimposed upon attrition predisposed to more severe loss of tooth structure than either operating alone. Little inconvenience or functional disability was suffered by acid workers due to erosion. Twenty-seven (23 · 7 %) of 114 erosions were considered to be disfiguring. Regular dental treatment was sought less by acid workers than by controls, and the oral hygiene of the latter was superior. There was no evidence to show any difference between caries experience among acid workers and controls. Calculus and periodontal disease were more prevalent among acid workers than among controls, but {{it was not possible to}} attribute this to the working environment. Black staining in iron picklers was considered to be due to the working environment. The use of closed acid containers or lip extraction on open acid vats prevented significant atmospheric contamination and diminished the prevalence of erosion. The use of <b>wall</b> <b>fans</b> and detergent foaming agents was helpful...|$|R
50|$|The storyline {{revealed}} that a previous epic storyline entitled Final Invasion {{was set up by}} Tyrant in order to distract Shin from realizing that Tyrant had managed to con him into essentially signing away the rights to the island by slipping in a falsified service provider document.
