5000|$|Made in America is {{composed}} {{in a single}} movement and has a duration of roughly 13 minutes. The main theme {{of the work is}} based on the song [...] "America the Beautiful." [...] Tower described the inspiration for the piece in the score program notes, writing: I crossed a fairly big bridge at the age of nine when my family moved to South America (La Paz, Bolivia), where we stayed for nine years. I had to learn a new language, a new culture, and how to live at 13,000 feet! It was a lively culture with many saints' days celebrated through music and dance, but the large Inca population in Bolivia was generally poor and there was little chance of moving up in class or <b>work</b> <b>position.</b> When I returned to the United States, I was proud to have free choices, upward mobility, and the chance to try to become who I wanted to be. I also enjoyed the basic luxuries of an American citizen that we so often take for granted: hot running water, blankets for the cold winters, floors that are not made of dirt, and easy modes of transportation, among many other things. So when I started composing this piece, the song [...] "America the Beautiful" [...] kept coming into my consciousness and eventually became the main theme for the work. The beauty of the song is undeniable and I loved working with it as a musical idea. One can never take for granted, however, the strength of a musical idea — as Beethoven (one of my strongest influences) knew so well. This theme is challenged by other more aggressive and dissonant ideas that keep interrupting, unsettling it, but [...] "America the Beautiful" [...] keeps resurfacing in different guises (some small and tender, others big and magnanimous), as if to say, [...] "I'm still here, ever changing, but holding my own." [...] A musical struggle is heard throughout the work. Perhaps it was my unconscious reacting to the challenge of how do we keep America beautiful.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This chapter {{describes}} the metrics for the validation of a Remote Tower Control workplace. The study shows how Air Traffic Control Officers (ATCOs) ob-serve traffic from a Tower Control <b>Working</b> <b>Position</b> at Airport Erfurt-Weimar {{in comparison to}} a Remote Controller <b>Working</b> <b>Position.</b> Shadow-mode trials were used to cover perceptual, operational, and human factors aspects of a Remote Tower System, including a live video panorama and a research aircraft. The aircraft was used to fly different maneuvers within the aerodrome. These maneuvers allow insights on the detectability of an aircraft within different distances from the tower and the gathering of operation information about aircraft status. In addition, a vehicle was used to position static objects on the airfield to determine the detectability of these objects for different distances to the Control Tower (RTO-camera system). Eight ATCOs from the DFS participated in the validation exercise. Time-synchronized questionnaires for the controller working position remote (CWP-remote) and the controller working position tower (CWP-tower) were applied, addressing operationally relevant questions to the ATCOs. The validation exercise targets the evaluation of metrics that could help standardize the process of testing Remote Controller <b>Working</b> <b>Positions.</b> The results consider expense of realization, comparability and feasibility as major classifications for the used metrics. Further an approach for combining the classification into one score is presented, to rank the metrics in relation to each other...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examines}} various combinations of {{levels of social}} isolation in private life and peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> as predictors of disability pension (DP). A second aim was to test the potential interaction effects (above additivity) of social isolation and peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> on the future risk of DP, and to provide results {{for men and women}} by age. The study was based on a sample of 45567 women and men from the Swedish population who had been interviewed between 1992 and 2007. Further information on DP and diagnoses was obtained from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency's database (1993 - 2011). The studied predictors were related to DP using Cox's proportional hazard regression. The analyses were stratified on sex and age (20 - 39 years, 40 - 64 years), with control for selected confounders. Increased risks of DP were found for most combinations of social isolation and peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> in all strata. The hazard ratios (HRs) for joint exposure to high degree of social isolation and a peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> were particularly strong among men aged 20 - 39 (HR 5. 70; CI 95 % 3. 74 - 8. 69) and women aged 20 - 39 (HR 4. 07; CI 2. 99 - 5. 56). An interaction effect from combined exposure was found for women in both age groups as well as a tendency in the same direction among young men. However, after confounder control the effects did not reach significance. Individuals who were socially isolated and in a peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> had an increased risk of future DP. The fact that an interaction effect was found among women indicates that a combination of social isolation and peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> may reinforce adverse health effects. There was no evidence that a peripheral <b>work</b> <b>position</b> can be compensated by a high degree of social intergration in private life...|$|E
