She was holding her pale hands before her, wide apart, with the palms turned down, quivering as might doves about to settle; and for all it was so dark, her grey eyes were visible-full of light, with black rims round the irises.

Petworth seemed a possible resting-place, or Pullborough; Midhurst seemed too near, and any {{place over the}} Downs beyond, too far, and so he meandered towards Petworth, posing himself perpetually and loitering, gathering wild flowers and wondering why they had no names--for {{he had never heard}} of any--dropping them furtively {{at the sight of a}} stranger, and generally 'mucking about.' There were purple vetches in the hedges, meadowsweet, honeysuckle, belated brambles--but the dog-roses had already gone; there were green and red blackberries, stellarias, and dandelions, and in another place white dead nettles, traveller's-joy, clinging bedstraw, grasses flowering, <b>white</b> <b>campions,</b> and ragged robins. One cornfield was glorious with poppies, bright scarlet and purple white, and the blue corn-flowers were beginning. In the lanes the trees met overhead, and the wisps of hay still hung to the straggling hedges. Iri one of the main roads he steered a perilous passage through a dozen surly dun oxen. Here and there were little cottages, and picturesque beer-houses with the vivid brewers' boards of blue and scarlet, and once a broad green and a church, and an expanse of some hundred houses or so. Then he came to a pebbly rivulet that emerged between clumps of sedge loosestrife and forget-me-nots under an arch of trees, and rippled across the road, and there he dismounted, longing to take off shoes and stockings--those stylish chequered stockings were now all dimmed with dust--and paddle his lean legs in the chuckling cheerful water. But instead he sat in a manly attitude, smoking a cigarette, for fear lest the Young Lady in Grey should come glittering round the corner. For the flavour of the Young Lady in Grey was present through it all, mixing with the flowers and all the delight of it, a touch that made this second day quite different from the first, an undertone of expectation, anxiety, and something like regret that would not be ignored.|$|R
40|$|The disproportionately large {{involvement}} of the X-chromosome in the isolation of closely related species (the large-X effect) has been reported for many animals, where X-linked genes are mostly hemizygous in the heterogametic sex. The expression of deleterious recessive mutations is thought to drive the frequent {{involvement of}} the X-chromosome in hybrid sterility, {{as well as to}} reduce interspecific gene flow for X-linked genes. Here, we evaluate the role of the X-chromosome in the speciation of two closely related plant species - the <b>white</b> and red <b>campions</b> (Silene latifolia and S. dioica) - that hybridize widely across Europe. The two species evolved separate sexes and sex chromosomes relatively recently (~ 10 (7) years), and unlike most animal species, most X-linked genes have intact Y-linked homologs. We demonstrate that the X-linked genes show a very small and insignificant amount of interspecific gene flow, while gene flow involving autosomal loci is significant and sufficient to homogenise the gene pools of the two species. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of the large-X effect in Silene and comprise the first report of this effect in plants. Non-hemizygosity of many X-linked genes in Silene males indicates that exposure of recessive mutations to selection may not be essential for the occurrence of the large-X effect. Several possible causes of the large-X effect in Silene are discussed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|R

In an attempt to elucidate the origin of these oligosaccharides, we studied two endoglycosidase activities, putative enzymes involved in their formation.

The production of UNGs in the culture medium rose correlatively.

This was correlated with repressed gynoecium development in male flowers. The expression of SLM 4 and SLM 5 in both sexes differed from that of SQUAMOSA in one important aspect.

40|$|Many double-flowered plants, {{in which}} petals replace stamens, are highly valued by the horticultural industry. These mutants exhibit a {{homeotic}} conversion of floral organs and frequently also a meristic increase n floral organ number. By gamma irradiation we generated a novel double-flowered mutant, Sl-dfl, in a male genetic {{background of the}} dioecious plant <b>white</b> <b>campion</b> (Silene latifolia). This mutant shows a homeotic conversion of stamens to petals, together with uncontrolled growth and division of second and third whorl floral organ primordia, causing a proliferation of petal and chimeric petal-stamen organs. We characterize this mutant developmentally by scanning electron microscopy and demonstrate {{that the effects of}} the mutation commence following the formation of a correctly partitioned floral meristem with a wild-type arrangement of organ primordia. We have commenced a molecular investigation of the Sl-dfl mutant by testing the expression and genomic organization of the known <b>white</b> <b>campion</b> putative MADS-box floral homeotic genes. These studies indicate four MADS-box genes to be unlikely to be mutated in the double-flowered mutant. The possibility that a putative C- function MADS-box gene may cause the mutant phenotype has not currently been excluded, though our morphological studies suggest that a C-function mutation is not involved in this case. We conclude that a number of different classes of double-flowered mutation exist, not all of which are currently known from model plant species. This may be indicative of important developmental differences between species and may also emphasize a need for comparative studies of floral development...|$|E
40|$|<b>White</b> <b>campion</b> is a {{dioecious}} {{plant with}} heteromorphic X and Y sex chromosomes. In male plants, a filamentous structure replaces the pistil, while in female plants the stamens degenerate early in flower development. Asexual (asx) mutants, cumulating the two developmental defects {{that characterize the}} sexual dimorphism in this species, were produced by gamma ray irradiation of pollen and screening in the M 1 generation. The mutants harbor a novel type of mutation affecting an early function in sporogenous/parietal cell differentiation within the anther. The function is called stamen-promoting function (SPF). The mutants are shown to result from interstitial deletions on the Y chromosome. We present evidence that such deletions tentatively cover the central domain on the (p) -arm of the Y chromosome (Y 2 region). By comparing stamen development in wild-type female and asx mutant flowers we show that they share the same block in anther development, which results {{in the production of}} vestigial anthers. The data suggest that the SPF, a key function(s) controlling the sporogenous/parietal specialization in premeiotic anthers, is genuinely missing in females (XX constitution). We argue that this is the earliest function in the male program that is Y-linked and is likely responsible for "male dimorphism" (sexual dimorphism in the third floral whorl) in <b>white</b> <b>campion.</b> More generally, the reported results improve our knowledge of the structural and functional organization of the Y chromosome and favor the view that sex determination in this species results primarily from a trigger signal on the Y chromosome (Y 1 region) that suppresses female development.

40|$|The sex {{chromosomes}} of dioecious <b>white</b> <b>campion,</b> Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae), are {{of relatively}} recent origin (10 - 20 million years), providing {{a unique opportunity}} to trace the origin and evolution of sex chromosomes in this genus by comparing closely related Silene species with and without sex chromosomes. Here I demonstrate that four genes that are X-linked in S. latifolia are also linked in nondioecious S. vulgaris, which is consistent with Ohno's (1967) hypothesis that sex chromosomes evolve from a single pair of autosomes. I also report a genetic map for four S. latifolia X-linked genes, SlX 1, DD 44 X, SlX 4, and a new X-linked gene SlssX, which encodes spermidine synthase. The order of the genes on the S. latifolia X chromosome and divergence between the homologous X- and Y-linked copies of these genes supports the "evolutionary strata" model, with at least three consecutive expansions of the nonrecombining region on the Y chromosome (NRY) in this plant species...|$|E
40|$|<b>White</b> <b>campion</b> (Silene latifolia) {{is one of}} the few {{examples}} of plants with separate sexes and with X and Y sex chromosomes. The presence or absence of the Y chromosome determines which type of reproductive organs [...] male or female [...] will develop. Recently, we characterized the first active gene located on a plant Y chromosome, SlY 1, and its X-linked homolog, SlX 1. These genes encode WD-repeat proteins likely to be involved in cell proliferation. Here, we report the characterization of a novel Y-linked gene, SlY 4, which also has a homolog on the X chromosome, SlX 4. Both SlY 4 and SlX 4 potentially encode fructose- 2, 6 -bisphosphatases. A comparative molecular analysis of the two sex-linked loci (SlY 1 /SlX 1 and SlY 4 /SlX 4) suggests selective constraint on both X- and Y-linked genes and thus that both X- and Y-linked copies are functional. Divergence between SlY 4 and SlX 4 is much greater than that between the SlY 1 and SlX 1 genes. These results suggest that, as for human XY-linked genes, the sex-linked plant loci ceased recombining at different times and reveal distinct events in the evolutionary history of the sex chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the effect}} of {{herbivory}} on plant reproduction has been investigated in some detail, {{little is known about}} how herbivores affect floral signalling. Here, we investigated {{the effect of}} foliar herbivory by the African Cotton Leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis) on floral signalling and fruit set in the <b>White</b> <b>Campion</b> (Silene latifolia). We found no effects of herbivory on floral traits involved in visual signalling (flower number, corolla diameter, calyx length, petal length) or in amount of nectar produced. However, Spodoptera-infested plants emitted higher amounts of the two floral volatiles, (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate and β-ocimene, than control plants. Open pollinated, infested plants also were found to produce more fruits than control plants, but only with nocturnal pollinators. Experimental addition of the two induced floral volatiles to non-infested Silene flowers also led to the production of more fruits with nocturnal pollination. This suggests that higher fruit production in herbivore-infested plants was caused by increased nocturnal pollinator attraction, mediated by the induced floral emission of these two volatiles. Our results show that the effects of herbivory on plant reproductive success are not necessarily detrimental, as plants can compensate herbivory with increased investment in pollinator attraction...|$|E
40|$|The most {{prominent}} feature of Y chromosomes {{is that they}} do not recombine and are usually genetically degenerate, containing only a few genes. <b>White</b> <b>campion</b> Silene latifolia has evolved sex chromosomes relatively recently, probably within the last 10 - 15 million years. Perhaps due to its recent origin, the Y chromosome in this species has not completely degenerated and most isolated X-linked genes have intact Y-linked homologues. A gene encoding a protein with strong homology to spermidine synthases, Slss, is the exception to this rule, as the Y-linked copy of this gene has apparently lost its function. Here I report evidence for a recent selective sweep in the X-linked copy of this gene (SlssX) that could reflect compensatory evolution in an X-linked gene that has lost a functional Y-linked homologue. The spread and fixation of an advantageous mutation in SlssX has resulted in a dramatic loss of genetic diversity and an excess of high-frequency derived polymorphisms in this gene. As the sweep has not affected the closely linked DD 44 X gene, the selective advantage of the mutation that has driven the sweep in the SlssX gene might have been less than 1 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{dioecious}} <b>white</b> <b>campion</b> Silene latifolia (syn.

The group of MROS genes, the first male-specifically expressed genes in dioecious plants, was recently identified in S. latifolia. To localize the MROS genes, we used the flow-sorted X chromosomes and autosomes as a template for PCR with internal primers.

The specificity of PCR products was checked by digestion with a restriction enzyme or reamplification using nested primers. Homology search of databases has shown the presence of five MROS 3 homologues in A. thaliana, four of them arranged in two tandems, each consisting of two copies.

40|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of flowering plants, which possess hermaphrodite flowers, <b>white</b> <b>campion</b> (Silene latifolia) is dioecious and has flowers of two different sexes.

The Y chromosome of S. latifolia was microdissected to generate a Y-specific probe which was used to screen a young male flower cDNA library.

SlY 1 is expressed predominantly in male flowers. A closely related gene, SlX 1, is predicted to be located on the X chromosome and is strongly expressed in both male and female flowers. SlY 1 and SlX 1 encode almost identical proteins containing WD repeats. Immunolocalization experiments showed that these proteins are localized in the nucleus, and that they are most abundant in cells that are actively dividing or beginning to differentiate. Interestingly, they do not accumulate in arrested sexual organs and represent potential targets for sex determination genes.

This species has become popular {{in studies of}} sex chromosome evolution. However, the lack of genes isolated from the X and Y chromosomes of this species is a major obstacle for such studies. Here, I report the isolation of a new sex-linked gene, Slss, with strong homology to spermidine synthase genes of other species. The new gene has homologous intact copies on the X and Y chromosomes (SlssX and SlssY, respectively). Synonymous divergence between the SlssX and SlssY genes is 4. 7 %, and nonsynonymous divergence is 1. 4 %. Isolation of a homologous gene from nondioecious S. vulgaris provided a root to the gene tree and allowed the estimation of the silent and replacement substitution rates along the SlssX and SlssY lineages. Interestingly, the Y-linked gene has higher synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates. The elevated synonymous rate in the SlssY gene, compared with SlssX, confirms our previous suggestion that the S. latifolia Y chromosome has a higher mutation rate, compared with the X chromosome. When differences in silent substitution rate are taken into account, the Y-linked gene still demonstrates significantly faster accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions, {{which is consistent with}} the theoretical prediction of relaxed purifying selection in Y-linked genes, leading to the accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions and genetic degeneration of the Y-linked genes. © Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution 2004; all rights reserved...|$|E

Intersexual co-adaptation can arise through sexually antagonistic co-evolution, a timely hypothesis addressed in animals but, to our knowledge, not yet in flowering plants. We investigated whether male and female population of origin affected pollen competition success, offspring fitness and sex ratio in crosses within/between six genetically differentiated populations of the <b>white</b> <b>campion,</b> Silene latifolia. Each female was crossed with pollen from one focus male from the same population, and pollen from two focus males from two distinct populations, both as single-donor and two-donor crosses against a fixed tester male with a 2 -h interpollination interval (n = 288 crosses). We analysed paternity with microsatellite DNA. Male populations of origin significantly differed for siring success and in vitro pollen germination rates. In vitro pollen germination rate was heritable. Siring success also depended on sex ratio in the female family of origin, but only in between-population crosses. In some female populations, two-donor crosses produced less female-biased sex ratios compared with single-donor crosses, yet in other female populations the reverse was true. Offspring sex ratio varied with donor number, depending on the female population. Within/between population crosses {{did not differ significantly}} in seed set or offspring fitness, nor were siring success and offspring fitness significantly correlated. Altogether this suggests reproductive divergence for traits affecting pollen competition in S. latifolia...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePlants are sessile organisms, often {{characterized}} by limited dispersal. Seeds and pollen are the critical stages for gene flow. Here we investigate spatial genetic structure, gene dispersal {{and the relative}} contribution of pollen vs seed in the movement of genes in a stable metapopulation of the <b>white</b> <b>campion</b> Silene latifolia within its native range. This short-lived perennial plant is dioecious, has gravity-dispersed seeds and moth-mediated pollination. Direct measures of pollen dispersal suggested that large populations receive more pollen than small isolated populations and that most gene flow occurs within tens of meters. However, these studies were performed in the newly colonized range (North America) where the specialist pollinator is absent. In the native range (Europe), gene dispersal could fall on a different spatial scale. We genotyped 258 individuals from large and small (15) subpopulations along a 60 [*]km, elongated metapopulation in Europe using six highly variable microsatellite markers, two X-linked and four autosomal. We found substantial genetic differentiation among subpopulations (global F(ST) = 0. 11) and a general pattern of isolation by distance over the whole sampled area. Spatial autocorrelation revealed high relatedness among neighboring individuals over hundreds of meters. Estimates of gene dispersal revealed gene flow at the scale of tens of meters (5 - 30 [*]m), similar to the newly colonized range. Contrary to expectations, estimates of dispersal based on X and autosomal markers showed very similar ranges, suggesting similar levels of pollen and seed dispersal. This {{may be explained by}} stochastic events of extensive seed dispersal in this area and limited pollen dispersal...|$|E
40|$|Flowering plants rely on vectors for pollen transfer, and cannot {{choose their}} mates. Although {{recipient}} plants {{are unable to}} choose which pollen they receive, post-pollination selection (acting pre- or post-zygotically) may modify the outcome of pollination. Here we show that genetic variation among pollen recipients can predict the outcome of pollen competition (seed paternity) in the dioecious <b>white</b> <b>campion.</b> To investigate whether genetic variation among pollen recipients affects paternity, we applied the same pollen mixture from two males to three females, two of which full sisters and the third one chosen at random (unrelated). To control for maternal environmental effects, the plants used for these crosses were greenhouse-reared F 1. We replicated this in two populations, {{for a total of}} 51 crosses, and genotyped a total of 772 offspring to assign paternity. If genetic variation affects paternity, we expected greater similarity of paternity success of the focal male with the sisters, compared to the unrelated female. Paternity of the focal male was significantly more repeatable over sisters, compared to repeatability over the mean of sisters and the unrelated females. When populations were analyzed separately, this was significant in one of the two populations. Paternity was not significantly correlated with stigma size. This provides evidence that in at least one population, genetic variation among individual plants influences the donors’ paternity success, as assessed through genetic analysis of the seedling. Since due to gravitydispersed seeds natural patches may often consist of related plants, the observed effect may contribute to variation in male reproductive success...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} of stable chromosome suspensions and flow cytometric sorting {{of both the}} Y sex chromosome of the <b>white</b> <b>campion,</b> Melandrium album, and the deleted Y chromosome of an asexual mutant, 5 K 63, is described. The principle has been to maintain transformed roots in vitro, synchronise and block mitosis, reduce cells to protoplasts, and lyse these to release chromosomes. Such in vitro material, unlike many cell suspensions, showed a stable karyotype. Factors critical to producing high‐quality chromosome suspensions from protoplasts include osmolality of isolation solutions and choice of spindle toxin and of lysis buffer. Agrobacterium rbizogenes transformed young growing root cultures were synchronised at G 1 /S with 50 μM aphidicolin for 24 h and released to a mitotic block with 30 μM oryzalin for 11 h. Protoplast preparations from such tissue routinely had metaphase indices reaching 15 %. Suspensions of intact metaphase chromosomes, with few chromatids, were obtained by lysing swollen mitotic protoplasts in a citric acid/disodium phosphate buffer. Except {{for the presence of}} clumps of autosomal chromosomes near the X and Y chromosome zones, monoparametric histograms of fluorescence intensities of suspensions stained with 4 ′, 6 ‐diamidino‐ 2 ‐phenylindole showed profiles similar to theoretical flow karyotypes. Two types of Y chromosomes, one full‐length and one partially deleted (from the asexual mutant), could be sorted at 90 % purity (21 ‐fold enrichment of Y). These results are discussed in the context of sex determination and differentiation in higher plants. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Copyright © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
