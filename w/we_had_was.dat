500|$|The {{sale of the}} band's North American {{independent}} {{record label}} Almo Sounds to Universal Music Group in early 2000 put the B-sides album on hold; Garbage decided to simply start work on recording their third album instead. Garbage began writing and recording the album at their own Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin in April of that year. [...] "The only vision <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> that we wanted it to sound different," [...] recalled guitarist Duke Erikson about the influence that the two new tracks had cast, adding that the band wished to evolve the chemistry that the band had developed from touring the previous two years.|$|E
500|$|Director Rob Bowman made bold {{decisions}} {{in designing the}} confrontation sequence. The scripted version showed the fight between Worf and Korris taking place entirely on the first deck of the engineering section. Instead, Bowman had them fight on the upper deck and, using camera angles never before seen on the show, filmed vertical sequences {{in that part of}} the set. He also altered the script so that Konmel needed to be hit by three phaser blasts. Bowman used a steadicam to film the scenes on the freighter in order to give a rough effect to the footage. He was pleased with the outcome, describing it as the easiest of all of the Next Generation episodes he directed. He said that it was a show where [...] "every hand <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> a 21. It just worked." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} the band was set to perform at Summersault in August 2000, about eight songs, {{including}} [...] "Life" [...] and [...] "Everyone's a Junkie", had been recorded as demos while the band {{was on the road}} touring. Guitarist Turner noted: [...] "After we were done we brought them in for the record company to hear, with an eye to making plans for next year. They heard what we were doing and said, 'Well, let's finish the album you're working on.' And we thought, 'Album? We're just demoing.' But they told us what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> great, so we went back into the studio with Arn and did just that." [...] Over the next two months, the band worked to complete the album with Arnold Lanni at Arnyard Studios in Toronto as well as Avatar Studios in New York City. Rumors had surfaced that, while in New York, Our Lady peace had dropped Lanni as producer to work with The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. These rumors were later debunked by Maida. The first songs to be played live were [...] "Life" [...] and [...] "Everyone's a Junkie", which debuted during Summersault in August 2000 shortly after they were first recorded. In an August 2000 interview with Chartattack Raine revealed that a song titled [...] "Yesterday" [...] (later to become [...] "Middle of Yesterday") was almost guaranteed to be the first single for Spiritual Machines.|$|E
2500|$|When {{being interviewed}} by the BBC {{to reflect on the}} 20th anniversary of the August Coup, Gorbachev again {{announced}} his dissatisfaction with the policies and rule of Putin. Speaking of the status of democracy in the Russian Federation, he proclaimed: [...] "The electoral system <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> nothing remarkable but they have literally castrated it". Gorbachev also stated that he believed that Putin should not have sought a third term as the Russian president in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|There was no {{budget for}} {{additional}} facilities, so managers decided to modify an existing facility {{by building a}} tank within it using tooling funds and in-house fabricators. [...] Stocks explained, [...] "All <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> the Directors Discretionary funds available at the time. [...] We {{were not allowed to}} construct a new building for the tank, so a leak was discovered under the model and prototype building. [...] This leak required about [...] of concrete under the floor to repair." [...] Thus the foundation of building 4706 was prepared in July 1967, to support a tank holding [...] of water.|$|E

The matter Lagrangian {{is presented in the}} form L_ϕ= -η (∂ϕ) ^ 2 +β G^μν∂_μϕ∂_νϕ. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> addressed two issues: the first <b>is</b> that, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proven that, this type of Galileons belong to the modified matter-curvature models of gravity in type of f(R,R^μνT_μν^m). Secondly, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> investigated exact solution for spherically symmetric geometries in this model. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found an exact solution with singularity at r= 0 in null coordinates. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proven that the solution has also a non-divergence current vector norm. This solution can be considered as an special solution which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> investigated in literature before, in which the Galileon's field is non-static (time dependence). Our scalar-shift symmetrized Galileon has the simple form of ϕ=t, which it is remembered by us dilaton field. Comment: Accepted in "International Journal of Theoretical Physics...|$|R

2500|$|Lieberman met {{his first}} wife, Betty Haas, at the congressional office of Senator Abraham Ribicoff (D-CT), where they worked as summer student interns. They married in 1965 while Joe Lieberman was in law school. They had two children– Matt and Rebecca. Betty, {{who is also}} Jewish, later worked as a {{psychiatric}} social worker. In 1981, the couple divorced. When asked about the divorce {{in an interview with}} New York Magazine, Lieberman said, [...] "one of the differences <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> in levels of religious observance", adding, [...] "I'm convinced if that was the only difference, we wouldn't have gotten divorced." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{arriving}} in Britain, the three couples lived in separate accommodation across London and struggled financially. They met {{to perform their}} missionary activities – which included kirtans (public chanting), attending notable public events, the distribution of promotional leaflets in busy areas such as Oxford Street, and the cultivation of new members. Having previously relied on the generosity of the local Indian community, they eventually settled in a warehouse complex in Covent Garden, which also served as their temporary temple. Malati later recalled of this early period in England: [...] " [...] hardly any possessions, no money, no protection. It often got very cold … All <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> love for Srila Prabhupada." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{histories}} of the crisis conclude that Faubus, facing pressure as he campaigned for a third term, decided to appease racist elements in the state by calling out the National Guard to prevent the black students from entering Central High. Former associate justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court James D. Johnson claimed to have hoaxed Governor Faubus into calling out the National Guard, supposedly to prevent a white mob from stopping the integration of Little Rock Central High School: [...] "There wasn't any caravan. But we made Orval believe it. We said. 'They're lining up. They're coming in droves.' ... The only weapon <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> to leave {{the impression that the}} sky was going to fall."

2500|$|Per the BCS {{selection}} procedure, {{the bowl}} games that lost teams {{to the national}} championship get first picks for a replacement. The Rose Bowl, after losing top ranked Ohio State, selected Illinois. Next, the Sugar Bowl selected Georgia to replace the #2 LSU Tigers. For the second selection for each bowl, per the BCS selection procedure, the game played nearest {{the date of the}} national championship had the first pick. For 2008, this was the Orange Bowl, which selected Kansas. Following the Orange Bowl's select, the Fiesta Bowl had the next pick following lastly by the Sugar Bowl. The Fiesta Bowl committee had a few teams to select from including Arizona State, Hawaii, and Big East champion West Virginia. The committee chose to invite West Virginia who almost made the national championship game before losing their last regular season game. John Junker, CEO of the Fiesta Bowl, said [...] "the selection <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>was</b> very simple." [...] If West Virginia had not been selected by the Fiesta Bowl, the Sugar Bowl would have been forced to select them, as West Virginia was guaranteed a BCS bowl berth by virtue of winning the Big East.|$|E
