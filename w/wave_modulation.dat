25|$|Another {{improvement}} over standard AM is obtained through reduction or {{suppression of the}} carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine <b>wave</b> <b>modulation,</b> the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus {{there is a great}} advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband (single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) or with both sidebands remaining (double sideband suppressed carrier). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|E

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} (EM) bias 'epsilon' is {{an error}} present in radar altimetry {{of the ocean}} due to the nonuniform reflection from wave troughs and crests. The EM bias {{is defined as the}} difference between the mean reflecting surface and the mean sea surface. A knowledge of the EM bias is necessary to permit error reduction in mean sea level measurements by satellite radar altimeters. Direct measurements of the EM bias were made from a Shell Offshore oil production platform in the Gulf of Mexico for a six month period during 1989 and 1990. Measurements of the EM bias were made at 5 and 14 Ghz. During the EM bias experiments by Melville et al., a wire wave gauge was used to obtain the modulation of the high frequency waves by the low frequency waves. It became apparent that the EM bias was primarily caused by the modulation of the short waves. This was reported by Arnold et al. The EM bias is explained using physical optics scattering and an empirical model for the short <b>wave</b> <b>modulation.</b> Measurements of the short <b>wave</b> <b>modulation</b> using a wire wave gauge demonstrated a linear dependence of the normalized bias on the short <b>wave</b> <b>modulation</b> strength, M. The theory accurately predicts this dependence by the relation epsilon = -alphaMH sub 1 / 3. The wind speed dependence of the normalized bias is explained by the dependence of the short <b>wave</b> <b>modulation</b> strength on the wind speed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to characterize cracking progression of concrete samples subjected to sulfate attack cycles by employment of a nonlinear <b>wave</b> <b>modulation</b> technique. The sidebands in frequency domain (f 1 ±f 2) are produced due to the modulation of two ultrasonic waves (high frequency f 1 and low frequency f 2) and the relative amplitude of sidebands is defined as the nonlinear parameter considered as a caliber for structural damage. Different from previous work where the low frequency signal was generated by the instrumented hammer, the low frequency signal in this research is a harmonic wave produced by an electromagnetic exciter to avoid the uncertainty of man-made influence. Experimental results show that the nonlinear parameter presents an excellent correlation with the progress of material deterioration, indicating that the <b>wave</b> <b>modulation</b> method is capable of discriminating different states of damage.
