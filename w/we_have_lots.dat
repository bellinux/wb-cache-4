500|$|Lemmings {{has also}} been called a {{predecessor}} of the modern real-time strategy (RTS) video game genre. A 1991 Amiga Power article claimed that Lemmings [...] "was the first major game to introduce the 'indirect-control' concept," [...] an element that is now common in many RTS games. Blizzard Entertainment developer Bob Fitch said {{that part of the}} inspiration for the first Warcraft game, , was based on developing a competitive multiplayer RTS that combined elements of The Lost Vikings (which he had worked on) and Lemmings; Fitch said [...] "We just went, 'Oh it's so cool when you see lots of Lemmings all over the place. Why don't <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>lots</b> of Vikings all over instead, and then the Vikings can fight each other." [...] Lemmings introduction of RTS elements has been noted by fantasy author Terry Pratchett; in his novel Interesting Times, an army of golems is controlled in a fashion reminiscent of the Lemmings user interface. When readers asked if this was deliberate, Pratchett responded: [...] "Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can't imagine how anyone thought that... Not only did I wipe Lemmings from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldn't get it back." ...|$|E
500|$|Just before Cassandra leaves town, {{she tells}} Donna that Matt, {{the man who}} raised her, is not her {{biological}} father. Cassandra tells Donna that her real father is a man named Nick.

Nick Nixon replies first and Donna begins to believe that he is her father. However, Professor Nicholas McKay (Chris Bunworth) later turns up and Donna becomes confused over the situation. Nicholas has just been released from jail and he is keen to do something right. However, he hurts Donna when he tells her that she is just like her mother and that she will run away. Robbie said [...] "He takes a horrible approach". Nicholas' arrival makes Donna more afraid to find out the results of the DNA test she asked Nick to take. On the situation, Robbie said [...] "She's a hopeless romantic and wants the happily ever after – not only with Ringo, but with her family." [...] The DNA test eventually proves that Nick is her real father.|$|E
