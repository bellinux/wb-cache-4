5|$|The {{response}} to the crisis and lack of transparency in the response brought attention {{to the state of}} media in Malaysia. After decades of having tight control of media, during which government officials were accustomed to passing over issues without scrutiny or accountability, Malaysia <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> thrust to the forefront of global media and unable to adjust to demands for transparency.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), {{is that at}} least parts of the room {{were found in the}} Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near Konigsburg castle.|$|E
5|$|Aaron Ward and Sterett, {{independently}} {{searching for}} targets, both sighted Yūdachi, who appeared {{unaware of the}} approach of the two U.S. destroyers. Both U.S.ships hit Yūdachi simultaneously with gunfire and torpedoes, heavily damaging the destroyer and forcing her crew to abandon ship. The ship did not sink right away, however. Continuing on her way, Sterett <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> ambushed by Teruzuki, heavily damaged, and forced to withdraw from the battle area to the east. Aaron Ward wound up in a one-on-one duel with Kirishima, which the destroyer lost with heavy damage. She also tried to retire from the battle area to the east but soon stopped dead in the water because the engines were damaged.|$|E

5|$|Brooks was {{assigned}} three prominent Minstrel attorneys, {{and after a}} year of sitting on the docket, at about 11 AM on April 15, 1874, Baxter's demurrer to Brook's complaint <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> called up. Neither of Baxter's lawyers were present in the court room, and the demurrer had been submitted without their knowledge. Without giving Baxter any time to testify, Judge Whytock overruled the demurrer and awarded Brooks $2,000 in damages and the office of Governor of Arkansas. Neither Brooks nor the court notified the legislature or Governor Baxter. Judge Wytock then swore in Joseph Brooks as the new governor of Arkansas, despite having no authority to do so.|$|E
5|$|Joachim Roth's {{low-level}} navigation {{had been}} extremely accurate. He had navigated his unit to within two minutes flying {{time from the}} target without interception, over unfamiliar enemy territory, on time and exactly on the planned route. But as the Dorniers neared the airfield they noticed {{that there was no}} smoke, or signs of damage. They expected to be polishing off a damaged fighter station. As the Germans burst over the airfield the air <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> filled with tracer rounds as the Dorniers' gunners engaged the Bofors and British AAA defences.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, 2015, {{while the}} band was not touring, guitarist Mick Thomson was hospitalized after a drunken knife fight with his brother at Thomson's home in Iowa. The pair {{sustained}} serious, but non life-threatening, injuries. On August 2, 2015, during a concert in Hartford, Connecticut, {{the band was}} forced to stop performing after Venturella <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> rushed to hospital, after undergoing a medical emergency. After 20 minutes, singer Taylor told the audience the band would continue the concert, performing without Venturella. It was later discovered that Venturella had collapsed because of extreme dehydration. During the band's following three concerts, Venturella played bass from backstage, returning to the stage on August 8.|$|E

5|$|The {{pressure}} {{had been}} too great for the advance posts of the much-reduced Yeomanry Mounted Division, which fell back down the Wadi Zeit but the pursuing Ottoman force <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> blocked by the 11th Light Horse Regiment of 4th Light Horse Brigade. The 4th Light Horse Brigade had moved by the same route as the 7th Mounted Brigade, but near El Burj they found the road blocked by fire. Brigadier General Grant, reporting to Barrow, ordered the brigade south of Beit Ur el Tahta to support the 6th Mounted Brigade. The 11th Light Horse Regiment was pushed forward with two machine guns to hold Wadi Zeit south west of Beit Ur el Foqa.|$|E
5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS Brilliant {{and it was}} he who {{stumbled}} into the most effective German counter-measure first. As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy was shocked to see Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E

5|$|In the bathroom, Lawrence finds a box {{containing}} a lighter, two cigarettes, and a one-way cellphone. He then recalls his abduction: {{he was trying}} to use his phone after being trapped in a parking garage, and <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> attacked by a pig-masked figure. They try to use a cigarette dipped in the corpse's blood, which is in fact cyanide, to stage Adam's death, but the plan fails when Adam is zapped through his ankle chain. Adam then recalls his own abduction: he was in his photo development room when the power went out and, after finding a puppet, was attacked by a similar pig-masked figure. At gunpoint, Alison calls Lawrence and tells him not to trust Adam, who admits that he was being paid to take photos of Lawrence, many of which were in the hacksaw bag. Adam also reveals his knowledge of Lawrence's affair with one of his medical students; Lawrence had been with her before he was abducted. Lawrence realizes from Adam's description that Tapp was paying him. Adam finds a photo that he didn't take, of a man staring out a window of Lawrence's house, whom Lawrence identifies as Zep. Unfortunately, the clock then strikes six as he realizes this.|$|E
5|$|On the June 7, 2010 {{episode of}} Raw, Cena <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> thrust {{into a new}} storyline when during his main event match against CM Punk, he was {{attacked}} by all eight former contestants of the first season of NXT, with Wade Barrett as their leader. Punk, his follower Luke Gallows, and other personnel around the ring were attacked as well, but Cena took {{the worst of the}} attack and was carried out on a stretcher. This group later referred to itself as The Nexus. At Fatal 4-Way, Cena lost the WWE Championship to Sheamus, in a fatal four-way match involving Edge and Randy Orton, after The Nexus interfered. Cena again lost to Sheamus in a steel cage match at Money in the Bank, after The Nexus again interfered. Cena, in retaliation to The Nexus, formed an alliance with Edge, Chris Jericho, John Morrison, R-Truth, The Great Khali, and Bret Hart. They defeated The Nexus at SummerSlam, with help from the returning Daniel Bryan, a former member of Nexus, who replaced Khali after he was injured.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia's Lisbon mission {{remained}} open {{throughout the}} late 1960s and early 1970s, providing a key {{link between the}} Rhodesian and Portuguese governments, which remained close. When Rhodesia adopted a republican constitution in 1970, Portugal bowed to British diplomatic pressure and withdrew its consul-general, João de Freitas Cruz, from Salisbury, but the Rhodesian office in Lisbon remained open. With the Carnation Revolution of 1974, Portugal's African policy <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> reversed. By contrast to the former authoritarian government, which had been committed to a pluricontinental Portugal, fighting costly wars against independence movements in its African territories to maintain it, the new leftist administration rapidly initiated moves to withdraw from Africa as quickly as possible. Following hurried negotiations between Portugal and the nationalist guerrillas in each territory, both Mozambique and Angola became independent under communist governments in 1975. Lisbon's stance on Rhodesia altered accordingly. The Portuguese government ordered {{the closure of the}} Rhodesian mission in April 1975, and simultaneously withdrew its own remaining officials from Rhodesia. The Rhodesian mission in Lisbon formally closed on 1 May 1975.|$|E

5|$|The {{years after}} the Black Death left many women widows; in the wider economy labour was in short supply and land <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> readily available. In rural areas peasant women could enjoy a better {{standard}} of living than ever before, but {{the amount of work}} being done by women may have increased. Many other women travelled to the towns and cities, {{to the point where they}} outnumbered men in some settlements. There they worked with their husbands, or in a limited number of occupations, including spinning, making clothes, victualling and as servants. Some women became full-time ale brewers, until they were pushed out of business by the male-dominated beer industry in the 15th century. Higher status jobs and apprenticeships, however, remained closed to women. As in earlier times, noblewomen exercised power on their estates in their husbands' absence and again, if necessary, defended them in sieges and skirmishes. Wealthy widows who could successfully claim their rightful share of their late husband's property could live as powerful members of the community in their own right.|$|E
5|$|Stratus' second {{reign as}} {{champion}} {{came to an}} end on June 23, when she was defeated at King of the Ring by Molly Holly. The two Divas continued their storyline feud for the next three months. After a failed attempt to win the title in July, Stratus won the championship back at Unforgiven. While feuding with Holly, Stratus was also involved in an angle with new Diva Victoria, who held a storyline grudge against Stratus, claiming she was betrayed by Stratus when they both worked as fitness models. The two competed in several title matches, with Stratus retaining until Survivor Series, where Victoria won the title in a Hardcore match. On March 17, 2003, Victoria and Steven Richards defeated Jazz and Stratus in a tag team match when Jazz walked out on Stratus. After the match, Jeff Hardy saved Stratus from an attack by Victoria and Richards and then kissed her, resulting in Stratus becoming Hardy's on-screen girlfriend once more. The two would talk and kiss backstage, compete as an intergender tag team, and come to each other's aid when in danger during singles competition. At no point was their previous relationship acknowledged. The storyline <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> dropped when WWE released Hardy in April. This marked the second time in two years that a romance between Stratus and Hardy was abruptly scrapped due to a setback in one of their personal lives. In neither instance did the angle fully play out or reach a conclusion.|$|E
