In addition, throughout Genie's stay with the Riglers they tested a variety of her brain functions and her performance on different tasks.

25|$|Jung's staunchest {{critics have}} {{accused him of}} either mystical or metaphysical essentialism.

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of dynamic channel {{allocation}} (DCA) in cellular network is discussed. We draw the conclusion about it that the system performance improvement by DCA is that DCA increases the trunking efficiency and a simple but useful method is developed to calculate the lower limit of call blocking probability of DCA. By using this method, we can compare the performance of Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA) <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> DCA schemes easily and clearly.
