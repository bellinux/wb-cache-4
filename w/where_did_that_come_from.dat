A little of Tibet in France. After the Olympic torch events of last year, why not. But then that did not prepare me for reporter Edward Cody’s piece on France in today’s Washington Post. “French Workers Return to Streets in Protest” predictably reported that a million-plus French were pounding pavement to shake Sarkozy out of his cautious, unsympathetic leadership in the face of jobs hemorrhaging around the country. No surprises there. Then: “Despite the rancor on their banners, most marchers seemed cheerful in the spring weather as they marched and shouted anti-capitalist slogans. They moved past the house where Gustave Flaubert, author of “Madame Bovary,” lived in the 19 th century; they walked by the Kunga Tibetan restaurant, from where three Tibetans peered out at a raucous phenomenon that their countrymen left behind under Chinese rule were unlikely to witness any time soon; and they spilled into the Place de la Bastille, where street protesters kicked off the French Revolution in 1789 by tearing open a royal prison tower. ” Wow.

Words are all around us - we use them every day to {{communicate}} our joys, fears, hopes, opinions, wishes and demands - but we don't often think about them too deeply. In this highly accessible introduction to English words, the reader will discover what the study of words can tell them about the extraordinary richness and complexity of our daily vocabulary and about the nature of language in general. Assuming no prior knowledge of linguistics, the book covers a wide range of topics, including the structure of words, the meaning of words, how their spelling relates to pronunciation, how new words are manufactured or imported from other languages, and how the meaning of words changes with the passage of time. It also investigates how the mind deals with words by highlighting the amazing intellectual feat performed routinely when the right word is retrieved from the mental dictionary. This revised and expanded second edition brings the study of words right up to date with coverage of text messaging and email and includes new material on psycholinguistics and word meaning. With lively examples from a range of sources - encompassing poetry, jokes, journalism, advertising and clichés - and including practical exercises and a fully comprehensive glossary, English Words is an entertaining introduction to the study of words and will be of interest to anyone who uses them...|$|R
5000|$|In {{regards to}} the soundtrack album, Rahman claimed, [...] "The soundtrack we created {{together}} truly captures the beautiful culture and energy behind the film— reminding us all {{how important it is}} to be open to new possibilities in life." [...] As the film's music has Indian as well as Western sensibilities, Rahman wanted to strike a balance between the two. The track [...] "Unborn Children" [...] is the song [...] "Thirakkadha Kaatu Kulle" [...] sung by K S Chithra and Unnikrishnan, featured in the 1999 film En Swasa Kaatre scored by Rahman. As a score, it is featured in the ending of the film where two kids were running into an open field. Upon inclusion of such a track, in an interview with The Hindu Rahman said, [...] "Frankly, I really didn't know how it landed there and the makers were researching my Indian music and must've stumbled upon this. When I saw the movie, I was like, 'Wow, <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> from!' But it felt so good. I didn't feel any need to change it." [...] He added that he never wanted to use the soothing number from the Tamil film but the director and music supervisor loved the tune and they've used it as part of the soundtrack. The track [...] "Nimma Nimma" [...] was recorded for Isles of Wonder, however, here the track is reused with slight changes in musical arrangement. On the collaborations with artists in the soundtrack, Disney listed names for featured collaboration whereas director Craig and composer Rahman made the choices together. On the score and the film plot analogy Rahman quotes, [...] "The songs add to the energy of the scenes and the score in places...We were careful not to telegraph key emotions and gave way to the actors playing characters to lead the emotion." [...] On his collaboration with the rapper Wale, Rahman stated that he was writing a lot of song ideas and the film director was suggesting that they should have a mainstream rapper for certain sequences especially when the all the boys in film go to America. He was quoted saying, [...] "So Wale's name popped up, we sent him the track and he loved it and did the rap and sent it back." [...] Singer Gaayatri Kaundinya has lent alaps to the score. She stated that she started interning with film composer A. R. Rahman at his studio in Los Angeles since 2012 and eventually got involved with the project. She added that it didn't take her long to record everything as she had many demo works with Rahman, earlier. In the album of the score her voice is featured in tracks [...] "Farewell" [...] and [...] "Bobbleheads" [...] but in the score itself she had about six to eight pieces. In the interview with Daily Bruin, she recalled, [...] "Originally we just put it in for the part where they find the two men to pitch at the speed that (the baseball scouts) want. After months of looking for cricket players, they find players who can throw at this incredibly fast speed. That's what the track was recorded for. But the director liked (the track) so much that they ended up using it for the opening of the movie." ...|$|R

40|$|YouTube 2 ̆ 7 s {{significance}} is partly {{to do with}} its pre-history, write HENRY JENKINS and JOHN HARTLEY YouTube: home port for lip-syncers, karaoke singers, trainspotters, birdwatchers, skateboarders, hip-hoppers, small-time wrestling federations, educators, third-wave feminists, churches, proud parents, poetry slammers, gamers, human rights activists, hobbyists. It gets ten hours of new content every minute. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> all <b>that</b> <b>come</b> from? There is much that is new about YouTube, but there is also much that is old. The emergence of ?Do-It-Yourself? cultures of all kinds {{over the past several decades}} paved the way for the early embrace, quick adoption and diverse use of new media. YouTube has gone from nowhere to cultural ubiquity in a couple of years because we already know what to do with it. Among its precursors were the zines of the political and cultural avant-garde of the 1970 s and ? 80 s, closely tied to the growth of punk rock and the emergence of Riot Grrl feminism. They were also part of a larger history of amateur publishing; the science fiction fan community can be traced back to the 1920 s. These DIY [...] or DIWO: do it with others [...] impulses spilled over from print zines to include mix tapes and home videos. Modern cyberculture can trace its roots back to the 1960 s, with ?people?s radio,? early video activism, underground newspapers and comics; all efforts to deploy low-cost media tools and practices towards alternative ends. Many early netizens explicitly embraced the value of participatory culture. These utopian pioneers would greet YouTube?s amateurs not as mindless kids but as the fulfilment of their hopes and a validation of their predictions. The digital revolution rhetoric has assumed new media displaces the old. But YouTube exemplifies a ?convergence culture,? with its complex interactions and collaborations between corporate and grassroots media. YouTube does not so much change the conditions of production as alter the contexts of circulation and reception. Amateur, activist and avant-garde works now reach a larger public. Yet, many of those earlier advocates remain sceptical that a commercial company such as YouTube can enable alternative politics. If we want to see a more democratic culture, they argue, we need anti-corporate outlets, greater diversity among participants, more debate about whose work gets seen and how it is valued. But as Geekcorps?s founder, Ethan Zuckerman, says, any medium sufficiently powerful to enable the distribution of cute cat pictures can also, under the right circumstances, be deployed to bring down a government. Right now, people are learning how to produce, upload and circulate content. What happens next is up to us all. With YouTube, there is almost infinite scope for creative content and new ideas to be produced without the need for avant-garde leadership, expert filtering or institutional control. The so-called long tail of self-made content is accessible to anyone near a computer terminal. While most people can read, very few publish in print. Hence active contribution to science, journalism and even fictional storytelling has been restricted to expert elites, while most of the general population makes do with ready-made entertainment. But the internet does not distinguish between literacy and publication. So now we are entering a new kind of digital literacy, where everyone is a publisher and whole populations have the chance to contribute as well as consume. We can use the internet for daydreaming, mischief and time-wasting, but we can also move on to other functionality levels and purposes, including science, journalism and works of the imagination. You can find all this on YouTube. If we see YouTube as operating without a history, we erase the politics behind those struggles to prepare the way, and we may end up accepting far less than what we bargained for, or what might be possible if we participate. By reclaiming what happened before, we will have a basis for judging how well YouTube is serving participatory culture and the growth of knowledge among all sections of society. We may also find openings for ?a critique, a goal, a community, and a context? of the kind that motivated earlier DIY media-makers. As they say in The Matrix: ?I don?t know the future. I didn?t come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it?s going to begin. ? ?
