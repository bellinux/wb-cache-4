5|$|The Pied-Noir {{relationship}} with France and Algeria {{was marked by}} alienation.

It is situated adjacent to the former facilities at Shenley Sports grounds, which Watford Football Club use for training purposes. They concluded it was “…essential to support the training facility”, that it would replace an existing building used by the club and that Arsenal’s community work “constituted exceptional circumstances”. The plans <b>were</b> <b>referred</b> to the Environment Secretary John Prescott, who ratified it, {{in spite of the}} area's position on the green belt.

Both eggs <b>were</b> <b>referred</b> to M. yaotunensis.

The ideas that Strom did not reject outright <b>were</b> <b>referred</b> to committees and study groups where they were watered down or shelved.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{encouraged}} intermarriage {{with the}} local population, and strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church.

During this time, Bombay's main trade was coconuts and coir. After Antonio Pessoa's death in 1571, a patent was issued which granted Mazagaon in perpetuity to the Sousa e Lima family. The St. Andrew Church at Bandra was built in 1575.|$|E

Another report described seven people with cancer, whose previously well-controlled pain escalated significantly over several days. Antibiotic treatment produced pain relief in all of them within three days.|$|E

5|$|The holotype of Paranthodon, BMNH 47338, {{was found}} in a layer of the Kirkwood Formation that has been dated between the Berriasian and early Valanginian ages.

One additional specimen can be assigned to it based on the dentition, BMNH 47992, including only isolated teeth sharing the same morphology as those from the holotype. However, the teeth do not bear any autapomorphies of Paranthodon, and <b>were</b> <b>referred</b> to an indeterminate stegosaurid in 2008.|$|E
