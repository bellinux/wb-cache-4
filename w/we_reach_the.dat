25|$|A very {{different}} kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> top. Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.|$|E

Kassar informed him that Spielberg asked for Warshaw specifically and that development needed {{to be completed by}} September 1 to meet a production schedule for the Christmas holiday. Though Warshaw had spent more than a year working on consecutive development schedules for games (seven months working on Yars' Revenge and then six months on Raiders of the Lost Ark), he accepted the offer based on the challenge of completing a game in a short time frame and at Spielberg's request. Warshaw considered it an opportunity to develop an innovative Atari 2600 game based on a movie he enjoyed, [...] "provided <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> right arrangement". Kassar reportedly offered Warshaw [...] and an all-expenses-paid vacation to Hawaii in compensation. Kassar then told him to arrive at the San Jose Airport a few days later to have a meeting with Spielberg.|$|E

2500|$|Though their {{development}} was gradual, we can date the full-blown appearance and general ecclesiastical (as opposed to simply popular or local) acceptance of Christian images as venerated and miracle-working {{objects to the}} 6th century, when, as Hans Belting writes, [...] "we first hear of the church's use of religious images." [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> {{second half of the}} sixth century, we find that images are attracting direct veneration {{and some of them are}} credited with the performance of miracles" [...] Cyril Mango writes, [...] "In the post-Justinianic period the icon assumes an ever increasing role in popular devotion, and there is a proliferation of miracle stories connected with icons, some of them rather shocking to our eyes". [...] However, the earlier references by Eusebius and Irenaeus indicate veneration of images and reported miracles associated with them as early as the 2nd century. [...] What might be shocking to our contemporary eyes may not have been viewed as such by the early Christians. [...] Acts 5:15 reports that [...] "people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{introductory}} paragraph {{added to}} the Book of Mormon in the LDS Church's 1981 edition stated in part: [...] "After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, {{and they are the}} principal ancestors of the American Indians." [...] In a 2006 edition, the statement was altered to indicate that [...] "the Lamanites ... are among the ancestors of the American Indians." [...] This change, church leaders said, was in harmony with the claims of the Book of Mormon itself, and what some Latter-day Saints had long perceived. For instance, in 1929 Anthony W. Ivins, of the LDS Church's First Presidency, cautioned church members: “We must be careful in the conclusions that <b>we</b> <b>reach.</b> <b>The</b> Book of Mormon teaches the history of three distinct peoples … who came from the old world to this continent. It does not tell us that there was no one here before them. It does not tell us that people did not come after. And so if discoveries are made which suggest differences in race origins, it can very easily be accounted for, and reasonably, for we do believe that other people came to this continent. A thousand years had elapsed from the time the Book of Mormon closed until the discovery of America, and we know that other people came to America during that period.” ...|$|E

2500|$|As we {{progress}} through time, <b>we</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> time of Abraham. Reuven Firestone states that, “In {{the case of}} the Abraham story, for example, Islamic interpretative literature traces his journeys to Haran, the land of Canaan, Egypt and back again to Canaan in a manner that parallels the basic route and chronology of the biblical story found in Genesis.” [...] However, {{it is interesting to note}} that Abraham’s journey also leads him to Mecca. Firestone states, “Abraham’s prayer in Quran 14:37 serves as proof text in the exegetical literature for his Meccan experience: “Our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in an uncultivated wadi by your sacred house, in order o Lord, which they may establish, regular prayer. There are other Quranic verses such as: “2:125-127, 3:97, and 22:26” that locate Abraham in Mecca. Firestone continues through his article to discuss how Islamic hadith and Quranic scripture were passed down orally. He also discusses how during this time, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam were all influencing one another in relation to the scriptural stories. Ibn Abbas, as discussed above, also recounts the story of Abraham’s journey from Syria to Mecca. This story was told by Ali b. Abi Talib, by Mujahid, and by Ibn Abbas. The version of this story told by Ibn Abbas can be found nineteen times among the sources, “it is the most popular and most complete explanation of Abraham’s transfer from Syria to Mecca”. To summarize the Ibn Abbas’ account, Abraham’s wife, Sarah, becomes jealous of Hagar because of the birth of Ishmael. Hagar leaves the house that she is staying in with Abraham and Sarah and hides her track so no one can follow her. Abraham takes Ishmael and Hagar to Mecca. After leaving both of them there, he returns to Syria. Hagar is weary of being left in this place and Abraham then recites the Quran 14:37-38: “O Lord! I have made some of my offspring live in an uncultivated wadi by your sacred house, in order, O Lord, that they establish regular prayer. So fill the hearts of some with love toward them, and feed them with fruits so that they may give thanks. O Lord! You know what we conceal and what we reveal, for nothing on Earth or in Heaven is hidden from God.” Both Ishmael and Hagar run out of water and Hagar can no longer feed Ishmael by nursing him. “She climbs Safa and Marwa and runs between them seven times.” Ibn Abbas notes that either Gabriel, another angel, or Ishmael struck the ground with their heel and caused water to flow out of it. “The angel tells Hagar not to worry about perishing, for the boy and his father will someday build the House of God there in Mecca. This version of the legend follows the biblical account of Genesis 21:19-21 in almost perfect order.” The many versions of this legend attribute the importance and provide explanation for this religious building in Mecca. Reuven Firestone writes that this interpretation of the story, “serves in effect as an Islamic midrash on Genesis 21:10-21, and indeed, contains motifs with clear parallels in post-biblical Jewish exegetical literature.” It is interesting to note the many different versions that have been written serve different purposes in the Islamic tradition. Ali’s version includes more supernatural events that may be added for the purpose of making the Ka’ba seen as more of an important religious shrine to the Islamic people. Whereas, Ibn Abbas’ version perfectly aligns with the biblical narration in Genesis.|$|E
