5000|$|The {{original}} {{claims were}} based on a number of war crimes committed by German troops during World War II. The substance of the facts were not disputed by Germany. A number of international agreements and measures had been passed which purported to <b>waive</b> the <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> the victims involved, or make reparations. [...] For instance, a 1947 peace treaty between Italy and the Allies purported to waive claims by Italian nationals; a 1963 agreement between Germany and Italy again purported to <b>waive</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> Italian nationals for 40m Deutsche marks in compensation. Germany had also passed various laws to effect individual compensation to victims of Nazi era atrocities. However, it is undisputed that the international agreements and the sometimes restrictive language of the compensation laws collectively failed to compensate many victims individually.|$|R
25|$|Often, {{instead of}} declaring insolvency, the company negotiates a debt {{restructuring}} with its lenders. The financial restructuring might entail that the equity owners inject some {{more money in}} the company and the lenders <b>waive</b> parts <b>of</b> their <b>claims.</b> In other situations, the lenders inject new money and assume the equity of the company, with the present equity owners losing their shares and investment. The operations of the company are not affected by the financial restructuring. Nonetheless, the financial restructuring requires significant management attention and may lead to customers losing faith in the company.|$|R
5000|$|The Second Sino-Japanese War {{also caused}} huge {{economic}} losses to China. Jiang Zemin, the core-leader {{of the third}} generation of the Communist Party <b>of</b> China (CPC), <b>claimed</b> that [...] "China suffered a direct economic loss of about $100,000,000,000 and indirect loss of about $500,000,000,000 {{as a result of}} the Japanese invasion." [...] However, Chiang Kai-shek waived reparations claims for the war when the ROC concluded the Treaty of Taipei with Japan in 1952. Similarly, when Japan normalized its relations with the PRC in 1972, Mao Zedong <b>waived</b> the <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> war reparations from Japan.|$|R

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} five types of grain {{are subject to}} the law of challah: wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye. Quantities of dough made from these {{different}} grains are counted together. They were also subject to the prohibition of the consumption of new produce before the <b>waiving</b> <b>of</b> the first sheaf, and to the prohibition of reaping prior to Passover. If they took root prior to the <b>waiving</b> <b>of</b> the first sheaf, the <b>waiving</b> <b>of</b> the first sheaf released them for consumption. But if not, they were prohibited until the next <b>waiving</b> <b>of</b> the first sheaf. The Mishnah taught that rice, millet, poppy seed, sesame, and legumes are exempt from challah (for though they are sometimes made into dough, they are not capable of leavening), as are less than five-fourths of a kav, or about 3½ pounds (the minimum subject to challah) of the five kinds of grain subject to challah. Sponge-biscuits, honey cakes, dumplings, pancakes, and dough made from a mixture of consecrated and unconsecrated grain are also exempt from challah.|$|R

5000|$|This {{provisional}} reading {{suggests that}} the inscription dealt with trading regulations covering losses <b>of</b> goods, the <b>waiving</b> <b>of</b> collection of interest, and perhaps of royal fees. The legible portion of the text does not bear the name of any merchant association, but a reference to [...] "our people" [...] (makkal) may indicate that an association was involved: several inscriptions of this period in southern India connect merchant associations - particularly the Ainnurruvar - {{with the construction of}} mandapa or other additions to both Hindu and Buddhist foundations.|$|R

United States, 81 U.S. 479 (1871), is a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that the {{principle}} of res judicata did not apply to Congressional reference cases.
