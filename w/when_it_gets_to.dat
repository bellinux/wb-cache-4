500|$|Following {{the first}} episode, viewers complained on social {{networking}} websites after {{it appeared that}} pitch correction (which {{has been seen as}} controversial in the music industry) was used {{to improve the quality of}} some singers' voices, and forty-five viewers complained to Ofcom. Series producers claimed post-production work was necessary on the show because of the number of microphones used during filming: [...] "The judges make their decisions at the auditions stage based on what they hear on the day, live in the arena. The footage and sound is then edited and dubbed into a finished programme, to deliver the most entertaining experience possible for viewers. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> the live shows, it will be all live." [...] It was reported on 26 August that Cowell had ordered a ban on pitch correction in future episodes, asking for them to be re-edited. In October 2010, Ofcom ruled that viewers had not been [...] "materially misled" [...] as pitch correction was only used during auditions and not when viewers were paying to vote for the contestants.|$|E

[...] He also called the song a [...] "grower" [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review saying, [...] "'Missing You' is a post-break-up song with a modishly rave-tinged production... {{and after a few}} spins the chorus wiggles into your brain like a tapeworm that missed the turning marked 'digestive tract' ...
