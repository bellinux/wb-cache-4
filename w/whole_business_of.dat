[...] Upon writing the novel, McBride conducted his own research and learned of the 92nd Infantry Division, which consisted of 15,000 African-American soldiers, who served in Italy during World War II from August 1944 to November 1945. McBride interviewed several remaining members of the 92nd Division. [...] "I studied Italian at The New School in New York City," [...] he explained. [...] "I moved to Italy with my family for six months. I interviewed dozens of Italians—Partisans and Fascists. I interviewed dozens of African-American soldiers who fought in the war, most who have since passed away. I must have read at least 20 books. I went to the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. I studied the <b>whole</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> what the 92nd did in Italy during the war, {{to try to get}} an idea of what really transpired."

500|$|In Groucho and Me, Groucho Marx called Skelton [...] "the most unacclaimed clown in show business", and [...] "the logical {{successor}} to [...] Chaplin", {{largely because of}} his ability to play a multitude of characters with minimal use of dialogue and props.

No grotesque make-up, no funny clothes, just Red." [...] He added that Skelton also [...] "plays a dramatic scene about as effectively as any of the dramatic actors." [...] In late 1965 ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, reminiscing about the entertainment business, singled out Skelton for high praise. [...] "It's all so very different today. The <b>whole</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> comedy has changed — from 15 minutes of quality to quantity. We had a lot of very funny people around, from Charley Chase to Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. The last one of that breed is Red Skelton."

Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called Emerson an acting [...] "god". Chris Carabott from IGN found one of the best moments of [...] "Eggtown", was the power struggle between Locke and Ben, because [...] "Their scenes together are amongst the best in the series and the one that opens [...] "Eggtown" [...] is a perfect display of how well Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn work together. O'Quinn captures Locke's uncertainty perfectly in the opening scene and it's always fun to watch Ben prey on any weakness of character." [...] Kevin Thompson of The Palm Beach Post wrote [...] "with those big ol' eyes of his, [...] could always say more with a lengthy stare than he could with twenty pages of dialogue.... once again, proved why he has become Losts star as well as its heart and soul.... an Emmy should belong to [...]" [...] Jennifer Godwin of E! wrote that [...] "no one has ever done better work humanizing a supervillain."

Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy describes Emerson's performance as [...] "fantastic", with [...] "many layers of intrigue and humanity". John Kubicek of BuddyTV also found his performance [...] "fantastic", adding [...] "he nailed it".
