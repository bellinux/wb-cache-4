5|$|At {{the time}} of its {{formation}} in 1921, the KJRM obtained four former Austro-Hungarian s that had been converted into minesweepers. Three were discarded soon after, but one served as a training vessel until the April 1941 invasion, at which time she was captured by the Italians. The Germans captured her in September 1943 and she <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> their hands some time later.|$|E

5|$|In {{the dying}} {{stages of the}} conflict, FRELIMO was {{provided}} with a few SA-7 MANPAD shoulder-launched missile launchers from China; these were never used to shoot down a Portuguese plane. Only one Portuguese aircraft <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> combat during the conflict, when Lt. Emilio Lourenço's G.91R-4 was destroyed by premature detonation of his own ordnance.|$|E
5|$|Wiśniowiecki's indebted {{family was}} not able to provide him with a funeral his rank and fame deserved. In the end, he never {{received}} the large funeral and the temporary location of his body, the monastery of the Holy Cross at Łysa Góra, became his final resting place. His body <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the fire {{at the end of the}} 18th century, which also prevents a modern reexamination of the cause of his death.|$|E

5|$|Across the Philippines, Typhoon Betty brought {{widespread}} flooding, {{which resulted}} in severe destruction. Damage added up to $100million (1987USD). In the Maguindanao and Albay provinces alone, 10,000people were evacuated and 1,000were homeless. However, {{the capital city of}} Manila avoided any serious damage. Nationwide, around 200,000people were reportedly homeless, 18,000of winch were from Marinduque and another 11,400resided on Mindoro Island. In the former, 4,000dwellings sustained damage, and all of the banana crop there <b>was</b> <b>lost.</b> <b>In</b> all, 25,518homes received damage. Roughly 400,000people were directly affected by the storm. Overall, 85people were killed and 324others were wounded. After striking the Philippines, six people were killed by Betty in Vietnam. Approximately 10,000structures were damaged and 103people were injured. Elsewhere, in northern Thailand, one person was killed and three others were hurt by the typhoon. Several villages were flooded, and numerous streets were damaged.|$|E
5|$|Although the new Phantoms were {{assigned}} a British designation as the F.3, they were generally {{referred to as}} the F-4J(UK). They {{were assigned}} to 74 Squadron at RAF Wattisham, which stood up in October 1984, two months after the first flight. The aircraft remained in service through the transition to the Tornado, which began entering service in 1987. In 1990, thanks to the conversion of F-4M squadrons to the Tornado, the RAF were able to transfer the best of its remaining FGR.2s to 74 Squadron, which meant that the F.3 was able to be withdrawn in January 1991. With a couple of exceptions, all of the RAF's F-4Js were broken up for scrap. One of the 15 airframes <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> a crash in 1987, killing both crew members.|$|E

However, the story takes on an unusual and very {{important}} twist. Soon {{after the start of}} his journey, the Smithy Gang invades the world. While attempting to stop the group, Mario is joined by Mallow, a cloud boy who thinks he is a tadpole; Geno, a doll possessed by a celestial spirit from the Star Road; Bowser, whose armies have deserted him out of fear of the Smithy Gang; and Princess Toadstool, who <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the turmoil that occurred when the Smithy Gang arrived.

5|$|Between the wars, Drummond {{served for}} two years in the Sudan and for four years in Australia on {{secondment}} to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), including a tour as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. Based in Cairo at the outbreak of World WarII, he was Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder's Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief RAF Middle East from 1941 to 1943. Drummond was twice offered command of the RAAF during the war but did not take up the position on either occasion.

In addition, Russell is forced to pay the taxes for the whole province and is transferred to Central Africa. After realising that Bhuvan loves Gauri, Elizabeth returns to London. Heartbroken, she remains unmarried {{for the rest of}} her life. It is revealed during epilogue, that Bhuvan went on to marry Gauri with great pomp and show. And despite the historic triumph, Bhuvan's name <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the pages of history.|$|E
5|$|Cumby {{took charge}} of the {{battered}} Bellerophon, directing her fire into Aigle and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. Bellerophon had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded. Although Aigle <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the chaotic storm which followed the battle, Bellerophon survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action. Cooke's body was buried at sea the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from Bellerophon.|$|E

5|$|Damage was {{widespread}} in the Philippines, particularly in Metro Manila, where the typhoon passed almost directly over. Power and water <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> several provinces, while overflowing rivers caused flooding, landslides and made roads impassable. In {{some parts of the}} country, electricity was cut off for up to six days straight. Many trees and billboards were toppled by Xangsane, while Luzon suffered an island-wide power outage. Rough waters and seaport closures left at least 3,400people and nearly 270 vehicles stranded in ports and terminals, mainly at the primary ferry crossing between Samar Island and Bicol Region. Local and provincial officials described Xangsane as the worst typhoon to directly impact Manila since Typhoon Angela passed over the city eleven years ago.|$|E
5|$|Early in its existence, Lenny {{produced}} large {{waves and}} high tides along the Guajira Peninsula in Colombia, sinking two boats and flooding 1,200houses. There were also reports of flooded businesses and damaged crops. In the country, strong winds on the storm's fringe {{killed a man}} by striking him with a beam. Although there were initial reports of nine people missing, only two were counted in the death toll for mainland Colombia. Two sailors were killed offshore when their yacht <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the southern Caribbean Sea.|$|E
5|$|Following Carmen's passage, {{officials}} {{feared the}} worst for {{an area of}} 1,000mi2 (2,590km2) where communication <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> Belize. A reconnaissance task force was sent out from Belize City the day after Carmen made landfall to assist any residents stranded by the storm. One person was killed {{off the coast of}} Belize after being washed off his boat by large swells produced by Carmen. Three other fishermen were listed as missing following similar incidents. Thousands of people moved from coastal areas inland to escape the storm. Crop damage in the country was reportedly severe.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, the British {{planned to}} build the G3 class, which had the same {{armament}} and armour as battleships {{of the time and}} were rated as battlecruisers only by comparison to the more heavily armoured and slower battleships also planned. They were cancelled as they exceeded the tonnage limits of the Washington Naval Treaty. Of the first nine battlecruisers, only HMS Tiger survived the Washington Treaty and into the 1930s. The three Courageous-class ships were converted to aircraft carriers during the 1920s and only Repulse, Renown and Hood served in the Second World War as battlecruisers. All three went through substantial refits between the wars. Hood <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> the battle of the Denmark Strait, Repulse was sunk by Japanese aircraft {{at the start of the}} war in the Pacific, and Renown survived the war to be scrapped in 1948.|$|E

Both Preussen and Friedrich der Grosse served in the fleet until the 1890s, when they were relegated to secondary duties, including serving as harbor ships, and later as coal hulks. The ships were eventually scrapped {{following the end of}} World War I, in 1919 and 1920, respectively.|$|E
