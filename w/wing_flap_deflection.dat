40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to analyze the wing/rotor interaction of tilt rotor aircraft in hover. The unsteady, thin-layer compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using an implicit, finite difference scheme that employs LU-ADI factorization. The rotor is modeled as an actuator disk which imparts a radial and azimuthal distribution of pressure rise and swirl to the flowfield. The 'chimera' approach of grid point blanking is used to update the rotor boundary conditions. Results are presented for both a rotor alone and for wing/rotor interaction where the thrust coefficient is 0. 0164 and <b>wing</b> <b>flap</b> <b>deflection</b> is 67 degrees. Many of the complex flow features are captured including the fountain effect, leading and trailing edge separation, and the unsteady wake beneath the wing. Wing surface pressures compare fairly well with experimental data although the time-averaged download is about twenty {{percent higher than the}} measured value. This discrepancy is due to a combination of factors that are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method for}} the treatment of boundary conditions in non-body conforming computational grids is proposed. The method incorporates a “gridless ” algorithm in which numerical boundary conditions may be imposed in such a manner that explicit connectivity between surface geometry and field mesh is not required. As a result, solutions to problems in computational physics are greatly facilitated since definition of the body geometry may be generated independently from the field mesh. Furthermore, perturbations in body geometry may be introduced into the simulation without the requirement for regeneration of the field mesh (i. e. <b>wing</b> <b>flap</b> <b>deflection).</b> The method is particularly suited for Cartesian mesh applications, in which convergence and stability issues associated with mesh skewness and distortion are eliminated. Furthermore, the method does not require special treatment for “thin body ” problems from which many Cartesian methodologies suffer. The applicability of the method for two-dimensional Euler simulations with examples of transonic flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil is presented here. Results of the method are shown to compare very favorably with traditional body-fitted mesh techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} of lift force required by an aircraft during take-off and landing phases is conventionally obtained through <b>wing</b> <b>flap</b> <b>deflection.</b> Such devices are usually driven by control systems made of robust actuators and control lines that significantly {{contribute to the}} weight of the whole wing structure and, whereas proper external fairings are needed, also to wing friction drag and aerodynamic noise. Moreover, the shape change locally induced by flaps to wing airfoils is clearly limited to the allowable flaps excursion; it follows that, in operative conditions, only a discrete set of few airfoil shapes can be achieved, each shape being related to a precise flap deflection angle within the allowable range. The naturally foreseen advantages of an adaptive high lift device able to smoothly change its shape according to flight conditions as well as the intent of reducing friction drag and emitted aerodynamic noise in take-off and landing, all represented valid motivations for the assessment of a novel flap technology. In the framework of the Low Noise Configuration domain of the Clean Sky – GRA ITD, the authors proved the feasibility of a morphing architecture enabling the controlled camber variation of a flap segment in compliance with top-level requirements pertinent to the next generation Green Regional Aircraft. The architecture is characterized by an Al-alloy multi-body morphing structure based on articulated ribs driven by electro-mechanical actuators. By referring to specific aerodynamic requirements in terms of target shapes and external loads expected in service, the structural layout of the device was preliminarily defined. Advanced FE analyses were then carried out in order to properly size the load-carrying components of the structure and the actuation system. Design performances were finally validated by experimental tests carried out on a true-scale prototype. The experimental campaign covered functionality, static and dynamic tests; obtained results showed high correlation levels with respect to numerical expectations thus proving the compliance of the device with design requirements as well as the goodness of modelling approaches implemented during the design phase...|$|E
40|$|Tests {{have been}} {{conducted}} to extend the existing low speed aerodynamic data base of advanced supersonic-cruise arrow wing configurations. Principle configuration variables included <b>wing</b> leading-edge <b>flap</b> <b>deflection,</b> <b>wing</b> trailing-edge <b>flap</b> <b>deflection,</b> horizontal tail effectiveness, and fuselage forebody strakes. A limited investigation was also conducted to determine the low speed aerodynamic effects due to slotted training-edge flaps. Results of this investigation demonstrate that deflecting the <b>wing</b> leading-edge <b>flaps</b> downward to suppress the wing apex vortices provides improved static longitudinal stability; however, it also results in significantly reduced static directional stability. The use of a selected fuselage forebody strakes {{is found to be}} effective in increasing the level of positive static directional stability. Drooping the fuselage nose, which is required for low-speed pilot vision, significantly improves the later-directional trim characteristics...|$|R

The analysis shows that for the Lark configuration with <b>wing</b> <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> of 0 degrees and 15 degrees the static longitudinal stability decreases slightly up to the critical Mach number and than as the Mach number increases further the stability increases greatly...|$|R
50|$|A {{longitudinal}} stabilizer is used {{to maintain}} the aircraft in longitudinal balance, or trim: it exerts a vertical force at a distance so that the summation of pitch moments about {{the center of gravity}} is zero. The vertical force exerted by the stabilizer to this effect varies with flight conditions, in particular according to the aircraft lift coefficient and <b>wing</b> <b>flaps</b> <b>deflection</b> which both affect the position of the center of lift, and with the position of the aircraft center of gravity (which changes with aircraft loading). Transonic flight makes special demands on horizontal stabilizers, since the crossing of the sound barrier is associated with a sudden move aft of the center of lift.|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} of lift force required by an aircraft during take-off and landing phases is conventionally obtained through <b>wing</b> <b>flap</b> <b>deflection.</b> Flaps are hinged surfaces located on wing trailing edge; their rotation generates an augmentation of aerodynamic sustentation force as consequence of an induced local modification of wing airfoil camber. Such devices are usually driven by control systems made of robust actuators and control lines that significantly {{contribute to the}} weight of the whole wing structure and, whereas proper external fairings are needed, also to wing friction drag and aerodynamic noise. Moreover, the shape change locally induced by flaps to wing airfoils is clearly limited to the allowable flaps excursion; it follows that, in operative conditions, only a discrete set of few airfoil shapes can be achieved, each shape being related to a precise flap deflection angle within the allowable range. From an aerodynamic standpoint, this implies that a conventional flap can generate just a finite number of extra-lift (and extra-drag) values each one corresponding to the finite number of deflections the flap may perform within the allowable range. The naturally foreseen advantages related to an adaptive high lift device able to smoothly change its shape according to flight parameters as well as the intent of reducing high-lift devices friction drag and emitted aerodynamic noise, represent all valid motivations to search for innovative flap architectures able to replace and/or improve conventional flaps system thanks to morphing camber capability. A morphing lifting surface is generally called to perform a transition from a baseline geometry to a target shape or to a set of target shapes, under the simultaneous action of aerodynamic loads, in turn influenced by that shape variation. Such an adaptive structure must be therefore conceived under contrasting design requirements: it has to be stiff enough to withstand external aerodynamic loads without appreciable deformations while being flexible enough to dramatically change its external shape. In the framework of JTI-Clean Sky project, authors investigated a high TRL solution for a morphing flap element to be implemented on a real-scale regional transportation aircraft. On the base of specific aerodynamic requirements in terms of target shapes and related external loads, the structural layout of the device was preliminarily defined. Advanced FE analyses were then carried out in order to properly size the load- carrying structure and the actuation system. A full scale limited span prototype was finally manufactured and tested to: - demonstrate the morphing capability of the conceived structural layout; - demonstrate the capability of the morphing structure to withstand static loads representative of the limit aerodynamic pressures expected in service; - characterize the dynamic behavior of the morphing structure through the identification of the most significant normal modes. Obtained results showed high correlation levels with respect to numerical expectations thus proving the compliance of the device with the design requirements as well as the goodness of modeling approaches implemented during the design phase...|$|E

At {{least one of}} the multiple spanwise flap segments includes a variable camber flap subsystem having multiple chordwise flap segments that may be independently actuated. Some embodiments also employ a continuous leading edge slat system that includes multiple spanwise slat segments, each of which has one or more chordwise slat segment. A method and an apparatus for implementing active control of a wing shape are also described and include the determination of desired lift distribution to determine the improved aerodynamic <b>deflection</b> of the <b>wings.</b> <b>Flap</b> <b>deflections</b> are determined and control signals are generated to actively control the wing shape to approximate the desired deflection...|$|R
40|$|A Au {{aircraft}} {{model with}} a close-coupled canard mounted above the wing chord plane was considered. Model angle of attack was varied from - 4 deg to 15 deg; canard incidence was varied from - 5 deg to 18 deg; and selected canard and <b>wing</b> <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> were investigated. By using the canard incidence for trim, maximum trimmed lift-drag ratios of about 8. 8, 7. 7, and 4. 7 were obtained at free-stream Mach numbers of 0. 40, 0. 90, and 1. 20, respectively. At a lift coefficient of 0. 60, model trim angle of attack could be varied over an incremental range between 3. 0 deg and 3. 8 deg, depending on Mach number, by different combinations of control settings. At high lift coefficients, larger trimmed lift-drag ratios were obtained by using the deflection capability of the canard leading- and trailing-edge flaps before increasing canard incidence angle...|$|R
40|$|The free-to-roll {{technique}} {{is used as}} a tool for predicting areas of uncommanded lateral motions. Recently, the NASA/Navy/Air Force Abrupt Wing Stall Program extended the use of this technique to the transonic speed regime. Using this technique, this paper evaluates various wing configurations on the pre-production F/A- 18 E aircraft and the Joint Strike Fighter (F- 35) aircraft. The configurations investigated include leading and trailing edge <b>flap</b> <b>deflections,</b> fences, leading edge flap gap seals, and vortex generators. These tests were conducted in the NASA Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel. The analysis used a modification of a figure-of-merit developed during the Abrupt Wing Stall Program to discern configuration effects. The results showed how the figure-of-merit can be used to schedule <b>wing</b> <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> to avoid areas of uncommanded lateral motion. The analysis also used both static and dynamic wind tunnel data to provide insight into the uncommanded lateral behavior. The dynamic data was extracted from the time history data using parameter identification techniques. In general, modifications to the pre-production F/A- 18 E resulted in shifts in angle-of-attack where uncommanded lateral activity occurred. Sealing the gap between the inboard and outboard leading-edge flaps on the Navy version of the F- 35 eliminated uncommanded lateral activity or delayed the activity to a higher angleof-attack.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the aerodynamic performance of vortex flaps on a 75 -deg sweep delta wing has been conducted in the NASA Langley Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at Mach numbers from 1. 7 to 2. 8. The sharp leading edge vortex flaps consisted of the outboard 30 percent of the local <b>wing</b> semispan. <b>Flap</b> <b>deflections</b> of 0, 5, 10, and 15 deg were investigated, for both a wing-alone and a wing-body configuration. The flaps were effective in reducing the drag across the lift-coefficient range. Integration of the upper surface pressure distributions showed that the suction pressures induced by the vortex on the flap {{were responsible for the}} drag reductions. At some lift conditions, the minimum drag condition permitted hinge line separation or vortex migration inboard of the hinge line. This result is in contrast to subsonic results, where optimum conditions call for no hinge line separation. The magnitude of the drag reduction due to <b>flap</b> <b>deflection</b> generally decreased as Mach number increased.

The data showed that the maximum lift at intermediate (20 deg. to 45 deg.) <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> was lowered considerably by the slot-entry extension; but at high <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> the effect was small. An increase in Reynolds number from 2. 4 million to 6. 0 million increased the maximum. lift coefficient at a <b>flap</b> <b>deflection</b> of 55 deg. from 3. 12 to 3. 30 and from 1. 18 to 1. 40 for the flap retracted condition, but did not greatly affect the maximum lift coefficient for intermediate <b>flap</b> <b>deflections.</b> The <b>flap</b> and fore flap load data indicated that the maximum lift coefficients at high <b>flap</b> <b>deflections</b> are limited by a breakdown in the flow over the. flaps...|$|R
