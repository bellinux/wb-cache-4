60|$|I {{was still}} lost in {{wonder at the}} sight <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> short, quick sob at my side.|$|E
60|$|I had got so far <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> {{noise of}} {{footsteps}} within, and Mr. Easton himself came out, in his shirt-sleeves.|$|E
60|$|It {{was growing}} dusky, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> loud whistle, and {{my name was}} called. I whistled in return, {{and in a few}} moments Walkirk came running to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "The whisky warmed me up a bit, and I 'ad {{just taken}} up the bottle to 'elp myself agin <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>'eard</b> <b>a</b> faint sort o' sound in the skipper's state-room. I put the bottle down and listened, but {{everything}} seemed deathly still. I took it up agin, and 'ad just poured out a drop o' whisky <b>when</b> <b>I</b> distinctly <b>'eard</b> <b>a</b> hissing noise {{and then a little}} moan.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, it {{was about}} eleven o'clock at night, and I was turning the lane into the Hit or Miss, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> awful {{flapping}} and hissing and whirring, like wings working by steam, in the waste ground {{at the side of}} the lane. And, as I was listening--oh, it frightens me now to think of it--oh, sir--" ...|$|R
6000|$|We had {{launched}} our canoe and gone but little {{way down the}} East Branch, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> answering shout from my companion, and soon after saw him standing on a point {{where there was a}} clearing {{a quarter of a mile}} below, and the smoke of his fire was rising near by. Before I saw him I naturally shouted again and again, but the Indian curtly remarked, [...] "He hears you," [...] as if once was enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. As I told you, I {{had only}} just {{discovered}} that she was so, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> footstep in the distance. But I shall see her again, tomorrow or next day." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was just}} {{measuring}} the Vermouth carefully <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> sound. Some man's voice groaned hoarsely: [...] "False, oh, God!--false, and Love {{is a lie}} and friendship but the byword of devils!" ...|$|E
60|$|As we {{made our}} way back to the drawing-room, I was hoping for a talk with Dolly (alas! I should not have many more), <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> voice which sounded strangely familiar.|$|E
6000|$|... "As sure {{as death}} I never kent you was here. I was up the Roods on my rounds <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> awfu' din {{down in the}} square, and thinks I, there's rough {{characters}} about, and the place for honest folk is their bed. So to my bed I gaed, and <b>I</b> was in't <b>when</b> your men gripped me." [...] "We must see into this before we leave. In the meantime you will act {{as a guide to}} my searchers. Stop! Do you know anything of this Egyptian?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{was sitting}} there with my feet outside, smoking <b>a</b> quiet pipe, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>’eard</b> <b>a</b> bit of a noise in the distance. Then <b>I</b> <b>’eard</b> people running and shouts of [...] "Stop, thief!" [...] A man came along round the corner full pelt, and, just as I got up, dashed through the wicket and ran on to the wharf. I was arter ’im like a shot and got up to ’im {{just in time to}} see him throw {{something}} into the dock. And at the same moment <b>I</b> <b>’eard</b> the other people run past the gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thirteen}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> Voice coming from God {{to help me}} to live well. I was frightened. It came at midday, in my father's garden in the summer." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{was still}} searching the horizon <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> soft {{footstep}} on the raft behind me, {{and a light}} hand was laid upon my shoulder. [...] "Forgive me," [...] said the girl's voice.|$|E
60|$|Here I had sat awhile lost in ease <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> {{footstep}} approaching and the rhythmical rustling of drapery, {{and knew}} eyes were now regarding me that I feared, yet much desired to meet.|$|E
60|$|This {{thought was}} in my mind <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> {{rustling}} of the foliage on the outside near where I stood, and that instant I made as if to copy the example of my companion.|$|E
60|$|But if I was extreamly {{delighted with}} the {{extraordinary}} things I saw in those Countries, you cannot but imagine I was exceedingly mov'd, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>a</b> Lunar World; and that the way was passable from these Parts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Dane dryly, [...] "as I admitted, it {{appeared}} somewhat {{out of your}} usual line, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>a</b> man from the settlement had been ejected with violence from your homestead, what could one believe?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> these words, <b>a</b> light {{began to}} fall upon the figure I had seen {{following}} them, some hours ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "One evening I {{was sitting}} among the rocks. It was very calm and getting dark <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> rattle and a splash. I {{reckoned}} Steve was looking hard for something if he trod on a loose stone." ...|$|E
6000|$|Two were {{pressing}} me {{so closely}} that I could not turn <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> movement behind me, {{and noted that}} {{the sound of the}} battle anthem had ceased. Was Dejah Thoris preparing to take her place beside me? ...|$|E
60|$|Half {{the night}} {{must have been}} spent <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> sound in the trench near the hut. It resembled muffled sobs. Presently a figure appeared, silhouetted against the lesser {{darkness}} beyond the doorway. It crept inside the hut.|$|E
60|$|He {{was sitting}} on deck <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went out, and his missis too, but neither of 'em spoke a word. I picked up my broom and went on sweeping, <b>when</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>'eard</b> <b>a</b> voice at the gate I thought I knew, and in came my wife.|$|R
60|$|I had {{perhaps the}} {{fraction}} of a second longer to live <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> angry growl behind us mingle with a cry of pain and rage from the giant who carried me. Instantly he went backward to the deck, and as he did so he threw his arms outwards to save himself, freeing me. I fell heavily upon him, but was upon my feet in the instant. As I arose, I cast a single glance at my opponent. Never again would he menace me or another, for Nob's great jaws had closed upon his throat. Then I sprang {{toward the edge of the}} deck closest to the girl upon the sinking tug.|$|R
6000|$|... "The horror which {{filled my}} mind as I sat in the half {{darkness}} waiting for their return I cannot describe. My fate appeared sealed and I gave myself up for lost, <b>when</b> presently <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> light step {{in the hall and}} the key turned in the lock.|$|R
60|$|One rainy autumn evening, while I {{was still}} {{practicing}} {{as a country}} doctor, I was sitting alone, thinking over a case then under my charge, which sorely perplexed me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> low {{knock at the door}} of my room.|$|E
60|$|Two Prussian corps {{had passed}} {{and a third}} was coming up, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> great fuss {{and the sound of}} several voices in the sitting-room. By {{altering}} my position I was able to look down and see what was going on.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{made for}} this mark as swiftly as I could, {{and for the}} clump of trees to which I had been directed. Oh, what a relief I had <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> low voice humming there, 'Over the hills and far away'!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. I {{was sitting}} up to finish a cigar, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> noise in this direction. On coming to his room I find he is not there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I surmised {{she was on}} {{the verge}} of {{bankruptcy}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> she'd bought <b>a</b> new motor. And you seriously think Charlie wants to marry her? ...|$|R
60|$|But an {{adventure}} came {{to break the}} monotony of this long wait. I was seated beside my loophole and congratulating myself that the corps was nearly past, and that the road would soon be clear for my journey, <b>when</b> suddenly <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> loud altercation break out in French in the kitchen.|$|R
60|$|About half-past seven I woke, {{and opened}} my window on a fine sunshiny day. The clock had struck eight, and I {{was just going}} out to chain up the dogs again, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> sudden whisking of {{petticoats}} on the stairs behind me.|$|E
60|$|The lion {{was halfway}} across the {{clearing}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> slight sound behind me. The great cat stopped in his tracks. He lashed his tail against his sides now, instead of simply twitching its tip, and his low moan became a thunderous roar.|$|E
6000|$|There wasn't {{anything}} else in the room to divide, and we were just about to come out and call the thing settled, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> shout at the door. I turned around, and there stood Harry Alden, and Scott, and Tom Myers and his brother George! ...|$|E
60|$|Engaged in {{conversation}} with Rupert Bailey, I was paying little attention to this evidence of an awakening world, <b>when</b> suddenly <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> hoarse, triumphant cry from Arthur Jukes, and, turned, I perceived his ball dropping neatly into the car's interior. Arthur himself, brandishing a niblick, was dancing about in the fairway.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, the {{innocent}} sounds of mirth ring sweetly on my ears, like the notes of birds. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> charming voice singing {{to the little}} ones, I have listened with delight. Would it be too presumptuous to beg the air songstress to repeat her song for the old recluse?" ...|$|R
60|$|However, spilt milk blows nobody any good, and it {{is useless}} to dwell upon it. The task now confronting Bertram was to put matters right, and I was pacing the lawn, pondering to this end, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{suddenly}} <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> groan so lost-soulish that I thought it must have proceeded from Uncle Tom, escaped from captivity and come to groan in the garden.|$|R
