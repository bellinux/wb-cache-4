5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning <b>with</b> <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E

Wealthier Romans were often accompanied by one or more slaves, who performed any required tasks such as fetching refreshment, guarding valuables, providing towels, and at the end of the session, applying olive oil to their masters' bodies which was then scraped off with a strigil, a scraper made of wood or bone.

25|$|Animal {{control and}} {{vaccination}} programs have decreased {{the risk of}} rabies from dogs {{in a number of}} regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those who are at high risk. The high-risk group includes people who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms. Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes <b>with</b> <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> povidone iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission. Only six people have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms, and this was with extensive treatment known as the Milwaukee protocol.|$|E
25|$|The US Navy {{dispatched}} {{aircraft carrier}} USS Ronald Reagan and other vessels which flew {{a series of}} helicopter operations. A spokesman for U.S. 7th Fleet naval personnel stated that monitoring equipment indicated that the warship {{had been exposed to}} radiation. Separate hand-held equipment also picked up the contamination on 17 crew members, who had participated in rescue operations. Commander Jeff Davis said that the exposure was low enough that after the crew washed <b>with</b> <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> follow-up tests were negative. Davis characterized the exposure as comparable to routine civilian activities and reiterated the US Navy's commitment to the relief operation. As a precaution, the aircraft carrier was repositioned farther offshore, away from the downwind direction of the plant and decontaminated. Several helicopters were decontaminated after returning from flights. One helicopter made a landing at Fukushima Airport after experiencing rotor icing and exposed some Australian and New Zealand search and rescue team members to low levels of radiation.|$|E

25|$|Prevention of snake bites {{can involve}} wearing {{protective}} footwear, avoiding areas where snakes live, and not handling snakes. Treatment partly {{depends on the}} type of snake. Washing the wound <b>with</b> <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> and holding the limb still is recommended. Trying to suck out the venom, cutting the wound with a knife, or using a tourniquet is not recommended. Antivenom is effective at preventing death from bites; however, antivenoms frequently have side effects. The type of antivenom needed depends {{on the type of}} snake involved. When the type of snake is unknown, antivenom is often given based on the types known to be in the area. In some areas of the world getting the right type of antivenom is difficult and this partly contributes to why they sometimes do not work. An additional issue is the cost of these medications. Antivenom has little effect on the area around the bite itself. Supporting the person's breathing is sometimes also required.|$|E
500|$|As {{was common}} at the time, Mao began embarking on farming {{activities}} aged five or six, being instructed {{to watch over}} the cattle and tend to the ducks. Mao's habits were heavily influenced by his peasant background; biographer Stuart Schram suggested that this {{took the form of}} a [...] "lack of social graces and of a concern either for comfort or appearances." [...] In later life, Mao would never become accustomed to the use of a toothbrush, instead retaining the habit of washing his mouth out with tea. Similarly, he continued to prefer cleaning himself with a steaming towel than <b>with</b> <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> again reflecting his peasant upbringing. Further, it was from traditional Hunanese cuisine that he developed his lifelong love of spicy food.|$|E

50|$|Avoiding food {{or water}} that may be {{contaminated}} with stool can help prevent the infection of Cystoisospora (Isosporiasis).

40|$|Abstract: Handwashing {{is thought}} to be {{effective}} for the prevention of transmission of diarrhoea pathogens. However it is not conclusive that handwashing <b>with</b> <b>soap</b> is more effective at reducing contamination with bacteria associated with diarrhoea than using water only. In this study 20 volunteers contaminated their hands deliberately by touching door handles and railings in public spaces. They were then allocated at random to (1) handwashing with water, (2) handwashing <b>with</b> non-antibacterial <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> (3) no handwashing. Each volunteer underwent this procedure 24 times, yielding 480 samples overall. Bacteria of potential faecal origin (mostly Enterococcus and Enterobacter spp.) were found after no handwashing in 44 % of samples. Handwashing with water alone reduced the presence of bacteria to 23 % (p < 0. 001). Handwashing <b>with</b> plain <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> reduced the presence of bacteria to 8 % (comparison of both handwashing arms: p < 0. 001). The effect did not appear to depend on the bacteria species. Handwashing <b>with</b> non-antibacterial <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> is more effective for the removal of bacteria of potential faecal origin from hands than handwashing with <b>water</b> alone <b>and</b> should therefore be more useful for the prevention of transmission of diarrhoeal diseases...|$|R
