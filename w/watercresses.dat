40|$|We {{investigated}} the potential role of defensive {{chemicals in the}} avoidance of <b>watercress</b> (Nasturtium officinale) by the cooccurring amphipod, Gammarus pseudolimnaeus at two spring brooks: Carp Creek, Michigan and Squabble Brook, Connecticut. We conducted observations and laboratory experiments on the consumption of <b>watercress,</b> the toxicity of damaged (frozen) <b>watercress,</b> and the toxicity of damage-released secondary chemicals. Field-collected yellowed <b>watercress</b> typically lacked the bite and odor characteristic of green <b>watercress</b> and was consumed by G. pseudolimnaeus. G. pseudolimnaeus strongly preferred yellowed <b>watercress</b> to green <b>watercress</b> despite the higher nitrogen content of the latter (2. 7 vs 5. 4 %), and usually consumed five times more yellowed <b>watercress</b> (> 50 % of yellowed leaf area vs. < 8 % of green leaf area presented). Fresh green <b>watercress</b> contained seven times more phenylethyl glucosinolate than yellowed <b>watercress</b> (8. 9 mg/g wet vs. 1. 2 mg/g). Cell-damaged (frozen) <b>watercress</b> was toxic to G. pseudolimnaeus (48 -hr LC 50 s: ca. 1 g wet/liter), and the primary volatile secondary chemicals released by damage were highly toxic. The predominant glucosinolate hydrolysis product, 2 -phenylethyl isothiocyanate had 48 -hr LC 50 s between 0. 96 and 3. 62 mg/liter, whereas 3 -phenylpropionitrile was less toxic, with 48 -hr LC 50 s between 130 and 211 mg/liter. These results suggest that live <b>watercress</b> is chemically defended against consumption. The glucosinolate-myrosinase system, recognized as the principle deterrent system of terrestrial crucifers, is also possessed by N. officinale and may contribute to defense from herbivory by aquatic crustaceans.

40|$|Background: Consuming <b>watercress</b> {{is thought}} to provide health {{benefits}} {{as a consequence of}} its phytonutrient composition. However, for <b>watercress</b> there are currently limited genetic resources underpinning breeding efforts for either yield or phytonutritional traits. In this paper, we use RNASeq data from twelve <b>watercress</b> accessions to characterize the transcriptome, perform candidate gene mining and conduct differential expression analysis for two key phytonutritional traits: antioxidant (AO) capacity and glucosinolate (GLS) content. Results: The <b>watercress</b> transcriptome was assembled to 80, 800 transcripts (48, 732 unigenes); 71 % of which were annotated based on orthology to Arabidopsis. Differential expression analysis comparing <b>watercress</b> accessions with ‘high’ and ‘low’ AO and GLS resulted in 145 and 94 differentially expressed loci for AO capacity and GLS respectively. Differentially expressed loci between high and low AO <b>watercress</b> were significantly enriched for genes involved in plant defence and response to stimuli, in line with the observation that AO are involved in plant stress-response. Differential expression between the high and low GLS <b>watercress</b> identified links to GLS regulation and also novel transcripts warranting further investigation. Additionally, we successfully identified <b>watercress</b> orthologs for Arabidopsis phenylpropanoid, GLS and shikimate biosynthesis pathway genes, and compiled a catalogue of polymorphic markers for future applications. Conclusions: Our work describes the first transcriptome of <b>watercress</b> and establishes the foundation for further molecular study by providing valuable resources, including sequence data, annotated transcripts, candidate genes and markers...|$|R

By this time we were indeed in a melancholy plight, footsore, half starved, and utterly worn out; and, in addition, I was suffering from a sharp attack of fever, which half blinded me and made me weak as a babe. Our ammunition, too, was exhausted; I had only one cartridge left for my eight-bore rifle, and Hans and Mashune, who were armed with Martini Henrys, had three between them. It was about an hour from sundown when we halted and lit a fire--for luckily we had still a few matches. It was a charming spot to camp, I remember. Just off the game track we were following was a little hollow, fringed about with flat-crowned mimosa trees, and {{at the bottom of}} the hollow, a spring of clear water welled up out of the earth, and formed a pool, round the edges of which grew an abundance of <b>watercresses</b> of an exactly similar kind to those which were handed round the table just now. Now we had no food of any kind left, having that morning devoured the last remains of a little oribé antelope, which I had shot two days previously.

I was too weak to go myself.|$|E
60|$|Further on was {{the cloth}} mart. Here were {{women and men}} selling the black {{blankets}} which almost all women here wear, {{in addition to the}} ornamented skins, which form the only garments of the Senafe women. These blankets, which are very large, are worn wrapped round the body, and secured on one shoulder by a large iron pin. The blankets are coarse and thin, and have but little warmth. Officers have, however, bought large numbers for their servants, who feel the cold at night much. When we are stationary for a few days the followers construct some sort of tents with gunny-bags and clothes, but upon the march they have, of course, to sleep in the open air. Near to the vendors of blankets for the women are the sellers of the white-cotton cloth for the men. These are always men; I have seen no women engaged in selling cloth. I have no doubt they carry it to the market, but the men take the sale into their own hands. This is, perhaps, the busiest part of the fair. But beyond this we come to the largest and by far the most amusing portion of all. This is the miscellaneous market. Vegetables and herbs occupy by far the largest share of this. Here are women and girls with herbs of every sort and kind, of very few indeed of which I had any previous knowledge. Here, too, are women with tobacco, very coarse, and broken up roughly, instead of being cut. The tobacco, of course, is carried in the skins, which appear to be the receptacles for everything in this country. Here are men with salt, in shape and appearance exceedingly like a mower’s whetstone. These serve as money, and are laid out upon the ground at so many for a dollar, but if the salesman sees a European approaching he will abstract a portion, and demand a dollar for {{less than half of the}} number which should be given for that amount. Here are men selling the blue string, which all Christians wear round their neck in token of their faith. Here are men selling the great iron pins, with a rough attempt at ornament upon their heads, which all women use to fasten their blankets upon their shoulders. Here are women with strings of beads, and pumpkins, and <b>watercresses,</b> and dried herbs, and chillies, and honey, and garlic, and potatoes, and young onions for sale. A miscellaneous catalogue, and sold quite as miscellaneously, for the goods are sold by barter more than for money, and each vendor will bring in half-a-dozen small baskets, which she places before her to contain the various articles which she may receive in exchange. Thus, for her beads she may get some grain, a few bulbs of garlic, and a bar or two of salt. Some of these, again, she will barter for a pumpkin, a chicken, and some dried herbs; and so the commerce is carried on. Imagine a large number of these dark-faced, scantily-dressed people, very grave over their purchases, but very merry, as is their wont, in their conversation with each other, the men generally walking about, the women squatting behind their wares, always in groups, and laughing, chattering, and looking after their children—strange little potbellied black figures, with half of their heads shaved, and their sole garment a very small piece of goatskin on their shoulder. Some of the girls are, as I have already said, really pretty, with beautiful brown eyes. They have no objection to be looked at and admired. They pretend, of course, to be very shy, and half hide their faces, and look the other way; but really are very amused and a good deal gratified when a European pauses to look at them. It is singular how similar is the constitution of the female mind in savage and in civilised countries. An English beauty certainly does not betray any consciousness of being looked at and admired, excepting, of course, if she be a milkmaid; but she is no doubt equally conscious, and perhaps just as pleased—except that the sensation is more a matter of course—as is the dark-eyed and dark-skinned Abyssinian girl sitting in her scanty leathern garment and shell-ornamented wrapper in the market at Attegrat.|$|E
