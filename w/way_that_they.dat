5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl in the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E

5|$|Divergence and convergence: In {{the human}} cerebellum, {{information}} from 200 million mossy fiber inputs is expanded to 40 billion granule cells, whose parallel fiber outputs then converge onto 15 million Purkinje cells. Because of the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{are lined up}} longitudinally, the 1000 or so Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone may receive input from as many as 100 million parallel fibers, and focus their own output down {{to a group of}} less than 50 deep nuclear cells. Thus, the cerebellar network receives a modest number of inputs, processes them very extensively through its rigorously structured internal network, and sends out the results via a very limited number of output cells.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the assumed}} role of these jamaat members cycle in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may be engaged as a preacher, a cook or as a cleaner at other times. Among Tabligh Jamaat members, this is {{generally}} {{referred to as}} khidmat which essentially connotes to serving their companions and freeing them for tablighi engagements. The members of the Jamaat are assigned these roles based on the day's mashwara. The markaz keeps records of each jamaat and its members, the identity of whom is verified from their respective mosques. Mosques are used to assist the tablighi activities of individual jamaats that voluntarily undertake preaching missions. Members of a jamaat, ideally, pay expenses themselves {{so as to avoid}} financial dependence on anyone.|$|E
5|$|Just like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and {{activate}} GR. However, {{in contrast}} to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR in such a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E

5|$|Mayfly nymphs {{may serve}} as hosts for parasites such as {{nematodes}} and trematodes. Some of these affect the nymphs' behaviour in such a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> become {{more likely to be}} predated. Other nematodes turn adult male mayflies into quasi-females which haunt the edges of streams, enabling the parasites to break their way out into the aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles. The nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for the horsehair worm Paragordius varius, which causes its definitive host, a grasshopper, to jump into water and drown.|$|E
5|$|Voting {{during the}} three shows {{consisted}} of 50 percent public televoting and 50 percent from a jury deliberation. The jury consisted of five music industry professionals who were citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury was asked to judge each contestant based on vocal capacity, the stage performance, the song's composition and originality, and the overall impression of the act. In addition, no member of a national jury could be related {{in any way to}} any of the competing acts in such a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member were released shortly after the grand final.|$|E
5|$|Drowned World Tour was {{the fifth}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna in support of her seventh and eighth studio albums Ray of Light and Music. It was also her first tour in eight years, {{following}} The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993. The tour was supposed to start in 1999, but was delayed until 2001 as Madonna {{gave birth to her}} son, got married to Guy Ritchie, was working on Music, and was busy filming The Next Best Thing. When the tour was decided, Madonna appointed Jamie King as choreographer and the tour was planned in a short timespan of three months, including signing up the dancers, musicians and technicians. Designer Jean-Paul Gaultier was the costume designer who designed the costumes in such <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> indicated different phases of Madonna's career. The poster and logo for the tour included references to Kabbalah, which Madonna studied.|$|E

40|$|The paper brings {{together}} three rather unlikely texts, the thirteenth-century Byzantine romance The Tale of Livistros and Rodamne, the thirteenth-century Old French Roman de la Rose, and the fifteenth-century Italian prose romance Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, which {{are characterized by}} their lengthy dream narratives in which a first-person narrator is initiated in the art and the mysteries of love. Focusing {{on a group of}} instructive speeches contained within or indirectly connected with these dream narratives, this paper examines instruction as an integral component of the initiation process and as a powerful rhetorical tool moving the narrative – and the love story of the protagonist couple – forward. In doing so, the paper also highlights the ideas about love expressed {{in each of the three}} romances, the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> interconnect and the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> differ...|$|R
5|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, in such a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion.|$|E
5|$|Level-5 {{collaborated with}} Studio Ghibli {{to produce the}} game's {{animated}} sequences, and the game features graphics and visuals replicating the traditional animation style of Studio Ghibli films. The collaboration began when musician Naoya Fujimaki, who had previously worked with both companies, introduced Level-5 president Akihiro Hino to Studio Ghibli president Toshio Suzuki. At the time, Studio Ghibli had completed work on Ponyo (2008), and the animation team had no ongoing projects, which influenced Suzuki's decision to collaborate with Level-5. Another influencing factor of the collaboration was witnessing Hino's passion for the project. Studio Ghibli approached the production process in the same <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would create an animated film. Work on the animation began in July 2008, and took much longer than the predicted three months.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux {{was known}} as a {{mathematician}} and maker of mathematical instruments such as compasses and hourglasses. He became acquainted with many prominent men of the day, including the writer Richard Hakluyt and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright. He also knew the explorers Thomas Cavendish, Francis Drake, Walter Raleigh and John Davis. Davis probably introduced Molyneux to his own patron, the London merchant William Sanderson, who largely financed the construction of the globes. When completed, the globes were presented to Elizabeth I. Larger globes were acquired by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions, while smaller ones were purchased as practical navigation aids for sailors and students. The globes were the first to be made in such a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were unaffected by the humidity at sea, and they came into general use on ships.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} half of the nineteenth century, Mexico City {{residents}} started to experience an increase in the frequency and intensity of fires. Residents cited the presence of fossil fuels, the introduction of large factories and electrical apparatuses, and the growing population density as the primary reasons that urban fires became more prevalent. Fire hazards acted as catalysts for social change in Mexico's capital. They created a ripple effect across society, altering everything from city planning to medical advancements to business endeavors, shaping the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> people experienced a period of significant urban growth. Fire forced people to adjust the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> lived their lives, the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> conducted business, and the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> thought about their city. Rather than looking at one great fire, this study contributes to a growing branch of disaster studies that examines the effects of much smaller, but far more frequent hazards. By drawing on the experiences of residents from different social groups (business owners, firemen, engineers, city officials, entrepreneurs, insurance agents, and physicians), this study shows how residents reacted differently to fire and how they feared and coped with the nearly constant presence of risk. Prevailing historiography of this time period in Mexico is often characterized by studies of the top-down projects of the dictator Porfirio Diaz, but this project shows how social actors collectively transformed their city in response to an environmental threat...|$|R

5|$|The ZX81's {{built-in}} RF modulator can output a video {{picture to}} either a UHF 625-line colour or monochrome television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France required a slightly {{modified version of the}} machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets, while the USA and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback in the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> handle visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a keystroke – takes place.|$|E
