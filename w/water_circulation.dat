In 2012, it produced about 70% of Estonia's ordinary waste, 82% of its hazardous waste, and more than 70% of its greenhouse gas emissions. Its activities lower groundwater levels, alter <b>water</b> <b>circulation,</b> and spoil water quality. Water pumped from the mines and used by oil shale-fired power stations exceeds 90% of all water used in Estonia. Leachates from waste heaps pollute surface and groundwater.

5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E

25|$|In 1909, {{the army}} decided to {{integrate}} airship reconnaissance into its military manoeuvres {{of that year}} ("Les grandes Manoeuvres du Bourbonnais") and the République was assigned to this task. A temporary hangar, comprising a metal framework over which a fabric skin was draped, was constructed at Lapalisse to accommodate the airship. On 3 September 1909, the République set off from Chalais-Meudon for the flight to Lapalisse. After 62 miles (105km), while over La Charité-sur-Loire, the motor overheated due to poor <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> {{and had to be}} stopped immediately, requiring the crew to land in poor conditions at Policards, in the commune of Jussy-le-Chaudrier.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main EBPVD configurations, {{electromagnetic}} alignment, electromagnetic focusing and the pendant drop configuration. Electromagnetic alignment and electromagnetic focusing use evaporation {{material that is}} in the form of an ingot, while the pendant drop configuration uses a rod. Ingots are enclosed in a copper crucible or hearth, while a rod will be mounted at one end in a socket. Both the crucible and socket must be cooled. This is typically done by <b>water</b> <b>circulation.</b> In the case of ingots, molten liquid can form on its surface, which can be kept constant by vertical displacement of the ingot.

25|$|The bog {{chemical}} environment involves a completely saturated acidic environment, where considerable concentrations of organic acids and aldehydes are present. Layers of sphagnum and peat assist in preserving the cadavers by enveloping the tissue {{in a cold}} immobilizing matrix, impeding <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> and any oxygenation. An additional feature of anaerobic preservation by acidic bogs {{is the ability to}} conserve hair, clothing and leather items. Modern experimenters have been able to mimic bog conditions in the laboratory and successfully demonstrate the preservation process, albeit over shorter time frames than the 2,500 years that Haraldskær Woman's body has survived. Most of the bog bodies discovered showed some aspects of decay or else were not properly conserved. When such specimens are exposed to the normal atmosphere, they may begin to decompose rapidly. As a result, many specimens have been effectively destroyed. As of 1979, the number of specimens that have been preserved following discovery was 53.|$|E
25|$|When {{refrigeration}} {{first arrived}} (the 19th century) the equipment was initially used to cool cans of milk, which were filled by hand milking. These cans were placed into a cooled water bath {{to remove heat}} and keep them cool until {{they were able to}} be transported to a collection facility. As more automated methods were developed for harvesting milk, hand milking was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a bulk milk cooler. 'Ice banks' were the first type of bulk milk cooler. This was a double wall vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the bottom and sides of the tank. A small refrigeration compressor was used to remove heat from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system shuts off. When the milking operation starts, only the milk agitator and the <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> pump, which flows water across the ice and the steel walls of the tank, are needed to reduce the incoming milk to a temperature below 5 degrees.|$|E
25|$|Restoration {{work by the}} Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), in {{collaboration}} with Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), began around 1999 after research work, which started in 1997, and was completed in March 2003. Around 12 hectares of lawns were replanted, and over 2500 trees and plants, including mango, lemon, neem, hibiscus and jasmine cuttings, were planted in the gardens. Installation of a new <b>water</b> <b>circulation</b> system for the walkway channels was also undertaken. To ensure that water flowed naturally through the channels and pools on the 12-hectare (30 acre) site {{without the aid of}} hydraulic systems, the water channels were re-laid to an exacting grade of one centimetre every 40 metres (1:4000 slope). This eventually enabled water to flow through the watercourses in the gardens, and dormant fountains to start functioning once again. Other tasks in this mammoth restoration project included setting up a rainwater harvesting system using 128 ground water recharge pits, and desilting and revitalising old wells that were discovered during the restoration work. This was first a privately funded collaborative effort {{under the aegis of the}} National Cultural Fund (NCF) by the ASI. Funding included a sum of $650,000 from the Aga Khan Trust for Culture of His Highness the Aga Khan, with help from the Oberoi Hotels Group.

30|$|The {{complexity}} of oceanic circulations {{around the island}} of Taiwan generated a high diversity of marine life, comprising about 10 % of the world's total marine fauna and including {{a large number of}} endemic species.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of heat fluxes and temperature distribution in continental rocks is of great importance for many engineering aspects (tunnelling, mining, geothermal research,…). This paper aims at providing a conceptual model of temperature distribution in karst environments which display thermal “anomalies” {{when compared to other}} rocks. In temperate regions, <b>water</b> <b>circulations</b> are usually high enough to completely “drain out” the geothermal heat flux at the bottom of karst systems (phreatic zone). A theoretical approach based on temperature measurements carried out in deep caves and boreholes demonstrates however that air circulations can largely dominate water infiltrations in the karst vadose zone, which can be as thick as 2000 m. Consequently, temperature gradients within this zone are similar to the lapse rate of humid air (~ 0. 5 °C/ 100 m). Yet, this value depends on the regional climatic context and might present some significant variations...|$|R
25|$|Another theory {{proposed}} by Ewing and Donn in 1956 hypothesized that an ice-free Arctic Ocean leads to increased snowfall at high latitudes. When low-temperature ice covers the Arctic Ocean {{there is little}} evaporation or sublimation and the polar regions are quite dry in terms of precipitation, comparable to the amount found in mid-latitude deserts. This low precipitation allows high-latitude snowfalls to melt during the summer. An ice-free Arctic Ocean absorbs solar radiation during the long summer days, and evaporates more water into the Arctic atmosphere. With higher precipitation, portions of this snow may not melt {{during the summer and}} so glacial ice can form at lower altitudes and more southerly latitudes, reducing the temperatures over land by increased albedo as noted above. Furthermore, under this hypothesis the lack of oceanic pack ice allows increased exchange of waters between the Arctic and the North Atlantic Oceans, warming the Arctic and cooling the North Atlantic. (Current projected consequences of global warming include a largely ice-free Arctic Ocean within 5–20 years, see Arctic shrinkage.) Additional fresh water flowing into the North Atlantic during a warming cycle may also reduce the global ocean <b>water</b> <b>circulation.</b> Such a reduction (by reducing the effects of the Gulf Stream) would have a cooling effect on northern Europe, which in turn would lead to increased low-latitude snow retention during the summer. It has also been suggested that during an extensive glacial, glaciers may move through the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, extending into the North Atlantic Ocean far enough to block the Gulf Stream.|$|E

40|$|Feasibility of {{electrochemically}} generated biocides in papermaking {{was evaluated}} in pilot scale trials. The trials indicated that electrochemically generated biocides prevent microbial growth and proliferation in broke systems, {{as well as}} in <b>water</b> <b>circulations.</b> The spoilage of broke can be delayed, and already spoiled broke can be recovered using these biocides. The improved broke quality increases the stability of the paper machine and, consequently, less broke is produced. The biocides can be added to water or pulp, and they have hardly any negative effect on the process or the end product. The presence of reducing compounds may cause limitations in the use of these oxidative biocides. It was observed that electrochemically generated biocide was also efficient against heat-resistant spores. However, the biocide was less efficient against spores as compared to vegetative cells, both aerobic and anaerobic, especially when the spore numbers were higher than 104 cfu/ml. Onsite oxidant production eliminates the transportation and storage of biocides. Moreover, due to the short time between the production and use, the degradation of the active compounds can be minimized...|$|R
