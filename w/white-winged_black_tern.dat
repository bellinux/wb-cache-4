500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, <b>white-winged</b> <b>black</b> <b>tern,</b> alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

40|$|Many terns (Laridae) {{from the}} {{northern}} hemisphere overwinter in Australia, but they are rarely covered comprehensively in bird counts in Australian coastal waterways. We conducted censuses over 3 years on terns in an increasingly popular recreational waterway at {{the northern end of}} Moreton Bay, known as Caloundra sandbanks, to provide the first overview of the relative abundance of non-breeding tern species on estuary-type sandbanks in Australia. The maximum number of birds counted was > 43, 000, of which over 90 % belonged to six species of terns. The most abundant tern species was the common tern Sterna hirundo longipennis which reached > 38, 000 in one Austral summer. Other northern-breeding migrant terns were the <b>white-winged</b> <b>black</b> <b>tern</b> Chlidonias leucopterus (> 17, 000) and the little tern S. albifrons sinensis (> 11, 000), which also breeds in Australia. These migrant terns arrived at Caloundra sandbanks at around late-October and a vast majority had departed by mid-April. Numbers were generally highest from late-December through to early-April. An additional three Australian-breeding terns of smaller population sizes frequented the sandbanks. Density of terns using the habitats could reach a peak of 600 ha− 1 during the warmer months of the year, coinciding with peak human recreational activities. In light of the results, Caloundra sandbanks should be regarded as an Area of International Importance based on criteria contained in the Ramsar Convention.
