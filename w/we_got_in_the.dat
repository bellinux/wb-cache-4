500|$|In 2003, one of Sesame Street's {{international}} co-productions, Takalani Sesame, {{caused some}} {{controversy in the}} US when the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, was created in response to South Africa's AIDS epidemic. It {{marked the first time}} AIDS and the goal of confronting the disease's stigma was included in a preschool curriculum. According to the documentary, The World According to Sesame Street, the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop. Some members of Congress attacked Sesame Street, Sesame Workshop, and PBS. According to co-producer Naila Farouky, [...] "The reaction <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US blew me away. I didn't expect people to be so horrible... and hateful and mean". The controversy in the US was short-lived, and died down when the public discovered the facts about the South African co-production, and when United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and prominent minister and conservative political commentator Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts. Kami went on to be named UNICEF's Champion for Children in November 2003.|$|E
500|$|In 2001 the Workshop {{introduced}} Sesame English, {{a series}} focused on teaching {{children and their}} families the basics of the English language and on familiarizing them with some aspects of American culture. As of 2009 it aired in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Italy. In 2003, in response to the epidemic of AIDS in South Africa, the co-producers of Takalani Sesame included the first preschool AIDS/HIV curriculum. They created the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, to confront the stigma of HIV and AIDS in South Africa. According to the documentary The World According to Sesame Street, the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop. Some members of Congress attacked Sesame Street, Sesame Workshop (previously, the CTW), and PBS. According to co-producer Naila Farouky, [...] "The reaction <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US blew me away. I didn't expect people to be so horrible... and hateful and mean". The controversy in the US was short-lived, and died down when the public discovered the facts about the South African co-production, and when UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and American televangelist and conservative activist Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop's efforts.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} several negative reviews. Andrew Billen, writing for The Times, lamented that Davies had [...] "forgotten that Doctor Who's main {{task is to}} send children scuttling behind sofas while entertaining their fathers with the odd philosophical idea, the occasional classical reference, a joke or two they would probably not wish to explain and a wee bit of space totty". Billen also criticised the writing and acting, but commended Tate for a [...] "toned down performance". Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal summarised it as [...] "a runaway Saturday morning cartoon in desperate need to a solid story". Blair found flaws with the comedy and the music in the episode, but was impressed with Tate's acting and Piper's cameo. Kevin O'Sullivan of the Sunday Mirror criticised Tate and Tennant for overacting, and had concerns about the writing: [...] "It didn't exactly ooze tension. All <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of terrifying space enemies was Sarah Lancashire hamming it up as an intergalactic super nanny, a couple of security guards with guns and lots of cute little fat babies." [...] Ian Hyland of News of the World criticised the child-friendly storyline, comparing it to [...] "the back of a fag packet". He also criticised Tennant for appearing [...] "jaded" [...] and Tate for [...] "still shouting".|$|E

2500|$|Also in 2002 {{they were}} invited by ABC's Radio National to {{represent}} Australia at the European Broadcasting Union's International Folk Festival in Hamburg. Lucas recalled [...] "e {{were a bit}} different… {{it was kind of}} scary, but it was really good. We got a really good response. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local paper. We got to meet the Mayor of Hamburg town. We couldn’t understand what he was saying to us, and he couldn’t understand us either, so we had a great time". During the following year they performed at various Australian festivals and at venues across the country. A proposed appearance at the 2003 Shanghai Spring International Music Festival in May was postponed to the following year due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. They toured southern China and were broadcast by radio stations based in Shanghai.|$|E
2500|$|Remarkably, Bore {{found the}} middle of the bat time and again, and when the last over started, another 14 runs were needed. Stephen Booth bowled the first ball of the season's last over and Bore scored a boundary. [...] The second ball went to the ropes again, and the third went for two runs. [...] Nottinghamshire needed four more runs from three balls to {{complete}} a remarkable win. Bore blocked the fourth ball and Andy Pick, Nottinghamshire's number 11, walked down the pitch to ask [...] "What did you do that for?" [...] "It wasn't in the right place." [...] Bore replied. The next delivery saw Bore launch a blow towards the stands. [...] The crowd and the entire Nottingham team were on their feet and Bore thought, as soon as he'd hit it, [...] "That's it, we've won". However Somerset's Richard Ollis ran in and caught the ball above his head, just ten feet from the boundary. [...] Nottinghamshire had lost by three runs and Bore's innings had been in vain. [...] As Bore related in an interview with Simon Lister [...] "We were stunned. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car and I don't think we spoke a word until we were well past Gloucester. No matter how many times I lie in bed and replay that ball I never score those four runs".|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, November 21, {{a hunting}} party of about 15 {{people were in}} a cabin on this private land. [...] Terry Willers, {{one of the two}} co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. He used a {{handheld}} radio to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property. According to Terry Willer's testimony, [...] "As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the food plot right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off." [...] At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the tree stand. Lauren Hesebeck a surviving victim stated, [...] "Bob had said I'm going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he's there, and make sure he doesn't, you know, knows that he's on private property and that he's not welcomed there. Denny had said to me this ought to be interesting, let's go and see what's going on. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back of it standing up (ATV), hanging on the rear bar."After following the directions given by Willers, they proceeded to approach Vang further down the trail. Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number to make a report to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck's testimony, Crotteau [...] "flipped over the hunting tag on Vang's back to get his license number".|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about him--and I don't want to know," [...] returned Link Merwell, and his tone was as bitter as before. [...] "Haskers didn't treat me right, and we separated before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sliding rocks and dirt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{been over}} to Baywater, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storm coming back," [...] {{explained}} Dan. [...] "We didn't {{know where we}} were till we saw your light. I guess we'll have to stay here till the storm is over--if you don't mind." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{are very}} happy after winning gold today for the team of five. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> second <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last game of trios and after that we set our target for gold only and we have done it as this time we beat the team of Korea," [...] Cheah said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, quite right!" [...] {{the young}} man {{interrupted}} feverishly. [...] "They would have stuck to it against the overdraft. How much have <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> safe?" ...|$|E

60|$|Of course, as a {{consequence}} of this, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of a good many other boats, during the mile, and they in ours, and, of course, as {{a consequence}} of that, a good deal of bad language occurred.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why--uh--we just walked, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rain. Say, Miss Nash was a wonder. She never peeped {{when she}} got soaked through--she just laughed and beat it like everything. And we {{saw a lot of}} quaint English places along the road--got away from all them tourists--trippers--you know." ...|$|R
60|$|A. Ah! that's just it! That's it exactly. You see, we were twins--defunct and I--and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> mixed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bathtub when we {{were only}} two weeks old, and {{one of us was}} drowned. But we didn't know which. Some think it was Bill. Some think it was me.|$|R

'Tis a greater Coney we have here, but we couldn't see it till <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> humour for it.

6000|$|... "They {{are scarce}} {{to be called}} wounds, Sir Count, seeing that they are but flesh cuts from their halberts which <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fray below. These slaughterers can doubtless strike a good blow with a pole-axe, but they are but clumsy varlets with other weapons. But to give them their due, they fought stoutly if with but little skill or discretion." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skiff and rowed {{toward the}} flats. I was rather {{concerned}} {{to see that}} apparently the tide was just about as high along this shore as it ever got. Sam shook his head. The tides were strange around the Keys. It will be high on the Gulf side and low on the Atlantic side, and sometimes it will run one way through the channels for thirty-six hours. But we forgot this {{as soon as we}} reached the bonefish shoals.|$|E
5000|$|Thus, {{there are}} no {{required}} rules <b>in</b> <b>the</b> service row <b>in</b> our example and we obtained new values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cells of <b>the</b> martix: <b>we</b> <b>got</b> 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cell [...] and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the value [...] instead of [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cell [...] So, positive result is obtained, consequently, there is logical inference path with given input values.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope we {{have not}} left it too long, Mr. James. I have held on longer than I ought, for every mile we get away from land is an advantage, {{and we have been}} running nearly due south, ever since I noticed the first falling of the glass when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I won't, {{so there}} is no need of {{discussing}} the matter. I am going to post the men at <b>the</b> windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope we shall get a shot at one of the crowd, and while that is being done you must make another search of the house to find out what <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way of water and provisions." ...|$|R
60|$|We had a {{good run}} from St. Helena to the calm {{latitude}}s, but these last proved calmer than common. We worried through them after a while, however, and then did very well until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latitude of the Windward Islands. Marble one day remarked to me that Captain Digges was standing closer to the French island of Guadaloupe than was at all necessary or prudent, if he believed in his own reports of the danger there existed to American commerce, in this quarter of the ocean.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad of that! I didn't think you'd been a {{very bad}} boy, but I fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got {{into some of the}} scrapes that young men seem to {{consider}} a necessary part of a foreign tour. Don't stay out there in the sun, come and lie on the grass here and 'let us be friendly', as Jo used to say when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sofa corner and told secrets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not it," [...] George said. [...] "It {{was against}} us, you know, {{all the way}} down, and could only have turned a little while before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boat. Look at that line of barges sailing down on the {{right-hand}} side. I vote we pull to them and ask the men what we had better do. Anyhow we could row {{to the land and}} get out there and wait till tide turns. It turned at about eleven, so that it will turn again somewhere about five. The steamer is not to start till eight, so we shall be back in plenty of time to catch it. We shall lose the dinner and the fun in the gardens, but that can't be helped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure we can camp any time, but <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{to travel}} {{most of the}} time if we ain't goin' to starve, an' <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to travel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right direction." ...|$|R
2500|$|The , [...] Hutchinson {{was known}} as a ferocious competitor. [...] "His {{displays}} of temper became legendary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American League", wrote Sports Illustrated in 1957. [...] "'I always know how Hutch did when we follow Detroit into a town,' cracked Yankee catcher Yogi Berra. 'If <b>we</b> <b>got</b> stools <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dressing room, I know he won. If <b>we</b> <b>got</b> , he lost.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shook and}} shook till <b>we</b> <b>got</b> red <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face, {{but not one}} dropped, for the tree was large, and our little arms were {{not strong enough to}} stir the boughs. Then we threw stones, but only one green and one half-ripe one came down, and my last stone broke the shed window, so there was an end of that.|$|R
60|$|The lawsuit {{drove me}} to sea, again, {{in a very short}} time. Finding no better berth, and feeling very savage at the {{blindness}} of justice, I shipped before the mast, in the Superior, an Indiaman, of quite eight hundred tons, bound to Canton. This was the pleasantest voyage I ever made to sea, in a merchantman, so far as the weather, and, I may say, usage, were concerned. We lost our top-gallant-masts, homeward bound; but this was the only accident that occurred. The ship was gone nine months; the passage from Whampao to the capes having been made in ninety-four days. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in,</b> <b>the</b> owners had failed, and there was no money forthcoming, at the moment. To remain, and libel the ship, was dull business; so, leaving a power of attorney behind me, I went on board a schooner, called the Sophia, bound to Vera Cruz, as foremast Jack.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{just the}} way with Hatboro'. There is no old Hatboro' any more; and there never was, as your father and mine could tell us if they were here. They lived in a painfully {{transitional}} period, poor old fellows! But, for all that, there is a difference. They lived in what was really a New England village, and we live now in a sprawling American town; and by American of course I mean a town where at least one-third {{of the people are}} raw foreigners or rawly extracted natives. The old New England ideal characterises them all, up to a certain point, socially; it puts a decent outside on most of 'em; it makes 'em keep Sunday, and drink on the sly. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Irish long ago, and now they're part of the conservative element. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> French Canadians, {{and some of them are}} our best mechanics and citizens. We're getting in the Italians, and as soon as they want something better than bread and vinegar to eat, they'll begin going to Congress and boycotting and striking and forming pools and trusts just like any other class of law-abiding Americans. There used to be some talk of the Chinese, but I guess they've pretty much blown over. We've got Ah Lee and Sam Lung here, just as they have everywhere, but their laundries don't seem to increase. The Irish are spreading out into the country and scooping in the farms that are not picturesque enough for the summer folks. You can buy a farm anywhere round Hatboro' for less than the buildings on it cost. I'd rather the Irish would have the land than the summer folks. They make an honest living off it, and the other fellows that come out to roost here from June till October simply keep somebody else from making a living off it, and corrupt all the poor people in sight by their idleness and luxury. That's what I tell 'em at South Hatboro'. They don't like it, but I guess they believe it; anyhow they have to hear it. They'll tell you in self-defence that J. Milton Northwick is a practical farmer, and sells his butter for a dollar a pound. He's done more than anybody else to improve the breeds of cattle and horses; and he spends fifteen thousand a year on his place. It can't return him five; and that's the reason he's a curse and a fraud." ...|$|E
60|$|A month cleaned me out, in such company. I {{spent every}} cent I had, with the {{exception}} of about fifteen dollars, that I had laid by as nest-eggs. I then shipped as second-mate, in the Rebecca Simms, a ship bound to St. Jago de Cuba, with flour. The voyage lasted four months; producing nothing of moment, but a little affair that was personal to myself, and which cost me nearly all my wages. The steward was a saucy black; and, on one occasion, in bad weather, he neglected to give me anything warm for breakfast. I took an opportunity to give him a taste {{of the end of the}} main-clew-garnet, as an admonisher; and there the matter ended, so long as I remained in the ship. It seemed quite right, to all on board, but the steward. He bore the matter in mind, and set a whole pack of quakers on me, as soon as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> suit was tried; and it cost me sixty dollars, in damages, beside legal charges. I dare say it was all right, according to law and evidence; but I feel certain, just such a rubbing down, once a week, would have been very useful to that same steward. Well-meaning men often do quite as much harm, in this world, as the evil-disposed. Philanthropists of this school should not forget, that, if colour is no sufficient reason why a man should be always wrong, it is no sufficient reason why he should be always right.|$|E
5000|$|The Southern {{rebellion}} {{was largely}} the {{outgrowth of the}} Mexican war. Nations, like individuals, are punished for their transgressions. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> our punishment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; I {{grew up in}} a {{much more}} civilized part of the world. We had a {{beautiful}} farm upon Lake Ontario, and raised <b>the</b> best crops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighbourhood.

60|$|On {{the fourteenth}} of September <b>we</b> <b>got</b> jammed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ice, and the Cotopaxi went to pieces.
