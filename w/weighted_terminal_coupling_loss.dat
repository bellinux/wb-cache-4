40|$|The {{distribution}} of energy among the subsystems of a system {{can be found in}} terms of the modes of the system. If there are enough modes in the frequency band of interest then the system can be described by an SEA model. However, in general this is a "quasi-SEA" model, which involves both direct and indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors, whose values depend on the modal overlap. This paper explores the conditions under which the indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors are zero, so that the system is described by a "proper-SEA" model. It also investigates the dependence of the direct and indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors on the modal properties of the system and on the modal overlap. In summary, the indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors are zero, so that a proper-SEA model can be formed, either if all the system modes are local or in the weak coupling regime as the modal overlap becomes large. It is seen that in the low modal overlap limit the <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors are proportional to the damping loss factor and equipartition of energy only occurs if all modes are global. For higher modal overlap the SEA parameters depend on the detailed statistics of the modes and the situation is complicated. However, if all the modes are local the indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors are all zero. In the high modal overlap limit the <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors asymptote to constants, with indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> factors becoming zero. This behaviour occurs because of mode shape correlation at the boundary between two directly connected subsystems...|$|R

40|$|The ITER cable-in-conduit {{conductors}} (CICCs) {{are built}} up from sub-cable bundles, wound in different stages, which are twisted to counter <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> caused by time-changing external magnet fields. The {{selection of the}} twist pitch lengths has major implications {{for the performance of}} the cable in the case of strain sensitive superconductors, i. e. Nb 3 Sn, as the electromagnetic and thermal contraction loads are large but also for the heat load from the AC <b>coupling</b> <b>loss.</b> Reduction of the transverse load and warm-up cool-down degradation can be reached by applying longer twist pitches in a particular sequence for the sub-stages, offering a large cable transverse stiffness, adequate axial flexibility and maximum allowed lateral strand support. Analysis of short sample (TF conductor) data reveals that increasing the twist pitch can lead to a gain of the effective axial compressive strain of more than 0. 3 % with practically no degradation from bending. For reduction of the <b>coupling</b> <b>loss,</b> specific choices of the cabling twist sequence are needed with the aim to minimize the area of linked strands and bundles that are coupled and form loops with the applied changing magnetic field, instead of simply avoiding longer pitches. In addition we recommend increasing the wrap coverage of the CS conductor from 50 % to at least 70 %. The models predict significant improvement against strain sensitivity and substantial decrease of the AC <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> in Nb 3 Sn CICCs, but also for NbTi CICCs minimization of the <b>coupling</b> <b>loss</b> can be achieved.
