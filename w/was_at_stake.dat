5|$|Knowing {{that his}} {{reputation}} <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa {{moved quickly to}} a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, {{it has been suggested}} that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{was widely}} {{respected}} and very cautious. He {{was able to}} continue his reform efforts in Lucca without any suspicion of unorthodox views, despite a papal meeting there with Emperor Charles V in 1541. His eventual downfall was caused by two of his followers, one of whom openly questioned papal authority and another who celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist. The reconstitution of the Roman Inquisition in 1542 {{may have been in}} part a response to fear that Lucca and other cities would defect from the Catholic Church. The authorities of the Republic of Lucca began to fear that their political independence from the Holy Roman Empire <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> if their city continued to be viewed as a Protestant haven. Bans on Protestant books heretofore ignored were enforced, religious feasts which had been dropped were reinstated, and religious processions were scheduled to assure Rome of Lucca's loyalty.|$|E

25|$|The {{divisions}} became fully exposed {{with the}} 1860 presidential election. The electorate split four ways. The Southern Democrats endorsed slavery, while the Republicans denounced it.

The Constitutional Union Party said {{the survival of the}} Union <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> and everything else should be compromised.|$|E
25|$|Simpson {{was one of}} {{many young}} players—eight of whom were uncapped—selected in an Australian side which toured New Zealand under Ian Craig in 1956–57.

Simpson played in all three matches against New Zealand, and scored 47, 67, 26 not out, a duck and 8 not out. His 67 was the top-score in the first innings of the second representative match.|$|E

25|$|The Qianlong Emperor {{had sent}} Ming Rui and his Bannermen {{assuming}} an easy victory. He had begun making plans {{about how he}} would administer his newest territory. For weeks, the Qing court had heard nothing, and then the news finally came. The Emperor was shocked and ordered an immediate halt to all military actions until he could decide what next to do. Generals returning from the front line cautioned {{that there was no}} way Burma could be conquered. But there was no real choice but to press on.

25|$|What <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in this debate, which pitted the {{administration}} against the grantees {{at the end}} of the 1820s and the beginning of the next decade, was whether there remained land to be distributed. The authorities wished to open new concessions in the Cirque of Salazie, which was done in 1830, but also in the heart of La Plaine-des-Palmistes and of the Plaine des Cafres, which happened in 1834. The farmers considered that their parcels extended up to the summit of the island's highest mountain, so that all the concessions met at a single point.|$|E
25|$|Australia and England {{drew the}} Test and series 1–1, with Australia {{retaining}} the Ashes {{for the fourth}} time after regaining them in 1958–59. It was the second time the two teams had drawn the series in the last three Ashes series, with 15 of the 20 Tests being drawn (the next series was also drawn 1–1). It had already been realised that the captains on both sides were unusually cautious when playing each other as so much <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> even though Bobby Simpson and Mike Smith had done all that they could to make the games interesting.|$|E
40|$|What <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> when J. L. Austin calls poetry ‘non-serious’, and sidelines it in {{his speech}} act theory? (I). Standard {{explanations}} polarize sharply along party lines: poets (e. g. Geoffrey Hill) and critics (e. g. Christopher Ricks) are incensed, while philosophers (e. g. P. F. Strawson; John Searle) deny cause (II). Neither line is consistent with Austin's remarks, whose allusions to Plato, Aristotle and Frege are insufficiently noted (III). What Austin thinks <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>is</b> confusion, which he corrects apparently {{to the advantage of}} poets (IV). But what <b>is</b> actually <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>is</b> the possibility of commitment and poetic integrity. We should reject what Austin offers (V) ...|$|R
50|$|The FpV, moreover, had the {{advantage}} of having relatively few Lower House seats <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in 2013. Congressmen in Argentina serve four-year terms, and gains for the various opposition parties in 2009 meant that 2013 put a disproportionate number of their Lower House seats at stake: while the FpV contested 38 of its 116 Lower House seats, a full 76 of 118 opposition seats <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> this year (a further 13 seats of the 23 belonging to minor parties allied with the FpV <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake).</b>|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, the Cabinet wives {{insisted that}} the {{interests}} and honor of all American women <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> They believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage. A woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable. Historian Daniel Walker Howe notes {{that this was the}} feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman's rights movement. Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, a widower, was already forming a coalition against Calhoun. He could now see his main chance to strike hard; he took the side of Jackson and Eaton.|$|E
25|$|With the {{economical}} {{downturn in}} the early 1930s, {{the survival of the}} school <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> when community funding dwindled and the school building had reached such a deteriorated state that major repairs were urgently needed. As the two-storey school building was made mainly of wood, it suffered badly from dry rot and termites infestation. In 1937, the Board wrote to the Education Department detailing the plight of the school and urged the government to take over its management. In 1938, GESS became a government school and in the same year, the government proposed to build a new school building at Anson Road. However, no immediate plans were drawn up.|$|E
25|$|The Giants have {{maintained}} a fierce divisional rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys since the Cowboys first began play in 1960.

The Cowboys lead the regular season series 62–43–2, while the Giants hold the lone playoff victory between the two teams, held {{at the conclusion of the}} 2007 season.|$|E

The open shop question <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> Out of the City Front strike came the Union Labor Party, because workers were angry at the mayor for using the police to protect strikebreakers. Eugene Schmitz was elected mayor in 1902 on the party's ticket, making San Francisco the only town in the United States, for a time, to be run by labor. A combination of corruption and unscrupulous reformers culminated in graft prosecutions in 1907.|$|E
25|$|U.S. President George H. W. Bush responded {{cautiously}} for {{the first}} several days. On one hand, Kuwait, prior to this point, had been a virulent enemy of Israel and was the Persian Gulf monarchy that had the most friendly relations with the Soviets. On the other hand, Washington foreign policymakers, along with Middle East experts, military critics, and firms heavily invested in the region, were extremely concerned with stability in this region. The invasion immediately triggered fears that the world's price of oil, and therefore control of the world economy, <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> Britain profited heavily from {{billions of dollars of}} Kuwaiti investments and bank deposits. Bush was perhaps swayed while meeting with British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who {{happened to be in the}} U.S. at the time.|$|E
25|$|However, even if such {{complacency}} existed, a {{dream of}} one Episcopal priest was to expand and change Williamsburg's future thus providing it a new major purpose, turning much of it into a massive living museum. In the early 20th century, {{one of the largest}} historic restorations ever undertaken in the US was championed by the Reverend Dr W.A.R. Goodwin of Williamsburg's Bruton Parish Church. Initially, Dr Goodwin had just aimed to save his historic church building. This he accomplished by 1907, in time for the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Episcopal Church in Virginia. However, upon returning to Williamsburg in 1923 after serving a number of years in upstate New York, he realized that many of the other colonial-era buildings which remained were also in deteriorating condition: their survival <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Greece, a water {{clock was}} known as a clepsydra (water thief). The Greeks {{considerably}} advanced the water clock by tackling the problem of the diminishing flow. They introduced several types of the inflow clepsydra, one of which included the earliest feedback control system. Ctesibius invented an indicator system typical for later clocks such as the dial and pointer. The Roman engineer Vitruvius described early alarm clocks, working with gongs or trumpets. A commonly used water clock was the simple outflow clepsydra. This small earthenware vessel had a hole in its side near the base. In both Greek and Roman times, this type of clepsydra was used in courts for allocating periods of time to speakers. In important cases, when a person's life <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> for example, it was filled. But, for more minor cases, it was only partially filled. If proceedings were interrupted for any reason, such as to examine documents, the hole in the clepsydra was stopped with wax until the speaker was able to resume his pleading.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Adrian Stokes of yellow fever in September 1927, it became {{increasingly}} evident that yellow fever {{was caused by a}} virus, not by the bacillus Leptospira icteroides, as Noguchi believed. Feeling his reputation <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake,</b> Noguchi hastened to Lagos to carry out additional research. However, he found the working conditions in Lagos did not suit him. At the invitation of Dr. William Alexander Young, the brilliant young director of the British Medical Research Institute, Accra, Gold Coast (modern-day Ghana), he moved to Accra and made this his base in 1927. However, Noguchi proved a very difficult guest and by May 1928 Young regretted his invitation. Noguchi was secretive and volatile, working almost entirely at night to avoid contact with fellow researchers. The diaries of Oskar Klotz, another researcher with the Rockefeller Foundation, describe Noguchi’s temper and behavior as erratic and bordering on the paranoid. His methods were haphazard. According to Klotz, he inoculated huge numbers of monkeys with yellow fever, but failed to keep proper records. He may have believed himself immune to yellow fever, having been inoculated with a vaccine of his own development. Possibly his erratic and irresponsible behavior was caused by the untreated syphilis with which he was diagnosed in 1913, and which may have progressed to neurosyphilis. In any case, he was careless not only of his own safety, but also of the safety of those around him. Despite repeated promises to Young, Noguchi failed to keep infected mosquitoes in their specially designed secure housing. In May 1928, having failed to find evidence for his theories, Noguchi was set to return to New York, but was taken ill in Lagos. He boarded his ship to sail home, but on 12 May was put ashore at Accra and taken to a hospital with yellow fever. After lingering for some days, he died on 21 May.|$|E
