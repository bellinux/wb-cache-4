40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the impact of}} crop genetics and processing in two pea lines (Pisum sativum L.) on starch digestion kinetics.

The Logarithm of Slope (LOS) kinetic model was used to analyse digestion curves obtained using porcine pancreatic α-amylase {{for a range of}} particle size fractions. Changes in starch structure induced by the r mutation led to clear differences in starch digestion kinetics for purified starches and pea flours. Larger particle size fractions showed slowed starch digestion relative to the purified starch, but significant differences still existed between r and wild type pea lines. It is expected that this work will help inform the design of future studies where both starch structure and food structure are important determinants of digestion behavior...|$|E

Soluções filmogênicas (SF) com diferentes teores de amido de ervilha (3, 4 e 5 %), goma xantana (0, 0, 05 e 0, 1 %) e glicerol (proporção glicerol-amido de 1 : 5 P/P) foram estudadas. As SF foram obtidas por ebulição (5 minutos), seguida de autoclavagem por 1 hora a 120 ºC e os filmes foram preparados por casting. O aumento da concentração de amido e de glicerol na composição causou aumento da espessura e da solubilidade dos filmes em água. O plastificante gerou ainda elevação dos coeficientes de permeabilidade ao vapor d'água e ao oxigênio. O aumento da concentração da goma xantana não interferiu nas propriedades estudadas. Os biofilmes obtidos a partir de amido de ervilha verde, associado ou não à goma xantana e glicerol, se comparados com filmes de amido de ervilha amarelas e outras fontes de amido, apresentaram boa barreira ao oxigênio e ao vapor d'água e baixa solubilidade em água. The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the barrier properties and solubility of biofilms made from <b>wrinkled</b> <b>pea</b> starch with high amylose content in association with xanthan gum and glycerol. Filmogenic solution (FS) with different levels of pea starch (3, 4 and 5 %), xanthan gum (0, 0. 05 and 0. 1 %) and glycerol (glycerol-starch 1 : 5 W/W) were tested. FS was obtained by boiling (5 minutes), autoclaving for 1 hour at 120 ºC and the films were prepared by casting. The increased concentration of starch and glycerol in the composition caused increases in thickness of the films and in their solubility in water.

40|$|Separated amyloses with {{different}} molecular weight distributions were obtained enzymatically from <b>wrinkled</b> <b>pea</b> starch and processed in a multi-zone twin-screw extruder. The crystalline polymorphs, crystallinity and crystallite dimensions of amylose (unbranched molecular starch component) and films extruded from it were investigated by wide-angle X-ray scattering. The starting amylose materials exhibit a crystalline V-A structure with rather large crystallites (9 - 25 nm) and {{a degree of}} crystallinity ranging from 30 and 40 %, depending {{on the history of}} the amylose sample. The extruded films, on the other hand, recrystallized in the B-type with a slightly higher degree of crystallinity and significantly smaller crystallite dimensions (3 - 7 nm). In one case, V-H-type crystals were observed. The mechanical properties of the extruded materials were determined in tensile tests. The amylose with the highest molar mass produces films with the highest mechanical performance. As compared with cellulose or synthetic polymer films, the mechanical properties of the amylose films appear to be fundamentally limited by the lack of preferred molecular orientation...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the concentration of starch in plant materials from the intensity of the blue iodine complex, it is necessary to know the Blue Value (B. V.), which is defined in this paper as the absorbancy of 100 mg of a starch-iodine complex in 100 ml of aqueous solution. An adequate amount of plant material is treated with a hot CaCl 2 solution for 1 / 2 hour and the solute is diluted to 25 ml with CaCl 2. This basic solution serves to measure absorbancy, as well as for starch determination. The first measurement is done by the dilution of a proper amount of basic solution with water and after adding a diluted iodine-iodide solution the reading of B. V. is taken off. The second measurement is done by the precipitation of a starch iodine complex from a proper amount of the basic solution, which is then purified, destroyed by Na 2 SO 3 solution, and starch is determined by the anthrone method. These two readings serve for the establishing of B. V. for the starch. Once established, B. V. can be used for starch determination in the proper plant material. A high degree of variation of the B. V. was found. The highest B. V. was obtained for <b>wrinkled</b> <b>pea</b> seeds (17. 4); walnut, potato, smooth pea and pear gave values from 12. 6 to 11. 0, common bean and broad bean - 10. 3 and 9. 7, Triticale, carrot, rye, wheat and garden parsley from 8. 7 to 8. 0 and maize, oat, normal rice from 7. 6 to 6. 2.

25|$|While {{carrying}} out breeding experiments {{to clarify the}} mechanism of inheritance in 1900, Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns independently rediscovered Gregor Mendel's work. News of this reached William Bateson in England, who reported on the paper during a presentation to the Royal Horticultural Society in May 1900. In Mendelian inheritance, the contributions of each parent retain their integrity rather than blending with {{the contribution of the}} other parent. In the case of a cross between two true-breeding varieties such as Mendel's round and <b>wrinkled</b> <b>peas,</b> the first-generation offspring are all alike, in this case all round. Allowing these to cross, the original characteristics reappear (segregation): about 3/4 of their offspring are round, 1/4 wrinkled. There is a discontinuity between the appearance of the offspring; de Vries coined the term allele for a variant form of an inherited characteristic. This reinforced a major division of thought, already present in the 1890s, between gradualists who followed Darwin, and saltationists such as Bateson.|$|R

The botanist replied, but his letter encouraged Mendel to examine the hawkweeds, a group of plants related to asters. In 1866, no one recognized that hawkweeds reproduced asexually and were not subject to Mendels meticulously developed theories of hybridization.

Except in extracts of pea embryos and sweet-corn endosperm, treatment with affinity-purified antibodies to pyrophosphate: fructose- 6 -phosphate 1 -phosphotransferase reduced the above fructose 6 -phosphate production to the rate found with boiled extracts. The antibody-resistant activity from sweet corn was slight.

50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel's {{observations}} of pea pods {{led to the}} principles of Mendelian genetics, the foundation of modern genetics. He ended up growing and examining about 28,000 pea plants {{in the course of his}} experiments. Mendel chose peas for his experiments because he could grow them easily, develop pure-bred strains, protect them from cross-pollination, and control their pollination. Mendel cross-bred tall and dwarf pea plants, green and yellow peas, purple and white flowers, <b>wrinkled</b> and smooth <b>peas,</b> and a few other traits. He then observed the resulting offspring. In each of these cases, one trait is dominant and all the offspring, or Filial-1 (abbreviated F1) generation, showed the dominant trait. Then he crossed members of the F1 generation together and observed their offspring, the Filial-2 (abbreviated F2) generation. The F2 plants had the dominant trait in approximately a 3:1 ratio. Mendel reasoned that each parent had a 'vote' in the appearance of the offspring, and the non-dominant, or recessive, trait appeared only when it was inherited from both parents. He did further experiments that showed each trait is separately inherited. Unwittingly, Mendel had solved a major problem with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution: how new traits were preserved and not blended back into the population, a question Darwin himself did not answer. Mendel's work was published in an obscure Austrian journal and was not rediscovered until about 1900.|$|R

The company went to the brands for which it canned and found that none of them wanted to sell the new peas. So Minnesota Valley decided to sell them under its own label. Rather than apologize for the size of the peas, they decided to emphasize it. They named the peas 'Green Giant.'"
