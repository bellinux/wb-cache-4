There is an imaginary portrait of him, c. 1843, by François-Édouard Picot for the Salles des Croisades at Versailles: it depicts him as a handsome, rather pensive man in his forties, wearing a coronet and fanciful pseudo-medieval costume.

25|$|Almost {{as soon as}} {{he settled}} in New York, Hillquit was drawn into East Side Jewish radical circles. He was then a small (5'4"), {{slightly}} built, frail adolescent <b>with</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> dark oval-shaped eyes, and a gentle charming manner. He was immediately attracted to other young Jewish immigrants, mostly former students, now shop workers, who considered themselves intellectuals — a new radical intelligentsia... For the most part their radicalism was rooted in their experiences in the European socialist and anarchist movements. But emigration and economic hardships in the United States also contributed to their further radicalization. As foreigners in America they were situated far enough outside the society to observe its failings. As frustrated but literate people, they were ambitious enough to participate in it. The young intellectuals were interested in finding alternatives to their present circumstances; their solution was to transform them.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, American author Nancy Kathleen Stouffer alleged {{copyright}} and {{trademark infringement}} by Rowling of her 1984 works The Legend of Rah and the Muggles (...) and Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly. The primary basis for Stouffer's case rested {{in her own}} purported invention of the word [...] "Muggles", {{the name of a}} race of mutant humanoids in The Legend of Rah and the Muggles, and Larry Potter, the title character of a series of activity booklets for children. Larry Potter, like Harry Potter, is a bespectacled boy <b>with</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> though he is not a character in The Legend of Rah and the Muggles. Stouffer also drew a number of other comparisons, such as a castle on a lake, a receiving room and wooden doors. Portions of Rah were originally published in booklet form by Ande Publishing Company in 1986, a company founded by Stouffer together with a group of friends and family. Ande Publishing filed for bankruptcy in September 1987 without selling any of its booklets in the United States or elsewhere. Rowling has stated that she first visited the United States in 1998.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy. In regards to the video's concept, Swift stated, [...] "It deals with the haunting power of music and how hearing a song {{years after it was}} first popular can have such an emotional appeal." [...] Clayton Collins portrayed Swift's love interest in the music video. He was cast because of his physical resemblance to the real subject of the song, in that they were both tall <b>with</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair.</b> The video begins with Swift, dressed by a white sundress, as she lies on the grass of a lake-bed and holds a transistor radio. Suddenly, the setting is switched to Collins as he drives a white and orange 1970 Chevrolet CST-10. He then turns his radio on and ceases driving, coming to a complete stop on a road. As Collins facial expressions become more serious, he flashbacks to memories with Swift. Swift and Collins are seen frolicking in a field, lying beside another on the back of Collins' CST-10, staring at the stars together, holding hands as they walk, and slow dancing. When the song is in its final chorus, Collins arrives at a wooden cabin in his pick-up truck. He runs up the staircase to discover an enveloped letter next to the door. He then sits on the staircase, opens the envelope, and reads the letter. The video transcends towards Swift playing an acoustic guitar as she leans against the wooden cabin. Cut-scenes feature Swift lying on the lake-bed and performing with a guitar next to the wooden cabin. The video concludes with Swift, once again, lying on the initial setting.|$|E

A handwritten codicil to his will leaving half his estate to his fiancée was contested by Dugger's sister, Sarah Dugger Schwartz. The will was judged invalid in 1971.|$|E
2500|$|Dances reenacting history {{most often}} {{contains}} {{this kind of}} mask, {{the most popular of}} which is a dance called Moors and Christians. Masks related to this dance vary widely with facial expressions from the serene to the terrifying. The dances tell of stories of Christians fighting Muslims, in Spain, France or in the Holy Land. Masks depicting the Christians generally have European features, <b>with</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> and a beard. The skin color is white or light pink, with red paint on the cheeks and sometimes other parts of the face. In some areas of Guerrero, Puebla and Veracruz, the faces are red, since light skin burns easily in the tropical sun. [...] Dancers playing Moors also have European masks, but to distinguish them, they wear large turbans. In some areas of Guerrero, red faces depict the Moors. In many versions, Saint James Matamoros also appears in the drama, distinguished by a more elaborate headdress and a hobby horse fastened to the waist.|$|E

2500|$|By the 19th {{century the}} English-speaking and French-speaking Métis had become {{culturally}} quite similar, {{moving closer to}} each other in opposition to the British-Canadian majority. Their musical traditions, {{especially in the case of}} fiddle music, was derived [...] from both British Isles and French origins, as was the Métis traditional dance referred to as [...] "jigging", or the [...] "Red River Jig". In complexion they ranged from fair skinned, blond and blue eyed through dark skinned, <b>with</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> and dark eyes. Métis elders say that no distinctions were made between individuals based upon complexion within the community. Family, culture, and strong identification with their Christian faith were the unifying bond amongst them. The two communities' primary differences lay in their languages and Christian religious affiliations; the French speakers were generally Roman Catholic and those of British descent were Protestant. Most Countryborn were Anglican or Presbyterian. They were involved in a mixed economy of subsistence farming and bison hunting throughout most of the 19th century; they also found employment with the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company.|$|E
2500|$|A {{television}} program {{was produced in}} 2007 with David Suchet as Poirot in the ITV series Agatha Christie's Poirot, first broadcast on 14 September 2008. It was directed by Ashley Pearce, who also directed Appointment with Death and Three Act Tragedy for the ITV series. It also starred Zoë Wanamaker returning as Ariadne Oliver (who first appeared in Cards on the Table) and Richard Hope as Superintendent Spence (who first appeared in Taken at the Flood), respectively. The adaptation is very faithful to the novel, despite the deletion of a few characters and omitting two of the women from the newspaper article – only focusing on Lily Gamboll and Eva Kane. The characters of Deirdre Henderson and Maude Wiliams are merged in the film. As such it is Maude Williams, the estate agents' secretary (<b>with</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> instead of blonde), who {{is in love with}} Bentley and helps Poirot throughout his investigation. Maude and Bentley are reunited by Poirot in the final scene. Also, Dr. Rendall's secret is not that he is suspected of killing his first [...] wife, but of mercy killing terminally ill patients. It is Mrs. Rendall, rather than her husband, who makes an attempt on Poirot's life.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, May 10, in Atoka, Oklahoma, a {{man walked}} up to a woman's house and opened her screen door. He asked Mrs. Harmon {{if he could have}} some {{turpentine}}, food, and money.
