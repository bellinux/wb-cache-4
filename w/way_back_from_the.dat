5|$|On the <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north, Pembroke {{stopped in}} the village of Deddington in the Midlands, putting Gaveston under guard there while he went to visit his wife. The Earl of Warwick took this {{opportunity}} to seize Gaveston, taking him to Warwick Castle, where Lancaster {{and the rest of his}} faction assembled on 18 June. At a brief trial, Gaveston was declared guilty of being a traitor under the terms of the Ordinances; he was executed on Blacklow Hill the following day, under the authority of the Earl of Lancaster. Gaveston's body was not buried until 1315, when his funeral was held in King's Langley Priory.|$|E
5|$|Ayyubid rule {{virtually}} {{ended in}} 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza—Hulagu's southernmost point of conquest. Hulagu left his army in Gaza after being recalled {{due to the}} death of the Mongol emperor, and Mamluk general az-Zahir Baybars subsequently drove the Mongols out of the city and again defeated them at Baysan in the Galilee. He was proclaimed sultan of Egypt on his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battlefield after the assassination of Sultan Qutuz. Baibars passed through Gaza six times during his expeditions against the remnants of the Crusader states and the Mongols between 1263 and 1269. Mamluk domination started in 1277, with Gaza initially being a small village in the territory of Ramla. In 1279, Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun encamped in Gaza for fifty days while on a march against the Mongols.|$|E

Lord's Seat blocks much of the panorama westward although the sea makes an appearance.|$|E
25|$|Ascents of the fell are {{commenced}} {{either from}} Rydal or Grasmere; the ascent from Grasmere allows Alcock Tarn to be visited {{by a short}} detour while the route from Rydal first climbs Nab Scar.

25|$|With {{increases}} in fuel capacity as the type was refined, {{the range of}} escort missions over Europe steadily increased until the P-47 was able to accompany bombers in raids {{all the way into}} Germany. On the <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> raids, pilots shot up ground targets of opportunity, and also used belly shackles to carry bombs on short-range missions, which led to the realization that the P-47 could perform a dual-function on escort missions as a fighter-bomber. Even with its complicated turbosupercharger system, its sturdy airframe and tough radial engine could absorb a lot of damage and still return home.|$|E

25|$|In mid April 1590 ten {{ships of}} the company, some freighted for Venice, for Constantinople {{and to other}} parts of the Mediterranean met on their homeward course within the Straits of Gibraltar having escaped all danger thus far. As soon as they were all {{together}} they came into a tight convoy formation as they approached the Spanish-held waters. Two Flemish ships on their <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean also joined them in convoy, partly for protection against pirates. The lead ship Salomon whose captain Benedict Barnham was in charge followed by second in command John Watts of the Margeret and John, followed with the rest; Thomas Cordell's Centurion, Minion, Viloet, Samual, Elizabeth, Ascension and finally the Richard.|$|E
25|$|In 1623, {{the prince}} angered the Ottomans {{by refusing to}} allow an army on its <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Persian front to winter in the Bekaa. This (and {{instigation}} by the powerful Janissary garrison in Damascus) led Mustafa Pasha, Governor of Damascus, to launch an attack against him, resulting in the battle at Majdel Anjar where Fakhr-al-Din's forces although outnumbered managed to capture the Pasha and secure the Lebanese prince and his allies a much needed military victory. The best source (in Arabic) for Fakhr ad-Din's career {{up to this point}} is a memoir signed by al-Khalidi as-Safadi, who was not with the Emir in Europe but had access to someone who was, possibly Fakhr ad-Din himself.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Messner {{returned}} and succeeded in reaching the summit using the normal route with Kammerlander and Mutschlechner. Although they had turned back twice during this expedition, {{they made the}} summit on the third attempt on 26 September.

25|$|Philipson was a noted gardener. A {{visit to}} Japan on the <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Test series in Australia in 1895 {{inspired}} him to apply knowledge that he acquired there to estate of Stobo Castle, near Peebles, in the Scottish Borders. Stobo had originally been in the family of Philipson's wife, the Honourable Nina Murray, until their exile following the Jacobite rising of 1745. The Japanese-style water garden that Philipson created at Stobo between 1909–13 has been maintained, despite a succession of owners after the estate was sold shortly after his death. Stobo was acquired in 1971 by Leo Seymour, whose family still own it, and is occasionally open to the public.|$|E
25|$|With the {{emergence}} of players such as Ian Healy, Mark Taylor, Geoff Marsh, Mark Waugh, and Greg Matthews in the late 1980s, Australia was on the <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> doldrums.

The Australians {{went on to the}} West Indies and had their chances but ended up losing the series. However, they bounced back and beat the Indians in their next Test series. With the retirement of the champion but defensive, Allan Border, a new era of attacking cricket had begun under the leadership of firstly Mark Taylor and then Steve Waugh.|$|E

25|$|The sorceress Circe is {{a figure}} from Greek mythology {{whose father was}} the sun (Helios) and whose mother was an ocean nymph. She appears in three {{separate}} stories.

He forces her to return them to human shape, lives with her {{for a year and}} has a child called Telegonus by her. Her ability to change others into animals is further highlighted by the story of Picus, an Italian king whom she turns into a woodpecker for resisting her advances. Another story makes her {{fall in love with the}} sea-god Glaucus, who prefers the nymph Scylla to her. In revenge, Circe poisoned the water where her rival bathed and turned her into a monster.|$|E

The opposition princes had to face the defeat of their mighty ally and to refrain from their plans to overthrow the Hohenstaufen dynasty.|$|E
25|$|An {{in-depth}} study of Wright's action formed {{a part of}} Tom Bergin's 1982 MA thesis at the University of New England. Bergin showed {{that a lack of}} money and too few pack animals to carry the supplies meant Wright was placed in an unenviable position. His requests to the Exploration Committee were not acted on until early January, by which time the hot weather and lack of water meant that the party moved extremely slowly. They were harassed by the Bandjigali and Karenggapa Murris, and three of the men, Dr Ludwig Becker, Charles Stone and William Purcell, died from malnutrition on the trip. On his way north, Wright camped at Koorliatto Waterhole on the Bulloo River while he tried to find Burke's tracks to Cooper Creek. While he was there he met Brahe, who was on his <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cooper to Menindee.|$|E
