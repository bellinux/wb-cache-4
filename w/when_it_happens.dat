5|$|In the TARDIS, the Doctor {{agrees to}} take Rose {{to the day}} her father died {{so that she can}} be there <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens.</b> Upon their arrival in London on Saturday 7 November 1987, they witness the {{accident}}, but Rose is unable to move when the Doctor tells her to go comfort her dying father. Rose asks the Doctor if she can try again, and the Doctor allows it but warns Rose to not run until their former selves have left to prevent a paradox. As the accident is about to happen, Rose suddenly runs out and pushes Pete aside, saving his life. The younger versions of the Doctor and Rose vanish. Rose and the Doctor fight about her actions, with the Doctor rebuking her for potentially damaging the timeline. The Doctor takes Rose's TARDIS key back and storms off without her. Rose decides to go with Pete to the wedding, while the Doctor walks back to the TARDIS only to find that it is now an empty shell. Strange flying beasts called Reapers appear and begin consuming people.|$|E

He is forced to escape aboard one of their flying craft. Dobby manages to wrench one arm free, but no more, while Gernisavien is securely fastened. They know their only course of action with Raul's defeat is to have Dobby smash some chemicals together. The resulting explosion levels the mountain. Raul is safely away <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens,</b> but he knows that the explosion means that the quest is dead, for his friends perished with the key and knowledge necessary to reactivate the farcaster.|$|E

His tenure with Calgary ended on March 10, 1994, when the team included him in a six-player trade. [...] The Flames sent Suter, along with Paul Ranheim and Ted Drury, to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for James Patrick, Zarley Zalapski and Michael Nylander. The move surprised Suter: [...] "Calgary's meant a great deal to me.

[...] Pennant is cited as an authority by Thomas Bewick throughout his pioneering field guide, A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804). For example, under [...] "The Golden Eagle", Bewick writes that [...] "Pennant says there are instances, though rare, of their having bred in Snowdon Hills". Bewick cites him for facts about rare species like [...] "The Sclavonian Grebe": [...] "This species is not numerous in the British Isles. Pennant says, they inhabit and breed in the fens near Spalding, in Lincolnshire, and that the female makes a nest not unlike that of the Crested Grebe, and lays four or five white eggs." [...] On occasion, Pennant's knowledge could be highly specific: for [...] "The Great-Crested Grebe", Bewick records that the nest [...] "is made of various kinds of dried fibres, stalks and leaves of water plants, and (Pennant says) of the roots of bugbane, stalks of water-lily, pond-weed and water-violet; <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> to be blown from among the reeds, it floats about upon the surface of the water".|$|E

2500|$|Marty Duffy of Sligo was {{appointed}} match referee for the final.

The GAA officially refused to offer a response to the two men. Liam and Sam in the Irish Independent compared the [...] "pre-emptive" [...] criticism of the referee to a scenario where the referee were to question the manner in which one of the teams play the sport or express dismay that a better team should have qualified for the final instead. Radio Kerry analyst and former referee Weeshie Fogarty expressed his dismay at the criticism of Duffy, commenting: [...] "It's bad enough to referee big games in Croke Park and see your name being castigated in the papers and torn asunder the following week.

2500|$|The Hotel Oloffson {{was one of}} {{the early}} concert venues for rasin bands and {{performers}} beginning in 1987. [...] Rasin bands incorporated not only traditional Vodou folk music lyrics and rhythms into modern musical style, but included petwo drums and rara horns, instruments used in Vodou religious ceremonies. [...] When Morse gathered together dancers and musicians to create RAM in 1990, the rasin style was popular in Port-au-Prince and gaining popularity {{in the rest of the}} country. [...] "Ke'm Pa Sote" [...] by Boukman Eksperyans, whose song title translates to [...] "I Am Not Afraid" [...] in English, was the most popular song at the 1990 Carnival in Port-au-Prince. [...] It was widely understood to be a criticism of the corrupt military government of General Prosper Avril. [...] RAM adopted a similar format and together with Boukman Eksperyans and other rasin bands developed the style and genre of protest music grounded in Vodou musical tradition. [...] Eventually, Richard Morse became so involved in the Vodou religion through his music that he was initiated as a houngan, or Vodou priest, in 2002. [...] Describing a RAM concert, Morse explains, [...] "Yes, you might see our dancers go into a trance.

2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E
