5|$|Continuing a {{theme of}} his presidency, in 2006 Mosley called for Formula One {{manufacturers}} to develop technology relevant to road cars. In recent years, {{a large proportion of}} the enormous budget of Formula One has been spent on the development of very powerful, very high-revving engines, which some say have little applicability to road cars. Mosley has announced a 10-year freeze on the development of engines, which would allow manufacturers to spend more of their budgets on environmentally friendly technology such as the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) introduced in 2009. In July 2008, he sent a letter to the Formula One teams, in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> for the teams to propose future sporting regulations to address specific issues including reduced fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Alexandre-Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois, a French geologist, {{published}} an early form of periodic table, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> the telluric helix or screw. He {{was the first}} person to notice the periodicity of the elements. With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois showed that elements with similar properties seemed to occur at regular intervals. His chart included some ions and compounds in addition to elements. His paper also used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram; as a result, it received little attention until the work of Dmitri Mendeleev.|$|E

American diplomat and writer John Lloyd Stephens described the ruins, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> Patinamit, after he visited Iximche with English artist Frederick Catherwood and in 1840. Catherwood never published any drawings of the site and Stephens reported that the locals had plundered the stone at the site {{for many years in}} order to use it for building materials in Tecpán. French architect Cesar Daly mapped Iximche in 1857.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as new to science by mycologist William Alphonso Murrill in 1912. Murrill collected the type material growing near redwoods near Searsville Lake, California, in December 1911. In 1914, Murrill {{decided that the}} species {{was the same as}} Lepiota cristata (<b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> Lepiota conspurcata (Willd.) Morgan); this opinion was later corroborated by Walter Sundberg in 1989 after he studied the type collection and concluded that the microscopic characteristics of both were the same. Using molecular analysis based on comparing DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region, mycologist Else Vellinga determined that despite the lack of distinguishing micro-morphological characteristics, the two species were distinct.|$|E

In a development unparalleled in American labor history, he also declared the force of 1,200 deputies to be illegal and ordered the group disbanded.

MVP began {{dominating}} Jericho until Jericho performed a Springboard Dropkick on MVP. MVP regained his momentum and performed a Delayed Elbow Drop, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Ballin' Elbow for a near-fall. MVP began working on Jericho's face and applied a Three-quarter Facelock and followed by executing Knee Lifts. MVP performed a Big Boot for a near-fall. Jericho tried to perform a Diving Crossbody but MVP countered it into a Flapjack. However, Jericho recovered and executed a One-Handed Bulldog. Jericho tried to perform a Springboard Moonsault <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Lionsault but MVP avoided the move. MVP tried to finish Jericho with an Overdrive <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Playmaker but Jericho countered it into an Elevated Boston Crab <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Walls of Jericho. Jericho forced MVP {{to submit to the}} Walls of Jericho. The second match in the quarter-final was between Matt Hardy and the Mr. Money in the Bank CM Punk. Hardy and Punk started the match by utilizing submission maneuvers against each other. Punk began dominating the match and attacked Hardy sending him to the corner. Hardy took advantage and executed a Flying Back Elbow on Punk's head. Hardy whipped Punk into the corner and executed a Corner Clothesline followed by a Bulldog which was countered by Punk. Punk whipped Hardy into the corner and executed a Step Up High Knee and a Bulldog. Punk tried to finish the match by attempting a Fireman's Carry Knee Strike <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Go To Sleep on Hardy. Hardy reversed and executed a Wrist-Lock Side Slam <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Side Effect. Hardy attempted a Front Facelock Three-Quarter Facelock Cutter <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Twist of Fate on Punk. Punk countered it into a Go 2 Sleep but Hardy attempted a Sunset Flip on Punk. Punk sat and held the Roll-Up to win the match.|$|R

5|$|Within {{the naval}} bureaus, however, {{there was still}} much resistance. In mid-to-late 1904, Poundstone {{continued}} to lobby the General Board while C protested that the final determinant in a naval battle would be the light guns—and in any case such a large uniform battery was not feasible. Poundstone replied with a design of his own creation, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> USS Possible and fit twelve 11-inch guns on a ship that displaced 19,330 long tons. With support from Lieutenant Commander William Sims, {{who was able to}} cite the increasingly accurate long-gunnery of the Navy, and interest shown in the project by President Roosevelt, the bureaucratic stalling ended.|$|E
5|$|A 1965 {{paper by}} A.K. Rozhdestvensky {{recognized}} all of Maleev's specimens as different growth {{stages of the}} same species, which he believed to be distinct from the North American Tyrannosaurus. He created a new combination, Tarbosaurus bataar, to include all the specimens described in 1955 as well as newer material. Later authors, including Maleev himself, agreed with Rozhdestvensky's analysis, although some used the name Tarbosaurus efremovi rather than T. bataar. American paleontologist Kenneth Carpenter re-examined the material in 1992. He concluded that it belonged to the genus Tyrannosaurus, as originally published by Maleev, and lumped all the specimens into the species Tyrannosaurus bataar except the remains that Maleev had named Gorgosaurus novojilovi. Carpenter thought this specimen represented a separate, smaller genus of tyrannosaurid, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> Maleevosaurus novojilovi. George Olshevsky created the new generic name Jenghizkhan (after Genghis Khan) for Tyrannosaurus bataar in 1995, while also recognizing Tarbosaurus efremovi and Maleevosaurus novojilovi, {{for a total of}} three distinct, contemporaneous genera from the Nemegt Formation. A 1999 study subsequently reclassified Maleevosaurus as a juvenile Tarbosaurus. All research published since 1999 recognizes only a single species, which is either called Tarbosaurus bataar or Tyrannosaurus bataar.|$|E
