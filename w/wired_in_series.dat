Due to the high surface area of the aerogel, these capacitors can be 1/2000th to 1/5000th the size of similarly rated electrolytic capacitors. Aerogel supercapacitors can have a very low impedance compared to normal supercapacitors and can absorb or produce very high peak currents.

As a coil of copper <b>wire,</b> <b>in</b> <b>series</b> with a light bulb, is cooled in a liquid nitrogen bath, its resistance decreases.

This unit is <b>wired</b> <b>in</b> <b>series</b> with the load. Diodes (D2, D3, D4 and D5) form a bridge which generates pulsed DC. R1 and C1 form a circuit {{with a time}} constant. As the voltage increases from zero (at the start of every halfwave) C1 will charge up. When C1 is able to make Zener diode D6 conduct and inject current into the SCR, the SCR will fire. When the SCR conducts then D1 will discharge C1 via the SCR. The SCR will shut off when the current falls to zero when the supply voltage drops {{at the end of}} the half cycle, ready for the circuit to start work on the next half cycle. This is an example of a Leading Edge Dimmer.|$|E
25|$|When the City & South London Railway (C) was {{authorised}} in 1884, it {{was intended}} to be a cable-hauled line, but during the construction phase, the promotors decided to use electric traction, {{despite the fact that the}} technology was in its infancy. Two prototype locomotives were built by Mather & Platt in 1889, to a design by Dr Edward Hopkinson, with Beyer-Peacock supplying many of the mechanical parts. No. 1 used motors mounted directly on the drive axles, while No. 2 had motors driven through gears. Trials were conducted in December 1889 with No. 1 and two passenger cars. No. 2 was also used for testing, but it is not clear whether it pulled any cars. A production run of 14 locomotives was then built, numbered 1 to 14, duplicating the original numbers 1 and 2. Each had four wheels, with Edison-Hopkinson motors fitted to the axles, which were permanently <b>wired</b> <b>in</b> <b>series.</b> A 26-step rheostat was used to control the speed, and a switch which altered the connections to the armature was used to reverse the direction of travel.|$|E

40|$|Large {{number of}} {{different}} superconducting correctors were designed and manufactured for Tevatron [1, 2], UNK [3], RHIC [4], LHC [5]. Some correctors showed rather low mechanical stability, long training history and usually worked at 30 - 50 % of short sample current limit. One {{of the problems is}} how to wind the shell type multiturn coil from 0. 3 - 0. 5 mm diameter superconductor without shorts and with specified geometry. BNL for RHIC used the 5 -axis computer controlled machine, which provided proper conductor positioning and fixation on separate support cylinders for each winding. Nevertheless, the field quality in RHIC shell type multipole corrector was b 1 < 0. 6 %, b 3 and b 4 < 2 % only. But such technology very difficult to use for multilayer coils. CERN for LHC used a ribbon type cable with the number of splices to connect all ribbon <b>wires</b> <b>in</b> <b>series.</b> <b>In</b> this case the field quality will be influenced by not proper radial positioning of outer windings.

40|$|International audienceElectrochemical {{impedance}} measurements {{performed on}} gas-evolving electrodes in high-conductivity solutions have shown artefacts at high frequency (HF) when using a commercial reference electrode (RE) {{due to its}} relatively high impedance.

This paper investigates HF EIS measurements in high-conductivity solutions from experiments in 1 M H 2 SO 4 solutions and simulations based on the equivalent circuit of the cell and of the electrode potential measurement device. In particular, the value of the capacitor and the position of the platinum wire are considered. Curiously, while the HF artefact is removed by the dual RE, a spurious loop may appear at low frequency depending on the position of the platinum wire. This is explained from simulations based on the equivalent circuit of the cell...|$|R

5000|$|Bassists can put an {{incorrect}} (that is too low) impedance load on their amplifiers {{even if they}} connect multiple speakers {{that are at the}} correct impedance rating. For example, if a bassist has a combo amp in which the power amp is rated at 4 ohms, and she/he plugs in a second 4 ohm speaker cabinet in parallel, this will drop the impedance ("load") on the amplifier down to 2 ohms, which is too low for the amplifier. When speakers of different impedance are wired up together (e.g., an 8 ohm speaker cabinet and a 4 ohm speaker cab, the impedance is calculated differently). In most applications, when bass speakers are plugged into an amplifier, they are <b>wired</b> <b>in</b> parallel. The parallel [...] "input/output" [...] speaker jacks on the rear of most bass cabinets, when plugged into additional speakers in a [...] "daisy chain" [...] approach, will cause the speakers to be connected in parallel. More rarely, bass speaker cabs may be <b>wired</b> up <b>in</b> <b>series,</b> which means that the impedance is calculated differently. Series wiring is much more complicated and in cases where a bassist is using series wiring, a custom-made cabling system is typically used. Some bass manufacturers that build large speaker cabinets with multiple speakers may wire some of the speakers <b>in</b> <b>series</b> and some <b>in</b> parallel to achieve a certain impedance rating for the entire speaker cabinet (e.g., in 8x10" [...] speaker cabinets, the speakers inside the cabinet may be all <b>wired</b> up <b>in</b> <b>series,</b> but the overall cabinet's [...] "input/output" [...] jacks are in parallel). Professional bass technicians and speaker designers setting up custom-made bass speaker systems for bass players from major bands may use an electronic meter to test the impedance of the speaker cabinets they design.|$|R
