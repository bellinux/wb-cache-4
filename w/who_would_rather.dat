5|$|In San Francisco, {{particularly}} in the Castro District, gay community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> not deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.|$|E
25|$|Within the Liberal Democrats, the {{two main}} ideological strands are social liberals and the {{classical}} liberals, the latter supporting economic liberalism. The principal {{difference between the two}} is that the classical liberals tend to support greater choice and competition and aim to increase social mobility through economic deregulation and creation of opportunity, whereas the social liberals were more commonly associated with directly aiming to increase equality of outcome through state intervention. Correspondingly, classical liberals tended to favour cutting taxes for the poorest in order to increase opportunity, contrasting with social liberals, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> see higher spending on public services and the disadvantaged in order to reduce income inequality.|$|E
25|$|Hospice {{care is a}} type of {{care and}} {{philosophy}} of care that focuses on the palliation of a chronically ill, terminally ill or seriously ill patient's pain and symptoms, and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs. In Western society, the concept of hospice has been evolving in Europe since the 11th century. Then, and for centuries thereafter in Roman Catholic tradition, hospices were places of hospitality for the sick, wounded, or dying, as well as those for travelers and pilgrims. The modern concept of hospice includes palliative care for the incurably ill given in such institutions as hospitals or nursing homes, but also care provided to those <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> spend their last months and days of life in their own homes. The first modern hospice care was created by Cicely Saunders in 1967.|$|E

25|$|The move by {{retailers}} to begin holiday sales during Thanksgiving Day (as {{opposed to the}} traditional day after) has been criticized as forcing (under threat of being fired) low-end retail workers, who compose an increasing share of the nation's workforce, to work odd hours and to handle atypical, unruly crowds on a day reserved for rest. In response to this controversy, Macy's and Best Buy (both of which planned to open on Thanksgiving, even earlier than they had the year before) stated in 2014 that most of their Thanksgiving Day shifts were filled voluntarily by employees <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> have the day after Thanksgiving off instead of Thanksgiving itself.

500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Kesha from her debut album, Animal (2010). Produced by Benny Blanco, and co-written by Kesha, Blanco, Neon Hitch and Sean Foreman, it was released as the album's second single on February 19, 2010, and features 3OH!3. Initial writing of the song took place when Kesha, Blanco, Hitch and Foreman were discussing which sex talked more and which one was more [...] "obnoxious." [...] The song is a midtempo electropop song that speaks {{of men in the}} same way that they have talked about women in the music industry. The lyrics depict a woman <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> have sex than listen to a man speak and features blatant come-ons throughout the song.|$|E

500|$|Winslet had {{roles in}} two period dramas of 1996Jude and Hamlet. As with her Heavenly Creatures part, her roles in these films {{were those of}} women with a [...] "mad edge". In Michael Winterbottom's Jude, {{based on the novel}} Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy, she played Sue Bridehead, a young woman with suffragette leanings who falls in love with her cousin, Jude (played by Christopher Eccleston). Roger Ebert {{believed}} that the part allowed Winslet to display her acting range, and praised her for [...] "making Sue into a sassy, defiant woman <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> be right than happy". After unsuccessfully auditioning for Kenneth Branagh's 1994 film Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Winslet was cast for the part of Ophelia, the doomed lover of the title character, in Branagh's adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet. Winslet, at 20 years old, was intimidated by the experience of performing Shakespeare with established actors such as Branagh and Julie Christie, saying that the job required her to [...] "hit a certain level of intellect that I don't believe I have". Even so, Mike Jeffries of Empire believed that she had played the part [...] "well beyond her years". Despite the acclaim, Jude and Hamlet earned little at the box office.|$|E
500|$|Mitford had no {{training}} as a writer or journalist; her style, particularly in the pre-war novels, is chatty and informal, much as in her letters. She may have inherited some of her natural wit and sharpness of expression from her maternal grandfather Thomas Bowles, who in his youth during the Franco-Prussian War had provided dispatches which Acton describes as [...] "extremely graphic and amusing". Mitford's fiction, based on upper-class family life and , belongs to the genre of the comedy of manners. Her protagonists—typically, intelligent women surrounded by eccentric characters determined to find life amusing—are broadly autobiographical. [...] It is unsurprising, says Thompson, that Mitford should first attempt {{to write a novel}} in the early 1930s, since many of her friends were doing the same thing. What is surprising, Thompson adds, is the ease with which [...] she found a publisher for this first book. Perhaps, says Thompson, her [...] publishers Thornton Butterworth [...] "liked the idea of this pretty, well-connected girl who wrote in the style du jour". Mitford was later embarrassed by her prewar novels; Rachel Cooke, writing on their reissue in 2011, believes she had no reason to be: [...] "There is a special kind of energy here, and its engine is the admirable and irresistible commitment of a writer <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> die than be boring".|$|E
500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] is a midtempo electropop song; {{the song}} {{utilizes}} synthesizers and drum machines in its production.

It is written in the key of D minor and Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the note of D3 to the note of D5. Lyrically, [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] depicts a woman <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>rather</b> have sex than listen to a man speak as the singer finds talkative men annoying; blatant come-ons such as [...] "show me where your dick's at" [...] and [...] "I wanna be naked" [...] leave this literal meaning unambiguous.

The song is written in the key of E Major and Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G3 to the note of B4. [...] "Stephen" [...] is opened in [...] "Kansas-style vocal harmonies" [...] as Kesha sings about an unattainable lover depicting their story.

[...] "Dancing with Tears in My Eyes" [...] is an upbeat pop-rock ballad; one of {{a small minority of}} tracks to incorporate Guitars in the instrumental, as Kesha tried to exclude the style from the album.

Onwumere watched a few episodes of the show to prepare for his audition, as he had not seen it before. The actor said about his approach to the character: [...] "My duty [...] not to emulate exactly what [...] has done, ... but just to give it my own spin, and kind of do my own thing, and just give this character the same essence, but ... maybe a different life and a different take on it."

Smash agreed to the proposal, and Miller performed his first session for the company early in 1964, when he recorded the hits [...] "Dang Me" [...] and [...] "Chug-a-Lug".
