A further attempt was made in 2005 to acquire new aircraft and plans were submitted {{for the purchase of}} ten new wide-bodied Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a total cost of $1billion. Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government. After bureaucratic delays and a perceived lack of commitment from the government, Boeing lost interest and the plans were cancelled. A similar attempt to purchase medium-haul aircraft for domestic service was also postponed. In , Biman {{put out a}} tender for the dry lease of two Airbus A310-300 and two Airbus A300-600 aircraft for two years. The sole response to the tender came from Star Aviation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{daunting}} problems faced by airport management at Aurangabad was that of parking space for the aircraft, since the old apron could only accommodate one wide-bodied aircraft; this hampered regular flights out of the airport and prevented its use by foreign chartered flights. In the second phase a new apron (measuring 500 by 400 ft) was built, accommodating up to four <b>wide-bodied</b> Airbus <b>aircraft.</b> The old apron will continue to accommodate one Airbus and one ATR aircraft. Parking for five to six aircraft is now available, enabling chartered flights and increasing international tourist traffic.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} full service network {{carriers}} have recently stated their ambition to develop certain ultra-long-range (ULR) routes, such as Doha to Auckland, Dubai to Auckland, Dubai to Panama City, Singapore to San Francisco, Singapore to New York, {{all of which}} require a great circle distance between 7, 000 - 9, 000 nautical miles (nm) with an estimated travel time between 15 and 20 hours. This paper examines the capability of {{the current generation of}} <b>wide-bodied</b> passenger <b>aircraft</b> to satisfy this evolving strategy, and the impact, if any, on the provision of air cargo transportation. An exploratory study is presented herein based on an assessment of each aircraft type&# 039;s payload-range envelope, taken from the appropriate Aircraft Airports Handling Characteristics Manual. The key findings reveal that airlines wishing to pursue this ultra-long-range strategy have a surprisingly limited choice of current-generation passenger aircraft which are capable of flying the desired mission profile without compromising significantly on passenger numbers and cargo payload...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 117 - 119) This paper {{describes the}} development of a portable data acquisition system for recording dynamic data from <b>wide-bodied</b> passenger <b>aircraft.</b> Aircraft flight testing background leading to the requirements for the system is reviewed. The general system design is presented, as well as design details. Finally, the results of laboratory and flight test usage, and procedures for applying the system in acoustic and vibration tests, are presented. The system was built into a portable, wheeled cart for ease in loading and handling aboard the aircraft. It was designed to operate on a variety of electrical power available on the aircraft or in the laboratory, and to operate on batteries in the event no power is available. It is capable of recording on magnetic tape a random mixture of signals on a variety of transducers, preamplifiers, and either sources, with a minimum of customary signal conditioners and amplifiers. Laboratory and flight tests have proven the system to be satisfactory in frequency response and signal-to-noise ratio characteristics, and in its ability to record useful dynamic data...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wide-bodied</b> {{transport}} <b>aircraft</b> {{are susceptible}} {{to the problem of}} fatigue cracking of the pressurized cabin. In order to design against catastrophic failure due to such fatigue cracking, the residual strength of a transport aircraft fuselage stiffened panel is analyzed for a crack spanning over two bays. A finite element model of the entire fuselage structure of a transport aircraft was modeled and a linear elastic stress analysis was carried out to identify the location of maximum tensile stress location susceptible for initiation of a fatigue crack. This is followed by fracture mechanics analysis of a growing crack in the panel to assess its crack arrest capability. Residual strength assessment was carried out for the panel and it was observed that residual strength of stiffened panel decreases with increase in the crack length, As the crack length approaches stiffener location the stiffener will share the maximum load, resulting in higher residual strength in the skin leading to crack arrest. Also, the residual strengths of the skin, stiffener and the rivets are estimated individually to generate panel strength diagram, which demonstrates the crack arresting capability of the stiffened panel...|$|R
40|$|In situ {{measurements}} of NO, NO_ 2, and CO_ 2 volume mixing ratios {{have been carried}} out in the near field exhaust plumes of seven subsonic <b>wide-bodied</b> jet <b>aircraft</b> using the DLR research aircraft 'Falcon'. For three additional aircraft only NO and CO_ 2 was measured. Plume ages of 50 s to 150 s have been covered, with maximum observed exhaust gas enhancements of 319 ppbv and 51 ppmv for #DELTA#[NO_x] and #DELTA#[CO_ 2], respectively, relative to ambient values. These measurements are used to derive NO_x emission indices for seven of the individual aircraft/engine combinations. The NO_x emission indices derived range from 12. 3 g/kg to 30. 4 g/kg. They are compared with predicted emission index values, calculated for the same aircraft engine and the actual conditions using two newly developed fuel flow correlation methods. The calculated emission indices were mostly within or close to the error limits of the measured values. On average, the predictions from both methods were 12 % lower than the measured values, with an observed maximum deviation of 25 %. The ratio #gamma#=[NO_ 2]/[NO_x] found during the present measurements ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 11 for five daytime cases and was around 0. 22 for two nighttime cases. By use of a simple box model of the plume chemistry and dilution these data were used to estimate the initial value #gamma#_ 0 present at the engine exit plane. #gamma#_ 0 values between 0 and 0. 15 were found. These where applied to estimate the corresponding NO_ 2 for the three cases where only NO was measured. (orig.)

50|$|Since 1 May 2015, The Airport Authority of India (AAI) {{has imposed}} the {{restriction}} of {{wide body aircraft}} such as Boeing 777 and 747 {{for a period of}} six months due to runway re-carpeting which had been long overdue at this airport. As a result, Emirates, Saudia and 2 Air India 747 flight operations had to move temporarily to Cochin International Airport during this time. The airport authorities have also expressed doubt about getting permission to operate <b>wide-bodied</b> <b>aircraft</b> from the airport even after the completion of the re-carpeting as the runway in the airport is not large enough for the operation of jumbo aircraft. AAI had earlier instructed all airports using widebody aircraft must have 240 m of RESA on each direction vs Calicut airports 75m. The airport Director K Janardhanan said the short runway was a major hurdle in operating the <b>wide-bodied</b> <b>aircraft</b> from the table top airport and the runway length should be extended from the current 2,850 metres to 3,150 metres to operate <b>wide-bodied</b> <b>aircraft,</b> he added. The major hurdle in extending the runway is the delay in acquiring the land which require a total of 385 acres of land for extending the runway and associated facilities. The state government has been finding the task difficult as it requires evacuation of 1,500 families living around the airport. As of June 10, 2016, not much action has been taken for land acquisition to help increase the runway length.|$|E
