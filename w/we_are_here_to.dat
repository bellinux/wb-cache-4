In observing discussions among them during his visit, Callahan-Bever noted: [...] "Despite the heavyweights assembled, the egos rarely clash; talks are sprawling, enlightening, and productive ... <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> contribute, challenge, and inspire".

500|$|Following {{the highly}} publicized incident, West took a brief break from music and {{threw himself into}} fashion, only to hole up in Hawaii {{for the next few}} months writing and {{recording}} his next album. Importing his favorite producers and artists to work on and inspire his recording, West kept engineers behind the boards 24 hours a day and slept only in increments. Noah Callahan-Bever, a writer for Complex, was present during the sessions and described the [...] "communal" [...] atmosphere as thus: [...] "With the right songs and the right album, he can overcome any and all controversy, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> contribute, challenge, and inspire."

500|$|The team {{held two}} Organized Team Activities (OTAs) {{prior to the}} draft, in {{addition}} to 12 throughout May and June. The OTAs were voluntary, however, most players did attend. Many players routinely worked on their conditioning and strength together, in addition to [...] "informal" [...] on field training. A week prior {{to the end of}} OTAs Mike Tomlin said he was happy with the team's progress during the sessions. Also stating, “We are having a productive off-season {{and that is what we}} are here for. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> get better individually and collectively and I think we are doing that.” Limas Sweed experimented on special teams play for the first time ever, with a concentration in punt blocking. On the day of the final OTA, June 12, Tomlin stated that while he was pleased with the progress of the team, no positions would be gained or lost based on the voluntary camp. Tomlin added, [...] "it's been teach-oriented, it's been skill-develop-oriented. It's different than playing the game of football." [...] The team was given 44days off until the beginning of training camp.|$|E
500|$|In February 2010 when {{accompanying}} the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, he said [...] "We feel that Saudi Arabia {{has a long}} and close relationship with Pakistan, that makes Saudi Arabia even more a valuable interlocutor for us. When we tell them about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens as somebody who is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, will listen with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone you speak to. If I speak to you, you are my interlocutor. I mentioned the Saudis as our interlocutors, i.e. the people <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> speak to".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Searle, {{along with other}} landlords, petitioned Berkeley's rental board to raise the limits on how much he could charge tenants under the city's 1980 rent {{stabilization}} ordinance. The rental board refused to consider Searle's petition and Searle filed suit, charging a violation of due process. In 1990, in {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "Searle Decision", the California Supreme Court upheld Searle's argument in part and Berkeley changed its rent control policy, leading to large rent increases between 1991 and 1994. Searle was reported to see the issue as one of fundamental rights, being quoted as saying [...] "The treatment of landlords in Berkeley is comparable to the treatment of blacks in the South...our rights have been massively violated and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> correct that injustice."

2500|$|The {{new head}} office was commended at the time. It {{featured}} in the 7 September 1967 edition of The Queensland Master Builder, which detailed the building's construction techniques and highlighted its modern technology. According to the MRD's magazine Queensland Roads, there were hopes [...] "that the construction of this building with its landscaped gardens and surroundings in the old Spring Hill area of Brisbane, [...] provide an incentive for other businesses and developers to {{follow the example of}} the Main Roads Department". Commissioner Barton viewed the MRD as [...] "a giant consulting engineers and construction organisation", and stated [...] "why should a department like Main Roads be any different from private business ... e hope that when our officers are dealing with people they will get the idea that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> do business just as efficiently and effectively as anybody else in the community". The Courier-Mail added that [...] "the building design, layout of office space and staff facilities, gives the Main Roads Department an air of big business, not the traditional Government department organisation", while the Mines and Main Roads Minister, Ronald Ernest Camm, claimed that the new building [...] "would {{be one of the most}} effective ways of organising Main Roads personnel and facilities for a bolder attack on the problems of the future".|$|E
