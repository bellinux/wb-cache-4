5|$|Epaminondas evidently began {{serving as}} a soldier after adolescence; Plutarch refers to an {{incident}} involving Epaminondas that occurred during a battle at Mantinea. Though not explicitly stated, this was probably the Spartan attack on Mantinea in 385 BC, as described by Xenophon; Plutarch tells us that Epaminondas <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> part of a Theban force aiding the Spartans, so this battle fits the description.* Hanson, Hoplites, 146; Stylianoy, Diodorus Siculus, 172. However, Buck (Boiotia, 63) questions {{the existence of a}} SpartanTheban alliance in 385 BC. Epaminondas was certainly not old enough to have served at the First Battle of Mantinea which was in 418 BC.|$|E

There, he met Anna Purnell, {{the daughter of a}} Chicago businessman, who <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> a YMCA volunteer. The two were married in August 1919. They had three children together, all daughters. While in Germany, Somervell also met Walker D.

Britannicus' father <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> was Lucius Domitius and his mother Agrippina who were the last surviving descendants of Germanicus. Claudius watched the young nobility, including Britannicus and Domitius, enact the Battle of Troy in the circus. Tacitus says Domitius was greeted with more enthusiasm than Britannicus.|$|E

Writing an epigram in honor of Vasile Goldiș, Ranetti <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> a delegate of both the Romanian Journalists' Syndicate and Iorga's Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians. Shortly after, Ranetti and Furnica joined a coalition of Francophiles and nationalists, supporting neutral Romania's alliance with the Entente Powers.|$|E
25|$|Fernando E. Rodríguez Vargas, a dentist, {{joined the}} United States Army on August 16, 1917, and on September 14, was {{commissioned}} a First Lieutenant.

In August 1919, he was reassigned to San Juan, Puerto Rico and served in Camp Las Casas. On February 18, 1921, Rodriguez Vargas was sent to Washington, D.C. and assigned to the Army Dental Corps where he continued his investigations in the field of bacteriology. Rodríguez Vargas <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> an educator and investigator of the bacteriological aspects of dental diseases. His research led him to discover the bacteria which causes dental caries. According to his investigations, three types of the Lactobacillus species, during the process of fermentation, are the causes of cavities.|$|E

Sheena and Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her were in Courtney's favor. Courtney tried to contact Sheena or to give the song to Sheena, but she failed. Mika mentioned Ringo as one of his favorite Japanese artists, alongside Puffy AmiYumi, The Yellow Monkey, Yoko Kanno, and the Yoshida Brothers; in several interviews during his visit to Japan in 2007.

Joe Small was placed in solitary confinement. Each of the men was interviewed by officers, {{sometimes}} {{in the presence of}} an armed guard. Questions focused on identifying [...] "ringleaders" [...] of the work-stoppage and on what was said by whom at the meeting on the prison barge. The men were asked to sign statements summarizing the interrogation, but the officer's version rarely matched the enlisted man's recollection of the interview. Some men, upon seeing that the written statements did not reflect what they had said, refused to sign. Others felt they {{had no choice but to}} signthey were being ordered to do so by an officer.

500|$|The three known {{specimens}} of the 1873-CC quarter, without arrows by the date, {{and the only}} known dime of that description, may have been salvaged from assay pieces, as the remainder of those coins had been ordered melted as underweight. A similar mystery attends the 1894 Barber dime struck at San Francisco (1894-S) of which the published mintage is 24, {{although it is not}} certain whether this total includes the one sent to Philadelphia to await the 1895 Assay Commission. [...] The fact that one of the 1895 assay commissioners was Robert Barnett, chief clerk of the San Francisco Mint, has led numismatic writers Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly to speculate that he may have been made an assay commissioner in order to retrieve the dime. [...] The 1895 Assay Commission report confirms that the dime <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>as</b> it was counted by the Counting Committee. [...] The dime is not mentioned as having been either weighed or assayed; Oliver and Kelly, in a May 2011 article in The Numismatist, suggest that Barnett used that privilege of assay commissioners to obtain the rarity. [...] He is not known, however, to have written or spoken of the matter before his murder in 1904.|$|E

She stood down on the Delaware River five weeks later, this time sailing to Mexico. Off Vera Cruz, Mexico, on 17 September, the steamer watched {{the last of the}} French occupation end before sailing to Pensacola, Florida, for repairs in mid-October. De Soto proceeded south along the Florida coast on 22 October, stopping at Tampa Bay and Key West before arriving at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, on 17 November. The ship, in company with sidewheel steamer [...] and screw sloop-of-war , <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>as</b> part of Secretary of State William H. Seward's plan to purchase the Danish West Indies. The day after De Sotos arrival, however, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the region and a tsunami swept the steamer from her moorings and threw the ship onto a wharf. Luckily, the next wave lifted the ship and carried her back to deep water. With her bottom damaged and leaking badly, De Sotos sailors and carpenters spent the next ten days pumping water and repairing the hull. On 5 December, the steamer sailed north with the Danish Commissioner on board and the ship arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on the 17th.|$|E
