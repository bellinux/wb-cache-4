5|$|After {{the song}} was composed, Lloyd Webber and Rice <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> to find a {{suitable}} musical actress for the songs and the titular role, since the only one they knew, Yvonne Elliman, {{had moved to the}} United States. One day they were watching the British musical television show, Rock Follies, where they noticed actress and singer Julie Covington, who played an aspiring rock musician. Covington had played in London musicals like Godspell, and her acting abilities in Rock Follies convinced Rice and Lloyd Webber to sign her for Evita.|$|E

5|$|By August 1997, the Tiger-Cats <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> {{with several}} {{injuries}} to their receivers. After Ted Long reinjured his groin, the Tiger-Cats signed Alford to their practice squad {{with the intention}} of using him to replace Long in the lineup. Alford made his debut with the Tiger-Cats on August 8, 1997 and went on to play three games with the club. In late August, Alford was released from the team.|$|E
5|$|For the 1965 Formula One season, Rindt {{signed as}} a {{permanent}} driver with Cooper, paired with Bruce McLaren. He was not immediately successful as Cooper, formerly a top team, <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> at the time. In his first race, the 1965 South African Grand Prix, he developed transistor trouble; the damage was initially repaired but the problem recurred and Rindt had to retire from the race. His best result was a fourth place at the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. He ended the season with four points, 13th in the championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, {{amendments}} to the Indian Act made school attendance compulsory for Indigenous children between 7 and 16 years of age. The changes included a series of exemptions regarding school location, {{the health of the}} children and their prior completion of school examinations. It was changed to children between 6 and 15 years of age in 1908. The introduction of mandatory attendance was the result of pressure from missionary representatives. Reliant on student enrollment quotas to secure funding, they <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> to attract new students due to increasingly poor school conditions.|$|E

5|$|Shankly {{began his}} {{managerial}} {{career at the}} club where his professional playing career had started. Carlisle in the 1948–49 season <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> in {{the bottom half of}} the Third Division North and finding it difficult to attract southern-based players because of the town's geographic remoteness in the far north of England. Shankly's work ethic transformed the team who finished 15th in 1948–49 after he had been in charge for only the last few matches. They improved to ninth in 1949–50 and then to third in 1950–51, almost gaining promotion.|$|E
5|$|The first deep-level tube railway, the City & South London Railway (C), {{opened in}} 1890. Its early success {{resulted}} in a rush of proposals to Parliament for other deep-level routes under the capital, but by 1901 only two more lines had opened: the Waterloo & City Railway (W) in 1898 and the Central London Railway (CLR) in 1900. Construction had started on one other line and then stopped following a financial crisis. The rest of the companies <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> to raise funding.|$|E
5|$|While intensifying, Cyclone Favio {{brushed the}} {{southern}} tip of Madagascar while bringing heavy rains to the nation. Along the southeastern portion of the nation, road access was reduced. Favio disrupted relief operations to 582,000people, who <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> to cope with a drought in the southern portion of the nation. Moreover, the cyclone disrupted relief efforts during an aftermath of flood that killed three persons and displaced 33,000people throughout the country. Overall, the cyclone was one of several storms to affect the nation during the season.|$|E

5|$|As {{commander}} of U.S. {{forces in the}} Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower on his three-day trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for an exit strategy for the stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases {{and the use of}} nuclear weapons. This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commander General Mark W. Clark, but had not been acted on when the armistice came in July 1953, {{at a time when the}} Chinese <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> with domestic unrest. Still, Radford's frankness during the trip and his knowledge of Asia made a good impression on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> when Healy {{came to the}} crease with the score at 7/63 after 14.2 overs. Three wickets had fallen {{in the space of}} 16 balls, during which only three runs had been added, and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory. Healy then struck three fours, making 15 from 9 balls before being {{dismissed}} by Nicki Shaw, ending a stand of 23 from 13 balls with Sthalekar. However, Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E
5|$|Bradford City <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> in the Second Division at {{the time}} of Cowan's signing, having won just one of their first ten games of the 1935–36 season. Cowan made his debut for them on 19 October 1935 in a 2–2 draw with Swindon Town, {{but it was not until}} Cowan's third game that Bradford won for the second time that season. Cowan missed just three of the club's {{remaining}} fixtures that season, playing 29 times in the league and three in the FA Cup as City finished 12th. The following season, City again struggled. Cowan missed just one of the first 23 games, but after Christmas, he was restricted to just six; and without Cowan, Bradford finished 21st and were relegated to the Third Division (North).|$|E

5|$|Eat a Peach is {{the third}} studio album by American rock band the Allman Brothers Band. Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was {{released}} on February 12, 1972, in the United States by Capricorn Records. Following their artistic and commercial breakthrough {{with the release of}} the live album At Fillmore East (1971), the Allman Brothers Band got to work on their third studio album. Many in the band <b>were</b> <b>struggling,</b> however, with heroin addictions, and checked into rehab to confront these problems. Shortly after leaving rehab, group leader and founder Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident in the band's home of Macon, Georgia thus making it the final album to feature the guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Following the sacking of Graeme Souness as Newcastle {{manager in}} February 2006, Bruce was again {{linked with the}} job, which {{ultimately}} went to Glenn Roeder. By {{this stage of the}} 2005–06 season, Birmingham <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> in the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7–0 at home by Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Some supporters of the club began to call for his resignation, but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager. The team managed to climb out of the relegation zone {{for the first time in}} nearly six months after a win over Bolton Wanderers in early April 2006. However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match their points total and therefore relegated.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{win over}} Leicester City, Burnley were drawn against Queens Park Rangers at Turf Moor in the Second Round. Despite a good {{performance}} by their opponents, Burnley progressed to the Third Round with a 4–2 win, in which Bob Kelly struck twice {{in the first half}} and Joe Anderson scored either side of half time. In the Third Round, Burnley were handed an away tie at Hull City, who at the time <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> in the Football League Second Division and had won only two matches in the previous five months. Despite being without first-team regulars George Halley and Joe Anderson through injury, Burnley were expected to win comfortably, not having lost since 4September 1920. Hull City played above all expectations and Burnley suffered a 0–3 defeat after being 0–1 behind at half time.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{moved to}} Liverpool in March 1934. Liverpool <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> to avoid relegation from the First Division when Johnson joined the club, having won only one match in 17 {{prior to his}} arrival. Johnson's {{introduction}} to the team coincided with an improvement in results, and Liverpool avoided relegation. He played in around half of Liverpool's matches in the 1934–35 season, and made six appearances in his final season as a professional. His final goal was scored against Grimsby in September 1935, and his final professional appearance came against Preston North End in April 1936. After leaving Liverpool he had a period as player-manager of non-league Darwen, who he represented until {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Situated in the Burnden area of Bolton, {{approximately}} one {{mile from the}} centre of the town, the ground served as the home of the town's football team for 102 years. In its heyday, Burnden Park could hold up to 70,000 supporters but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life. A section of The Embankment was sold off in 1986 {{to make way for a}} new Normid superstore. At this time, Bolton were in a dire position financially and <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> in the Football League Third Division, so there was a low demand for tickets and the loss of part of the ground gave the Bolton directors good value for money.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{attack on}} San Leonardo by the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada began late on 5 December 1943 with A Company {{establishing}} a bridgehead across the Moro, taking heavy casualties. In {{the early morning}} of 6 December, A Company was withdrawn and two additional Seaforth companies resumed the offensive. As PPCLI secured and held their bridgehead over the Moro River, the Seaforth Highlanders <b>were</b> <b>struggling</b> to enter San Leonardo. By 07:15, a single objective had been taken, with Canadian units pinned down by well-coordinated defensive fire from several companies of the 361st Regiment. Simultaneously, small arms fire prevented C Company from moving up {{the road from the}} Moro to San Leonardo, while D Company remained on the southern banks of the Moro throughout the early morning.|$|E
