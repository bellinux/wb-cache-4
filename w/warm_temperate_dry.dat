40|$|A risk {{assessment}} of vegetation zone responses {{to climate change}} was conducted using the classical Holdridge life zone model on the Loess Plateau of Northwest China. The results show that there are currently ten vegetation zones occurring on the Loess Plateau (1950 – 2000), including alvar desert, alpine wet tundra, alpine rain tundra, boreal moist forest, boreal wet forest, cool temperate desert, cool temperate desert scrub, cool temperate steppe, cool temperate moist forest, warm temperate desert scrub, warm temperate thorn steppe, and <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> <b>dry</b> forest. Seventy years later (2070 S), the alvar desert, the alpine wet tundra and the cool temperate desert will disappear, while warm temperate desert scrub and warm temperate thorn steppe will emerge. The area proportion of <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> <b>dry</b> forest will expand from 12. 2 % to 22. 8 %– 37. 2 %, while that of cool temperate moist forest will decrease from 18. 5 % to 6. 9 %– 9. 5 %. The area proportion of cool temperate steppe will decrease from 51. 8 % to 34. 5 %– 51. 6 %. Our results suggest that future climate change will be conducive to the growth and expansion of forest zones on the Loess Plateau, which can provide valuable reference information for regional vegetation restoration planning and adaptive strategies in this region...|$|E

The quantitative analysis of climate change impacting on vegetation ecosystem will afford the efficient data to support the implement of reasonability ecological restoration project. HLZ ecosystem model is employed to simulate the changes of climate-vegetation ecosystem in Loess Plateau during the periods from 1964 to 1974 (C 1), from 1975 to 1985 (C 2), from 1986 to 1996 (C 3), and from 1997 to 2007 (C 4) on spatial resolution of 1 km× 1 km. Combining the elevation data, {{the results show that}} there are 15 types of climate-vegetation ecosystem in which the cool temperate steppe, cool temperate moist forest and warm temperate are the major climate-vegetation types which respectively occupied the 82. 73 %, 83. 19 %, 82. 86 % during the periods from C 1 to C 4, and 79. 77 % of the sum area of Loess Plateau. The most types of moist climate-vegetation ecosystems have decreased since C 1 period, especially the area of nival area, alpine wet tundra and alpine rain tundra have rapidly decreased during the four periods. Furthermore, the average distribution elevation of all climate-vegetation ecosystems distribution are on the increase except warm temperate thorn steppe, especially the average distribution elevation of alpine rain tundra, boreal wet forest, cool temperate scrub and <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> <b>dry</b> forest have continuously increased during the four periods...|$|E
40|$|The {{systematic}} {{excavation of}} the site of Guado San Nicola (Monteroduni, Molise) revealed a stratigraphic sequence, more than two meters thick, located on the distal part of an ancient terraced alluvial cone made by the Lorda creek, {{a tributary of the}} Volturno river. The lithologic, morphographic and pedostratigraphic evidences suggest its attribution to an Interstadial of MIS 6 or to MIS 72. The radiometric dating (40 Ar/ 39 Ar method and Electron Spin Resonance in combination with the uranium family disequilibrium method) reported an age between 350 and 400. 000 years, confirmed by a Late Galerian fauna and by the presence of Cervus elaphus acoronatus and Equus ferus ssp. The fauna assemblage, apart from these two taxa, is characterized by the presence of Ursus sp., Elephas sp., Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis, Bos primigenius e cf. Megacerinae, which denote a <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> <b>dry</b> climate. Paleontological remains are characterized by the presence of intentional fractures produced by human activities aimed at the extraction of bone marrow while cut marks are badly preserved. The abundance of deer antlers seems to be due to its use as soft hammers. Handaxes of different forms and variable sizes are frequent, usually the shaping is mostly accurate on the point while the base is not shaped at all; the débitage component is characterized by the presence of a Levallois production. From a chronological point of view, despite the lithologic, morphographic and pedostratigraphic interpretation suggests a correlation to an Interstadial of MIS 6 or to MIS 7, the considerations on the fauna and radiometric dating are in agreement with an attribution to MIS 11...|$|E

40|$|Global {{seasonal}} hydrologic {{prediction is}} crucial to mitigating the impacts of droughts and floods, especially in the developing world. Hydrologic predictability at seasonal lead times (i. e., 1 – 6 months) comes from knowledge of initial hydrologic conditions (IHCs) and seasonal climate forecast skill (FS). In this study we quantify the contributions of two primary components of IHCs – soil moisture and snow water content – and FS (of precipitation and temperature) to seasonal hydrologic predictability globally on a relative basis throughout the year. We do so by conducting two model-based experiments using the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrology model, one based on ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) and another based on Reverse-ESP (Rev-ESP), both for a 47 yr re-forecast period (1961 – 2007). We compare cumulative runoff (CR), soil moisture (SM) and snow water equivalent (SWE) forecasts from each experiment with a VIC model-based reference data set (generated using observed atmospheric forcings) and estimate the ratio of {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) of both experiments for each forecast initialization date and lead time, to determine the relative contribution of IHCs and FS to the seasonal hydrologic predictability. We find that in general, the contributions of IHCs to seasonal hydrologic predictability is highest in the arid and snow-dominated climate (high latitude) regions of the Northern Hemisphere during forecast periods starting on 1 January and 1 October. In mid-latitude regions, such as the Western US, the influence of IHCs is greatest during the forecast period starting on 1 April. In the arid and <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> <b>dry</b> winter regions of the Southern Hemisphere, the IHCs dominate during forecast periods starting on 1 April and 1 July. In equatorial humid and monsoonal climate regions, the contribution of FS is generally higher than IHCs through most of the year. Based on our findings, we argue that despite the limited FS (mainly for precipitation) better estimates of the IHCs could lead to improvement in the current level of seasonal hydrologic forecast skill over many regions of the globe at least during some parts of the year...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} internal {{building envelope}} retrofitting of multi-storey, multi-owner residential buildings. The main {{question is how}} does the additional insulation placed {{on the inner side}} of the building envelope affect its thermal inertia. Among other reasons, thermal inertia is important in increasing human comfort in the space, avoiding overheating in summer, and managing solar gains. Inside insulation can alter this behaviour, and the aim is to understand the positive and negative consequences of such an intervention. The work assesses insulating materials and components integrated in the internal side of the retrofitted buildings in the summer periods. The scope of work addresses <b>warm</b> <b>temperate</b> climate with <b>dry</b> and warm summers, abbreviated as ‘Csb’ according to Koppen climate classification, and which is represented in the city of Milan, Italy. The alternatives assessed consider lightweight as well as massive building envelopes. To that aim, simulations are carried out {{in order to understand the}} variance in the thermal behaviour of the envelope, corresponding to the change in insulation placement on the building envelope (inside, outside or without). Analytical assessment is performed in order to include air and surface temperatures and internal heat loads. The results show that, under the conditions of this study, both internal and external insulation are beneficial in terms of surface, indoor air and operative temperatures in summertime.
