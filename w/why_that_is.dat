500|$|However, {{the jury}} found Goldman and Berkman guilty. Judge Julius Marshuetz Mayer imposed the maximum sentence: two years' imprisonment, a $10,000 fine each, and the {{possibility}} of deportation after their release from prison. As she was transported to Missouri State Penitentiary (now Jefferson City Correctional Center), Goldman wrote to a friend: [...] "Two years imprisonment for having made an uncompromising stand for one's ideal. <b>Why</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a small price." ...|$|E

On {{the lyric}} side of things, if I was singing about dancefloors or happier or rosier things, it wouldn't ring true for me. I don't know <b>why</b> <b>that</b> <b>is.</b> People quite often say, 'oh, you write these sad lyrics but you're not a sad person' - and I'm not... I don't think you need to be sad to write a sad song, everybody has a dark side." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{this general}} fact is proved by {{mathematical}} induction, the n = 0 case is trivial, (since the empty product is 1, {{and the empty}} sum is 0). The n = 1 case is also trivial, [...] And for each n ≥ 3, the case is easy to prove from the preceding n − 1 case. The real difficulty lies in the n = 2 case, which is <b>why</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the one stated in the standard product rule.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{shortly after}} the season began, TV Guide announced, [...] "In a November episode of CBS' NCIS, the origins of Tony's fascination with cinema will be {{explained}} — and strengthen his bond with Ziva." [...] This involved him finding an old camera with photographs {{of his mother and}} later showing them to Ziva. Weatherly stated, [...] "She was really the beginning of his love for movies and <b>why</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> such a deep, penetrating part of who he is. The last gift she gave him was to turn to the movies as a moral compass." [...] De Pablo divulged, [...] "We end up going deeper with each other than ever before. It's a profound, soft, vulnerable moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In TNGs [...] "Q Who?", Guinan {{mentions}} that the Borg are [...] "made up of organic and artificial life [...] {{which has been}} developing for [...] thousands of centuries." [...] In the later episode of Star Trek: Voyager, [...] "", Gedrin, of the race the Vaadwaur, says that before his people and he were put into suspended animation 892 years earlier, the Borg had assimilated only a few colonies in the Delta Quadrant and were considered essentially a minor nuisance. Now awake in the 24th century, he is amazed {{to see that the}} Borg control a vast area of the Delta Quadrant.

6000|$|They {{remained}} so, face to face; {{the effect}} of which for him <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he had after a little understood <b>why.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> fundamental. [...] "Well, I see." ...|$|R

2500|$|The 1902 Constitution {{instituted a}} poll tax and {{required}} bulk payment after a voter missed elections, making voting a luxury that poor people, which included many African-Americans, could not often afford. The Constitution also required that voters pass a literacy test, a poll test on the Virginia Constitution, with their performance graded by the registrar. When questioned {{as to whether}} these measures were potentially discriminatory, Glass exclaimed, [...] "Discrimination! <b>Why</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> exactly what we propose. To remove every negro voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength of the white electorate." [...] Indeed, the number of African-Americans qualified to vote dropped from 147,000 to 21,000 immediately. Carter Glass remained {{one of the strongest}} advocates of segregation and continued to dedicate much of his political career to the perpetuation of Jim Crow laws in the South.|$|E
2500|$|Coincidentally at {{this same}} time a new {{panchromatic}} photographic emulsion was developed that allowed {{the full range of}} colors to be captured. Soon after it became available Stieglitz aimed his 8" [...] x 10" [...] view camera at the sky and began taking pictures. By the next year he had created a series of ten mounted photographs he called Music: A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs (also called Clouds in Ten Movements). He told his wife Georgia O'Keeffe [...] "I wanted a series that when seen by Ernest Bloch (the great composer) he would exclaim: Music! Music! Man, <b>why</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> music! How did you ever do that? And he would point to violins and flutes, and oboes, and brass…" [...] He first exhibited this series in 1923 in his one-man show at the Anderson Galleries in New York, and reported that when Bloch saw them there he had exactly the reaction Stieglitz had wanted.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} named Cloverfield. This changed several times throughout production {{before it was}} decided that the original title would be used. Matt Reeves explained that the title was changed frequently due to the hype caused by the teaser trailer. [...] "That excitement spread {{to such a degree that}} we suddenly couldn't use the name anymore. So we started using all these names like Slusho and Cheese. And people always found out what we were doing!" [...] The director said that [...] "Cloverfield" [...] was the government's case designation for the events caused by the monster, comparing the titling to that of the Manhattan Project. [...] "And it's not a project per se. It's the way that this case has been designated. That's <b>why</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> on the trailer, and it becomes clearer in the film. It's how they refer to this phenomenon [...] this case", said the director. The film's final title, Cloverfield, is the name of the exit Abrams takes to his Santa Monica office. In turn, the road used to lead to the Santa Monica Airport, which originally bore the name Clover Field.|$|E

60|$|The cook {{continued}} his journey, unconscious of the admiration excited by his movements. He {{began to think}} <b>that</b> he had <b>been</b> a trifle foolish in talking so freely.

50|$|Ludham's {{parents were}} Richard and Eda of Ludham, Norfolk, {{and he had}} a brother Thomas who was also a priest.
