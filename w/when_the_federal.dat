5|$|The economy {{began to}} recover in 1933, but {{unemployment}} remained high among youth and older workers until 1940, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government built up supplies and armaments going into World War II.|$|E
5|$|After this {{construction}} was complete, {{there were still}} more calls to further develop the site, and especially to provide facilities for education about the wars. A $62million proposal was presented in 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members, and ran into significant funding problems <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Government decided not to provide funding.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, as of 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve sets an {{interest}} rate target for <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> funds (overnight bank reserves) market. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>Federal</b> funds rate {{is higher than the}} target, the New York Reserve Bank will usually increase the money supply via a repo (effectively borrowing from the dealers' perspective; lending for <b>the</b> Reserve Bank). <b>When</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>Federal</b> funds rate is less than the target, the Bank will usually decrease the money supply via a reverse repo (effectively lending from the dealers' perspective; borrowing for the Reserve Bank).|$|R
5|$|Many farmers {{distilled}} their {{corn harvest}} into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey {{was used as}} a form of currency on the frontier. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people in}} {{government}} {{want to say}} that safety is priority number one, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government provides some guidances for safety measure which would reduce death by 37%, such as alcohol in 1998 or motorcycle helmet in 1967, around ten years are necessary for such measures be implemented by a number of local governments.|$|E
5|$|The college moved {{several times}} during its first eleven years, before {{settling}} in its present location. Prior to Canadian Confederation, the college was financially supported by the Presbyterian Church in Scotland, the Canadian government and private citizens. After Confederation, the college faced ruin <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government withdrew its funding and the Commercial Bank of the Midland District collapsed, a disaster which cost Queen's two-thirds of its endowment. The college was rescued after Principal William Snodgrass and other officials created a fundraising campaign across Canada.|$|E

25|$|Porter {{could not}} get many of his ironclads over the falls at Alexandria. Colonel Joseph Bailey {{designed}} Bailey's Dam, to which Banks soon gave night-and-day attention. Several boats got through before a partial dam collapse. An extra upriver dam provided additional water depth, allowing the march to resume. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> left Alexandria, <b>the</b> town went up in flames, the origins of which are disputed. Because the Confederates had already burned most of the cotton, many speculators at Alexandria were disappointed.|$|R
5|$|The {{section of}} the byway that follows M-65 was first added to the state highway system in the mid-1930s. On December 20, 1988, the National Forest Service {{designated}} the River Road National Forest Scenic Byway in Iosco County. A second designation was added on September 22, 2005, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Highway Administration listed the roadway as the River Road National Scenic Byway.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> {{government}} began operations {{under the new}} form of government on March 4, 1789, two (of the 13) states were ineligible to participate as they had not yet ratified the Constitution. Both did so while Washington was in office, thereby joining the new Union: North Carolina, November 21, 1789; and Rhode Island, May 29, 1790.|$|E
5|$|Jones himself {{came under}} threat of {{transfer}} or subordination in April 1943 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> government began moves to unite the Air Force's command by creating an overarching Air Officer Commanding RAAF position that would have effectively replaced Jones as CAS and also been senior to Bostock. Air Marshal Drummond was again approached but once more the British Air Ministry refused to release him, having selected him for an Air Council post. MacArthur rejected two other RAF candidates, and the plan was held over. In the King's Birthday Honours that June, Jones was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E

50|$|The {{diminution}} of <b>the</b> squadron came <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> {{were able to}} travel up the James River after the Confederates destroyed its guardian, CSS Virginia. In an attempt to bolster the obstructions at Drewry's Bluff, the CSS Jamestown was sunk and its guns mounted on the bluff. Its crew, along with the crews {{of the rest of}} the squadron, fought at the Battle of Drewry's Bluff on May 15, 1862. The hull of the new ironclad CSS Richmond was towed from Norfolk to Richmond during this withdrawal.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{immediate}} ideas for redevelopment of the base was {{to turn it into}} a federal prison, something which had been done previously at the former Carswell AFB in Texas <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Medical Center, Carswell was opened on its grounds. Many other former Air Force facilities have had prisons opened up on their grounds as well. From the outset, there was some reluctance in the town about turning it into creating a prison culture in Limestone, but this was lessened once the government decided that it did not want to build a federal prison on the grounds of the former air base.|$|E
5|$|The banks {{who held}} the company's large debt forced the Holt board of {{directors}} to accept their candidate, ThomasA.Baxter, to succeed Benjamin Holt. Baxter was a former Boston banker who had joined the Holt company in 1913 as a business manager. The company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust. Baxter initially cut the large tractors from the company's product line and introduced smaller models focused on the agricultural market. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Aid Highway Act of 1921 funded a US$1 billion federal highway building program, Baxter began focusing company assets towards road construction. Along with the C.L.Best Gas Traction Company, formed by Clarence Leo Best in 1910, Holt faced fierce competition with the Fordson company.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> {{government}} shifted {{to a day}} school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished {{to serve as the}} control sample.|$|E

5|$|Dar was disqualified on 28 July 2017 by the Supreme Court of Pakistan to {{hold the}} office of Ministry of Finance after then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was also disqualified by the court {{following}} Panama Papers case decision. On the same day, he had ceased to hold ministerial office <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> cabinet was disbanded after Nawaz Sharif resigned as Prime Minister. Following the election of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi as new Prime Minister in early August 2017, Dar {{was inducted into the}} federal cabinet of Abbasi despite his disqualification and an investigation was ordered against him by the Supreme Court and was re-appointed as the Minister for Finance for the fourth time After assuming the office of Prime Minister, Abbasi divided the Finance Ministry into separate entities thus minimizing the role of Dar in the federal government affairs. On 11 August 2017, he was removed as chairman of Economic Coordination Committee by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. On 20 August 2017, he was removed from the chairmanship of some 35 National Assembly committees by Shahid Khaqan Abbasi thus further reducing Dar's influence. Pakistan Today reported that the reason of confining Dar to Ministry of Finance only is on direction of the Sharif family. In September 2017, a NAB court in Pakistan indicted Dar in Panama Papers corruption case.|$|E
