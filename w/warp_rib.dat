According to the proposed model, the stiffening beams are isolated from the plate by sections in the lower outer surface of the plate, taking into account the arising tractions in all directions at the fictitious interfaces. The aforementioned integrated tractions result in the loading of the beams as well as the additional loading of the plate. Their distribution is established by applying continuity conditions in all directions at the interfaces. The analysis of both the plate and the beams is accomplished on their deformed shape taking into account second-order effects. Six boundary value problems with respect to the plate transverse deflection, to the plate inplane displacement components, to the beam transverse deflections, to the beam axial deformation and to the beam nonuniform angle of twist are formulated and solved using the Analog Equation Method (AEM), a BEM based method employing a boundary integral equation approach. The solution of the aforementioned plate and beam problems, which are nonlinearly coupled, is achieved using iterative numerical methods. The adopted model describes better the actual response of the plate beams system and permits the evaluation of the shear forces at the interfaces in both directions, the knowledge of which is very important in the design of prefabricated ribbed plates. The evaluated lateral deflections of the plate- beams system are found to exhibit considerable discrepancy from those of other models, which neglect inplane and axial forces and deformations.

40|$|Nonrigid image {{registration}} {{is a key}} tool in medical imaging. Because of high degrees of freedom in nonrigid transforms, {{there have been many}} efforts to regularize the deformation based on some reasonable assumptions. Especially, motion invertibility and local tissue rigidity have been investigated as reasonable priors in {{image registration}}. There have been several papers on exploiting each constraint separately. These constraints are reasonable in respiratory motion estimation because breathing motion is invertible and there are some rigid structures such as bones. Using both constraints seems very attractive in respiratory motion registration since using invertibility prior alone usually causes bone <b>warping</b> in <b>ribs.</b> Using rigidity prior seems natural and straightforward. However, the “sliding effect” near the interface between rib cage and diaphragm makes problem harder because it is not locally invertible. In this area, invertibility and rigidity priors have opposite forces. Recently, we proposed a simple piecewise quadratic penalty that encourages the local invertibility of motions. In this work we relax this penalty function by using a Geman-type function that allows the deformation to be piecewise smooth instead of globally smooth. This allows the deformation to be discontinuous {{in the area of the}} interface between rib cage and diaphragm. With some small sacrifice of regularity, we could achieve more realistic discontinuous motion near diaphragm, better data fitting error as well as less bone warping. We applied this Geman-type function penalty only to the x- and y-direction partial derivatives of the z-direction deformation to address the sliding effect. 192 × 128 × 128 3 D CT inhale and exhale images of a real patient were used to show the benefits of this new penalty method...|$|R
