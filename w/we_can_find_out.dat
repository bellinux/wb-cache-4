6000|$|... "Don't jeer. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> only <b>find</b> <b>out</b> through Whittington. We must {{discover}} {{where he}} lives, what he does--sleuth him, in fact! Now I can't do it, {{because he knows}} me, but he only saw you {{for a minute or}} two in Lyons'. He's not likely to recognize you. After all, one young man is much like another." ...|$|R

60|$|No {{doubt we}} learn from it that Ruth was the ancestress of King David; and that she was, therefore, an ancestress of our blessed Lord Jesus Christ: but curious and {{interesting}} as that is, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> hardly call that something necessary to salvation. There must be something more in the book. Let us take it simply as it stands, and see if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> it <b>out.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{compared}} the balium preparations having high density and low viscosity (BP-HDLV) with those currently in use. We adopted the stomaches of pigs and the new phantom manufactured by ourselves. We especialy noted {{the quality of the}} contrast. The results indicate that BP-HDLV do not always make high contrast. The contrast is related to fluidity besides density. The fluidity of BP-HDLV should be improved. In adition, it costs much to increase content of balium. Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> not <b>find</b> <b>out</b> positive significance to use these BP-HDLV...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} what the key {{decision}} makers in organizations decide after having received information on {{the current state of}} the organizational performance. Because of strong attributions to success and failure, it is impossible to predict in advance which concrete actions will occur. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> however <b>find</b> <b>out</b> what kinds of actions are decided upon by means of an organizational learning model that focuses on the hastenings and delays after performance feedback. As an illustration, the responses to performance signals by trainers and club owners in Dutch soccer clubs are analyzed...|$|R
50|$|People don't {{always know}} why {{they do what they}} do, or what they do until it happens. Therefore, {{describing}} an experimental situation to participants and then asking them to respond normally will produce responses that may not match the behavior of people who are actually in the same situation. We cannot depend on people's predictions about what they would do in a hypothetical situation; <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>find</b> <b>out</b> what people will really do when we construct a situation that triggers the same psychological processes as occur in the real world.|$|R

The woman will also, doubtless, be able to give a description of his wife as well of himself, and with these various proofs in your hand I think you may safely go down and see Sir Ralph Gilmore, whom I shall, of course, prepare by letter for your visit.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You mean Teeny Weeny the Shrew," [...] replied Old Mother Nature, {{smiling at}} Happy Jack. [...] "He isn't a Mouse. He isn't even a Rodent.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of chaotic attractors can be complex {{and difficult to}} describe without some mathematical tool. The topic of this contribution is the realization of program for computing the dimensions of state space attractors. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> also <b>find</b> <b>out</b> if the system is highly sensitive to initial conditions. First we need to numerically integrate system of equations, create a data set and finally <b>we</b> <b>can</b> estimate the capacity or Kaplan-Yorke dimension. The main objective of derived program is to analyze and determine chaotic behavior providing a chance to discuss the accuracy of computation engine and theoretical value...|$|R

30|$|Because {{the degree}} L {{of the matrix}} A_u^TA_u is far smaller than the degree M of the matrix A_uA_u^T, i.e., the number of {{extracted}} snapshots L is much smaller {{than that of the}} spacial mesh points M, but their positive eigenvalues λ_i (i= 1, 2,...,r) are the same. Thus, we may first compute the eigenvalues λ_i (i= 1, 2,...,r) for the matrix A_u^TA_u and the corresponding eigenvectors ψ_i (i= 1, 2,...,r), and then, by means of the formula φ_i=A_uψ_i/√(λ_i) (i= 1, 2,...,r), <b>we</b> <b>can</b> acquire the eigenvectors φ_i (i= 1, 2,...,r) corresponding to the positive eigenvalues λ _i (i= 1, 2,...,r) for the matrix A_uA_u^T. Thus, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> conveniently <b>find</b> <b>out</b> the POD basis.|$|R
40|$|This lesson {{uses the}} 3. 6 million year old tracks of early {{hominids}} in Laetoli {{to provide a}} tantalizing opportunity to explore how scientists use patterns of the present to understand the past.

40|$|In {{this study}} we have interviewed eight {{teachers}} about when and how particle concepts should be taught. All of the surveyed teachers argue for an early introduction. This view {{is also consistent with}} the scientists on when the particle concepts should be introduced. By an early introduction teachers and scientists consider the age between 6 - 12 years old. A majority of the scientists and the surveyed teachers use concept of change as a entery point to talk about particle ideas. A substance that is commonly used among both teachers and scientists is water. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> also <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that the surveyed teachers think that the particle concepts are fundamental for pupils to get a broader understanding in school science learning...|$|R
