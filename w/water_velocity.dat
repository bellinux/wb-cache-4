40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and shape}} of algae can affect their survival in wave-swept environments because of the hydrodynamic drag created by water flow. Studies of morphology and drag are typically conducted at relatively low <b>water</b> <b>velocities,</b> {{and the influence of}} algal morphology on drag, over the range of <b>water</b> <b>velocities</b> algae must cope with in their natural environment, remains unclear. Here, we tested the link between morphological variation and hydrodynamic drag for a dominant kelp with complex morphology (Ecklonia radiata), over a range of <b>water</b> <b>velocities</b> representative of conditions on wave-swept reefs. Our results indicated that kelps on subtidal reefs must withstand maximal orbital <b>water</b> <b>velocities</b> in excess of 2 – 3 m s− 1. Our measurements of drag, resulting from flows ranging from 1 to 3 m s− 1, revealed that shape- and width-related thallus and lamina characters were important to drag at low speed, but that total thallus area (or biomass) was the main determinant of drag at high flow. Drag coefficients converged at increasing speed suggesting that, at high flow, significant thallus reconfiguration (more streamlined shape) decoupled drag from morphology. This implies that, at peak velocities, only size (total area), not morphology, is important to drag and the probability of dislodgment...|$|R

25|$|By the 1850s the Fraser Canyon was {{transformed}} from a First Nations and fur trade corridor to a busy route, called the Cariboo Road, used by gold rush miners seeking access to the upper Fraser Basin. During the 1880s, the Canadian Pacific Railway built a new transcontinental railroad to unite the far-flung provinces of the young Dominion of Canada. This nation-building project saw new railroad tracks constructed on the west riverbank at Hells Gate, connecting the British Columbia coast to the Interior (and the rest of Canada) through the Fraser Canyon. Some assert that rocks and debris dumped into the river during construction of the CPR constricted the river flow and impeded salmon passage, {{though there is no}} documented historical or physical evidence to support this claim. By early 1911 the Canadian Northern Railway began a second transcontinental railway along the south and east bank of the canyon, which was completed in a year's time. While carving into canyon walls to create new rail-bed, rock and debris were again dumped into the river in significant volumes at various locations, including Hells Gate. In early 1914, two years after the completion of the CNR and during construction of a new tunnel, a large rockslide fell into the river just above the Hells Gate portal. Debris dispersed on the river bottom caused a 5-meter vertical drop in water depth and increased <b>water</b> <b>velocity</b> from five meters per second to 6.75m/second. As observed and noted by local residents and later by biologists {{in the aftermath of the}} slide, noticeably higher <b>water</b> <b>velocity</b> seemed to exceed the swimming capacity of the salmon, resulting in premature mortality and reduced populations of salmon fry in the subsequent year. In an initial attempt to redress the ecological and physical changes at Hells Gate that impeded migrating salmon, tons of rocks and debris were removed from the river during the winter of 1914-1915. By early 1915, Hells Gate was pronounced clear. While government officials declared that the river at Hells Gate was fully restored, many biologists maintain that the slide permanently altered the river's ecology.|$|E

40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} is one {{mechanism by}} intertidal organisms {{to change and}} survive {{in a variety of}} local flow environments. One such species is the barnacle Balanus glandula, which exhibits plasticity in both its feeding behavior and the morphology of its feeding cirri. Barnacles feed actively at low flow speeds, but can feed passively at higher flow speeds. Additionally, individuals in habitually low flow environments have longer and thinner cirri than barnacles in high flow environments. This study explores how behavioral and morphological plasticity interact to give barnacles from low flow environments an advantage while feeding at slower <b>water</b> <b>velocities.</b> Using a flow tank to observe feeding behavior, barnacles were placed in flows ranging from 0 to 10 cm/sec. Barnacles from a low flow site employed passive feeding at lower <b>water</b> <b>velocities</b> than barnacles from a high flow site.

25|$|There is {{a diverse}} range and {{combination}} of methodologies employed {{to understand the}} hydrological dynamics in salt marshes {{and their ability to}} trap and accrete sediment. Sediment traps are often used to measure rates of marsh surface accretion when short term deployments (e.g. less than one month) are required. These circular traps consist of pre-weighed filters that are anchored to the marsh surface, then dried in a laboratory and re-weighed to determine the total deposited sediment. For longer term studies (e.g. more than one year) researchers may prefer to measure sediment accretion with marker horizon plots. Marker horizons consist of a mineral such as feldspar that is buried at a known depth within wetland substrates to record the increase in overlying substrate over long time periods. In order to gauge the amount of sediment suspended in the water column, manual or automated samples of tidal water can be poured through pre-weighed filters in a laboratory then dried to determine the amount of sediment per volume of water. Another method for estimating suspended sediment concentrations is by measuring the turbidity of the water using optical backscatter probes, which can be calibrated against water samples containing a known suspended sediment concentration to establish a regression relationship between the two. Marsh surface elevations may be measured with a stadia rod and transit, electronic theodolite, Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System, laser level or electronic distance meter (total station). Hydrological dynamics include water depth, measured automatically with a pressure transducer, or with a marked wooden stake, and <b>water</b> <b>velocity,</b> often using electromagnetic current meters.|$|E

40|$|The {{movements}} of 23 northern squawfish Ptychocheilus oregonensis were monitored by radiotelemetry below a Columbia River hydroelectric dam during the out-migration of juvenile anadromous salmonids in 1984 and 1985. The {{work was done}} {{as part of a}} study to relate predator abundances and distribution to juvenile salmonid mortalities associated with dams. Northern squawfish remained in protected shoreline areas in spring and early summer, when discharge rates were high, but moved close to the dam and the juvenile bypass outflow area in mid to late summer, when discharge rates were low. Trends in northern squawfish movements were similar during abrupt changes in discharge rate. During short-term closures of the spillway, when flow patterns were abruptly changed, four of five northern squawfish moved out of the protected areas and into the main river channel. Surface <b>water</b> <b>velocities</b> at 81 locations occupied by radio-tagged northern squawfish in June to August 1985 ranged from 0 to 70 cm/s (mean, 24. 5 cm/s).

2500|$|Cooling {{water systems}} are {{susceptible}} to fouling. Cooling water typically has a high total dissolved solids content and suspended colloidal solids. Localized precipitation of dissolved solids occurs at the heat exchange surface due to wall temperatures higher than bulk fluid temperature.

Cooling water is typically on the tube side of a shell and tube exchanger because it's easy to clean.

2500|$|The name Hells Gate {{was derived}} from the journal of {{explorer}} Simon Fraser, who in 1808 described this narrow passage as [...] "a place where no human should venture, for surely these are the gates of Hell." [...] Long before the arrival of Simon Fraser, and as early {{as the end of the}} last ice age, Hells Gate was a First Nations congregation ground for settlement and salmon fishing. Archaeological evidence from old occupation sites and isotope analysis of human skeletal remains suggest that settlement and migration patterns for indigenous peoples in the Canyon correlated with the seasonal migration patterns of Pacific salmon. During the last deglaciation 4000–6000 years ago, long tongues of ice formed wedges and dams in the river's basin above the canyon, resulting in the formation of large reservoirs and new lakes—creating optimal spawning grounds for salmon. During this inter-glacial period, salmon began to populate the Fraser River and used Hells Gate passage as their route to upstream spawning grounds. Constricted by two steep subvertical granodiorite walls, the incredibly narrow passage and high <b>water</b> <b>velocity</b> made this part of the upstream journey extraordinarily difficult for salmon, and they would hover along the shores of the river or rest in its back-eddies. As a result, Hells Gate’s geology provided the Indigenous fishers with superb opportunities to readily catch salmon congregated at the river’s edge attempting to elude the strong currents and rough waters. Hells Gate became one of the most popular fishing stations along the Fraser River— pre- and post-colonial contact— where large numbers of aboriginal locals, and eventually European settlers, congregated during the summer months to fish for migrating salmon. Standing on adjacent rocks or on specially constructed wooden platforms extending from surrounding cliffs, fishermen would use long dip nets to snatch the salmon. As salmon fishing at Hells Gate was so prolific that, as Matthew Evenden asserts, the aboriginal culture along the Fraser River was built on a “salmon economy.” After Simon Fraser charted the river in the early nineteenth century, it became (and Hells Gate with it) an established corridor between the Pacific Ocean and the interior of what was to become British Columbia. Yet, as Fraser first noted, safe water transportation through the 115 foot wide opening at Hells Gate has proven virtually impossible.|$|E
50|$|Large dams can {{essentially}} influence downstream {{water quality}} via two key mechanisms, either by poor water quality {{released from the}} waters of the dam itself and reduced mixing of the river water column attributable to lower <b>water</b> <b>velocities</b> leading to anoxic conditions at the bottom of deep river pools.|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} {{the variability in}} hydrodynamic forces among locations separated by only centimeters along three horizontal transects on a steep rocky shore. Our results extend previous work showing that wave forces have the characteristics of 1 /f-noise, in which variability in wave forces decreases exponentially with decreasing scales of measurement. Furthermore, our results suggest that protection from hydrodynamic forces is not a certain consequence of a rugose substratum, suggesting that investigators should directly test (rather than assume) smallscale topographic protection from hydrodynamic forces. The intertidal zone of wave-swept rocky shores {{is one of the}} most physically stressful environments on Earth. Perhaps the most apparent physical stress factors—at least to the human observer—are the violent hydrodynamic forces imposed by breaking waves. On exposed shores, <b>water</b> <b>velocities</b> from breaking waves routinely reach 10 m s 21, while storm waves can produce <b>water</b> <b>velocities</b> of greater than 25 m s 21 (Denny et al. 2003). The high <b>water</b> <b>velocities</b> in the intertidal zone can impose large hydrodynamic forces on objects they encounter (e. g., Koehl 1984; Denny 1988), and many investigators have examined dislodgement and breakage of organisms subjected to breaking waves (e. g., Shanks and Wright 1986; Trussell et al. 1993; Denny 1995; Gaylord 1999). Amid these potentially dangerous hydrodynamic forces, wave-swept rocky shores provide habitat for rich and highly diverse communities of species (Ricketts and Calvi...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{passage through}} {{culverts}} {{is an important}} consideration in fish bearing streams. Just as adequate culvert capacity is required for safety, adequate provision for fish passage is required to maintain healthy fish populations. The main problem with improperly designed and installed culverts is that they form velocity barriers to fish migrants at the outlet, inlet or through the culvert barrel. If water depths are too low or <b>water</b> <b>velocities</b> at any of these three culvert locations exceed fish swimming ability, fish may be prevented from reaching their spawning grounds. Since hydraulic efficiency and optimum fish passage requirements are mutually exclusive objectives, compromises must be effected that permit adequate fish protection with maximum economy. Such compromises involve the matching of <b>water</b> <b>velocities</b> with fish swimming performance at design discharges that allow limited delay in fish migrations. Migrating fish must negotiate the culvert outlet, the culvert barrel, and the culvert inlet before successfully passing upstream. Hydraulic conditions, such as <b>water</b> <b>velocities</b> and depths, at {{each one of these}} three locations must be suitable for passage at the highest and lowest stream flows expected during fish migration. Fish need to swim continuously for the entire culvert length when no resting opportunities are available. Culvert length and velocities, as well as maximum distance that fish are able to swim, determine whether fish can pass through a culvert once they enter it...|$|R
