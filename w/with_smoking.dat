5|$|Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinoma, {{which usually}} {{originates}} in peripheral lung tissue. Although most cases of adenocarcinoma are associated <b>with</b> <b>smoking,</b> adenocarcinoma {{is also the}} most common form of lung cancer among people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes ("never-smokers") and ex-smokers with a modest smoking history. A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, is more common in female never-smokers, and may have a better long-term survival.|$|E
5|$|Each {{account is}} {{closed with a}} {{miniature}} woodcut known from {{its position in the}} text as a tail-piece. These small artworks depict aspects of country life, often with humorous subjects, but all with Bewick's eye for detail, style, and precision. Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail-piece for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete <b>with</b> <b>smoking</b> chimney beside a river.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{legislation}} in North Korea has tightened in recent years, {{although it is}} still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing smoking rates. The rules on where people can or cannot smoke are complex, <b>with</b> <b>smoking</b> prohibited on sidewalks, ferries, airplanes and at stations, in health-care and educational facilities, kindergartens and nurseries, shops, theaters, cinemas, culture halls and conference rooms, historic and battle sites, and hotel lobbies. However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} family smoking habits on adolescent smoking experience for information for anti-smoking strategies. Subjects and Methods: We analyzed data from 4776 junior high school students and 5047 high school students responding to the “Survey on Prevention of Life-Style Related Diseases of Children” conducted in Nara Prefecture of Japan in 2004. The chi-square test determined the odds ratios (ORs) for smoking experience rates of the two groups of students according to the smoking habits of their fathers, mothers, older brothers, and older sisters. Logistic regression analysis was also performed for smoking experience according to school year, sex, and family smoking habit. Results: The OR for smoking in junior high school students with a father as the only smoking family member against all other cases was 0. 60, and the OR with a mother as the only smoking family member was 2. 50. The OR <b>with</b> a <b>smoking</b> father against cases <b>with</b> no <b>smoking</b> family members was 1. 23, and the OR <b>with</b> a <b>smoking</b> mother against cases <b>with</b> no <b>smoking</b> family members was 3. 50. The OR for smoking in high school students with a father as the only smoking family member against all other cases was 0. 76, and the OR with a mother as the only smoking family member was 2. 66. The OR <b>with</b> a <b>smoking</b> father against cases <b>with</b> no <b>smoking</b> family members was 1. 59, and the OR <b>with</b> a <b>smoking</b> mother against cases <b>with</b> no <b>smoking</b> family member was 3. 26. All these ORs showed significance. Conclusion: Maternal <b>smoking</b> was associated <b>with</b> a particularly high risk of smoking experience in junior high and high school students. Prevention of maternal smoking should be given high priority to reduce smoking rates in adolescents. 博士（医学）・甲第 624 号・平成 26 年 12 月 3 日© 2014 Morikawa Hideko et al.

5000|$|Cotinine levels <10 ng/mL are {{considered}} to be consistent <b>with</b> no active <b>smoking.</b> Values of 10 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL are associated <b>with</b> light <b>smoking</b> or moderate passive exposure, and levels above 300 ng/mL are seen in heavy smokers - more than 20 cigarettes a day. In urine, values between 11 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL may be associated <b>with</b> light <b>smoking</b> or passive exposure, and levels in active smokers typically reach 500 ng/mL or more. In saliva, values between 1 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL may be associated <b>with</b> light <b>smoking</b> or passive exposure, and levels in active smokers typically reach 100 ng/mL or more. [...] Cotinine assays provide an objective quantitative measure that is more reliable than smoking histories or counting the number of cigarettes smoked per day.

Cigarette smoking increases the risk of Crohn's disease as well as the severity of the course of the disease. It is also the number one cause of bladder cancer. The smoke from tobacco elicits carcinogenic effects on the tissues of the body that are exposed to the smoke.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-20th century psychologists such as Hans Eysenck {{developed}} a personality profile {{for the typical}} smoker of that period; extraversion was associated <b>with</b> <b>smoking,</b> and smokers tended to be sociable, impulsive, risk taking, and excitement-seeking individuals.

During the early stages, smoking provides pleasurable sensations (because of its action on the dopamine system) and thus serves as a source of positive reinforcement. After an individual has smoked for many years, the avoidance of withdrawal symptoms and negative reinforcement become the key motivations. Like all addictive substances, the amount of exposure required to become dependent on nicotine can vary from person to person.|$|E

He was rushed to the local hospital where pneumonia in one lung was treated effectively and efficiently, a fracture near his hip was repaired and he was diagnosed with brain damage.

Cards are also inserted into cigarette packs in Canada. There are sixteen of them, and only one comes in a pack. They explain different methods of quitting smoking. Also, in the United Kingdom, {{there have been a number}} of graphic NHS advertisements, one showing a cigarette filled with fatty deposits, as if the cigarette is symbolizing the artery of a smoker.|$|E
