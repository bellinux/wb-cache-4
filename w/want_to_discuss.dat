I quoted an {{argument}} between historians in which various numbers of casualties were mentioned. One wrote there were 12million victims and another wrote there were 800,000.

Some witnesses do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> certain subjects, leading to a lock symbol appearing over the subject. By showing the witness a magatama, the player is able to see the secret they are trying to hide in the form of locks, called a [...] "Psyche-Lock"; by presenting correct evidence or character profiles, the player can break the locks and be able to discuss the subject.|$|E
