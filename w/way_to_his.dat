5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{spends the}} rest of the episode working in an improv comedy group with Quagmire and Joe. Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} should never have been attempted.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Cromwell {{moved to}} the street in 1647, taking up {{residence}} in Wallingford House. Two years later, Charles I was carried through Whitehall on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> trial at Westminster Hall. Whitehall itself was a wide street and had sufficient space for a scaffold to be erected for the King's execution at Banqueting House. He made a brief speech there before being beheaded. Cromwell died at the Palace of Whitehall in 1658.|$|E

5|$|Bok asked a {{man with}} a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari. The man, a Muslim named Abdah, agreed to help him. Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to {{transport}} Bok to the town of Ed-Da'Ein {{in the back of his}} truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions. Bok stayed with Abdah, his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum, the capital city of Sudan. When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum, Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok. Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money, no place to go, and did not know where to turn. Fortunately for Francis, another stranger helped him find his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the Jabarona settlement.|$|E

5|$|British and Soviet ballistic-missile {{submarines}} are mysteriously disappearing. James Bond—MI6 agent 007—is {{summoned to}} investigate. On the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> briefing, Bond escapes an ambush by Soviet agents in Austria, killing their leader during a downhill ski chase. The {{plans for a}} highly advanced submarine tracking system are being offered in Egypt. There, he encounters Major Anya Amasova—KGB agent Triple X—his rival to recover the microfilm plans. They travel across Egypt together, encountering Jaws – a tall assassin with razor sharp steel teeth – along the way. Bond and Amasova reluctantly join forces after a truce is agreed by their respective British and Soviet superiors. They identify {{the person responsible for}} the thefts as the shipping tycoon and scientist Karl Stromberg.|$|E
5|$|Following his death, Sabbagh and Zahir's sons Abbas and Salih {{were arrested}} by Hasan Pasha's men. The Sublime Porte also seized {{property}} belonging to Zahir, his sons and Sabbagh, which valued at 41,500,000 piasters. They were imprisoned in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital {{along with their}} physician, who {{was known to be}} talented in his profession. The physician was summoned by the sultan to treat his wife's ailment, which he did successfully, earning him his freedom from incarceration and a medal of honor from the sultan. The physician used his influence with the authorities to have Zahir's children and grandchildren released and returned to their hometowns. Sabbagh was executed by Hasan Pasha. Al-Dinkizli was rewarded with the governorship of Gaza, but died on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> new headquarters, likely having been poisoned by Hasan.|$|E
5|$|Now a Crown property, Dunstaffnage was {{controlled}} {{by a series of}} keepers. James I seized the castle in 1431, following the Battle of Inverlochy, as his enemies were hiding inside. In 1455 James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas stayed at Dunstaffnage, on his way to treat with John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles. This followed James II's attack on Douglas power, and led to the signing of the Treaty of Westminster-Ardtornish. A later keeper, John Stewart of Lorn, was a rival of Alan MacDougall, and was stabbed by his supporters on his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> marriage at Dunstaffnage Chapel in 1463, although he survived long enough to make his vows. Although MacDougall took the castle, he was ousted by James III, who granted Dunstaffnage to Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll in 1470.|$|E

5|$|Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett {{vanished}} on his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> grandmother's {{house in}} Longsight, Manchester, {{early in the}} evening of 16 June 1964, four days after his birthday. Hindley lured him into her Mini Pick-up—which Brady was sitting in the back of—by asking for the boy's help in loading some boxes, after which she said she would drive him home. She drove to a lay-by on Saddleworth Moor as she and Brady had previously arranged, and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove. Hindley kept watch, and after about 30minutes or so Brady reappeared, alone and carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier. When Hindley asked how he had killed Bennett, Brady said that he had sexually assaulted the boy and strangled him with a piece of string.|$|E
5|$|Pattle {{had flown}} several patrols {{that morning and}} was {{suffering}} from a high temperature and fever. He had downed a Ju 88 and two Bf 109s on a morning interception to interdict German air operations. One of his victims, a Bf 109 from III./JG 77 crash-landed at Larissa. His success took Pattle's total from 47 to 49. At 17:00 in the afternoon, another raid approached. He was seen, just before an air raid alarm, in the mess, lying on a couch, shivering under the blankets. He was detailed to take a patrol over the lines but during the mission briefing, around 100 German bombers with fighter escort attacked the capital, seeking to attack Allied shipping in the harbour. He ran for the door towards a Hurricane. His adjutant, George Rumsey, tried to stop him, but Pattle was determined to fly. On the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> fighter, he narrowly avoided being killed in a strafing attack by a low-flying Bf 110. He took to the skies minutes later. Pattle climbed to gain altitude and headed for Piraeus Harbour at 20,000 feet.|$|E
5|$|When the Germans {{launched}} {{the invasion of}} Crete on 20 May, Kippenberger, {{like most of the}} defenders of the island, was surprised at the sight of hundreds of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) descending under parachutes. He quickly recovered and was making his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> headquarters, when a burst of gunfire from a paratrooper was directed his way. After twisting his ankle in avoiding the gunfire, he stalked and killed the paratrooper with a shot to the head. His brigade was positioned east of Maleme airfield, on the Galatas plains. It was well positioned to counterattack scattered paratroopers who were beginning to consolidate into a good starting position from which an attack on the airfield could be launched. His request to do so was denied by the acting divisional commander, Brigadier Edward Puttick. An attack launched later without Kippenberger's knowledge failed although he believed the outcome could have been different if his troops had been involved.|$|E
