5|$|Hoover {{directed}} the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC {{as it was}} established (it {{did not have a}} full-time executive director until 1960). The investigations were largely superficial until 1962, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> learned that one of King's most trusted advisers was New York City lawyer Stanley Levison.|$|E
5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; {{he insisted that}} his intentions were peaceful {{and that he had}} suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E
25|$|During the 20072008 school year, F-M {{was again}} in the news <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> was {{consulted}} in an investigation at Fayetteville–Manlius High School.|$|E
5000|$|In 1940, Herrmann {{divorced}} Herbst {{and married}} Ruth Tate. He {{served in the}} United States Coast Guard, enlisting in New Orleans, in World War II. The couple fled the country and went to Mexico, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI's</b> Hiss-investigations began. He was placed under surveillance and questioned many times in Mexico by <b>the</b> <b>FBI.</b>|$|R
50|$|A sting {{operation}} to capture arms dealer Miles Jackson goes awry <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI's</b> inside man double crosses them. Miles rendezvouses {{with his girlfriend}} Erica Kessen, who has a getaway car. Officers Danny Fisher and Hank Carver are dispatched to help <b>the</b> <b>FBI.</b> They look at Jackson's record and see a surveillance video of him dancing with Kessen. An encounter with them at a traffic light leads to her death and Miles being taken away. Miles swears vengeance on Fisher.|$|R
50|$|Michael Smith {{kept his}} secret until 1999, <b>when</b> told <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> about <b>the</b> box. Inquiries with law {{enforcement}} officials in Ohio and Indiana produced the box and remains, which {{had been found in}} 1980 by highway workers in an Indiana field.|$|R
25|$|News {{stories in}} 1999 {{did not mention}} {{anything}} about cipher messages, which were not announced until 12 years later <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> listed the death as a murder, and posted a notice for help on the main page of their website. Investigators believe the notes in McCormick’s pants pockets were written within the three days before his death.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the latest}} Swango {{incident}} {{took place at}} a Veterans Affairs facility, federal authorities got involved. Swango dropped out of sight until mid-1994, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> {{found out he was}} living in Atlanta and working as a chemist at a computer equipment company's wastewater facility. Soon after the FBI alerted the company, Swango was fired for lying on his job application. The FBI obtained a warrant charging Swango with using fraudulent credentials to gain entry to a Veterans Affairs hospital.|$|E
25|$|In 1950 it was {{revealed}} that one of the scientists at Los Alamos, Klaus Fuchs, was providing the Soviet intelligence bureau, NKGB, with secret information about bomb research. Between 1943 and 1946, Fuchs worked at both Columbia and Los Alamos. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> interviewed Bethe and Feynman about their relationship with Fuchs while at Los Alamos, Feynman said Fuchs was quiet, reserved and not inclined to mix with other scientists outside of work. He also said he believed Fuchs was less stand-offish with Ashkin and seemed friendly with him.|$|E
50|$|Whittaker Chambers {{identified}} him to <b>the</b> <b>FBI.</b> Sveshchnikov reported to Soviet Agent handler Boris Bykov. <b>When</b> interviewed by <b>the</b> <b>FBI,</b> De Sveshnikov {{said he was}} first approached by Soviet intelligence in the mid-1920s, and from 1931 to 1938/39, he allegedly furnished Soviet intelligence with industrial and military patents as well as military journals and received regular payments in return.|$|R
50|$|Arthur needs a defender, a man {{of great}} strength, skill, purity, and faith. Fate has given him Hal Woczniak, a broken-down drifter plagued by {{nightmare}} memories of a dead child. <b>When</b> Hal quit <b>the</b> <b>FBI,</b> he practically quit the human race as well.|$|R
50|$|In July 2010, <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> sent {{a letter}} to the Wikimedia Foundation {{demanding}} that it cease and desist from using its seal on Wikipedia. <b>The</b> <b>FBI</b> claimed that such practice was illegal and threatened to sue. In reply, Wikimedia counsel Michael Godwin sent a counter notice to <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> claiming that Wikipedia was not in <b>the</b> wrong <b>when</b> it displayed <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> seal on its website. He defended Wikipedia's actions and also refused to remove the seal.|$|R
25|$|Coppola {{left his}} gun and hat at the murder scene. Since the {{advancement}} of forensics since 1977, a judge ordered Coppola to submit a DNA test. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> requested a DNA sample on August 8, 1996 which could have proved {{he was at the}} murder scene, Coppola fled his Spring Lake, New Jersey home with his wife. He spent most his time moving between apartments in San Francisco and New York City. During his time on the run, he was featured on America's Most Wanted. Although on the run, authorities believed he was still holding power over organized crime in New Jersey as a fugitive. A fellow New Jersey mobster for the Genovese family and a Furmara/Coppola associate, was charged by the FBI with illegally harboring Coppola during the months before he was caught and arrested. In April 2002, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey obtained an indictment against Fiumara for conspiring to assist Coppola in Coppola’s flight. In March 2003, he pleaded guilty to conspiring to conceal and failing to report that he had been in contact with Coppola. In November, a federal judge ordered Fiumara back to prison for eight months for concealing Coppola’s whereabouts.|$|E
500|$|Composer Mark Snow {{described}} his score as possessing a [...] "sense of biblical fervor and religiosity—an elegy—a feeling {{about it that}} was so poignant and touching to me." [...] "My Weakness", a song by Moby from his 1999 album Play, is used in this episode, during the first scene <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> discover the mass grave and near the end when Mulder encounters his sister's spirit. Carter never told Snow about {{the decision to use}} someone else's music, although Snow has since said that his reaction {{to the use of the}} song was very positive and that the song was a [...] "perfect" [...] fit for the scenes in which it can be heard. Another Moby song, [...] "The Sky is Broken" [...] also from Play, would be featured in the late seventh-season episode [...] "all things".|$|E
500|$|As {{the episode}} begins, [...] "Mulder" [...] and Gibson Praise are cornered {{at the edge}} of a {{mountain}} by pursuing agent John Doggett. Suddenly, [...] "Mulder" [...] walks off the edge of the cliff and appears to fall to his death; however, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> agents are sent down to retrieve his body, they find that it has disappeared. Dana Scully realizes that what appeared to be her partner was actually an Alien Bounty Hunter sent to retrieve Praise. The Bounty Hunter, who has returned to the school, continues his search for Praise. Meanwhile, Scully follows a girl, Thea (Christine Firkins), she had previously observed to be Praise's friend throughout the desert until she is able to locate Praise. After Doggett explains the events on the clifftop to Alvin Kersh, Walter Skinner tells him that Kersh is setting him up to fail. Shortly afterwards, the Bounty Hunter (now disguised as agent Scully) attacks Agent Landau. Skinner and the real Scully eventually manage to drive the alien away.|$|E
25|$|Press {{attention}} focused on whether more {{should have been done}} to protect him in prison, and whether his murder was motivated by anti-communism. <b>When</b> Cagle confessed, <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> instructed him to describe the crime as if he and McCoy had been trying to rob Remington.|$|R
5000|$|Al-Libi {{was turned}} over to <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> and held at Bagram Air Base. <b>When</b> talking to <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> interrogators Russell Fincher and Marty Mahon, he seemed [...] "genuinely friendly" [...] and spoke chiefly in English, calling for a {{translator}} only when necessary. He seemed to bond with Fincher, a devout Christian, and the two prayed together and discussed religion at length.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Lee was {{recorded}} on a wiretap speaking with another Taiwanese-American scientist {{who had been}} accused of espionage. Lee offered to the scientist to find out who had turned him in. <b>When</b> confronted by <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> about this incident, Lee {{said he did not know}} the scientist, until <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> demonstrated proof of the conversation. Despite some evidence that could have kept the case open, <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> closed this file on Lee in 1984.|$|R

2500|$|Sante and Kenny were {{suspects}} in the 1995 abduction of 62 year-old Levitz Furniture heiress Jacqueline Levitz {{from her home in}} Vicksburg, Mississippi up until July 1998, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> announced that it had concluded that [...] "There is nothing that would indicate that [...] {{had anything to do with}} Ms. Levitz." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} that in April 2004, Henry Heine found a test tube in the lab containing anthrax and contacted Ivins. In an email sent in reply, Ivins reportedly {{told him it was}} [...] "probably RMR-1029" [...] and for Heine to forward a sample to the FBI. Doubts regarding the reliability of the FBI tests were later raised <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> tested Heine's sample and a further one from Heine's test tube: one tested negative and one positive.|$|E
25|$|Libby {{does not}} dispute that he {{initially}} heard about Mrs. Wilson from Cheney, but {{he claims that}} he had no recollection of that fact <b>when</b> he told <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> in October 2003 and the grand jury in March 2004 that he remembered first learning about Mrs. Wilson in a conversation with NBC’s Tim Russert on July 10, 2003.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s Argent Corporation had {{siphoned}} off between $7 and $15 million using rigged scales. <b>When</b> {{exposed by}} <b>the</b> <b>FBI,</b> this skimming operation {{was the largest}} ever exposed.

2500|$|Tsarnaev {{continued}} to tweet after the bombings, {{and sent a}} tweet telling the people of Boston to [...] "stay safe". He returned to his university after the April 15 bombing and remained there until April 18, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> released pictures of him and Tamerlan at the marathon.

2500|$|... : To avert {{potential}} violence {{arising from}} planned anti-war protests, a government-sponsored rock festival was held near Portland, Oregon from August 28 to September 3, attracting 100,000 participants. The festival, arranged by the People's Army Jamboree (an ad hoc group) and Oregon governor Tom McCall, {{was set up}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> told the governor that President Nixon's planned appearance at an American Legion convention in Portland could lead to violence worse than that seen at 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.|$|E
2500|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> {{learned of}} Adamski's claims, three agents {{were sent to}} talk to Adamski. He denied having stated that the FBI or USAF {{intelligence}} supported his claims (even though his remarks were reported in a local newspaper, the Riverside Enterprise), and he agreed to sign a letter stating that [...] "he understood the implications of making false claims" [...] and that the FBI [...] "did not endorse [...] of individuals." [...] The three FBI agents also signed the letter, and a copy was given to Adamski.|$|E
5000|$|<b>When</b> Christopher meets <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> {{agents at}} <b>the</b> store, he says [...] "Oh, Sheriff of Nottingham, my kingdom for a mortadell'."

My kingdom for a horse!" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> Kulak {{approached}} <b>the</b> <b>FBI,</b> he was {{overweight and}} a heavy drinker. Often during his interviews with FBI agents, Kulak drank from a bottle of scotch, and his frequent inebriation has been cited as evidence {{that he was a}} genuine volunteer for <b>the</b> <b>FBI.</b> Besides providing information about a potential mole, Kulak gave <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> details on Soviet agents, which led to <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> making a number of arrests and imprisonments, adding to the sense that he was a genuine volunteer. Additionally, Kulak told <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> that <b>the</b> KGB's mole in the agency had given the Soviets codes the Americans used in their counter-intelligence work, which would have been a major coup and a closely guarded secret for the Soviets, and which appears to have been true.|$|R
25|$|After being a {{fugitive}} for eight years, Schillaci {{was arrested in}} the town of San José de Gracia, Michoacán on June 5, 2008 without incident. <b>When</b> approached by <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> and Mexican authorities, he confirmed his identity.

2500|$|A {{man with}} the same name as those given by the FBI turned up alive in Saudi Arabia, {{saying that he had}} studied at the University of Denver and his {{passport}} was stolen there in 1995. The name, origin, birth date, and occupation were released by the FBI, but the picture was not of him. [...] "I couldn't believe it <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> put me on their list", he said. [...] "They gave my name and my date of birth, but I am not a suicide bomber. I am here. I am alive. I have no idea how to fly a plane. I {{had nothing to do with}} this." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{folklore}} {{that has}} been passed down throughout the years {{is that of the}} Purple LSD lab. [...] It has been said that sometime in the 70's, a group of chemistry majors living in Purple blocked off some of the alley for a special project. [...] The product of their project, was dubbed [...] "Lloyd-grade" [...] LSD, to denote its extraordinary purity. The rumor goes {{that it was one of}} the largest sources of LSD at the time. [...] Nearly the entire senior class was expelled <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> invaded the house (only three seniors are mentioned in the yearbook from 1970), though folklore also holds that the perpetrators escaped capture, leaving only a teasing banner for the invaders reading [...] "Welcome, FBI!".|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, MIT {{doctoral}} student Ryan Shapiro, collecting {{research on the}} role of the FBI in the Occupy movement, sent the FBI three FOIA requests regarding [...] "a potential plan to gather intelligence against the leaders of [...] and obtain photographs, then formulate a plan to kill the leadership [...] via suppressed sniper rifles." [...] <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> refused the request, Shapiro filed a federal complaint in Washington, D.C., and subsequently obtained 17 pages (most of the requested documentation was ruled withheld due to the possibility to [...] "disclose the identity of a confidential source.") The redacted FBI document confirmed the Houston plot and contradicted an earlier claim by the FBI that it had never opened an investigation on the Occupy movement.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1983, he leaked an FBI {{surveillance}} tape to {{the media}} regarding John DeLorean.
