5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} problem <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> {{is that it}} relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of}} the day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E
5|$|After {{the mixed}} {{reception}} of Hulk, Marvel Studios reacquired the film {{rights to the}} character, and writer Zak Penn began work on a sequel titled The Incredible Hulk. However, Edward Norton rewrote Penn's script after he signed on to star, retelling the origin story in flashbacks and revelations, to help in establishing the film as a reboot; director Louis Leterrier agreed <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach.</b> Leterrier acknowledged that the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America.|$|E
5|$|Flanders felt that, {{to quell}} inflation, wage {{increases}} should {{be tied to}} productivity increases, rather {{than the cost of}} living. He recommended splitting gains in productivity three ways: to the worker for higher wages, to the company for higher profits and to the consumer for lower prices. He felt that <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> everyone would benefit at the company level and in the national economy. Such an approach would require mutual respect and understanding between labor and management.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the film}} on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film Fuck instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson always wanted to call it Fuck, because it succinctly described the film's contents. There were inherent problems <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach,</b> including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers such as LA Weekly. Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre marquees.|$|E
5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real grape juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine grape juice allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real grape juice producers such as Welch Grape Juice Co. and have an advantage over other imitation grape flavored beverage producers. A problem <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> was that Grapico was an artificial grape drink that included neither real grape juice nor fruit from the grape.|$|E
25|$|A {{major concern}} <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> is that NNRTI {{resistance}} mutations are commonly observed in both mothers and infants after single-dose nevirapine, and may compromise {{the response to}} future NNRTI-containing regimens. A short course of maternal zidovudine/lamivudine is recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service Task Force to reduce this risk.|$|E

25|$|In {{such cases}} where the {{ultimate}} target is harder to come by, or limits SAR, it is sometimes possible to source a middle-to-late stage biosynthetic precursor or analogue from which the ultimate target can be prepared.

25|$|This revised CIMS {{establishes}} a modular and scalable framework for consistent response {{at any level}} – from a small, single agency response to a larger, multi-agency response that may require co-ordination at the community or incident level or higher.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to this issue. One {{approach is to}} argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, so we have only {{to be sure that}} a body is far enough away from all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach's principle). Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> is that we might miss something, or account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach {{is to look at the}} way the forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the Jellaz Incident, the French {{authorities}} imposed martial law on Tunis for almost a decade. Within months however, popular discontent manifested itself in the Tunis Tram Boycott. In response the authorities clamped down hard on the Young Tunisian movement several of whose leaders were exiled from the country. After this the movement, which had generally sought to work for the advancement of Tunisia in collaboration with France, became disillusioned <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach.</b> When the leaders returned form exile, they took a different political approach and founded the Destour party in 1920.|$|E
25|$|The problem <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> was {{producing}} enough {{energy in the}} resonators. As the electron passed the opening in the resonator they deposited some of their energy as radio waves, but only a small amount. To generate useful amounts of radio energy, the electrons either had to pass the resonators multiple times to deposit more energy in total, or huge electron currents had to be used. Single-chamber klystrons, like those being used at the time, had to go the latter route, and were difficult to make in a form with useful output given a reasonable input power.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) {{history with}} the ICF program starts with {{physicist}} John Nuckolls, who started considering the problem after a 1957 meeting on the peaceful {{use of nuclear weapons}} arranged by Edward Teller at LLNL.

PACER envisioned the explosion of large hydrogen bombs in large underground caverns to generate steam that would be converted into electrical power.

25|$|Machinability can {{be based}} on the measure of how long a tool lasts. This can be useful when {{comparing}} materials that have similar properties and power consumptions, but one is more abrasive and thus decreases the tool life. The major downfall <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> is that tool life is dependent on more than just the material it is machining; other factors include cutting tool material, cutting tool geometry, machine condition, cutting tool clamping, cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut. Also, the machinability for one tool type cannot be compared to another tool type (i.e. HSS tool to a carbide tool).|$|E
25|$|An {{association}} {{energy of}} 22-25kJ/mol {{is typical of}} charge-induced dipole interactions, {{and so there is}} interest in the use of charged linkers and metals. The metal–hydrogen bond strength is diminished in MOFs, probably due to charge diffusion, so 2+ and 3+ metal ions are being studied to strengthen this interaction even further. A problem <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> is that MOFs with exposed metal surfaces have lower concentrations of linkers; this makes them difficult to synthesize, as they are prone to framework collapse. This may diminish their useful lifetimes as well. Most common strategies to increase this binding energy for MOFs and molecular hydrogen have been reviewed.|$|E
25|$|Toon Boom Animation's Toon Boom Harmony {{software}} {{was used as}} the main software package for the production of the film, as the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) system that Disney developed with Pixar in the 1980s for use on their previous traditionally animated films had become outdated.
