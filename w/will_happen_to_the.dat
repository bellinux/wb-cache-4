5|$|While {{talking to}} the camera, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reveal that Jim was offered an {{entrepreneurial}} sports job by an old college friend based on an idea the two had in college. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because {{it would not be}} good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying that they are more interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that, with work and kids, nothing interesting <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Halperts in a long time.|$|E
25|$|On July 15, 2015, WADL added Grit to 38.2, moving Get TV to 38.3 in the process. This caused The Word Network to be {{temporarily}} {{removed from}} the station' subchannel entirely. The Word Network eventually returned to WADL on September 18 of that year, replacing Antenna TV on 38.4. WADL will add Cozi TV to 38.4 on February 1, 2016, displaced from WMYD 20.2 by Antenna TV. It is unknown what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Word Network's current affiliation on 38.4, but on May 4, 2017, returned The Word Network on a newly-created fifth subchannel, and added Justice Network to the new 38.6 subchannel. WADL also added the simulcast of WFDF-AM (audio only) to the new 38.7 subchannel, on May 26, 2017.|$|E

These acts (of intentional animal cruelty or non-accidental injury) may be indicators of serious psychological problems. According to the American Humane Association, 13% of intentional animal abuse cases involve domestic violence. As many as 71% of pet-owning women seeking shelter at safe houses have reported that their partner had threatened and/or actually hurt or killed {{one or more of}} their pets; 32% of these women reported that one or more of their children had also hurt or killed pets. Battered women report that they are prevented from leaving their abusers because they fear what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> animals in their absence. Animal abuse is sometimes used as a form of intimidation in domestic disputes.|$|E

In an interview at the time, Bush said he was trying to re-record vocals for some of the songs that had already been recorded.|$|E
500|$|Other {{evidence}} has surfaced illustrating Mölders' ambiguous {{relationship with the}} National Socialist regime. Mölders {{may have been in}} contact with bishop Clemens August Graf von Galen, who was highly critical of the Nazi regime. Von Galen publicly criticised the regime for the Gestapo's tactics and the deportation and euthanasia of the mentally ill. According to the diary kept by Heinrich Portmann, von Galen's secretary and chaplain, Mölders threatened to return his awards if von Galen's euthanasia accusation turned out to be true. Furthermore, Portmann stated that Hitler had asked Mölders during the presentation of the Diamonds to the Knight's Cross if there was anything he wished for. Mölders reportedly responded, [...] "Please leave the bishop of Münster alone." [...] Hitler assured him that [...] "Yes, nothing <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bishop of Münster." [...] The MGFA concluded in 2004 that this story was most likely false. The MGFA revised its position again on 28 June 2007, concluding that there had been contact between Mölders and von Galen.|$|E

500|$|In 1982 Sheldon Jaffery and Roy Torgeson {{met with}} Weinberg to propose taking over as licensees, but Weinberg {{decided not to}} pursue the offer. [...] The {{following}} year, Brian Forbes approached Weinberg with another offer. Forbes' company, the Bellerophon Network, was an imprint of a Los Angeles company named The Wizard. [...] Ashley reports that Weinberg was only able to contact Forbes by phone, and even that was not always reliable, so negotiations were slow. [...] Forbes' editorial director was Gordon Garb and the fiction editor was Gil Lamont; Forrest Ackerman also assisted, mainly by obtaining material to include. [...] There {{was a good deal}} of confusion between the various participants in the project: according to Locus, a science fiction trade journal, [...] "Ackerman says he has had no contact with publisher Forbes, does not know what <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> material he put together, and is as much in the dark as everybody else. [...] Lamont says that he is still renegotiating his contract and is not sure where he stands". The original plan was for the first issue to appear in August 1984, dated July/August, but before it appeared the decision was taken to change the contents, and a new, completely reset issue finally appeared {{at the end of the}} year, dated Fall 1984. [...] Even with this delay a final agreement had not yet been reached with Weinberg over licensing. [...] Only 12,500 copies were printed; these were sent to two distributors who both went into bankruptcy. [...] As a result, few copies were sold, and Forbes was not paid by the distributors. [...] Despite the financial setback, Forbes attempted to continue, and a second issue eventually appeared. [...] Its cover date was Winter 1985 but it was not published until June 1986. [...] Few copies were printed; reports vary between 1,500 and 2,300 in total. [...] Mark Monsolo was the fiction editor, but Garb continued as editorial director; Lamont was no longer involved with the magazine.|$|E
