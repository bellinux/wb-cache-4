5|$|With the Coinage Act of 1873, {{the dollar}} {{was no longer}} {{equivalent}} to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that {{as the price of}} silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining companies could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> as money than they were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver—the dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for the melting pot above $1.38 per ounce.|$|E

5|$|Construction of Selfe's {{version of}} the Sydney harbour bridge never started due to an {{economic}} slowdown and a change of government at the 1904 state election. Much to Selfe's outrage, the Department of Public Works kept his calculations and drawings, and also copied and printed them. Eventually in 1907, the department contacted Selfe {{and asked him to}} collect his drawings, but refused to return the calculations. Selfe was never given the £1,100 prize, nor was he paid for his subsequent work which he estimated to be <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than £20,000.|$|E
5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias {{has increased the}} profitability of slow loris hunting and driven many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, slow lorises are shaken out of trees and then bludgeoned {{to death with a}} stick. In Indonesia, slow lorises are <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of gold in California, {{a large amount of}} gold coins began appearing in American commercial channels. The influx caused the price of gold relative to silver to decrease, making silver coins <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> as bullion than as currency. They were exported abroad, or else melted locally for their bullion value. As it was profitable to export silver, little was presented at the Mint, which resulted in low mintage numbers for the silver dollar; 1,300 and 1,100 were struck in 1851 and 1852 respectively. The rarity of these dates was recognized by the late 1850s; Mint employees made surreptitious restrikes to sell to collectors.|$|E

5|$|With the {{indigenous}} groups {{closer to the}} Caribbean Coast, the people traded highly valuable sea snails.

5|$|Despite {{its lack}} of {{commercial}} success {{when it was first}} released, the C5 gained an unexpected degree of cult status in the later years. Collectors began purchasing them as investment items, reselling them for considerably more than their original retail price. One such investor, Adam Harper, bought 600 C5s from a film company as a speculative investment in 1987. He sold all but four within two years, selling them to customers who wanted a novel or more environmentally friendly form of transportation. He also found willing customers among drivers who had been banned from the road, as the C5 did not need a driving licence or vehicle tax. According to Harper, C5s could be resold for as much as £2,500 – more than six times the original retail price. By 1996, a Special Edition C5 in its original box was reported to be <b>worth</b> <b>more</b> than £5,000 to collectors.|$|E
