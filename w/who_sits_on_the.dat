25|$|In a vocal recital, {{a concert}} team may {{have one or}} more vocalists as the {{principal}} performer(s). Instruments, such as the Saraswati veena and/or venu flute, can be occasionally found as a rhythmic accompaniment, but usually, a vocalist {{is supported by a}} violin player (who sits on his/her left). The rhythm accompanist is usually a mridangam player (<b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side, facing the violin player). However, other percussion instruments such as the ghatam, kanjira and morsing frequently also accompany the main percussion instrument and play in an almost contrapuntal fashion along with the beats.|$|E

500|$|In the morning, they {{escape to}} Harry's house, where Victoria unsuccessfully {{attempts}} to contact Captain Kell. Hannay, alone, meets with Sir George, <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defence committee. Hannay reveals {{the contents of}} the notebook, leading to Sir George disclosing that a meeting of the National Committee of Defence is being held the next day at Stirling Castle to unveil new naval plans, matching part of the double code. Later, Hannay and Victoria kiss, and the next morning he sees her leaving with a man, whom he recalls seeing previously on the train and at the rally. With the notebook missing and finding out that Victoria disconnected the call she made to the Secret Service Bureau before it was connected, Hannay goes to Stirling Castle, believing Victoria to be a traitor. There, Victoria reveals she works for the Secret Service Bureau and he meets Kell (Alex Jennings) and Wakeham, the man Victoria left with earlier (Steven Elder), who reveal they used Hannay to distract the Germans and sent Victoria {{to keep an eye on}} him. Hannay deduces that Sir George is the traitor, as he should have heard them when he was at Fisher's House, and, with his photographic memory, has escaped with the naval plans memorised. To identify his rendezvous point with the Germans, they crack the remaining code, referring to the room they were previously imprisoned in at Longkeep Castle, and discover [...] "39 steps" [...] written in the notebook by Scudder using invisible ink. At the Castle, Hannay and Victoria find 39 steps leading to a loch. A shoot-out ensues, and a German U-boat surfaces in the loch. Fisher, the Germans and Sir George fail to get to the U-boat before it submerges, and surrender.|$|E

[Footnote 1: The {{following}} anecdote {{related by}} Mr. Coleridge, in April, 1811, was preserved and communicated {{to me by}} Mr. Justice Coleridge:--"As I was descending from Mount AEtna with a very lively talkative guide, we passed through a village (I think called) Nicolozzi, when the host happened to be passing through the street. Every one was prostrate; my guide became so; and, not to be singular, I went down also. After resuming our journey, I observed in my guide an unusual seriousness and long silence, which, after many hums and hahs, {{was interrupted by a}} low bow, and leave requested to ask a question. This was of course granted, and the ensuing dialogue took place. Guide. [...] "Signor, are you then a Christian?" [...] Coleridge. [...] "I hope so." [...] G. [...] "What! are all Englishmen Christians?" [...] C. [...] "I hope and trust they are." [...] G. [...] "What! are you not Turks? Are you not damned eternally?" [...] C. [...] "I trust not, through Christ." [...] G. [...] "What! you believe in Christ then?" [...] C. [...] "Certainly." [...] This answer produced another long silence. At length my guide again spoke, still doubting the grand point of my Christianity. G. [...] "I'm thinking, Signor, {{what is the difference between}} you and us, that you are to be certainly damned?" [...] C. [...] "Nothing very material; nothing that can prevent our both going to heaven, I hope. We believe in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost." [...] G. (interrupting me) [...] "Oh those damned priests! what liars they are! But (pausing) we can't do without them; we can't go to heaven without them. But tell me, Signor, what are the differences?" [...] C. [...] "Why, for instance, we do not worship the Virgin." [...] G. [...] "And why not, Signor?" [...] C. [...] "Because, though holy and pure, we think her still a woman, and, therefore, do not pay her the honour due to God." [...] G. [...] "But do you not worship Jesus, <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right hand of God?" [...] C. [...] "We do." [...] G. [...] "Then why not worship the Virgin, <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left?" [...] C. [...] "I did not know she did.
