50|$|Implementation {{has been}} difficult, with years {{sometimes}} passing between legislation passage and initial regulations. Superfund {{was passed in}} December 1980, just before Reagan took office. The first administrator of Superfund was Rita Lavelle {{who had worked for}} a major hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>generator.</b> The result was that her implementation of Superfund was designed mainly to delay regulation, and the subsequent controversy resulted in the resignation of Lavelle, EPA administrator Anne Burford, and several other top EPA personnel. In 1986, Congress passed the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, increasing funding to $9 billion and providing for studies and new technologies. By 1995, Superfund cleanup still took an average of twelve years per site, and costs for each site can range in the billions of dollars. Superfund, while showing improvements, has been probably the most criticized of environmental programs based on costs of remediation, implementation problems, and the questionable seriousness of the problems it addresses.|$|E
40|$|Recurring waste {{management}} noncompliance problems have spurred a fundamental site-wide process revision to characterize and disposition wastes at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The reengineered method, termed <b>Waste</b> <b>Generator</b> Services, will streamline the waste acceptance process and provide waste generators comprehensive {{waste management}} services through a single, accountable organization {{to manage and}} disposition wastes in a timely, cost-effective, and compliant manner. This report outlines the strategy for implementing <b>Waste</b> <b>Generator</b> Services across the INEEL. It documents the culmination of efforts worked by the LMITCO Environmental Management Compliance Reengineering project team since October 1997. These efforts have included defining {{problems associated with the}} INEEL waste management process; identifying commercial best management practices; completing a review of DOE Complex-wide waste management training requirements; and involving others through an Integrated Process Team approach to provide recommendations on process flow, funding/charging mechanisms, and WGS organization.

40|$|What is {{the cost}} of {{off-site}} hazardous waste disposal? In addition to paying for disposal fees and shipments costs, <b>generators</b> of hazardous <b>waste</b> can potentially be held liable for the cost of cleanup if the waste disposal site contaminates the environment after closure or abandonment and thus falls under the federal or state Superfund legislation. This paper empirically examines the sensitivity of individual hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>generators</b> to these categories of costs, exploiting the variation across states in factors influencing disposal costs, and {{in the structure of the}} liability imposed on <b>waste</b> <b>generators</b> under certain circumstances by state laws. We fit nested logit models to predict the waste management method (incineration or landfill disposal) and the state of destination for shipments of halogenated solvent waste used for metal cleaning in manufacturing and reported in the Toxic Release Inventory in 1988 – 1990. <b>Waste</b> <b>generators</b> respond to transportation costs and to proxies for current disposal costs. Generators also find the concurrent presence of strict and joint-and-several liability a deterrent, but this deterrent effect does not vary with the wealth of the firm or the volume of the waste shipped.

40|$|After {{opening the}} Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) for the {{permanent}} disposal of transuranic (TRU) waste on March 26, 1999, the Department of Energy (DOE) Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO) and DOE Headquarters launched a major initiative {{to assess and}} recommend modifications to the national transuranic waste system.

The project to compile the inventory {{is referred to as}} the recent and projected data task. The inventory was compiled primarily for use in a baseline risk assessment under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.

The inventory is based on waste information that was available in facility operating records, technical and programmatic reports, shipping records, and <b>waste</b> <b>generator</b> forecasts.
