500|$|In a {{motel room}} in Roswell, New Mexico, Mulder and Scully prepare for bed and talk. Mulder {{explains}} his belief [...] "that the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to us as part of something greater than us—greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless now, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> if we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves." [...] Despite their slim chance for success, Mulder declares, [...] "Maybe there's hope." ...|$|E
500|$|As writers Carter and Frank Spotnitz {{aimed to}} avoid complicating the storyline of [...] with {{superfluous}} appearances of characters {{from the television}} series, Skinner is the only returning character in the movie. He {{was included in the}} film's plot only when a fitting opportunity to involve him arose, and Spotnitz and Carter were very happy to write Skinner into the story. The scenes of The X-Files: I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> <b>that</b> include Skinner were filmed very late in the movie's filming schedule, and the particular scene that acts as the character's introduction in the movie was filmed, for reasons of time, in two different locations.|$|E
500|$|Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians {{has been the}} subject of {{constant}} panning by critics since its inception. Brian Lowry, reviewing the show for Variety, said that the network: [...] "widens its lens to encompass the whole irritating brood — including Kim's sisters Khloé and Kourtney, mom-manager Kris and stepdad Bruce Jenner, who now has the distinction of having two sets of useless rich kids featured in pointless reality shows." [...] Ginia Bellafonte of The New York Times compared the show to reality series Gene Simmons Family Jewels and exclaimed that: [...] "the Kardashian show is not about an eccentric family living conventionally; it is purely about some desperate women climbing to the margins of fame, and that feels a lot creepier." [...] Laura Burrows of IGN criticized the family for being too self-seeking and using the given platform only to gain more notoriety for themselves. Following the conclusion of the second season of the series, Burrows wrote: [...] "Those of us who watch this show [...] <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> these whores of attention have souls and would actually do something for their fellow man and not reap the benefits of their service, but two seasons' worth of self-absorbed egocentrism speaks to the contrary." ...|$|E

60|$|Looking {{at her and}} {{listening}} to her the man beside her could not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> depravity of any sort or degree entered into the girl's nature, yet he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{she had not been}} virtuous, for otherwise his task was less a sinecure--the Hon. Morison was not entirely without conscience.|$|R
5000|$|Flash Thompson, not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> his idol was [...] "Puny Parker", {{convinced}} {{himself that}} Peter was merely covering for Spider-Man and goaded {{him into a}} dodgeball fight. Peter, no longer needing to protect his identity, made quick work of Flash by kicking the ball into his face and knocking him out.|$|R
2500|$|In a June 2012 {{interview}} at her Kenyan home, Sarah Obama was asked: [...] "Some people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{the president was}} born in Kenya. Have these people ever bothered you or asked for his birth certificate?" [...] Her response was: [...] "But Barack Obama wasn’t born in Kenya." ...|$|E
2500|$|When he was 14, the Spanish tennis {{federation}} {{requested that}} he leave Mallorca {{and move to}} Barcelona to continue his tennis training. Nadal's family turned down this request, partly because they feared it would hurt his education, but also because Toni said that [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{you have to go}} to America, or other places to be a good athlete. You can do it from your home." [...] The decision to stay home meant that Nadal received less financial support from the federation; instead, Nadal's father covered the costs. In May 2001, he defeated former Grand Slam tournament champion Pat Cash in a clay-court exhibition match.|$|E
2500|$|Scrooge {{is a very}} {{misunderstood}} person. In {{his early}} years, he was very kind and polite. But the 'slaps' of society from cruel people, {{as well as the}} ungratefulness those who he had helped to overcome their problems, made Scrooge a cruel, selfish, and powerful man. [...] Feeling that he had been taken advantage of, he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> others had real problems or difficulties in their lives. [...] This made him seem obnoxious at best, and heartless at worst. [...] As a result, no one could understand his problems, including his nephew, and his great-nephews. This isolation paved the path to acquiring untold wealth and power. But despite it all, he still has a good heart, and will help those he sees as distressed or troubled.|$|E
5000|$|She still <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{her country}} {{was the best}} place in the world. The beliefs she had {{cherished}} for a lifetime would be vindicated. But now she couldn't deny what was staring her plainly in the face: dogs in China ate better than doctors in North Korea. Nothing to Envy ...|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} shot at {{me during}} the meeting rankled still; I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Krebs had inspired it, and her championship of him gave me a twinge of jealousy,--the slightest twinge, to be sure, yet a perceptible one. At the same time, the unaccountable liking I had for the man stirred to life. The act she described had been so characteristic.|$|R
2500|$|... "We <b>want,</b> or <b>wanted,</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> without love {{we would}} disappear, that love, somehow, would save us that, yeah, {{if we have}} love, give love and know love, we are truly alive {{and if there is}} no love, there would be no life. The Terror is, we know now, that even without love, life goes on... we just go on... there is no mercy killing." ...|$|R
2500|$|Suddenly {{realising}} that Gustave is missing, Christine {{recalls that}} she {{had asked him to}} wait backstage for Raoul, but she does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Raoul may have taken the boy. Furious, the Phantom vows to kill the [...] "drunken fool," [...] but Squelch informs him that he saw the Vicomte leave alone. The Phantom then suspects Madame Giry, because of her attitude towards him before Christine's number, and proceeds to threaten Giry when she is brought to him by Squelch and Gangle. Madame Giry confesses that she knew about Gustave's true parentage, but denies abducting the boy. Fleck reports that she was passing Meg's dressing room, where she saw that the mirror has shattered, and Meg is now nowhere to be found. Christine fears for her child's life, but Madame Giry assures her that Meg would never hurt Gustave. The Phantom believes he knows where Meg has gone ("Gustave, Gustave").|$|E
6000|$|For {{an instant}} Victor hesitated, {{then took the}} leap. [...] "Well, yes, I am, but then you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> report; it's {{more than half a}} lie." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed to}} be making very lame excuses, and James {{did not look at}} her. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> she was really {{avoiding}} them--it would mean too much.|$|E
60|$|Now Happy Jack {{knew just}} what he would like <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> He would like <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Farmer Brown's boy had taken Shadow away and made an end of him. And because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> it wasn't very hard <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it. There was the empty cage. Of course Farmer Brown's boy wouldn't {{have gone to the}} trouble of {{trapping}} Shadow unless he intended {{to get rid of him}} for good.|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I love you. But I can't go on {{with this}} deceit. I'd sooner shoot myself.|$|R
30|$|The {{survey results}} {{revealed}} that the lowest participant scores were {{from those in the}} age group of 31 – 40  years, with between 5 and 10  years of experience in organizational culture. Because the auditors in this age group were facing promotional pressure at this critical stage in their career, they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> most problems could be solved through hard work. Employees hope that their organizations can focus on personal achievements.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> you are glad," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{have been}} restless ever since you left. Tell me at once, {{what did they}} say to you here?" ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{a terrible}} flaw in the trust: {{she was afraid of}} any hasty movement, as men are who hold {{something}} precious and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it is not broken.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{an appeal}} in Anthea's voice. [...] "Can't you say {{anything}} that will drive out what I think?" [...] she asked. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I could not have heard or understood aright." ...|$|E
50|$|Tryon {{is called}} back to Patesville on {{business}} and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> see Rena again. He is {{still in love with}} her and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> her family history is a lie. Although Rena refuses to dance at the party, her mother convinces her to dance with Wain. Tryon arrives at the house {{just in time to see}} the couple dancing. He is hurt to find that Rena appears to be happy rather than being depressed and pining for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no {{deception}} in it really. I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> if I am here, like this, to-day, it is {{not from}} fear. It is not!" ...|$|R
50|$|Ellis's Orion {{character}} {{claimed to}} have been managed by one Colonel Mac Weiman, and have been born in Ribbonsville, Tennessee on December 31, 1931. Listeners of Orion were initially split into two camps: those who knew that Orion was Ellis just having some fun sounding like Presley, and others who sincerely <b>believed</b> or <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he was truly Presley coming back on the scene after faking his own death. As Orion, Ellis reached Billboards country chart with nine singles.|$|R
60|$|Miss Ophelia {{noticed it}} too, {{and tried to}} make Mr. St. Clare see it. But he would not. He loved his little Eva so much, that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{anything}} could be the matter with her.|$|E
6000|$|The doctor {{suddenly}} {{gave way}} to a botryoidal hilarity. [...] "To think that one should be consulted about visions of God--in Mount Street!" [...] he said. [...] "And you know, you know you half <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> vision was real. You know you do." ...|$|E
60|$|Remembering {{the remarks}} {{which had been}} made about her by her friend Edith, I could not but admit {{that she was a}} very fine girl, {{combining}} a great many attractive qualities, but I rebelled against every conviction I had in regard to her. I did not want to think about her admirable qualities. I did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> in time they would impress me more forcibly than they did now. I did not want people to imagine that I would come to be so impressed. If I stayed there I might almost look upon her in the light of a duty.|$|E
2500|$|In a January 2011 interview, in {{response}} to the 2011 Tucson shooting, Bennington said, [...] "There's a non-violent way to express yourself and get your point across—regardless of what you're saying or what your point is. In a free society, people have a right <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> whatever they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>That's</b> their business and they can speak their mind... but nobody, even in a free society, has the right to take another person's life. Ever. That's something that we really need to move beyond." ...|$|R
25|$|Willy Loman desperately <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he has succeeded, {{that he is}} “well liked” as a great salesman, a fine father, and {{a devoted}} husband. That he has not really {{attracted}} the admiration and popularity at which he has aimed is evident, however, in the weariness that belabors him {{from the beginning of}} the play. Nearing retirement he suffers a drastic decrease in sales work, a dissatisfying marriage, and a turbulent relationship with his sons which inexorably leads to his suicide with the justification that the insurance will finally provide for his family.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean, Grace. A {{woman in her}} {{position}} {{ought to be more}} circumspect than any other woman, if she <b>wants</b> people <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> her husband treated her badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To help you!" [...] he said, eagerly. [...] "For that alone! To do all I can {{to assist}} you, {{if you really}} believe, and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>that</b> you have another. To ask you to confide in me; to tell me all you have been told, all that you know, think you know, or WANT to know about your {{relationship}} to the Arguellos--or to--any one. And then to devote myself entirely to proving what you shall say is your desire. You see, I am frank with you, Yerba. I only ask you to be as frank with me; {{to let me know}} your doubts, that I may counsel you; your fears, that I may give you courage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! {{do not ask}} me that.... Tell me--you see we've so much to talk about, Stephen--tell me of all you {{are going}} to do. Everything. Because I've got to make a great vow of renunciation--of you. Not to think again--not even to think of you again.... No, no. I'm not even to look for you in the papers any more. There's to be no tricks this time. And so you see I want to fill up my mind with you. To store myself with you. Tell me your work is worth it--that it's not like the work of everyone. Tell me, Stephen--that. I want to believe that--tremendously. Don't be modest now. That will be cruel.

2500|$|The Chaldean astrologer Beleses {{predicts the}} {{downfall}} of Sardanapalus, then meets the satrap Arbaces and plots the king's murder with him. Salemenes enters and tries forcibly to arrest both men, but Sardanapalus arrives unexpectedly and, not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Beleses and Arbaces could be traitors, breaks up the struggle. Salemenes and the king leave, and Arbaces, shamed by the king's clemency, momentarily abandons his regicidal intentions. A messenger arrives from the king, telling the two satraps {{to return to their}} respective provinces without their troops. Beleses <b>believes</b> this <b>to</b> be the prelude to a death sentence. Arbaces agrees: ...|$|R
