5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men <b>were</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they <b>were</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month <b>were</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers <b>were</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> belong to the Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors <b>were</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had {{to take an oath}} of loyalty and obedience to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E
