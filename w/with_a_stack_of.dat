The demos were completed and mixed by Norton on his own at Backbeach Studios. The double album was compiled using unreleased material from 8 Miles High, The Prize Recruit and IRCR eras as well as the unheard new demos. Norton also added a track called [...] "The Road" [...] that was written in collaboration with Cam Baines of Bodyjar and Phil Rose of Nursery Crimes. Baines recorded the vocals for this track in Norton’s “Cabin in the woods” in a remote part of Victoria. [...] "The Road" [...] opens the album followed by four of the new demo tracks and a number of rareities including the title track of the 2000 EP 8 Miles High that was omitted from the original release. In November 2004 the posthumous compilation album, New, Rare, Live, was released by Shock Records as a 2-CD set. Artwork was contributed by Melbourne designer Richard DeSilva who also worked with the band on Identical Remote Controlled Reactions.|$|E

2500|$|Suddenly, Sisko {{transitions}} entirely {{into his}} vision, becoming Benny Russell, an African-American science fiction writer in 1950s New York City. Russell {{writes for the}} science fiction magazine Incredible Tales, {{and most of the}} people he encounters bear the likeness of people from Sisko's life on the station. On the way to work, Russell buys the latest edition of Galaxy, their competitor, from a local newsboy (Aron Eisenberg/Nog). He then runs into his coworker Albert Macklin (Colm Meaney/O'Brien), and the two walk to work together. There, short-tempered liberal writer Herbert Rossoff (Armin Shimerman/Quark) argues with magazine editor Douglas Pabst (René Auberjonois/Odo) over donuts, while writers Kay Eaton, a.k.a. K.C. Hunter, (Nana Visitor/Kira) and Julius Eaton (Alexander Siddig/Bashir) banter in the background. The magazine's illustrator Roy Ritterhouse (J. G. Hertzler/Martok) then arrives <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> sketches for the next edition. Russell is particularly drawn to a sketch of a space station much like Deep Space 9, and decides to write a story for it. When Pabst announces the next edition will include photos of the staff, he suggests Kay [...] "sleep late" [...] that morning, as the public would not respond well to the revelation she is a woman. Russell realizes he also will not be included, which Pabst confirms. Rossoff objects, but Pabst stands firm, choosing to conform to the prevailing public opinion.|$|E
2500|$|After {{proceeding}} to Manassas Junction, Virginia by railroad, on July 8, 1861, with an escort of about 12 men from Fairfax, Virginia, Taylor set out under a {{flag of truce}} toward the Union Army headquarters of Major General Irvin McDowell at Arlington, Virginia, [...] presumably to ultimately present the dispatches to President Lincoln. About seven miles from Arlington, Taylor was met by Union Colonel, soon to be Brigadier General, Andrew Porter, a comrade from the Mexican-American War and First Lieutenant, later Brigadier General, William W. Averell. After some personal conversation between Taylor and Porter, a Union cavalry escort took Taylor to Arlington, where they found McDowell was out. Taylor {{was taken to the}} office of U.S. Army General-in-Chief, Brevet Lieutenant General Winfield Scott in Washington when Scott learned of his mission and that McDowell was not present to receive him. Scott sent the dispatches to President Lincoln. Scott served wine and champagne while they waited for a reply. Due to the late hour, after 10:00p.m., Lincoln sent no reply. Scott sent Taylor back to Major General Irvin McDowell for more hospitality and to stay the night, promising that he would send a reply from Lincoln promptly. After breakfast and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> northern newspapers, Taylor and his party were escorted back to the Confederate lines. Lincoln never responded to Davis's messages. However, he did not enforce the stated policy of hanging privateers as pirates.|$|E
2500|$|In April, Orwell {{returned}} to Barcelona. Wanting {{to be sent}} to the Madrid front, which meant he [...] "must join the International Column", he approached a Communist friend attached to the Spanish Medical Aid and explained his case. [...] "Although he did not think much of the Communists, Orwell was still ready to treat them as friends and allies. That would soon change." [...] This was the time of the Barcelona May Days and Orwell was caught up in the factional fighting. He spent much of the time on a roof, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> novels, but encountered Jon Kimche from his Hampstead days during the stay. The subsequent campaign of lies and distortion carried out by the Communist press, in which the POUM was accused of collaborating with the fascists, had a dramatic effect on Orwell. Instead of joining the International Brigades as he had intended, he decided to return to the Aragon Front. Once the May fighting was over, he was approached by a Communist friend who asked if he still intended transferring to the International Brigades. Orwell expressed surprise that they should still want him, because according to the Communist press he was a fascist. [...] "No one who was in Barcelona then, or for months later, will forget the horrible atmosphere produced by fear, suspicion, hatred, censored newspapers, crammed jails, enormous food queues and prowling gangs of armed men." ...|$|E

2500|$|If one has {{a source}} of heat at {{temperature}} [...] and cooler heat sink at temperature , the maximum theoretically possible value for the ratio of work (or electric power) obtained to heat supplied is , given by a Carnot heat engine. If we take 6000K for {{the temperature of the}} sun and 300K for ambient conditions on earth, this comes to 95%. In 1981, Alexis de Vos and Herman Pauwels showed that this is achievable <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> an infinite number of cells with band gaps ranging from infinity (the first cells encountered by the incoming photons) to zero, with a voltage in each cell very close to the open-circuit voltage, equal to 95% of the band gap of that cell, and with 6000K blackbody radiation coming from all directions. However, the 95% efficiency thereby achieved means that the electric power is 95% of the net amount of light absorbed – the stack emits radiation as it has non-zero temperature, and this radiation has to be subtracted from the incoming radiation when calculating the amount of heat being transferred and the efficiency. They also considered the more relevant problem of maximizing the power output for a stack being illuminated from all directions by 6000K blackbody radiation. In this case, the voltages must be lowered to less than 95% of the band gap (the percentage is not constant over all the cells). They found that the maximum power was 86.8% of the amount of in-coming radiation. When the in-coming radiation comes only from an area of the sky the size of the sun, the efficiency limit drops to 68.7%.|$|E

The scenes between her and her ex start with a private meeting between the two in the library, scenes where she is finding a place by herself without him in the library, to the awkward scene of finding him across the room from her. Swift hides behind a book she's holding when she notices her ex, then looks away pulling on her clothes and plays with her hair, in the attempt of not making him notice her. She doesn't notice that he noticed her too, later in the video, and was trying to avoid her too. They both eventually catch each other looking and they awkwardly try to give each other a silent and distant [...] "Hi" [...] as the video cuts to a scene where we see a girl who first pulls Swift's ex into a make out, then pulls away as the librarian passes by. When the librarian passes, Swift's ex pulls the girl back and kisses her again. This cheating caused the fall out between Swift and the guy. Swift eventually gives the first [...] "Hi" [...] which he returns and both get up to confront the other. The video ends with a break out of the other classmates and staff joining in, the classmates throwing away their papers and they and the staff begin dancing to the song while both Swift and her ex are face to face with each other in a very awkward moment, both trying to say how the other feels, but eventually they both shrug at each other and walk away. The last shot is of Swift closing the book of [...] "The Story of Us".|$|E

Highly disordered Î²bc-nickel hydroxide comprises of an intergrowth of Î±-phase of nickel hydroxide in Î²-nickel hydroxide. These disorders introduce a significant changes in their structure composition and morphological features in contrast to crystalline phase of Î²-nickel hydroxide. The tap densities of all these nickel hydroxide samples were investigated. Electrochemical performance of crystalline phase Î²-nickel hydroxide with high tap density exchanges 0. 3 e/Ni while nickel hydroxide samples with stacking disorder or compositional disorder exchanges 0. 8 - 0. 9 e/Ni. These samples have lower tap densities compared to crystalline Î²-nickel hydroxide. The results clearly show that the better electrochemical activity is mainly dictated by the structural disorder and is not associated to tap density of nickel hydroxide. Â© 2008 Elsevier B. V.
