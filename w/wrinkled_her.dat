60|$|Betty's {{forehead}} was <b>wrinkled.</b> <b>Her</b> eyes wore a far-away expression.|$|E
60|$|She <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> brows in {{a puzzled}} frown, and her colour deepened.|$|E
60|$|Mary Phillips <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> {{forehead}} and gazed steadfastly into her lap. Suddenly she looked up.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gannett, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> forehead, {{eyed the}} marvellous bird curiously.|$|R
60|$|Miss Naylor stared, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> nose, {{and holding}} the {{scissors}} wide apart....|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce {{leaned back}} in her chair smiling, and <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> fine, thin nose.|$|R
60|$|The {{figure of}} the girl seated in the big {{armchair}} did not stir. Her lips pouted contemptuously, a frown <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> forehead.|$|E
60|$|Jill <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> forehead. That odd {{familiar}} {{look was}} in his eyes again. But memory failed to respond. She shook her head.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth leaned towards him. She {{was very}} loth indeed to {{acknowledge}} defeat. Once more {{her voice was}} deliciously soft, her forehead delicately <b>wrinkled,</b> <b>her</b> blue eyes filled with alluring light.|$|E
60|$|LADY ELLA. Her clothes must be ruined. That pond--ugh! [She <b>wrinkles</b> <b>her</b> nose] Tommy, do have it drained.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{that you}} say, Tommy?" [...] {{interrupted}} old Martha, putting {{her hand to}} <b>her</b> ear and <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> brow interrogatively.|$|R
60|$|Taking out his pouch, {{he rolled}} a cigarette. The white young man bent his dull wink on Thyme, who, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> nose, was {{pretending to be}} far away.|$|R
60|$|The lady {{in black}} satin {{appeared}} undecided. She looked from Anna, who {{was far too}} nice-looking to be travelling about alone, to that reassuring pile of luggage, and <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> brows thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|Willard {{unlocked}} the door and showed Miss Sally over the place. Miss Sally poked and pried and sniffed and <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> forehead, and finally stood on the stairs and delivered her ultimatum.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Bellew {{had passed}} {{so close that}} the skirt of her seagreen dress brushed their feet with a swish, and a scent as of a flower-bed was wafted from it. Mrs. Pendyce <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> nose.|$|E
60|$|In the Crescent gardens Stella {{herself was}} sitting on a camp stool, sketching. He stole up close behind. How fair and pretty she was, bent diligently, holding up <b>her</b> brush, measuring, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> brows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, papa," [...] said Clara that morning, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> brows {{and putting}} her finger-tips {{together}} with the air of an experienced person of business, [...] "I {{want to have a}} talk to you about money matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Her room's {{much the}} best in the house; it's airy, and it looks out over someone's garden. I suppose she stays there because it's so cheap. The Hughs' rooms are---" [...] She stopped, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> {{straight}} nose.|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "old one," [...] who was, {{as we have}} said, as deaf as a post, <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> visage up {{into the}} most indescribable {{expression}} of world-embracing benignity, expanded her old lips, displayed her toothless gums, and chuckled.|$|E
60|$|With {{an angry}} lash of her tail she bared her yellow fangs, curling her great lips in a hideous snarl that <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> bristling snout in serried ridges {{and closed her}} wicked eyes to two narrow slits of rage and hatred.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Wenham Gardner leaned towards him. It was {{certainly}} {{the first time that}} a woman in her apparent rank of life had looked upon Tavernake in such a manner. Her forehead was a little <b>wrinkled,</b> <b>her</b> lips were parted, her eyes were pathetically, delightfully eloquent.|$|E
60|$|William sat late in her tent that night, reading through {{page after}} page of the square handwriting, patting the {{sketches}} of proposed repairs to the reservoir, and <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> eyebrows over the columns of figures of estimated water-supply.|$|R
6000|$|... "And it's {{something}} dreadful, I know!" [...] she said, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> brows with {{a pretty}} terror. [...] "Couldn't you pretend you had told it to me, and let us go on just the same? Couldn't you, Kla'uns? Tell me!" ...|$|R
2500|$|June {{is thrilled}} when her sons {{are invited to}} cotillions and {{birthday}} parties but <b>wrinkles</b> <b>her</b> nose with disgust when they bring home wriggling earthworms or rain-soaked clothing. She was described by {{her husband in the}} series as a [...] "former belle of East St. Louis." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was silent}} until the waiter, who was filling her glass with white wine, had departed. Then {{she leaned over}} towards him. Her {{forehead}} was a little <b>wrinkled,</b> <b>her</b> eyebrows raised. She had the half-plaintive air {{of a child who}} is complaining of being unjustly whipped.|$|E
60|$|He {{went into}} the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat. The others, taken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing to say. Aunt Kate <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject. Mr. D'Arcy stood {{swathing}} his neck carefully and frowning.|$|E
60|$|Molly <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> {{forehead}} in her agitation. Men of Lord Dreever's type {{appeal to}} the motherly instinct of women. As a man, his lordship was a negligible quantity. He did not count. But as a willful child, to be kept out of trouble, he had a claim on Molly.|$|E
6000|$|William sat late in her tent that night, reading through {{page after}} page of the square handwriting, patting the {{sketches}} of proposed repairs to the reservoir, and <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> eyebrows over the columns of figures of estimated water-supply."And he finds time to do all this," [...] she cried to herself, [...] "and-well, I also was present. I've saved one or two babies.|$|R
60|$|This {{also was}} true, for old Mrs Merryboy, seeing that {{something}} unusual was occurring, {{had all this}} time been watching the various speakers with her coal-black eyes, changing aspect with their varied expressions, and <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> visage up into such inexpressible contortions of sympathetic good-will, that she really {{could not have been}} more sociable if she had been in full possession and use of her five senses.|$|R
6000|$|William sat late in her tent that night, reading through {{page after}} page of the square handwriting, patting the {{sketches}} of proposed repairs to the reservoir, and <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> eyebrows over the columns of figures of estimated water-supply. [...] "And he finds time to do all this," [...] she cried to herself, [...] "and--well, I also was present. I've saved one or two babies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Like sieves!' She sighed. A troubled frown <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> forehead. 'Men are so helpless! Oh, dear, I'm {{sure you}} don't pay any {{attention}} to anything important. I don't believe you ever bother your head about keeping warm in winter and not getting your feet wet. And now I shan't be able to look after you!' ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{conscious}} of nothing but his book; however, she found the logarithms, and brought them to Mr. Ernescliffe, staying {{to look at his}} drawing, and asking what he was making out. He replied, smiling at the impossibility of her understanding, but she <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> brown forehead, hooked her long nose, and spent the next hour in amateur navigation.|$|E
60|$|Tavernake {{did exactly}} as he was bidden. The chair toward which she had pointed was quite close to the sofa, {{but there was no}} other unoccupied in the room. She raised herself a little on the couch and turned towards him. Her eyes were fixed anxiously upon his, her {{forehead}} slightly <b>wrinkled,</b> <b>her</b> voice tremulous with eagerness.|$|E
5000|$|Khema saw the maiden's {{beautiful}} skin <b>wrinkle,</b> <b>her</b> hair {{change to}} gray {{and her body}} age. She then saw the body collapse with age and pass away, leaving behind just a corpse, which in turn changed to a heap of bones. Understanding that all conditioned phenomena were impermanent, Khema realized that the same would happen to her. How could she retain her beauty when this exquisite vision aged and decomposed before her very eyes? ...|$|R
60|$|Seb. The tempest is o'erblown, {{the skies}} are clear, And the sea charmed into a calm so still, That not a <b>wrinkle</b> ruffles <b>her</b> smooth face.|$|R
6000|$|Then slow raise Marjory o' the Lochs, [...] And <b>wrinkled</b> was <b>her</b> brow, [...] Her ancient weed was russet gray, [...] Her auld Scots bluid was true; ...|$|R
