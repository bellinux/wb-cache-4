5|$|Berlin's {{civilian}} {{work schedule}} {{had been that}} of a hardworking night owl, generally writing material until two or three in the morning. His efforts to adjust to military life and become a good soldier included springing out of bed obediently each morning, which earned him the resentment of fellow soldiers because he concealed his hatred of reveille too well and appeared eager to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> in the mornings.|$|E

5000|$|The {{scene where}} Buffy <b>wakes</b> <b>up</b> in Parker's bedroom echoes {{the scene from}} [...] "Innocence" [...] where Buffy <b>wakes</b> <b>up</b> in Angel's room after they sleep together. In both scenes, Buffy <b>wakes</b> <b>up</b> alone, wrapped in red sheets. Buffy seems to sense this and worries that Parker is gone, as {{happened}} with Angel, until he walks in with coffee. Similar circumstances also occur later in the season, when Buffy sleeps with Riley. That time, however, Buffy <b>wakes</b> <b>up</b> in red sheets, looks around, and Riley is lying right next to her.|$|R

5|$|Nancy decides {{the only}} way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy, and {{explains}} that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that, when she finally fell asleep, she would {{no longer be able to}} <b>wake</b> <b>up.</b> Quentin uses the adrenaline to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> Nancy, who pulls Krueger into reality. She uses a broken blade to cut Krueger's gloved hand off, and then slice his throat. She then torches the secret room, with Krueger's body inside, and she and Quentin leave. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital; Krueger suddenly appears and kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror while Nancy screams.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} of morning <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> {{of patients in}} the ward and its influence on a patient. Morning <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> of patients is a situation faced by everyone who {{find themselves in a}} hospital { [...] } both a hospital employee and a patient. It is an everyday activity, although it may be one of great problems for hospitalized patients. The first aim of my thesis was to find out how morning <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> is perceived by patients hospitalized in a standard hospital ward. The second aim was to identify negative factors connected with morning <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> of patients hospitalized in a standard hospital ward. The third aim was to learn whether nurses working in a standard hospital ward respect the needs of their patients concerning morning <b>waking</b> <b>up.</b> The aims were fulfilled {{with the help of a}} questionnaire. A group monitored was formed by patients of an internal ward block. Three hypotheses were determined for these aims. Hypothesis one confirms that hospitalized patients are satisfied with morning <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> in a standard ward. Hypothesis two confirms that the most frequent factor concerning morning <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> with patients hospitalized in a standard ward is the time of <b>waking</b> them <b>up.</b> Hypothesis three confirms that nurses working in a standard ward respect the patient´s needs concerning morning <b>waking</b> <b>up.</b> The results will be handed over to senior executives of the ward where the research was carried out. They will have an opportunity to consider the problem of morning <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> of patients in their ward and, as the case may be, they can improve the situation...|$|R

50|$|When Cindel has a {{nightmare}} about bad guys coming into Noa's house, a scene {{was cut from}} the television broadcast, in which Cindel rushes to Noa's bed to <b>wake</b> him <b>up,</b> but instead finds Terak {{in the bed and}} <b>wakes</b> <b>up.</b> The television version just shows Cindel <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> after the men break in.|$|R
5|$|When they <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> in the hospital, Harry, Ron, and Hermione {{are told}} that Black has been sentenced to receive the Dementor's kiss, which removes {{the soul of the}} recipient.

5|$|After {{his band}} The Crosswalk was dropped from Hollywood Records in 1997, Cody Chesnutt spent several months {{recording}} The Headphone Masterpiece in his bedroom, {{which he used}} as a makeshift studio called the Sonic Promiseland, in Valley Village, California. He used a 4-track recorder, and recorded the songs entirely by himself with equipment worth $10,000, including one microphone, an organ, a guitar, bass, and keyboard. He used a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones as a studio monitor {{in order not to}} <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> his roommate. It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.|$|E

5|$|At bedtime on Christmas Eve, {{the family}} makes last-minute {{preparations}} at home, Marge tells everyone {{that no one}} can open presents until 7 AM and confiscates all of the alarm clocks. However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it. Bart hides the evidence outside beneath the snow in the front yard.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} episode, Wirt and Greg <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> in a hospital, with Greg telling a story but being cut off before we can hear what it's about. As the scene ends, Greg's frog begins to glow, due to having eaten a magic bell in The Unknown, {{suggesting}} that there was at least some physical aspect to the story. The series ends with a slow montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the morning}} <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> call, the crew {{began work on}} the day's tasks, which were {{centered}} on inspection of the orbiter's heat shield. Using the shuttle robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew went through a detailed inspection of the orbiter's thermal protection system (TPS) tile and Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) surfaces. During the inspection, engineers on the ground noticed a small area of tile on the forward area of the shuttle's right wing that appeared to have suffered some damage during ascent.|$|E

50|$|Later, as {{everybody}} is asleep, Pike <b>wakes</b> <b>up</b> Sergeant Wilson (who gets a fright {{at the sight}} of the bearskin), and asks him if he can come into bed with him. Wilson says to ask Captain Mainwaring, so Pike <b>wakes</b> <b>up</b> Jones and gets him to ask Captain Mainwaring if he can come into bed, however Mainwaring refuses because there is no room for Pike. Pike then asks Wilson whether he can accompany him to wash his hands and clean his teeth. Wilson reluctantly agrees, but only after Pike threatens to tell his mother if he doesn't come. Meanwhile, Godfrey <b>wakes</b> <b>up</b> Frazer because he needs to visit the bathroom. Frazer refuses due to there being too many unnatural causes, so Godfrey <b>wakes</b> <b>up</b> Captain Mainwaring, who also refuses to accompany him to the bathroom. He <b>wakes</b> <b>up</b> Jones, who agrees to accompany him to the bathroom. They set off and meet Pike coming back around a corner, frightening both parties.|$|R
5|$|In the past, {{during the}} fasting month of Ramadan, the Musaher {{of a town}} would yell and beat his drum to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> the town's {{residents}} for suhoor (lit. 'of dawn')—usually {{very early in the}} morning, ranging from 4-6 am. The meals eaten during this time are light and foods include labaneh, cheese, bread and fried or boiled eggs along with various liquids to drink. The muezzin's call to dawn prayers signaled the beginning of sawm or fasting.|$|E
5|$|Jenner would {{normally}} <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> to pray at 5am each day. In the 1940s, Jenner left the Glanton Brethren {{and joined the}} Open Brethren. For {{the rest of his}} life, Jenner attended Open Brethren churches: one on Goulburn Street in Sydney and the other in Bexley, New South Wales. At these churches, people did not understand what narcolepsy was and thought that Jenner was consistently falling asleep during services because he lacked respect for God. The church on Goulburn Street also disapproved of his partnership with other Christian organisations and churches; Jenner actively partnered with The Navigators, Campaigners for Christ, Baptists, Anglicans, and Methodists.|$|E
