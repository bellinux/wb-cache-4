6000|$|All this time, however, there hovered {{upon the}} tip of his tongue a {{confession}} that the very same objections which Mr Cheeryble had stated to the employment of his nephew in this commission applied with at least equal force and validity to himself, and a hundred times had he been upon the point of avowing the real state of his feelings, and entreating to be released from it. But as often, treading upon the heels of this impulse, came another which urged him to refrain, and to keep his secret to his own breast. 'Why should I,' thought Nicholas, 'why should I throw difficulties in the way of this benevolent and high-minded design? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> love and reverence this good and lovely creature.

6000|$|Observe {{that this}} is not in the {{slightest}} the conclusion of the orthodox economists. Every man, they said, gets what he actually makes, or, by exchange, those things which exactly correspond to it as regards the cost of making them--which have, to use the key-word of the theory, the same value. Let us take a very simple example. If I go fishing with a net which I have myself constructed out of fibers and sticks, and if I catch a fish and if I then roast the fish over a fire which I have made without so much as the intervention of a lucifer match, then it is I and I alone who have [...] "produced" [...] the roast fish. That is plain enough. But what if I catch the fish by using a hired boat and a hired net, or by buying worms as bait from some one who has dug them? Or <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not fish at all, but get my roast fish by paying for it a part of the wages I receive for working in a saw mill? Here are a new set of relationships.

Foreseeing that Phineas might commit himself if he attended these meetings, Mr. Monk had counselled him to remain at Killaloe. But Phineas had refused to subject himself to such cautious abstinence. Mr. Monk had come to Ireland as his friend, and he would see him through his travels.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} everyday activities, context-aware applications use {{sensors to}} detect {{what is happening}} and use increasingly complex mechanisms (e. g., by using big rule-sets or machine learning) to infer the user 2 ̆ 7 s context and intent. For example, a mobile application can recognize that the user is in a conversation and suppress any incoming calls. When the application works well, this implicit sensing and complex inference remain invisible. However, when it behaves inappropriately or unexpectedly, users may not understand its behavior. This can lead users to mistrust, misuse, or even abandon it. To counter this lack of understanding and loss of trust, context-aware applications should be intelligible, capable of explaining their behavior. We investigate providing intelligibility in context-aware applications and evaluate its usefulness to improve user understanding and trust in context-aware applications. Specifically, this thesis supports intelligibility in context-aware applications through the provision of explanations that answer different question types, such as: Why did it do X? Why did it not <b>do</b> Y? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> W, <b>What</b> will it <b>do?</b> How can <b>I</b> get the application to do Y? This thesis takes a three-pronged approach to investigating intelligibility by (i) eliciting the user requirements for intelligibility, to identify what explanation types end-users are interested in asking context-aware applications, (ii) supporting the development of intelligible context-aware applications with a software toolkit and the design of these applications with design and usability recommendations, and (iii) evaluating the impact of intelligibility on user understanding and trust under various situations and application reliability, and measuring how users use an interactive intelligible prototype. We show that users are willing to use well-designed intelligibility features, and this can improve user understanding and trust in the adaptive behavior of context-aware applications...|$|R

The author’s basic idea for doing so (1990, 1991) : a reinforcement learning (RL) controller is rewarded for action sequences that improve the predictor. Here this idea is revisited {{in the context of}} recent results on optimal predictors and optimal RL machines. Several new variants of the basic principle are proposed. Finally it is pointed out how the fine arts can be formally understood {{as a consequence of the}} principle: given some subjective observer, great works of art and music yield observation histories exhibiting more novel, previously unknown compressibility / regularity / predictability (with respect to the observer’s particular learning algorithm) than lesser works, thus deepening the observer’s understanding of the world and what is possible in it...|$|R
500|$|With {{the success}} of albums by Hill, Badu, and Maxwell, D'Angelo's second album Voodoo served as a further {{alternative}} to excesses of late 1990s R and hip hop, as neo soul reached its apex in 2000. A production of the Soulquarians, it was an exemplary creative milestone of neo soul. Ben Ratliff of The New York Times called the album [...] "the succes d'estime that proves the force of this new music: it is a largely unslick, stubbornly idiosyncratic and genuinely great album that has already produced two hit singles". By {{the time of her}} second album Mama's Gun (2000), Erykah Badu had been dubbed by writers as [...] "the queen of neo-soul". She said of the honorific title, [...] "I hated that because <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don’t <b>do</b> that anymore? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> change? Then that puts me in a penitentiary." [...] Subsequently, other artists attained success in the early 2000s, including Bilal, Musiq Soulchild, India.Arie, and Alicia Keys, who broke through to broader popularity with her debut album Songs in A Minor (2001). Hip hop artists such as The Roots and Common, associated with the Soulquarians, released albums that incorporated neo soul, Phrenology (2002) and Electric Circus (2003).|$|R
