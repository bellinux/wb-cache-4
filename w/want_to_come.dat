They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted {{to be able to}} raise her own garden. In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making.

25|$|Through 2010, Homestar Runner {{remained}} {{financially viable}} for the brothers through sales of related merchandise. Both brothers were married by 2010 and had {{their children to}} care for, and they recognized that {{they would need to}} find other jobs to support their respective families. When Matt had a second daughter, the two agreed to put the series on hiatus, knowing they would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to it but could not guarantee a time frame. Mike also noted that they had spent nearly ten years delivering a weekly cartoon, and believed that, creatively, they needed a break.

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, in September 2008, Iniesta was elected the fourth-choice captain behind, in order of preference, Carles Puyol, Xavi and Víctor Valdés; all four were {{products}} of the Barcelona youth system. His performances throughout the season were highly lauded, and he received standing ovations both in Barcelona at the Camp Nou, as well as from rival supporters in away matches. A leg injury sustained in mid-November 2008 left Iniesta sidelined until 3 January; initially expected to return to action in six weeks, he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back until he was 100 percent. Upon his return to action, as a 65th-minute substitute against Mallorca, he scored a crucial goal after just ten minutes on the pitch and completed a Barcelona comeback in front of the Camp Nou.|$|E

Childs later remarked that Verity Lambert [...] "didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in and just do the same old routine – the kick bollock and scramble action adventure stuff that made the early name of the company".

That was Jon Vitti's way of criticizing Saturday Night Live for having overlong sketches with thin joke premises. The sequence originally had a longer version of the Tuesday Night Live band playing into the commercial break, but it was cut because Vitti, who was a writer on Saturday Night Live during the 1985–86 season along with fellow The Simpsons writers, George Meyer and John Swartzwelder, did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> off as being bitter.|$|E
