25|$|Murakami is {{a serious}} {{marathon}} runner and triathlon enthusiast, {{though he did not}} start running until he was 33 years old. On 23 June 1996, he completed his first ultramarathon, a 100km race around Lake Saroma in Hokkaido, Japan. He discusses his relationship with running in his 2008 memoir What I Talk About <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> About Running.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} the Gunzo Award for his 1979 literary work Hear the Wind Sing, Murakami did not aspire {{to meet other}} writers. Aside from Sarah Lawrence's Mary Morris, whom he briefly mentions in his memoir What I Talk About <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> About Running alongside Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Morrison, Murakami was never {{a part of a}} community of writers, his reason being that he was a loner and was never fond of groups, schools, and literary circles. When working on a book, Murakami states that he relies on his wife, who is always his first reader. While he never acquainted himself with many writers, Murakami enjoys the works of Ryu Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Murakami {{published}} the anthology Birthday Stories, which collects short {{stories on the}} theme of birthdays. The collection includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. What I Talk About <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> About Running, containing tales about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the U.K. and the U.S. in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver's short story collection, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.|$|E

6000|$|... "Faith, nor I," [...] {{said her}} husband. [...] "But she is willing, {{provided}} {{she can have}} the child. She said so only the other day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> o't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{understand}} why Mr. Morel always looked so sad <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> of the prairie," [...] she said brokenly. [...] "Mother, {{you must have}} known!" [...] she added as an afterthought.|$|R
500|$|Nolan {{has also}} {{stressed}} the importance of establishing a clear point of view in his films, and makes frequent use of [...] "the shot that walks into a room behind a character, because... that takes [...] inside the way that the character enters". He has also used cinéma-vérité techniques (such as hand-held camera work) to convey realism. In an interview at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, he explained his emphasis on realism in The Dark Knight trilogy: [...] "You try and get the audience to invest in cinematic reality. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about reality in these films, it's often misconstrued as a direct reality, but it's really about a cinematic reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "If I mistake not, it is {{the common}} {{sentiment}} of the secessionists of the South, that {{they talk about the}} Constitution, but say nothing about the Union. [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about the Union, what do I talk about? [...] I talk about that thing which {{is the result of the}} American Constitution." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Shelby Spong once accused Williams {{of being}} a [...] "neo-medievalist", preaching orthodoxy {{to the people in}} the pew but knowing in private that it is not true. In an {{interview}} with Third Way Magazine Williams responded: [...] "I am genuinely a lot more conservative than he would like me to be. Take the Resurrection. I think he has said that of course I know what all the reputable scholars think on the subject and therefore <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about the risen body I must mean something other than the empty tomb. But I don't. I don't know how to persuade him, but I really don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{never did}} give me any--not the {{least in the}} world, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to her myself," [...] said Fred, eager to vindicate Mary. [...] "But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> asked Mr. Farebrother to speak for me, she allowed him to tell me there was a hope." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Biddy," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> {{with her}} after dinner, as {{her little girl}} lay {{sleeping}} in her lap, [...] "you must give Pip to me one of these days; or lend him, at all events." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To the point, to the point. The robbers?' 'I {{am at the}} point. The shawls is the point. For <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> of the shawls and the {{heaviness}} of my loss, {{you must}} know that {{the captain of the}} robbers--' ...|$|R
2500|$|Prior to {{entering}} college, Robinson held {{a short-term}} job as shoeshine man before {{getting a job}} as warehouse personnel. [...] After finishing his college degree, Robinson {{was unable to find}} a suitable career in his hometown of Gulfport. Robinson attributed this to racial discrimination as many of the local garages were under white ownership; speaking to his father, he said, [...] " [...] give me a job sweeping, filling gas tanks, changing tires, or washing, but I'm an engine man... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> to [...] about automotive science they smile, look at each other, and then look at me like I belong behind a mule and a plow." ...|$|E
2500|$|I've {{become more}} patient and more tolerant. A life spent in cricket {{can make you}} very self-centred, so I think I've moved away from that and become more open. People still say I come across as a grumpy old man, though, with a droopy {{moustache}} and a worn-out face. But that's just my exterior. Underneath I'm a much softer person. I haven't {{got rid of the}} moustache and long hair from my cricketing days, which gets a mixed reaction. Babies in prams look at me strangely quite a lot, so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> to them I have to put my finger over my top lip to soften the blow. They think the hair bear bunch [...] have arrived.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{retired from}} {{acting in the}} early 1960s and later turned down the role of Belle Rosen, a {{character}} with a crucial swimming scene, in The Poseidon Adventure. (The role eventually went to Shelley Winters.) She continued to lend her name to a line of retro women's swimwear. [...] "Women worldwide are fighting a thing called gravity," [...] said Williams. [...] "I say to women <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> to them, 'You girls of 18 have until about 25, 30 at the most, {{and then you have}} to report to me. My suits are quality fabric.'" [...] She went on: [...] "I put you in a suit that contains you and you will swim in. I don't want you to be in two Dixie cups and a fish line." ...|$|E
5000|$|Coming into this, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to Herb and Marion Sandler, {{one of my}} {{concerns}} was precisely this question of independence and nonpartisanship...My history has been doing [...] "down the middle" [...] reporting. And so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to Herb and Marion I said [...] "Are you comfortable with that?" [...] They said, [...] "Absolutely." [...] I said, [...] "Well, suppose we did an expose {{of some of the}} left leaning organizations that you have supported or that are friendly to what you've supported in the past."They said, [...] "No problem." [...] And when we set up our organizational structure, the board of directors, on which I sit and which Herb is the chairman, does not know in advance what we're going to report on.|$|R
60|$|Now {{you want}} to know what <b>I</b> meant <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> of a bit of lime going out to sea, and forming part of a coral island, and then of a {{limestone}} rock, and then of a marble statue. Very good. Then look at this stone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, she knowed {{no more of}} a chowder, than if the sea wern't in the neighbourhood, {{and there}} wern't {{such a thing as}} a fish in all England. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to her of a chowder, she gave in, like a Spaniard at the fourth or fifth broadside." ...|$|R
60|$|IV <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> {{and you are}} heedless, I {{will show}} no anger needless.|$|E
6000|$|... "She doesn't {{look at me}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> of myself," [...] he thought, {{while his}} {{listeners}} were laughing. [...] "I must try other subjects." ...|$|E
60|$|Lyndar. You {{would be}} perjured if you should, I fear: And, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> with Prince Abdalla next, I with your fond suspicions shall be vext.|$|E
6000|$|... "None," [...] said Nigel Olifaunt, [...] "except cold {{deeds and}} fair words. I have thought for some time, their only object {{was to get}} rid of me--one {{yesterday}} pressed money on me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> of going abroad, in order that I might not want the means of exiling myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I really {{considered}} what I should be," [...] said John. [...] "There {{was quite}} {{enough to think}} of with work, and cricket, and all the rest, till this spring, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have been off it all, and then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> it over with Dr. Medlicott, he settled my mind about various things that I wanted to know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I thought you--a prig," [...] she recollected. [...] "No; that's {{not quite}} it. There were the ants who stole the tongue, and I thought you and St. John were like those ants--very big, very ugly, very energetic, {{with all your}} virtues on your backs. However, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to you <b>I</b> liked you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{sit on the}} ottoman," [...] {{the young}} lady proceeded. [...] "Bring a chair, Godfrey. I like people to be {{opposite}} to me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know he is, and I try to {{keep him}} decent, but I forget, and he hates to be fixed, and Miss Bat doesn't care, and father laughs <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your charming ward," [...] Cecil answered, [...] "has as many whims and fancies as an elf. She yawns <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> to her, {{and looks}} longingly {{after one of}} my villagers. Hang the fellow!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jerusalem!" [...] the miner exclaimed. [...] "What on airth {{are they}} doing there? Why, we thought they had gone down {{to the west of}} the Colorado. I told you so, chief, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> to you about it; and instead of that, here they are up in the country of the 'Rappahoes and Shoshones." ...|$|R
5000|$|Macheru Karuku, a Kenyan {{official}} {{who oversaw the}} numerous school-building campaigns throughout Kenya was afraid that the volunteers might act negatively, and was [...] "encouraged <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> with them later and they realized how lucky {{they were to be}} living in good houses back in America, adding that they would never forget what they had seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Had you {{any idea}} of his coming so soon?" [...] said Mrs. Dashwood. [...] "I had none. On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety {{at all on the}} subject, it has been in recollecting that he {{sometimes}} showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> of his coming to Barton. Does Elinor expect him already?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{this better}} life is what I mean <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> of Aristocracy. This {{idea of a}} life {{breaking}} away from the common life to something better, is the consuming idea in my mind.|$|E
60|$|MISS T. I never {{passed the}} Higher Standard. But the khansamah is very patient with me. He doesn't get angry <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> about sheep's topees, or order maunds of grain when I mean seers.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm not {{a little}} man, I'm Tods, and I know all about it. Ditta Mull, and Choga Lall, and Amir Nath, and--oh, lakhs of my friends {{tell me about it}} in the bazars <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> to them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I allow I don't {{altogether}} see. Anyhow, Wolf's a German." [...] Austin {{looked puzzled}} and Jefferson smiled. [...] "You don't get me yet? The fellow has cultivated out his accent and claims he's English. That's important, {{because he got}} his English in the United States and doesn't claim he's American. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> about Chicago and Munich I made an experiment." ...|$|R
60|$|He smiled <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> {{of going}} over them. He {{told me they}} were so {{infinitely}} high, that no human creature could live upon the top; and withal so steep and so frightful, that if there was even a pair of stairs up on one side, and down on the other, no man would dare to mount up, or venture down.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Wyndham moodily. [...] "Perhaps I made a lucky shot <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> {{about our}} trading with the opposition. I imagine it touched him; {{looks as if}} there was an opposition. Then I don't suppose he knows Peters is on our track and his. Well, in the {{meantime}} we must use patience and trust our luck." ...|$|R
