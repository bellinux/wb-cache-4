They wrote the viceroy, asking him for the handing of the treasure he had taken, and guided the British to the cabildo at Luján. The invaders captured the treasure, sending it to London, where it was paraded in triumph on its <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> vaults (not knowing that a month earlier, the porteños had reconquered the city).|$|E
500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2003, Lovering was feeling depressed. In a 2004 interview, he commented: [...] "I {{remember}} I was on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> and I was just bummed out—everything, financially, was really a mess for me. I {{was involved in this}} relationship that was absolutely terrible. I was bottoming out. And I'm on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> and my cellphone rings. It's Joe he says, 'Guess what?'" [...] Santiago had just received a call from Thompson stating his desire to reunite the Pixies. Lovering was overjoyed at the news. He added that [...] "the saddest thing is that when I sat down to rehearse for the Pixies, I couldn't believe that I had given up something that I loved". In 2004 Lovering and the band recorded their reunion single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E
500|$|The New Yorker Anthony Lane {{criticized the}} plot, saying [...] "toss {{everything}} you can find, starting with roughly diced plots, into the blender: such {{appears to be the}} method behind Tower Heist." [...] Lane called the characters [...] "unlikable people" [...] but offered praise to Broderick, saying he [...] "underplays [...] so well." [...] Lane lamented that [...] "the notion of a theft from the thieves from those who are lapped in lofty, screw-you wealth is a tempting one right now, but Tower Heist passes the buck." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge was also critical, saying the film [...] "goes wonky on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> due to its lackluster pacing and shortage of the qualities that typically earn stars Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy their paychecks – namely, laughs." [...] Debruge felt that the opening 40 minutes were [...] "a dull blue-collar drama populated entirely by stereotypes," [...] and while the film [...] "picks up some much-needed momentum" [...] with the actual heist, the [...] "resolution feels rushed." [...] However, Debruge echoed praise for Murphy, calling his performance [...] "a welcome return to the comic's irreverent, '80s-era persona," [...] and lamenting his limited screen-time.|$|E

500|$|However, several {{critics were}} more {{positive}} towards the show. A number of publications welcomed {{the show as}} [...] "guilty pleasure", including The Huffington Post, The Atlantic, and The Week. Tim Stack, writing for Entertainment Weekly, described the reality series as: [...] "my favorite little slice of reality TV spongecake." [...] Lauren Le Vine of Refinery29 appreciated {{the success of the}} family which [...] "achieved the American dream of making something out of nothing," [...] using the given platform. Libby Hill of The A.V. Club also acknowledged the show's success and said: [...] "Keeping Up With The Kardashians gives us real, joyous, ugly, unsavory, hilarious life, with all the polished sitcom trappings. And though the latter may have launched a multimedia empire, the former has made it last". Maura Kelly of The Guardian evaluated the aftermath of the failed wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries, which was documented on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and subsequently caused public outrage, including an online protest petition to cancel the show. [...] "Since Kim doesn't exactly seem to be an exemplar of self-awareness, I suppose it's possible that she really believed she and Humphries would live happily ever after," [...] Kelly speculated whether or not the marriage was a publicity stunt. [...] "But more likely, she and E! are laughing all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> [...] 10.5 million viewers tuned into [...] "Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event", after all," [...] Kelly summarized the controversy. Josh Duboff, writing for Vanity Fair, commented on the show's long run and said that [...] "it is near impossible to argue that their continued relevance, 10 years later, is anything other than awe-inspiring and remarkable".|$|E

After reading it, in fact, my brother George and I laughed {{all the way to the}} bank." [...] He used a similar response to subsequent poor reviews, famously modifying it to [...] "I cried all the way to the bank."

2500|$|Liberace sent a {{telegram}} that read: [...] "What you said hurt me very much. I cried {{all the way}} to the bank." [...] He sued the newspaper for libel, testifying in a London court that he was not homosexual and that he had never taken part in homosexual acts. He was represented in court by one of the great barristers of the period, 75 year old Gilbert Beyfus, QC, who displayed all his old flair despite being unwell. [...] They won the suit, partly on the basis of Connor's use of the derogatory expression [...] "fruit-flavoured". The case partly hinged on whether Connor knew that 'fruit' was American slang implying that an individual is a homosexual. After a three-week civil trial, a jury ruled in Liberace's favor on June 16, 1959 and awarded him £8,000 (around $22,400) in damages (worth about £ or $ today) which led Liberace to repeat the catchphrase to reporters: [...] "I cried {{all the way to}} the bank!" [...] Liberace's popularization of the phrase inspired the title of Crying All the <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank,</b> a detailed report of the trial based on transcripts, court reports, and interviews, by the former Daily Mirror journalist Revel Barker.|$|E
2500|$|SpongeBob cries hopelessly {{but then}} sees that Patrick has the key; in fact, {{he found it}} while he cleaned SpongeBob's pants. They {{go back into the}} train and are on their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> Eventually, Plankton steals the key and bats them out of a window then they must chase the train. SpongeBob morphs himself into a hang glider and he and Patrick fly back onto the train to pursue him. Once they return, SpongeBob and Patrick chase Plankton. But, Plankton {{disconnects}} the cars of the train, leaving SpongeBob and Patrick in the front car. SpongeBob and Patrick try to stop the train but Patrick stupidly breaks the brake of the train causing the train to go out of control. He makes several (but stupid) futile attempts to stop the train, including putting a heavy boulder on the tracks. This only causes the train to flip and move forward while some of the wheels are off the track. The two manage to bring all wheels back in place when they stop in front of a retirement home. Then, Patrick stupidly breaks the throttle. Meanwhile, Plankton is seen trying to steal the formula but is stopped by Mr. Krabs. However, he secretly escapes with it, but the train comes into the bank and stops Plankton before he could leave. Plankton's plan fails again, and Mr. Krabs has to pay the damage to the bank with his bank account. 75 years later, SpongeBob, shown as an elderly, finishes the story of the [...] "Great Train Caper". His grandson responds with a cheer in excitement over his video game.|$|E

5000|$|The Burial of the Sardine (Spanish: El entierro de la sardina) is an oil-on-panel {{painting}} by Spanish artist Francisco Goya, usually dated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1810s.

Had Gibault known what a theatrical air was, {{he might have been}} immensely tickled; but, being what he was--an unsophisticated son of the wilderness--he knew nothing about such airs, and therefore regarded his companion in the light of a superior order of being, or a madman; he was not quite sure which.|$|R

5|$|The Russian {{position}} at Borodino {{consisted of a}} series of disconnected earthworks running in an arc from the Moskva River on the right, along its tributary, the Kolocha (whose steep <b>banks</b> added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defense), and towards the village of Utitsa on the left. Thick woods interspersed along the Russian left and center (on the French side of the Kolocha) made the deployment and control of French forces difficult, aiding the defenders. The Russian center was defended by the Raevsky Redoubt, a massive open-backed earthwork mounting nineteen 12-pounder cannons which had a clear field of fire all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of <b>the</b> Kolocha stream.|$|R

Behind, where their feet had sped the moment before, the ice broke up and turned turtle. Through this opening the river rushed out upon them to their waists, burying the sled and swinging the dogs off at right angles in a drowning tangle. But the men stopped their flight to give the animals a fighting chance, and they groped hurriedly in the cold confusion, slashing at the detaining traces with their sheath-knives. Then they fought their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> through swirling water and grinding ice, where, foremost in leaping to the rescue among the jarring fragments, was the Kid.|$|E

One day he strolled down there with a feeling that was rare with him now. He felt suddenly at peace with the world. The evening was drawing in and the dusk seemed to cling to the leaves of the coconut trees like a little thin cloud. A faint breeze stirred them noiselessly. A crescent moon hung just over their tops. He made his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> He saw Ethel in the water floating on her back.
