The two playoff games drew 2,836 and 3,340 respectively, even after the team launched their SOS (Save Our Soccer) campaign late in the season. Losses for the season were pegged in the $500,000 range. This led too many <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> would be a next season, or if the owner would just pull the plug.|$|E

500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{admitted}} that the chorus of the song is triumphant. Chris Norris of Blender wrote that the song [...] "evokes both early-'80s dance giants the S.O.S. Band and early-'80s dance giant Madonna." [...] Matt Zabosek of The Chicago Maroon wrote: [...] "...'Get Together' is probably the best, but it's hard not to feel that Madonna's computerized voice is a cheat (perhaps to cover for the high notes she can no longer reach?)" [...] Diego Costa of The UWM Post in review of the song, wrote: [...] "In this one-step-up-from-lounge-track, Madonna is a teen again, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> {{is such a thing}} as love at first sight. But in the end, as a wise woman, she realizes that whether it exists or not, she doesn't care, since 'all is just an illusion.' Yeah, we heard it all before, she will even admit it in the following track, but it doesn't mean we don't want to hear it again." [...] In 2007, the song was nominated in the category of Best Dance Recording at the 49th Grammy Awards but lost to Justin Timberlake's 2006 single [...] "SexyBack".|$|E
500|$|However, Prost had {{the firm}} belief that Honda and Ron Dennis viewed Senna {{as the future}} of the team. Prost {{recalled}} that by the Italian Grand Prix he had one car with maybe four or five mechanics, while his teammate had two cars and 20 people around him. Before the race Prost, who had announced in July 1989 that he would depart from McLaren, announced he was joining Ferrari. Although Prost was forced to make a public apology to both McLaren and Honda over his Monza comments, he received support from Nigel Mansell (who would be his [...] teammate at Ferrari), and former teammate Rosberg who claimed that once it became known they would not be using the Japanese engines the next season, their Honda engines did not seem to work as well as was once normal. Prost actually won the Italian Grand Prix, after Senna's engine blew with only 9 laps remaining. Until that point Prost's MP4/5 had not been a match for Senna's on Monza's long straights, which had many, especially those in the press, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was actually truth to Prost's claim that his Honda engines were not as good as the ones Senna was able to use.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Buried Secrets" [...] left me <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> {{was even}} more to Megan's father's death than a simple suicide. There must be a story there and I hope we get to hear more of it. [...] It {{would be nice to}} see Megan get her answers, no matter what they may be". Orlando called Joan [...] "a real piece of work" [...] saying that she could not understand why Joan would not allow Megan to exhume her father's body.

Of the conversation between Samantha and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) she said, [...] "Ethan's story about losing his guinea pig as a child was sad and sweet. In his own strange way he was trying to relate to Samantha and the death of her friend. Plus, it painted a heart-breaking picture of a sad, lonely boy". She added that the death of the episode [...] "caused a ripple effect, touching everyone who came near it", including Kate, who she said that she admired Megan for exhuming the body, as [...] "she's not allowed to flaunt [...] the rules the way Megan is prone to do.|$|E

Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was really good for everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times. [...] I felt a little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part of me was just <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry." ...|$|E

Then, all at once, Carry thought of a way by which Patty might have a new dress. She had been tossing restlessly, but now she lay very still, staring with wide-open eyes at the moonlit window, with the big willow boughs branching darkly across it. Yes, it was a way, but could she? Could she? Yes, she could, and she would. Carry buried her face in her pillow with a sob and a gulp. But she had decided what must be done, and how it must be done.|$|E
