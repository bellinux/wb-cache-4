Billy takes a taxicab to the BBC be interviewed on The One Show but discovers that the other torchbearers have already been interviewed. He is chased out of the studio by a {{security}} guard. Billy's next stop is Wembley Stadium and again he discovers the torchbearers have already left. Billy then goes to West Ham United F.C. and catches up with the other torchbearers but unfortunately Billy has lost his pass and is not allowed in. His taxi driver, Hercules, appears with Billy's pass and he takes part in the celebrations. Billy then wakes up in the hair and beauty salon in Walford {{and it turns out}} he <b>was</b> <b>dreaming.</b>|$|E
500|$|In the August 1917 {{edition of}} the {{magazine}} Electrical Experimenter, Tesla postulated that electricity {{could be used to}} locate submarines via using the reflection of an [...] "electric ray" [...] of [...] "tremendous frequency," [...] with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar). Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water. Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France's first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla's general speculation that a very strong high-frequency signal would be needed was correct. Girardeau said, [...] "(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he <b>was</b> <b>dreaming,</b> at least he <b>was</b> <b>dreaming</b> correctly." ...|$|E
500|$|Cobb reveals to Ariadne {{that he and}} Mal went to Limbo while {{experimenting with}} the dream-sharing technology. Sedated {{for a few hours}} of real time, they spent fifty years in a dream {{constructing}} a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to return to reality, Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem (an object dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality) and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real. However, when she woke up, Mal still believed that she <b>was</b> <b>dreaming.</b> In an attempt to [...] "wake up" [...] for real, Mal committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles.|$|E

500|$|The {{moment that}} Cupid and Psyche are {{revealed}} {{is an example}} of [...] "Keatsian intensity" [...] as they are neither in a state of separation nor are they united; they exist in a state somewhere in between in a similar manner to the figures depicted in Keats's [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". The narrator's ability to witness the union is unique to Keats's version of the Psyche myth because the lovers in the original story were covered in darkness. However, the narrator questions if he was able to see them at all or if he <b>was</b> <b>dreaming.</b> This inability of the narrator to know if he was awake is a theme that appears in many of Keats's odes that followed, including [...] "Ode on Indolence", [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Regardless of the narrator's state of consciousness, he is able to relate himself to Cupid as he believes himself to be in love with Psyche, representing the mind.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Man" [...] was {{directed}} by Urban Strom and produced by Danny Germaine in July 2009. It was shot in a mansion in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California. For the video, the singer wore a [...] "clingy" [...] white vest and hotpants. It begins with showing {{a man who is}} in bed and cannot sleep. Ewen is later shown in the mansion which prompts the man to turn on the light of a torch, leave the bed and search for her. Ewen then begins dancing on the wall as the torch is being flashed at her by the man. During the second verse, she is shown singing on a couch, again with the torch being flashed. When the song's bridge begins, Ewen is shown dancing outside on the porch where the man is watching her. As the video ends, it is revealed that the man <b>was</b> <b>dreaming,</b> in which Ewen appears near the room's curtains.|$|E
500|$|... "Sad" [...] {{was written}} by Maroon 5's lead singer Adam Levine {{together}} with band's guitarist, Valentine. According to Valentine, {{the development of the}} song began one morning, [...] "before he was even awake" [...] he <b>was</b> <b>dreaming</b> of his living room's piano playing the melody. He further stated that it was cool and he liked the chords to the verse. He later went to the studio where Levine had a concept for the song including couple of lines for the chorus. It was produced by Levine and Valentine together with Noah [...] "Mailbox" [...] Passovoy. For an interview with MTV News, Levine told that [...] "Sad" [...] is his most personal track on the album, although not revealed the inspiration behind it. The song was recorded at Conway Studios in Los Angeles by Noah Passovoy while Eric Eylands served as engineering assistant. Serbian Ghanea mixed it at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach together with John Hanes and Phil Seaford who served as mixing engineer and mixing assistant respectively.|$|E

500|$|The Passamaquoddy tribal council fired Gellers {{and asked}} Tureen to take over. Fearing that his federally funded legal aid {{employer}} could not withstand the political pressure that the suit would inevitably provoke, in 1971, Tureen asked the Native American Rights Fund (NARF) {{to act as}} co-counsel. Tureen himself would eventually move to NARF {{during the course of}} the litigation. Tureen attempted to persuade a large law firm to join the case pro bono. Among those who turned him down were Arthur Lazarus, Jr. of Frank, Harris, Shriver & Kampelman, who had litigated many claims in front of the Indian Claims Commission. Based on the acreage involved, Lazarus pointed out that the claim would net only $300,000 before the Commission, which would be less than the cost of litigation. When Tureen said, [...] "Mr. Lazarus, this is not an Indian Claims Commission case, this is a Nonintercourse Act claim," [...] Lazarus shook his head and told Tureen he <b>was</b> <b>dreaming.</b> Tureen was able to recruit Barry Margolin, David Crosby, and Stuart Ross of Hogan & Hartson. The other members of the team were Robert Pelcyger of NARF and Robert Mittel of Pine Tree Legal Assistance.|$|E
500|$|Ross Bonaime of Paste {{magazine}} {{gave the}} episode a complimentary review. He started {{by claiming that}} Awake was [...] "the best drama to come out the 2011–12 season on television, {{and one of the}} finest NBC dramas in years". He also wondered [...] "what Awake would be like in a Michael Britten-like alternate reality where the show lasted five seasons, or 10, or even just one more year", Could Awake maintain this story for long and still be compelling?" [...] Bonaime wrote that it was [...] "better to have one great season and be remembered fondly". Bonaime claimed that the [...] "ending is quite smart, given that it never truly clarifies if Michael <b>was</b> <b>dreaming</b> the whole time, or if Dr. Lee was right and that he {{was on the verge of}} completely snapping, which makes much more sense". He was also grateful that [...] "Awake decided to just go completely nuts with the last half of this episode". He claimed that the episode and series was [...] "different, a rare move, especially on network television". He claimed that [...] "Once Awake arrives on Netflix and DVD, people will rush through in a matter of days and will say they enjoyed their experience with this short yet sweet treasure". He claimed that works with Awake should be [...] "rewarded" [...] and [...] "praised". Bonaime concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9.0 out of 10".|$|E
500|$|That same year, Cooper {{made two}} films with {{director}} and good friend Howard Hawks. In the biographical film Sergeant York, Cooper portrays war hero Alvin C. York, {{one of the}} most decorated American soldiers in World War I. The film chronicles York's early backwoods days in Tennessee, his religious conversion and subsequent piety, his stand as a conscientious objector, and finally his heroic actions at the Battle of the Argonne Forest, which earned him the Medal of Honor. Initially, Cooper was nervous and uncertain about playing a living hero, so he traveled to Tennessee to visit York at his home, and the two quiet men established an immediate rapport and discovered they had much in common. Inspired by York's encouragement, Cooper delivered a performance that Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune called [...] "one of extraordinary conviction and versatility", and that Archer Winston of the New York Post called [...] "one of his best". After the film's release, Cooper was awarded the Distinguished Citizenship Medal by the Veterans of Foreign Wars for his [...] "powerful contribution to the promotion of patriotism and loyalty". York admired Cooper's performance and helped promote the film for Warner Bros. Sergeant York became the top-grossing film of the year and was nominated for eleven Academy Awards. Accepting his first Academy Award for Best Actor from his friend James Stewart, Cooper said, [...] "It was Sergeant Alvin York who won this award. Shucks, I've been in the business sixteen years and sometimes dreamed I might get one of these. That's all I can say ... Funny when I <b>was</b> <b>dreaming</b> I always made a better speech." ...|$|E

He took classes in philosophy and mathematics, excelling in both, {{and was on the}} Dean's List {{at the end of his}} first year. However, feeling restless at being away from Israel, especially with Israel skirmishing against Egypt during the War of Attrition, Yoni transferred to Jerusalem's Hebrew University in 1968. In early 1969, he left his studies and returned to the army.

After the [...] "Freddy's War" [...] arc's completion, a story about Freddy employing a teenager to kill the girl who helped Jade and her father was released. The second story arc, titled [...] "Demon of Sleep", detailed a group of social outcasts who, after realizing they are being killed off one by one, decide to summon an Aztec sleep demon to battle Freddy. The last issue, released in June 2007, was about a worker at a fast-food restaurant who <b>was</b> <b>dreaming</b> about Freddy killing other people, until Freddy killed him.|$|E
2500|$|In Dion's version, [...] "I Drove All Night" [...] is dance-pop. It {{was also}} {{considered}} [...] "{{a little bit}} dance-club, a little bit rock & roll."

[...] In the chorus, she sings, [...] "Woke you from your sleep {{to make love to}} you/Is that all right?/I drove all night." [...] In the second verse, Dion duplicates a line as it is heard in Orbison's original recording. Instead of singing, [...] "no matter where I go I hear the beating of our heart," [...] Dion sings, [...] "our one heart." [...] Like the original, the chorus is sung again twice, which ends the single.|$|E

2500|$|In his Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes {{embarked}} upon a quest {{in which}} he called all his previous beliefs into doubt, {{in order to find}} out of what he could be certain. In so doing, he discovered that he could doubt whether he had a body (it could be that he <b>was</b> <b>dreaming</b> of it or that it was an illusion created by an evil demon), but he could not doubt whether he had a mind. This gave Descartes his first inkling that the mind and body were different things. The mind, according to Descartes, was a [...] "thinking thing" [...] (...) , and an immaterial substance. This [...] "thing" [...] was the essence of himself, that which doubts, believes, hopes, and thinks. The body, [...] "the thing that exists" [...] (...) , regulates normal bodily functions (such as heart and liver). According to Descartes, animals only had a body and not a soul (which distinguishes humans from animals). The distinction between mind and body is argued in Meditation VI as follows: I have a clear and distinct idea of myself as a thinking, non-extended thing, and a clear and distinct idea of body as an extended and non-thinking thing. Whatever I can conceive clearly and distinctly, God can so create.|$|E
2500|$|Carl is Kirsty's ex-boyfriend, and Coonan {{explained}} {{that they were in}} a relationship [...] before he went to prison. Carl was in his early 20s and Kirsty was 16 when they met and he became obsessive of her. Their relationship was based on hedonism and excess, rather than tenderness. When he went to prison, Kirsty promised to wait for him to be released, but she realised their relationship was toxic and ceased all contact. She then went on to marry Max. Carl is still in love with Kirsty, believing her to be [...] "the only woman for him" [...] and his second mission in Walford is to get her back. Coonan said this would cause problems between Carl and Max. He later said that [...] "In Carl's head, he's coming in on a white horse to save Kirsty from a bad marriage", and {{explained that}} while Carl was in prison he focussed on Kirsty, and she [...] "become an object of this freedom he <b>was</b> <b>dreaming</b> about. [...] Now he sees she's poodling after Max and that he isn't treating her right." [...] However, he thought that Kirsty may not want to reunite with Carl because [...] "he's not the type of guy who's just going to change overnight" [...] and he is probably not [...] "the knight in shining armour" [...] he thinks he is. Coonan {{went on to say that}} Carl would treat Kirsty [...] "like a goddess" [...] but would probably have a problem with her independence, and he would want to provide for her, being [...] "old-fashioned and a bit misguided", and they would have a [...] "fiery" [...] relationship because they are both [...] "strong-willed". Kierston Wareing, who plays Kirsty, opined that her character is more suited to Carl than to Max, and hoped they could be a [...] "manipulative, power couple".|$|E
