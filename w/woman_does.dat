5|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Trollope's triangles, Mary is not called upon to judge between a good suitor and a bad one, but between two good men. Gilmore {{is presented as a}} sympathetic and admirable character; the reader learns far less about Captain Marrable's character, and is given no reason why Mary should prefer him to his rival. To Trollope, a <b>woman</b> <b>does</b> not necessarily fall in love because of a man's merits; and it is very wrong for a woman to marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E
5|$|The cult members, squeamish about {{committing}} acts of violence, {{decide that}} Jacqueline, who is suicidal, should kill herself. When she refuses, they let her leave, but send an assassin to follow her. The assassin chases {{her through the}} darkened streets with a switchblade, but she eludes him and returns to her apartment above Dante's. She briefly encounters her neighbor, Mimi (Elizabeth Russell), {{a young woman with}} a terminal illness. Mimi confesses to Jacqueline that she's afraid to die, and plans to have one last night out on the town. Jacqueline enters her own apartment and hangs herself. The thud of the chair falling over is heard, but the sick <b>woman</b> <b>does</b> not recognize the sound as she leaves for the evening.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal and South India, Shashthi is worshipped on {{the sixth}} day after {{childbirth}} and on Aranya-Shashthi (also called Jamai-Shashthi), the sixth day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Jyeshtha. Her worship can be performed in the house, where she is symbolised as an earthenware pitcher; she may also be worshipped outdoors in a natural, open space consecrated to her, termed a shashthitala. In honour of Shashthi, women tie a stone in a small rag to the branch of a tree in the shasthitala: a mother does this to ask for long life for her child, while a barren <b>woman</b> <b>does</b> so to entreat the goddess to aid her in conceiving. The vrata (ritual) performed {{on the day of}} Jamai-Shashthi is also prescribed to be performed by pregnant women at least once on any Monday, Tuesday, Friday or Saturday in the month of Jyestha. Dough images of Shashthi and her black cat are prepared and worshipped, along with a water pitcher with a banyan tree branch near it. Betel nuts and leaves, fruits, sweets and kheer are offered to her in units of six. In North India, Shashthi is worshipped {{in the form of the}} banyan tree, which is sacred to her.|$|E

Thus, by choosing to terminate her pregnancy, Thomson concludes that a pregnant <b>woman</b> <b>does</b> not normally violate the fetus's right to life, but merely withdraws its use of her own body, which usually causes the fetus to die.|$|E

25|$|In Western Australia, since 20 May 1998, abortions {{are allowed}} on request up to 20 weeks of {{pregnancy}} – subject to counselling by a medical practitioner {{other than the}} one performing the abortion – or when serious personal, family or social consequences will result to the woman if an abortion is not performed, when the life or physical or mental health of the woman is endangered and when the pregnancy causes serious danger to the woman's mental health. After 20 weeks of pregnancy abortions may only be performed if the fetus is likely to be born with severe medical problems – which must be confirmed by two independently appointed doctors. In the event of the woman being under 16 years of age one of her parents must be notified, except where permission has been granted by the Children's Court or the <b>woman</b> <b>does</b> not live with her parents.|$|E
25|$|While {{the rate}} of {{domestic}} violence among immigrant groups does not differ {{from that of the}} general population, immigrant victims of domestic violence may face additional challenges. While victims can be of either gender, women may be especially vulnerable. The process of immigrating to another country and adjusting to American culture can be stressful, increasing the likelihood of domestic violence. Factors such as limited English language ability, legal status, and lack of social ties may create additional barriers for those trying to escape such situations. Even when a <b>woman</b> <b>does</b> have access to social services that could help her escape an abusive situation, cultural norms may make it difficult for her to leave. If a woman decides to leave an abusive spouse she may run the risk of social ostracism and of bringing shame to her family. Thus, a woman may choose to stay and suffer abuse rather than face the social consequences of leaving her husband.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{economic}} effects {{to the person}} who has to shoulder the double burden. Oftentimes, this tends to be the woman in the relationship, and so there has been analysis done on the economic effect of the double burden on women. According to Himmelweit (2002), because women often earn less than men, there is the thought that the woman should be the one to fit her paid job around household activities such as taking care of children. Because of this, and because they have many domestic duties, women often take part-time jobs and jobs in the informal sector in order to balance paid work with domestic work. Part-time jobs and jobs in the informal sector do earn less than full-time jobs, so men have to increase their paid work hours in order to compensate for the lacking family income. This will [...] "weaken her earning power and strengthen his", leading to an unequal distribution of power in the household, and allow the man to exploit the woman's unpaid work. This situation could have negative consequences especially for the woman because she is perceived to have less contribution to the household, due to domestic work being seen as less of a contribution than paid work. Such negative consequences include the lack of a divorce threat, where the <b>woman</b> <b>does</b> not have the economic means to ask for a divorce because she does not have a full-time job, and she has less money that she personally receives, decreasing her perceived contributions to the household.|$|E

The first issue of Spider-Gwen experienced commercial success and was the third best-selling comic of February 2015 with sales of over 250,000 copies. The first volume ended after the fifth issue, with the character carrying over into the second volume of Spider-Verse as part of the Secret Wars event. After the conclusion of the event, a second volume by the same creative team began with the first issue as a part of Marvel's All-New, All-Different Marvel imprint entitled The Radioactive Spider-Gwen. Spider-Gwen was featured as a major character in a multi-part crossover entitled Spider-Women. It commenced with Spider-Women Alpha #1 and ended with Spider-Women Omega #1, with certain issues of Spider-Woman, Silk and Spider-Gwen partially depicting the storyline in between.|$|E
