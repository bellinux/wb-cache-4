5|$|Norway Airlines was {{established}} on 2 April 1987 by Kjell Adserø and his holding company Hell Holding, {{along with several}} other investors from Trøndelag—the largest of which was Lyng Industrier. The business model was to operate charter flights from Norway to the Mediterranean; {{eighty percent of the}} market was carried out with foreign airlines and Adserø believed that Norwegians not only would prefer a Norwegian carrier, but <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more for one. The company had an initial share capital of NOK10 million and established its head office and main base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. Separate companies, organized as kommandittselskap, wer established to own each aircraft and lease them to the airline. The aircraft owner companies paid 28.7 million United States dollars for each Boeing 737-300, which were delivered new from Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Shares in the aircraft owning companies was offered to the public with a four-percent annual return on investment. Part of the investment model was based on tax advantages.|$|E
5|$|Schmittou {{learned from}} {{a member of the}} Metro Board of Parks and Recreation that neither the Park Board or the city of Nashville <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for such a park. So, Schmittou, along with help from country music star Conway Twitty, put {{together}} a group of investors including other country stars Cal Smith, Larry Gatlin, Jerry Reed, and Richard Sterban (bass singer of the Oak Ridge Boys), as well as other Nashvillians, in order to finance a stadium and a minor league team. Twenty shares valued at US$15,000 each were issued, with Schmittou purchasing 2shares, or 10percent of the team. The Metro Parks Board agreed to lease to Schmittou the site of Nashville's former softball fields on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, approximately two miles (3km) south of downtown, for a period of 20years as long he built a stadium with a minimum capacity of 6,500 at a cost of at least $400,000 within 10years. In the second ten years, he would be required to pay the city seven percent of the team's total revenue.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the Genesis, Sega's Consumer Products Research and Development Labs led by manager Tomio Takami were tasked with {{creating}} a CD-ROM add-on for the system, which became the Sega CD. The Sega CD was originally intended to equal the capabilities of the TurboGrafx-CD, but with twice as much random-access memory (RAM), and sell for about JP¥20,000 (or US$150). In addition to relatively short loading times, Takami's team planned for the device to feature hardware scaling and rotation similar to that found in Sega's arcade games, which required the use of a dedicated digital signal processor (DSP). However, two changes made later in development contributed to the final unit's higher than expected price. Because the Genesis' Motorola 68000 CPU was too slow to handle the Sega CD's new graphical capabilities, an additional 68000 CPU was incorporated into the add-on. In addition, upon hearing rumors that NEC planned a memory upgrade to the TurboGrafx-CD, which would bring its available RAM from 0.5 Mbit to between 2 and 4 Mbit, Sega decided to increase the Sega CD's available RAM from 1 Mbit to 6 Mbit. This proved {{to be one of the}} greatest technical challenges during development since the Genesis' access speed was initially too slow to run programs effectively. The cost of the device was now estimated at $370, but market research convinced Sega executives that consumers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more for a state-of-the-art machine. Sega partnered with JVC, which had been working with Warner New Media to develop a CD player under the CD+G standard, to develop the Sega CD.|$|E

25|$|Controlling {{interest}} {{level is}} the value that an investor <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control. Some of the prerogatives of control include: electing directors, hiring and firing the company's management and determining their compensation; declaring dividends and distributions, determining the company's strategy and line of business, and acquiring, selling or liquidating the business. This level of value generally contains a control premium over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An additional premium may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, {{crime rates}} in New York City were peaking after rising since 1966. Between 1966 and 1981, violent crime {{rates in the}} city had more than tripled from 325 to 1100 violent crimes per 100,000 people annually. By mid-decade, the city had a {{reported}} crime rate over 70% higher {{than the rest of}} the United States. In 1984, there were 2 homicides, 18 violent crimes, and 65 property thefts reported per 10,000 people. The subway became a symbol of the city's inability to control crime. In an opinion poll of New York City residents taken the month after the shootings, more than half of those surveyed said crime was the worst thing about living in the city; about a quarter said they or a family member had been a victim of crime in the last year; and two-thirds said they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for private security for their building or block.|$|E
25|$|Consumers {{typically}} have positive attitudes for {{products that are}} ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often {{are not willing to}} pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.|$|E

500|$|There was an {{extensive}} {{debate over how}} to divide {{the cost of the}} proposed fleet between the Netherlands and NEI. The members of the Royal Commission were split on this question; while a minority preferred an equal division, the majority wanted the NEI to pay most of the costs. The public debate on this issue was centered on the questions of who should pay for the ships and who would make the greatest profits from the NEI remaining under Dutch rule. Arguments against the NEI paying for the ships included that the resources required were needed to fund economic and social development and that [...] the cost of the ships would increase opposition to Dutch rule, thereby worsening the security situation in the East Indies. Some critics of the plan also argued that it was unreasonable to expect the Dutch subjects in the NEI to pay for ships intended to prolong colonial rule. In contrast, Onze Vloot published pamphlets which claimed that Dutch rule was seen as beneficial in the NEI, and that both white and native residents of the islands <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the ships as they were necessary to guarantee its continuation. These pamphlets also argued that the cost of the ships was modest compared to the NEI's economic output.|$|E

Zack Furniss of Destructoid liked the game {{to the point that}} he thought Nintendo should use some ideas from it in future Metroid titles. Jonathan Holmes, also at Destructoid, said that AM2R does a good job at filling the [...] "void" [...] left by Nintendo's lack of new 2D Metroid games, calling it [...] "even more of an extensive re-imagining than Metroid: Zero Mission was to Metroid 1". Gonçalo Lopes at Nintendo Life said that the game was a great way to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary and a dream come true for Metroid fans, and that he imagined people <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> money for it if sold on Nintendo's eShop. Matthew Castle at Nintendo Gamer called it an example of how to do a remake right. Tom Sykes at PC Gamer praised AM2R as a [...] "great game in its own right" [...] regardless of whether one had played Metroid II prior or not. NF Magazine Tony Ponce initially worried that the game would lose the [...] "eerie charm" [...] of Metroid II, but found it {{to be able to keep}} a high-tension feeling, as well as including new things for longtime fans of the original.|$|E
