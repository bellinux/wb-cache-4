50|$|Industrial ecology (IE) is {{the study}} of {{material}} and energy flows through industrial systems. The global industrial economy can be modelled as a network of industrial processes that extract resources from the Earth and transform those resources into commodities which can be bought and sold {{to meet the needs of}} humanity. Industrial ecology seeks to quantify the material flows and document the industrial processes that make modern society function. Industrial ecologists are often concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>that</b> industrial activities have on <b>the</b> environment, <b>with</b> use of <b>the</b> planet's supply of natural resources, and with problems of waste disposal. Industrial ecology is a young but growing multidisciplinary field of research which combines aspects of engineering, economics, sociology, toxicology and the natural sciences.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an experiment in}} full cost accounting applied {{to the case of}} an industrial process. It aims at exploring the difficulties of putting full cost accounting into practice. Its specific contribution to the growing body of experiments in full cost accounting is that it attempts to compare exactly what impacts can be translated into financial information <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>that</b> are being left out. Amongst other things, we provide a quantitative figure of what is monetized in the experiment, expressed as a percentage of what should be monetized if all negative external effects were to be taken into account. The experiment uses three different external cost evaluation methods. The most comprehensive method monetizes less than 10 % of the flows of the industrial process studied. According to the method used and the assumptions made, external costs vary by a factor of more than 1 to 12, 000 per unit of product. The paper then discusses what can be learnt by comparing the range of results obtained with each method and suggests directions for future research. ...|$|R

50|$|In Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth, he {{explores the}} idea of {{decolonization}} {{by focusing on the}} conditions of colonization and the process of decolonization. He describes decolonization as the implementation of the statement, “The last shall be first.” This means that the systems and institutions in place that privilege a particular group need to be replaced with ones that redistribute privilege to those who have previously denied. In this vein of reordering society, Fanon engages <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>that</b> the “black elite” can have on that process; he specifically notes how the black elite— who are mostly western educated and trained— continue the colonial practices and their educational background can become a crutch that impedes change and progress in the post-colonial nation. As Fanon states, decolonization is a process of “disorder”.|$|E

Additionally, limited financial resources for transport infrastructure require new and different approaches to constructing, planning, operating, and maintaining modes of transport [23]. Sustainability is therefore very important {{in the design of}} transportation solutions and infrastructure. However, there is still no standard definition and no standard way of considering transportation sustainability. Consequently, the progress towards transportation sustainability has to take place on at least three levels of sustainability: economic development, environmental protection, and social development and well-being [64].|$|E
40|$|Recent work in {{the field}} of Undocumented Studies has tended to {{consider}} Undocumented Youth as either victims or as resilient leaders in movements for Social Justice for migrants. However, the ways in which narratives are experienced and expressed within this population of young people has received little attention. This thesis looks to address this gap, by considering grassroots art activism that demonstrates complex and varied experiences of Undocumented Youth in California. Placing creative expression as a form of response to structural oppression within a history of artistic activism throughout the Americas, and situating current experiences of Undocumented Youth within the specific conditions of contemporary eras, this thesis uses in depth-qualitative research to consider experiences of Undocumented Youth in California. Starting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>that</b> art has on individual empowerment through interviews with young Undocumented art activists, then moving towards a focus on the art itself as a text to understand and complicate narratives related to education and Queer issues, this project explores Undocu-Youth led movements for justice during a period of intense state-led violence towards Undocumented Youth and their communities. This thesis finds art to be a powerful method of healing, connecting, learning, and sharing narratives, as well as space in which counter narratives and movements can be included in struggles for social justic...|$|R

Nevertheless, none of them changes significantly the value of the Gini coefficient for the income distribution before taxes except for the inflation tax in high inflation rates periods. ...|$|E

This article presents results from analyzing a large dataset of teller service times from a retail bank.

40|$|The fourty {{years between}} 1958 / 60 and 1998 / 2000 have overall given Europe an {{unprecedented}} economic growth – now, however, with increasing unemployment and social problems. During the period bonds {{among the nation}} states that now form the European Union were created and strengthened to an extent, that nobody imagined {{at the end of}} the second world war. The mainly successful results in the production sectors of the national economies have come about in societies with originally very different institutional arrangements. To exemplify: very liberal and laissez faire arrangements in the U. K. after 1979; liberal and socially balanced arrangements in the Netherlands and the Nordic countries; a "social market economy " in the German Federal Republic since the fifties and a state interventionist institutional structure in France.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>that</b> federal structures {{have on the}} development of welfare to work or activation policies. More precisely, it argues that the incentives and the risks associated with a division of responsibilities among different jurisdictions may constitute an obstacle to broad reforms that promote labor market participation of nonworking benefit recipients. This argument is illustrated with a case study discussing policy responses to a massive rise in caseloads among social assistance recipients in Switzerland. We conclude that the lack of a fundamental reform was the consequence of the incentives provided by the federal structure of the program. These incentives have both encouraged cost shifting among jurisdictions and discouraged involvement of federal level policy makers in a bigger reform...|$|E
