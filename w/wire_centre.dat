40|$|Abstract. Commercially pure Al wires {{are drawn}} through equal channel angular dies with {{simultaneous}} torsion. The wires are deformed {{up to an}} equivalent strain of 1 to 4 at room temperature after several passes. The microstructure evolution of the wires is investigated using optical microscopy at both longitudinal and transverse cross sections. A grain refinement to a mean grain size of 10 to 15 µm is achieved by using this process. Finer grain structure is observed at the edge area of the wires due to the non-uniform strain distribution. The micro-hardness measurement indicates that the hardness distribution is inhomogeneous and increasing from a minimum value at the <b>wire</b> <b>centre</b> to a maximum value at the wire edge. Finite element (FE) results show that by using a channel angel of 160 ° and an initial wire diameter of 4 mm during one pass, an equivalent plastic strain of about 0. 4 at the <b>wire</b> <b>centre</b> and 0. 9 at the wire edge can be achieved. The most important advantage {{of this process is}} the ability to impose continuous severe plastic deformation to wires. This new hybrid process could be used as an industrial method for continuous grain refinement of wires...|$|E

It was claimed recently that a very large {{electron mass}} shift should be expected near the surface of a metal hydride (Widom and Larsen 2006 Eur. Phys. J. C 46 107). We examine the shift using a formulation based on the Coulomb gauge, which leads to a much smaller shift. The maximization of the electron mass shift under nonequilibrium conditions seems nonetheless to be an interesting problem. We consider a scheme in which a current in a hollow wire produces a large vector potential in the <b>wire</b> <b>centre.</b> Fluctuations in an LC circuit with nearly matched loss and gain can produce large current fluctuations; and these can increase the electron mass shift by orders of magnitude over its room temperature value. 1...|$|E

Potentially economical, accuracy improving differential equation-based distance algorithms are considered. These involve elliptic Poisson and a hyperbolic-natured Eikonal equation approaches. Numerical issues relating to non-orthogonal curvilinear grid solution of the latter are addressed. Eikonal extension to a Hamilton-Jacob equation is discussed. Use of this extension to improve turbulence model accuracy and, along with the Eikonal, enhance detached eddy simulation (DES) techniques is considered. Application of the distance approaches is studied for various geometries. These include a plane channel flow with a <b>wire</b> at the <b>centre,</b> a wing-flap system, and a supersonic double-delta configuration. Although less accurate than the Eikonal, Poisson method-based flow solutions are extremely close to those using a search procedure. For a moving grid case the Poisson method is found especially efficient. Results show that the Eikonal equation can be solved on highly stretched, non-orthogonal, and curvilinear grids. A key accuracy aspect is that metrics must be upwinded in the propagating front direction. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is found to have qualitative turbulence model improving properties.

5000|$|Mandrels {{are also}} used in {{industrial}} composite fabrication such as in filament winding. During the manufacturing process, resin-impregnated filaments are wound around a mandrel to create a composite material structure or part. The structure is cured and the mandrel is removed. One problem {{with this type of}} process is that the mandrel can be very difficult to remove once the part has been cured. As a result, engineers have created a new type of mandrel that has the ability to change shape and be easily extracted. When heated above a certain temperature, the mandrel becomes elastic and can be manipulated into the desired shape and then cooled to become rigid again in the new shape. It can then be used in the filament winding process. Once the composite part is cured, the mandrel can be reheated until elastic and easily removed from the cured part. These types of mandrels can be used repeatedly. In the production of steel core used for flexible drives, the <b>centre</b> <b>wire</b> upon which the subsequent layers are wound is referred to as a Mandrel.

Unfortunately {{in this case the}} stability was coupled with [...] "heavy" [...] controls and poor manoeuvrability. A suitable engine was not available in sufficient quantities to replace the air-cooled Renault – the RAF 1a being essentially an uprated version of the French engine – so that the improvement in the B.E.2c's performance was less than startling. When bombs were to be carried or maximum endurance was required the observer had to be left behind, so it was still necessary to have him sit over the centre of gravity, in front of the pilot.

Our study examined {{the proximity of the}} wire to the common peroneal nerve. We have demonstrated that the distance from the tip of the styloid process of the fibula to the nerve as it winds around the neck was 34.8  mm (range 21.5 – 44.3  mm). This finding concurs with Rupp et al. [7] who demonstrated the nerve to wraps around the fibular neck at an average of 3.5  cm from the styloid process or tip (range 3 – 4.4  cm). Stitgen et al. [3] also studied the course and branches of the peroneal nerve {{at the level of the}} fibular neck; their study determined that a ‘safe zone’ from a line drawn between the fibular head and the tibial tuberosity superiorly and extending 2  cm distally minimised the risk of damage to the nerve. Rubel et al. determined an anatomical safe zone for wires inserted into the tibia from the lateral side based on Gerdy’s tubercle and mapping out a safe arc. However, these authors recommended that, in the presence of a fibula fracture, these dimensions may be altered and could only be observed reliably in an intact fibula [6]. The nature of the configuration of proximal and intra-articular tibial fractures which require circular frame surgery may often mean that the fibula is not intact. In these circumstances, location of the nerve in relation to fixed fibula landmarks may prove to be more helpful in determining a safe location in which to insert a wire.|$|R

To obtain a homogeneous temperature distribution and {{to limit the}} number of traumas due to the implanted catheters, most catheters are used for both heating and thermometry. Implications of temperature measurement inside applicators are discussed. In particular, the impact of self-heating of both the applicator and the afterloading catheter were investigated. A one-dimensional cylindrical model was used to compute the difference between the temperature rise inside the applicators (deltaTin) and in the tissue just outside the afterloading catheter (deltaTout) as a function of power absorption in the afterloading catheter, self-heating of the applicator and the effective thermal conductivity of the surrounding tissue. Furthermore, the relative artefact (ERR), i. e. (deltaTin - deltaTout) /deltaTin, was measured in a muscle equivalent agar phantom at different positions in a dual-electrode applicator and for different catheter materials. A method to estimate the tissue temperature by power-off temperature decay measurement inside the applicator was investigated. Using clinical dual-electrode applicators in standard brachytherapy catheters in a muscle-equivalent phantom, deltaTin is typically twice as high as deltaTout. The main reason for this difference is self-heating of the thin feeder <b>wires</b> in the <b>centre</b> of the applicator. The measurement error caused by energy absorption in the afterloading catheter is small, i. e. even for materials with a high dielectric loss factor it is less than 5 %. About 5 s after power has been switched off, Tin in the electrodes represents the maximum tissue temperature just before power-off. This delay time (t(delay)) and ERR are independent of Tin. However, they do depend on the thermal properties of the tissue. Therefore, ERR and t(delay) and their stability in perfused tissues have to be investigated to enable a reliable estimation of the tissue temperatures around electrodes in clinical practic...|$|R
40|$|Muon {{detectors}} {{from the}} outer layer of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Over a million individual detectors combine {{to make up the}} outer layer of ATLAS. All of this is exclusively to track the muons, the only detectable particles to make it out so far from the collision point. How the muon’s path curves in the magnetic field depends on how fast it is travelling. A fast muon curves only a very little, a slower one curves a lot. Together with the calorimeters, the muon detectors play an essential role in deciding which collisions to store and which to ignore. Certain signals from muons are a sure sign of exciting discoveries. To make sure the data from these collisions is not lost, some of the muon detectors react very quickly and trigger the electronics to record. The other detectors take a little longer, but are much more precise. Their job is to measure exactly where the muons have passed, calculating the curvature of their tracks in the magnetic field to the nearest five hundredths of a millimetre. Even these precision detectors are not exactly sluggish – they react within a millionth of a second. Such a fast response is essential when new collisions are occurring in the centre of ATLAS 40 million times every second! This muon detector is a drift tube - an aluminium tube with a wall thickness of some 1 / 10 mm that is filled with a special gas mixture. Inside the tube there is a wire that is tightened all over the length of the tube and fixed at the end caps.

40|$|The study {{presented}} in this thesis investigated the flexural fatigue behaviour of non-corroded and corroded pretensioned beams and examined the use of externally bonded Carbon Fibre Reinforcement Polymer (CFRP) sheets as a repair technique aimed at restoring the loss in capacity due to corrosion. This was accomplished through an extensive experimental and analytical program. The experimental program was comprised of a material testing phase and a beam testing phase. The material testing phase consisted of testing seventy-two (72) material samples under monotonic and cyclic axial loading, full strand testing, and corrosion measurements of prestressing strands corroded while embedded in concrete prism. Material testing achieved multiple objectives: (a) it identified the rate of accelerated corrosion of the prestressing strands, (b) it quantified {{the distribution of the}} applied nominal tensile force among the seven wires within a single 7 -wire strand in a prestressed strand, (c) it determined the material fatigue properties, and the stress-strain behaviour of the strand wires, and (d) it quantified the stress concentration factor in the prestressing strand due to corrosion. The beam testing involved constructing thirty-seven (37) 3. 6 m long pretensioned T-beams and testing them in a four-point bending configuration. Twelve (12) beams were tested under monotonic loading, and twenty-five (25) beams were tested under cyclic loading. The main testing variables included: the corrosion level, the applied stress range, and a repair or the lack of it. Corrosion resulted in a significant deterioration of the monotonic and fatigue resistance of the beams in comparison to non-corroded beams, and repair using externally bonded CFRP sheet restored all or most of the monotonic and fatigue resistance lost due to corrosion. All beams failed by rupture of the prestressing strand. Inspection of the strand’s fracture surface showed signs of surface fretting. In addition, the fracture profile was similar to that reported by Toribio and Ovejero (2005) for hydrogen induced stress cracking of heavily cold drawn prestressing wires. Strands having corrosion levels of 5 % and 10 % by mass loss exhibited an overall section loss together with distinct deep corrosion pits. In the analysis phase, fatigue data measured from smooth axial samples taken from the <b>centre</b> <b>wire</b> of a prestrssing strand was used to model the fatigue behaviour of the outer wires of the 7 -wire prestressing strand for corroded and non-corroded pretensioned beams. Strain-based fracture mechanics was employed in all the analyses, which included the flexure fatigue behaviour of: non-corroded and corroded single prestressing wires-in-air, a full 7 -wire prestressing strand-in-air, and a non-corroded and corroded 7 -wire prestressing strand in a beam. The mode results correlated well with the observed experimental results. This thesis presents extensive experimental work, along with an in depth fatigue analysis that is based on material fatigue properties obtained from simple single wire cyclic testing. The resulting modelling approach offers a mechanistic explanation of 7 -wire prestressing strand failure under various conditions...|$|R

The WITCH (Weak Interaction Trap for Charged Particles) experiment will measure this correlation {{with the aim of}} further constraining the possible existence of scalar currents in the weak interaction or find a positive indication. The setup is located at ISOLDE/CERN and consists of a double Penning trap system combined with a retardation spectrometer to probe the energy of the recoil ions from the ß decay. The shape of the recoil ion energy spectrum allows to determine the ß&# 957; angular correlation coefficient, a. Past experiments have allowed to measure this parameter with a precision of 0. 5  1 %. The aim of the WITCH experiment is to measure a with a precision of about 0. 5 %. A first step towards this goal has already been taken in 2006 with the {{measurement of}} a recoil ion energy spectrum from the decay of 124 In. The complicated decay scheme of this nucleus, however, did not allow to extract the ß&# 957; correlation coefficient. Measurements performed as part of this PhD work showed that the requirements for the prime physics candidate, 35 Ar, put even more, stringent technical constraints on the system. To cope with these a major upgrade of the system was found to be necessary. The vacuum has been improved by one order of magnitude (5 · 10 &# 8722; 9 mbar in crucial areas), a control system to automate certain processes of the system was developed, parts of the system were improved and made more flexible and a magnetic shield was installed which allows, in combination with an RFQ buncher, to become independent from other experiments and thus provide significantly more time for testing and optimising the system. The first trial to measure a recoil ion energy spectrum with 35 Ar in 2009 was hampered by a retardation-dependent ionisation effect  due to a Penning-like electron trap in the spectrometer  that was discovered. The effect was characterised with offline measurements, by simulations and with experience gained at other experiments. The solution to this problem is a conductive <b>wire</b> in the <b>centre</b> of this electron trap, effectively absorbing all electrons before they can cause rest gas atoms to be ionised and disturb the measurement. Further, in preparation for the analysis of a recoil ion energy spectrum from 35 Ar decay, systematic effects have been studied in detail. The main effects {{to be taken into account}} relate to the properties of an ion cloud in a Penning trap (i. e. the radioactive source for the experiment), the transport of the recoil ions through the spectrometer and their detection. With the current understanding and operation of the system, the focus for the further investigation of systematic effects will have to lie on the determination of the properties of the ion cloud and the characterisation of the efficiencyof the detection surface. At present, the setup is ready for measuring a good-quality recoil ion energy spectrum from 35 Ar decay from which a first value of a can be extracted. The ionisation effect has been solved and important systematic effects have been identified. The study of systematic effects will continue and this should lead to a good determination of a (&# 948;a &# 8776; 1 %) before the CERN shutdown period in 2013. nrpages: 275 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with the fatigue strength of copper power conductors applied in umbilicals and power cables. Two cross-sections of conductors were investigated, namely, 95 mm 2 and 300 mm 2. The work included fatigue testing of both individual wires and full cross-section conductors in tension-tension and tension-bending modes. Moreover, fatigue strength assessments by employing 3 D finite element and analytical methods were performed to attempt bridging the gap between individual wire fatigue test data and full cross-section conductor fatigue performance. The thesis is composed as a collection of research papers and consists of two parts. The first part presents an introduction to the topic and summarizes the findings of the PhD study. The second part gives the research papers (journal articles). The experimental investigations were divided into three major parts, including: 1. Individual wire fatigue tests in tension-tension mode and in load control applying a constant amplitude with a stress ratio R = 0. 1. The loading was sinusoidal with load frequency f = 2 Hz. The tests were performed for <b>wires</b> taken from <b>centre,</b> inner and outermost layer of the 95 mm 2 cross-section. A similar procedure was employed for testing of the outermost layer of the 300 mm 2 conductor. 2. Full cross-section fatigue tests in tension-tension mode were performed for the 95 mm 2 copper conductor under constant amplitude loading with a stress ratio R = 0. 1, in load control, and at load frequency 2 Hz. 3. Displacement controlled bending fatigue tests of 95 and 300 mm 2 full cross-section conductors were carried out. The specimens were prestressed to 100 MPa mean stress and exposed to reversed bending motion with a constant curvature. The loading was sinusoidal with load frequency f = 0. 4 Hz. The intention of the test was to simulate the loading of a conductor hanging from a floater through a bellmouth (bending stiffener) and subjected to the motions of a floating structure. In this test, all motions were applied in one plane. Moreover, in order to assess the initiation and growth mechanism of fatigue cracks (fatigue failures due to tension-tension and tension-bending loads) fractography was investigated using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) for both 95 mm 2 and 300 mm 2 conductors. Finite element (FE) analysis of individual wires was carried out to investigate the combined effects of surface irregularities resulting from the manufacturing processes and material plasticity on the fatigue performance. The obtained results from FE analysis were used to transform S-N fatigue data based on the nominal stress range to S-N fatigue data based on the actual stress ranges. A series of friction tests of copper wire against copper wire was conducted. The purpose of these tests was to investigate the coefficient of friction. Several constant normal force conditions were applied in the tests. The tangential and normal loads were monitored throughout the tests and the associated coefficient of friction was calculated. A calibration test was used to tune the FE model of the 95 mm 2 and 300 mm 2 copper power conductors. This was performed by investigating the measured axial stiffness vs. FE and analytical results. A copper power conductor with free span length 1000 mm was mounted in a servo-hydraulic test machine. On each individual wire of the outer layer, strain gages were attached for measuring the axial strain. In addition, the specimen was equipped with an extensometer for monitoring the average axial strain of the conductor. FE analysis of both cross-sections was carried out applying the measured coefficient of friction. A simplified description of the contact behaviour was adopted, considering the large contact area resulting from plastic deformations of the wires during manufacturing, and calibrated by the axial tension testing. Numerical simulations and analytical calculations were performed in order {{to bridge the gap between}} the S-N data obtained from full cross-section fatigue tests and S-N data obtained from individual wires fatigue tests...|$|R
40|$|The 'Standard Model' of {{elementary}} particles {{has been a}} very successful theory for the last few decades and has met every experimental test. It incorporates the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory of electroweak interactions and the quantum chromodynamics theory of the strong interactions, and thereby includes all known forces between elementary particles except gravity. The Standard Model includes the 'Higgs' mechanism to endow the particles with mass. This mechanism, however, requires the existence of the 'Higgs boson'. This is the only particle of the Standard Model that has escaped experimental observation, despite many efforts of the last four decades. Current indirect measurements from the experiments at the LEP accelerator at CERN indicate that the mass of the Standard Model Higgs particle falls in the range 114 - 196 GeV / c 2 with a probability of 90 %. The LEP accelerator and its detectors are currently being dismantled to be replaced by the more powerful LHC accelerator and its four new experiments (called ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb). This new accelerator will be a proton-proton collider with a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, and will become operational in 2007. One of the key elements of the LHC physics program is the search for the Standard Model Higgs particle, since {{it is one of the}} corner stones of the model. Numerous Higgs particles will be produced at the LHC, if it exists at all, and its discovery should be possible after a few years of data taking. This thesis is devoted to ATLAS, one of the two general-purpose detectors at the LHC. It focuses on that sub-detector, which will play a crucial role in the analysis of the Higgs decay channel H &# 8594; Z 0 Z 0 &# 8594; µ+µ&# 8722;µ+µ&# 8722; : the muon spectrometer. This specific Higgs decay is an important discovery channel, because of the clear signature that the decay products leave in the detector. This thesis covers the main contributions to the precision with which the momentum of the muons can be measured. The scope is limited to the barrel part of the muon spectrometer. The momentum of a muon is determined by measuring the deflection of the particle in a magnetic field. This is done by measuring three segments along the particle track. The particle momentum is directly related to the 'sagitta', which is defined as the distance from the middle segment to the straight line connecting the two outer segments. The more precise the sagitta is measured, the more precise the muon momentum is determined. For muons with high momentum (1 TeV/c), the precision of the momentum measurement is limited by this sagitta measurement. For muons with lower momentum (< 100 GeV), however, the precision of the measurement is limited by multiple scattering of the muon in the detector material and by fluctuations of its energy loss in the calorimeters (two of the other ATLAS sub-detectors). This thesis presents results on the two main contributions to the precision of the sagitta measurement: the precision of the individual segments measured along the track (i. e. local) and the precision of the relative alignment of the detector elements measuring the segments (i. e. global). The target precision of the momentum measurement is 10 % for a muon with a momentum of 1 TeV/c. This translates into the target precision of the sagitta measurement of 50 µm. This precision is composed of the target precision of 40 µm for the contribution of the segment measurements, and the target precision of 30 µm for the contribution of the alignment. The coordinates of the individual segments in the bending direction of the muon are measured by Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers. An MDT is an aluminium tube with a diameter of 30 mm. It holds a <b>wire</b> at its <b>centre</b> with a precision of 7 µm. The MDTs are precisely assembled to form chambers of various sizes. The largest barrel chamber type ('BOL', constructed at NIKHEF), for example, consists of 432 tubes arranged in two times three layers of 72 tubes, which are 5 m long. A measurement apparatus, the X-ray tomograph, was developed at CERN to measure the precision of the wire positions of a complete MDT chamber. The tomograph measures the wire positions with a precision of a few µm over the full working space of 2. 2 x 0. 6 m 2. The few BOL chambers that have been X-rayed have a precision of 15 µm on the wire positions, which is a remarkable achievement for such a large object (2. 2 x 0. 5 x 5 m 3). A comparison between the results of the X-ray tomograph and the quality control monitoring data taken during chamber assembly reveals a correspondence of better than 7 µm. This justifies that only a limited number of the produced chambers (one in eight) is being measured in the X-ray tomograph. After construction of a BOL chamber, is it tested by operating it in a set-up at NIKHEF using cosmic muons. With this set-up dead and noisy channels can be found, the detection efficiency can be measured, and the uniformity is checked. Eventually the wire positions will also be determined using the cosmic muons. This set-up is also used to measure the resolution of the drift tubes and the precision of the reconstructed muon track segment in a single BOL chamber. The space - time relation of the drift tube is determined in an auto-calibration procedure, with an average left-over systematic deviation of less than 3 µm. The larger systematic deviations near the wire (up to 70 µm) need some more attention, although they are still significantly smaller than the local resolution. The average measured single tube resolution is 82 µm after correction for multiple scattering. This includes errors from the calibration procedure and errors due to the limited precision of the wire positions and is therefore the relevant resolution. The achieved resolution is close to the target resolution of 80 µm. The method that is used to determine the resolution uses only the data of the MDTs themselves. It results in a flat probability distribution, which gives confidence in the method. The average measured precision on the track position is 36 µm after correction for multiple scattering. This is close to the target precision of 32 µm. The detection efficiency of the tubes is excellent (99. 98 %). The hit-on-track inefficiency (5 %) is dominated by &# 948;-electrons ejected by the muons, which mask the real muon hit. Significant systematic tube-to-tube variations in the operation point have been observed, which are related to the (partly serial) gas distribution system, and need further investigation. The 'twin-tube' concept, where two drift tubes are interconnected at the high-voltage end to provide an effective read-out on both sides of the tubes, is shown to provide an adequate second coordinate measurement. It thereby transforms the two-dimensional drift tube chambers into a real three dimensional tracker system. The twin-tube concept is not the ATLAS baseline, but it may actually be implemented in the outer stations of the muon spectrometer. The precision of the global alignment of the MDT chambers has been tested in an experimental set-up called DATCHA, which was assembled at CERN. It consists of one full-size 'tower' of the ATLAS muon spectrometer using prototype detectors, and is equipped with Rasnik alignment systems. The detectors are operational and cosmic muons are used as a reference to compare the Rasniks to. For several controlled displacements of one MDT chamber, the average measured sagitta of the muon tracks is compared to the average sagitta of the Rasnik measurements. It has been demonstrated that the alignment systems are capable of monitoring changes in the geometry with a precision of 11 µm on the muon track sagitta. This achievement has one caveat: it is a relative test, because the Rasniks were not calibrated. It is yet to be demonstrated that the alignment system can provide the absolute corrections using pre-calibrated Rasnik systems, which is what is needed for ATLAS. From the point of view of the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the decay channel H &# 8594; Z 0 Z 0 &# 8594; µ+µ&# 8722;µ+µ&# 8722; (assuming a Higgs mass < 200 GeV), the requirement on the alignment precision could easily be relaxed to 100 µm without any significant loss in the resolution of the muon momentum measurement...|$|R
