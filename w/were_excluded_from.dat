5|$|In 1941 the Soviet Union {{decided to}} cease {{production}} of the 152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10). One of the reasons was the disbanding of the Rifle Corps between August and September 1941 and the consequent removal of the corps artillery. Moreover, all 152mm howitzers <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> divisional artillery. As a result, there was no series production of 152mm howitzers during 1942.|$|E

5|$|Richard's {{succession}} to the estates {{did not go}} undisputed, however. A protracted {{battle over}} parts of the inheritance ensued, particularly with Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset, who had married a daughter from Richard Beauchamp's first marriage. The dispute centred on land, not on the Warwick title, as Henry's half-sisters <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> the succession.|$|E
5|$|Since 1714, Britain {{had shared}} a monarch with Hanover in Germany, but under Salic law women <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> the Hanoverian succession.

He was her heir presumptive until she {{married and had}} a child.|$|E
5|$|The Albanian state led also {{efforts to}} {{establish}} an independent orthodox church, contrary to {{the provisions of the}} Protocol of Corfu and thereby reducing the influence of Greek language in the region.

5|$|A quick {{peace was}} {{essential}} to keep Russia from entering the conflict on Austria's side. Prussia annexed Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, {{and the city of}} Frankfurt. Hesse Darmstadt lost some territory but not its sovereignty. The states south of the Main River (Baden, W체rttemberg, and Bavaria) signed separate treaties requiring them to pay indemnities and to form alliances bringing them into Prussia's sphere of influence. Austria, and most of its allies, <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> the North German Confederation.|$|E
5|$|After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish peers, {{including}} {{those who did not}} sit as representative peers, <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> the House of Commons. Irish peers were more favoured and not subjected to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative peers were allowed to serve in Parliament as representatives of a constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided they gave up their privileges as a peer. Lord Curzon, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage so he would not be debarred from sitting in the House of Commons.|$|E

5|$|Although they <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> {{the formal}} rituals of the temple, laymen still sought to {{interact}} with the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues {{to interact with}} the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.|$|E

On three occasions the county progressed to {{the third round of}} the competition: in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Minor counties teams <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> the competition from the 2006 season; Cornwall's last match was against the Netherlands {{in the first round of}} the 2004 competition.|$|E
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E

5|$|In 1949 a New Zealand M훮ori side toured Australia {{where they}} played three Test matches.

5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} wrote {{that these two}} teeth {{resemble}} multituberculate deciduous anterior upper premolars, particularly second and third premolars (P2 and P3), and used this {{as one of their}} arguments for identifying Ferugliotherium as a multituberculate. However, as with the dentary MACN Pv-RN 975, the two upper premolars <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> Ferugliotherium and identified as multituberculates by Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues after the discovery of the jaw of Sudamerica.

5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> the report. Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed {{to learn that the}} statute of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E

5|$|The Old School faction was {{convinced}} that the Plan of Union with the Congregational churches had undermined Presbyterian doctrine and order. At the 1837 General Assembly, the Old School majority successfully passed resolutions removing all judicatories found under the Plan from the Presbyterian Church. In total, three synods in New York and one synod in Ohio along with 28 presbyteries, 509 ministers, and 60 thousand church members (one-fifth of the PCUSA's membership) <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> <b>from</b> the church. New School leaders reacted by meeting in Auburn, New York, and issuing the Auburn Declaration, a 16-point defense of their Calvinist orthodoxy.|$|E
