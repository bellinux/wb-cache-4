50|$|The Arktika is a double-hulled icebreaker; {{the outer}} hull is 48 mm (1.89 in) thick, the inner 25 mm (0.98 in) thick, {{with the space}} in between {{utilized}} for <b>water</b> <b>ballasting.</b> At the strongest point, the cast steel prow is 50 cm (19 ¾ in) thick and bow-shaped to aid in icebreaking, the curve applying greater dynamic force to fracture the ice than a straight bow would. The maximum ice thickness it can break through is approximately 5 meters (16.4 ft). Like many icebreakers, Arktika also has an Air Bubbling System (ABS) which delivers 24 m3/s of steam from jets 9 m (29.5 ft) below the surface to further aid in the breakup of ice.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an architecture for model-based diagnosis {{that was developed}} during the BEHAVIOR joint project. The focus of BEHAVIOR was the application of model-based knowledge representation and reasoning techniques to the domain of dynamic, technical systems. Within this context, Fraunhofer IITB and the University of Hamburg developed a tool box to integrate different modeling approaches {{to be used in}} model-based diagnosis. Toward this end, a diagnostic engine derived from the general framework Generic Diagnostic Engine (GenDE) was used. This engine was able to treat all model types uniformly. The basic approach for modeling the behavior of the system was to focus on the components, supplemented by an approach that focused on the processes. This allowed modeling of the domain using either components, processes, or combinations of both. In addition, models of spatial interactions were used to describe structural changes for diagnostic purposes. This repertory was supplemented by a language that described combinations of quantitative and qualitative descriptions. This approach, along with the use of event models, was used to describe the kinds of behavior that are difficult to explain using purely quantitative methods. The functionality and usefulness of the integrated approach was demonstrated using the domain of <b>water</b> <b>ballasting</b> systems. <b>Water</b> <b>ballasting</b> systems can be found on offshore-platforms or ships. The purpose of such systems is to keep the platform or ship balanced even when the sea is rough or when moving heavy loads. The <b>water</b> <b>ballasting</b> system of the ship under investigation consisted of more than 40 tanks. Example faults from this domain were used that required several modeling and analysis methods...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} an architecture for model-based diagnosis {{that was developed}} during the joint three year project BEHAVIOR. The focus of this project was to apply model-based knowledge representation and reasoning to the domain of dynamic, technical systems. The project concentrated {{on the development of}} techniques for modeling, analysis of behavior and fault diagnosis. One main focus was post-mortem diagnosis, i. e. fault localization when a system is known to have failed. The approach of Fraunhofer IITB and the University of Hamburg was to use different types of models and methods of analysis, but to treat them uniformly with the diagnostic engine. The main goal was to develop a tool box for model-based diagnosis that allowed different approaches for modeling a domain. The project was tested using examples from the domain of <b>water</b> <b>ballasting</b> systems...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{tractive}} efficiency (TE) of MF 285 and U 650 tractors during moldboard plowing were evaluated and compared. Field experiments were {{conducted at the}} Experimental Station, College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, using a randomized complete block design with a 3 * 3 factorial. The soil was sandy clay loam with an average moisture content of 18 % b. d. from zero to 30 cm depth. Test treatments were combinations of three tractor types or conditions (U 650, MF 285 liquid ballasted and MF 285 with no liquid or weight ballast) and three levels of plowing depth (10 - 15 cm, 15 - 20 cm and 20 - 25 cm). Plowing speed was kept constant at about 4 km/h throughout the experiment. The measured or calculated parameters included: tractor drawbar pull and rolling resistance, drive wheel slip and tractor tractive efficiency. Statistical analysis of the test {{results showed that the}} primary difference between the tractor types or conditions was in their wheel slip, such that the average wheel slip of U 650 was lowest (12. 6 %) while that of unballasted MF 285 was highest (27 %) and was reduced to 17. 7 % with liquid ballasting. Also, while growth of unballasted MF 285 wheel slip with increasing plowing depth was drastically high (11 % to 48 %), that of U 650 was quite moderate (9. 7 % to 16. 5 %). Analysis of the calculated values of TE showed that there was no significant changes in the TE of U 650 with increasing plowing depth and that with an average of 73. 8 %, it had a desirable performance. The TE of unballasted MF 285 that was over 75 % at shallow plowing, dropped to 46 % with increasing plowing depth, while <b>water</b> <b>ballasting</b> improved the decreasing trend of TE with plowing depth and raised its minimum value to about 63 %. The overall results of this study showed that unballasted MF 285 tractors had desirable TE only at shallow plowing and that for medium and deep plowing, U 650 or water ballasted MF 285 tractors should be used...|$|E
50|$|Modern {{competition}} gliders carry jettisonable <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> (in {{the wings}} and sometimes in the vertical stabilizer). The extra weight provided by the <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> is advantageous if the lift {{is likely to be}} strong, and may also be used to adjust the glider's center of mass. Moving the center of mass toward the rear by carrying water in the vertical stabilizer reduces the required down-force from the horizontal stabilizer and the resultant drag from that down-force. Although heavier gliders have a slight disadvantage when climbing in rising air, they achieve a higher speed at any given glide angle. This is an advantage in strong conditions when the gliders spend only a small amount of time climbing in thermals. The pilot can jettison the <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> before it becomes a disadvantage in weaker thermal conditions. Another use of <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> is to dampen air turbulence such as might be encountered during ridge soaring. To avoid undue stress on the airframe, gliders must jettison any <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> before landing.|$|R
