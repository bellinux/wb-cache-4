5|$|Fürst Bismarck was {{designed}} before the naval arms race between Germany and the United Kingdom. Admiral Hollmann <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Secretary of the Naval Office at the time.

5|$|Migratory {{groups of}} Native Americans {{inhabited}} {{the area for}} thousands of years, but the first permanent settlements in what would become Harrison County were created by American settlers {{in the years after}} the American Revolutionary War. The population grew rapidly during first decade of the 19thcentury. Corydon was officially platted in 1808 and became the capital of the Indiana Territory in 1813. Many of the state's early important historic events occurred in the county, including the writing of Indiana's first constitution.

5|$|SR167 was {{designated}} in 1923 as a short connector from SR 7 to the Pennsylvania state line east of Richmond Center, an unincorporated village. In 1928, the route was rerouted from Jefferson to the Pennsylvania state line east of Pierpoint. The new western terminus was in SR 46/84 (now SR 307) in Jefferson, {{and the eastern}} terminus <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> line, north of Richmond Center. The route became concurrent with US6 beginning in 1932, between SR7 and the Pennsylvania state line. In 1939, the highway was rerouted north of its concurrency with US 6, replacing SR 538. In about 1969, SR 11 opened at SR 167 as an at-grade intersection, and seven years later, an interchange replaced the intersection. Between 1979 and 1981, the route was rerouted to {{the north side of}} Jefferson to its current alignment.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{returning}} to Brazil, PedroII was faced with an unexpected crisis. The Brazilian clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, leading to a great loss {{of respect for the}} Catholic Church. The imperial government had embarked upon a program of reform to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> religion, the government exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs, paying clerical salaries, appointing parish priests, nominating bishops, ratifying papal bulls and overseeing seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops who satisfied its criteria for education, support for reform and moral fitness. However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased.|$|E

5|$|The two commanders {{believed}} that training by both airborne troops and aircrews could {{be completed by}} the end of February, when there would be suitable meteorological conditions for such an operation to take place.

5|$|Before the {{formation}} of I-70, there was a road over the Pavant Range numbered SR-13 that {{was similar to the}} route of I-70. The highway, which largely still exists as a two-lane road between SR-161 (former US-91) at Cove Fort and US-89 at Sevier, had been taken over by the state on August 2, 1912, and assigned the label by the early 1920s as part of Utah's initial highway numbering. In the Wasatch Plateau, the base for I-70 was derived from a portion of SR-10. Both of these were transferred to State Route4, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> legislative designation for all of I-70 in Utah, in 1962. U.S. Route50 was changed to overlap with Interstate70 through most of Utah in 1976, with U.S. Route6 remaining on its former route. In 1977, Utah renumbered its state routes so that the legislative and signed numbers would match. With this change, the state designation for Interstate70 is now State Route70.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{returned}} to Australia and led New South Wales to the Sheffield Shield title in 1953–54. He topped the Australian first-class batting averages with 71.10, but had his poorest {{season with the}} ball, taking only 16wickets at 38.75. The season was purely domestic with no touring side and therefore no Test matches. The season was also a transition point in Australian cricket, as Hassett retired upon return to Australia. Initially, Morris and Miller were the two frontrunners for the captaincy. Miller <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> captain, but Morris was the vice-captain of the Test team ahead of Miller. At the time, Johnson had been dropped from the Australian team, but inherited the Victorian captaincy from Hassett, who accused him of not trying. Hassett told Johnson that he could become Test captain if he regained his form and his Test position. As the outgoing captain, Hassett was believed to have an influence over the selection of his successor. Miller had also criticised Hassett in his book, and there was talk that Hassett was upset about Miller's departure from South Melbourne and Victoria. Johnson {{returned to}} form with 45wickets at 22.75 for the season.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} measures Daniels successfully pushed through <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> adoption of Daylight Saving Time, which Daniels argued would save the state money on energy costs. Although the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, Indiana's counties had adopted their own time zone practices, and in practice the state effectively observed two different times, and {{the central part of the}} state maintained a single time—Eastern Standard—year round. Interests for both EST and CST time zones had prevented the official adoption of daylight saving since the 1930s, and had led to decades of debate. Daniels pressed for the entire state to switch to Central Time, but the General Assembly could not come to terms. Ultimately after a long debate, they adopted Eastern Daylight Saving Time in April 2005, the measure passing by one vote, putting all but northwestern and southwestern Indiana on the same time for the first time.|$|E
