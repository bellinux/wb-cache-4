This online trend developed also in the way companies interact with their customers by means of Internet platforms, or in the form of e-commerce.

The study analyzes the differences in the risk perception and the willingness to buy online in the future depending on gender, age or income. The way in which consumers perceive risks affects the company's marketing strategy, because if consumers see a greater risk in online transactions, the probability that they will buy online decreases.

40|$|Any {{discussion}} about designing output-based aid schemes {{must begin with}} an understanding of the underlying strategy—in particular, how it differs from traditional ways of funding and delivering public services. Traditional approaches to providing health, education, infrastructure, and other public services channel public funding (whether sourced from domes-tic taxpayers or international development assistance) to the labor, materials, and other inputs consumed by state-owned monopolies, with at best indirect links between funding and the delivery of services. In the developing world especially, results have often been disappointing. Incentives for efficiency and innovation have been weak. Accountability for performance has been dismal. And opportunities for leveraging scarce public resources through private financing have been limited. Output-based aid seeks to address these weaknesses by delegating service delivery to a third party under contracts that link payment to the outputs or results delivered. It thus has the potential to improve incentives and account-ability while also expanding opportunities for mobilizing private financing. The focus shifts not only from inputs to outputs, but also toward the Holy Grail of development outcomes. From strategy to implementation The extent to which the potential benefits of output-based aid can be real-ized depends critically on the design of individual schemes. There are no standard models or blueprints, and approaches need to be adapted to the characteristics of the service and to the environment in which it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>delivered.</b> As <b>with</b> any policy intervention, the design of output-based aid schemes often involves tradeoffs between goals—such as providing high-powered incentives for efficiency, attracting sufficient interest from service providers, ensuring effective monitoring of performance, and minimizin...|$|R

40|$|Background Primary radiochemotherapy with photons is the {{standard}} treatment for locally advanced-stage {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) patients. Acute radiation-induced side effects such as oesophagitis and radiation pneumonitis limit patients’ quality of life, and the latter can be potentially life-threatening. Due to its distinct physical characteristics, proton therapy enables better sparing of normal tissues, which is supposed to translate into a reduction of radiation-induced side effects. Methods/design This is a single-centre, prospective, randomised controlled, phase II clinical trial to compare photon to proton radiotherapy up to 66 Gy (RBE) with concomitant standard chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced-stage NSCLC. Patients <b>will</b> <b>be</b> allocated in a 1 : 1 ratio to photon or proton therapy, and treatment <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>delivered</b> slightly accelerated <b>with</b> six fractions of 2 Gy (RBE) per week. Discussion The overall aim of the study is to show a decrease of early and intermediate radiation-induced toxicity using proton therapy. For the primary endpoint of the study we postulate a decrease of radiation-induced side effects (oesophagitis and pneumonitis grade II or higher) from 39 to 12 %. Secondary endpoints are locoregional and distant failure, overall survival and late side effects.

40|$|Background Depression {{appears to}} be more {{enduring}} amongst people with intellectual disabilities, suggesting that it is a more chronic problem or more poorly managed in this population. This is not helped by a lack of evidence about the effectiveness of psychological therapies for people who have intellectual disabilities and depression. Behavioural activation, which aims to counteract depression by increasing individuals’ level of meaningful activity and their exposure to positive reinforcers, has proven to be as effective as cognitive behavioural therapy in the general population. Given that this therapy makes fewer communicative demands and focuses on activity, it was thought that behavioural activation would be both accessible and apt for people with intellectual disabilities, who are often socially marginalised. Methods/Design This study is a multi-centre single-blind randomised controlled trial of behavioural activation versus a self-help attention control intervention for depression in adults with mild/moderate intellectual disabilities. The study has an internal pilot in one centre, to establish that recruitment can be built up and sustained at the required level, before being rolled out across the other sites. One hundred sixty-six participants <b>will</b> <b>be</b> randomly assigned to the behavioural activation or self-help interventions, which <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>delivered</b> to individuals <b>with</b> mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, accompanied by someone who provides them with regular support. Both interventions <b>are</b> manualised and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>delivered</b> over a period of approximately 4 months. The primary outcome measure <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the Glasgow Depression Scale, a self-report measure which is completed at baseline and 4 and 12 months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes include measures of participants’ activity levels, proxy reports of depressive symptoms, and cost-effectiveness. Discussion The study will provide evidence about the effectiveness of behavioural activation for depression, adapted for people who have mild/moderate intellectual disabilities, and will inform the delivery of psychological therapies to people with intellectual disabilities in practice...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to observe the {{response}} of Western Blacknose Dace (R. obtusus) to a turbulent flow field by comparing their swim paths to selected flow metrics in the hopes of garnering relationships between the two that could improve future research project designs. Experiments were carried out in a hydraulic flume populated with baffle-like obstructions under various flow conditions into which the dace were released. Fish movement was tracked with video cameras to catalog swim-paths, and acoustic Doppler velocimeter measurements were taken to characterize the hydraulic conditions encountered by the swimming dace. The motivation for this study was the need for biologically-based criteria to compare against results obtained from computational fluids dynamics (CFD) models. The ability to compare CFD model outputs to species-specific behavioral and performance-based criteria can facilitate more accurate evaluations from a fish passage perspective, increasing the likelihood of enhanced passage efficiencies at hydraulic structures such as recessed or baffled culverts and bypass channels. Preliminary results indicate that multiple flow parameters or metrics <b>will</b> <b>be</b> required to predict fish paths given the character of the flow measurements obtained here and the lack of a priori behavioral knowledge of this species.
