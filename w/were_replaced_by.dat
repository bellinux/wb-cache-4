5|$|Although the {{essential}} problem of large tribal {{groups on the}} frontier remained {{much the same as}} the situation Rome faced in earlier centuries, the 3rd century saw a marked increase in the overall threat, although there is disagreement over whether external pressure increased, or Rome's ability to meet it declined.

5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{to make the}} river suitable for coasters began in 1856, when Edward Leader Williams was appointed as engineer. He oversaw the complete reconstruction of the navigation between 1870 and 1900, a programme {{which was designed to}} ensure that the river remained attractive to carriers, and which ensured its profitability. The 12 locks of the 1830s <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> five much larger locks, and most of the bridges <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> swing bridges, which enabled coasters of up to 1000 tons to use the river.|$|E

5|$|After {{the rise}} of the {{imperial}} Chalukyas of Badami, the Gangas accepted Chalukya overlordship and fought for the cause of their overlords against the Pallavas of Kanchi. The Chalukyas <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta in 753 CE as the dominant power in the Deccan. After a century of struggle for autonomy, the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought alongside them against their foes, the Chola Dynasty of Tanjavur. In the late 10th century, north of Tungabhadra river, the Rashtrakutas <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the emerging Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the Kaveri river. The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region.|$|E

In 1910, Tokiwas boilers <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Miyabara water-tube boilers and her six-inch guns <b>were</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> Japanese-built models.
