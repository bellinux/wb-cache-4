25|$|The {{evolutionary}} history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said 'Don't be ridiculous'. These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will {{come along and}} tell it much better than I did, but I do hope that if people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still {{have something to say}} about the <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, James {{was forced}} to leave the US under threat of {{deportation}} for having overstayed his visa. In his attempt to remain in America, James wrote a study of Herman Melville, Mariners, Renegades and Castaways: The Story of Herman Melville and the <b>World</b> <b>We</b> <b>Live</b> In, and had copies of the privately published work sent to every member of the Senate. He wrote the book while being detained on Ellis Island. In an impassioned letter to his old friend George Padmore, James said that in Mariners that he was using Moby Dick as a parable for the anticommunism sweeping the United State, a consequence, he thought, of Americans' uncritical faith in capitalism.|$|E

25|$|On the whole, {{industrialisation}} in Germany must {{be considered}} to have been positive in its effects. Not only did it change society and the countryside, and finally the world...it created the modern <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in. It solved the problems of population growth, under-employment and pauperism in a stagnating economy, and abolished dependency on the natural conditions of agriculture, and finally hunger. It created huge improvements in production and both short- and long-term improvements in living standards. However, {{in terms of social}} inequality, it can be assumed that it did not change the relative levels of income. Between 1815 and 1873 the statistical distribution of wealth was on the order of 77% to 23% for entrepreneurs and workers respectively. On the other hand, new problems arose, in the form of interrupted growth and new crises, such as urbanisation, 'alienation', new underclasses, proletariat and proletarian misery, new injustices and new masters and, eventually, class warfare.|$|E

The illustration is from the famed space artist Chesley Bonestell and carries the caption: [...] "Purple Pleione, a star of the familiar Pleiades cluster, rotates so rapidly that it has flattened into a flying saucer and hurled forth a dark red ring of hydrogen. Where the excited gas crosses Pleione's equator, it obscures her violet light." ...|$|E

The appearance of the interrogation room where Cole is being interviewed by the scientists {{was based on the}} work of Lebbeus Woods; these scenes were shot at three different power stations (two in Philadelphia and one in Baltimore). Gilliam intended to show Cole being interviewed through a multi-screen interrogation TV set because he felt the machinery evoked a [...] "nightmarish intervention of technology. You try to see the faces on the screens in front of you, but the real faces and voices are down there and you have these tiny voices in your ear.

Arjona commented that [...] "'Quién' is the world {{out of the window}} and the prison built by ourselves. It's the freedom to choose the path or to prefer loneliness as an argument of nostalgia. 'Quién' is a story with the hurry of the desperate, is the flashback of those who end up loving alone." [...] "Quiero", also written by Arjona, was released as the second single in November 2007. Website ADN Mundo called the song bohemian and hippie, and that it was [...] "a love story that doesn't speak about love, but instead about the recent events on the <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> [...] and finally comes to the search of an individual who challenges nostalgia finding entertainment on the impossible."
