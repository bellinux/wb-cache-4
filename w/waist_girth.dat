Study subjects were 850 active males, aged 22 – 66 years; 88. 4 % of them answered the question on breathing pauses during sleep from a structured, validated sleep questionnaire. Forty-one (= 5. 4 %) subjects reported breathing pauses at least once a week; these “positive responders” were older, heavier and had larger neck- and <b>waist</b> <b>girths</b> as compared to subjects with negative answers. Loud habitual snoring, various sleep disturbances, excessive daytime sleepiness, a doctor diagnosis of sleep apnoea, history of stroke and hypertension were significantly more frequent among subjects with breathing pauses during sleep. The prevalence found in this survey was close to that reported from the UK (5. 2 %). However, by logistic regression, we identified novel determinants of breathing pauses i. e. habitual snoring, loud snoring, and excessive sleepiness, factors well known in clinical setting, but never previously reported in epidemiologic studies...|$|R

40|$|Information on {{body size}} and shape is used to {{interpret}} many aspects of physiology, including nutritional status, cardio-metabolic risk and lung function. Such data have traditionally been obtained through manual anthropometry, which becomes time-consuming when many measurements are required. 3 D photonic scanning (3 D-PS) of body surface topography represents an alternative digital technique, previously applied successfully in large studies of adults. The acceptability, precision and accuracy of 3 D-PS in young children have not been assessed. We attempted to obtain data on girth, width and depth of the chest and <b>waist,</b> and <b>girth</b> of the knee and calf, manually and by 3 D-PS in a multi-ethnic sample of 1484 children aged 5 - 11 years. The rate of 3 D-PS success, and reasons for failure, were documented. Precision and accuracy of 3 D-PS were assessed relative to manual measurements using the methods of Bland and Altman. Manual measurements were successful in all cases. Although 97. 4 % of children agreed to undergo 3 D-PS, successful scans were only obtained in 70. 7 % of these. Unsuccessful scans were primarily due to body movement, or inability of the software to extract shape outputs. The odds of scan failure, and the underlying reason, differed by age, size and ethnicity. 3 D-PS measurements tended to be greater than those obtained manually (p 0. 90 for most outcomes). 3 D-PS is acceptable in children aged ≥ 5 years, though with current hardware/software, and body movement artefacts, approximately one third of scans may be unsuccessful. The technique had poorer technical success than manual measurements, and had poorer precision when the measurements were viable. Compared to manual measurements, 3 D-PS showed modest average biases but acceptable limits of agreement for large surveys, and little evidence that bias varied substantially with size.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown smokers to weigh less than non-smokers, which is {{plausible}} given the metabolic effects of cigarette smoke. The interrelation between smoking and relative body weight and its change over time were analysed by using data from Finnish population based surveys from 1982 and 1987. Among {{both men and women}} the inverse association between smoking and body mass index was clearly weakened between 1982 and 1987. In 1987 among men aged 25 - 44 smoking was positively related to body mass index. Moreover, the relation between smoking and <b>waist</b> to hip <b>girth</b> ratio was positive in both sexes at all ages. Years of smoking was nevertheless confirmed as a significant inverse predictor of relative weight. A cluster of unfavourable health habits, including high consumption of alcohol and saturated fats, especially emerged among younger smokers. This may have been due to different selection of smokers in Finland, where smoking increasingly seems to be a form of deviant or risk taking behaviour. It is concluded that at a population level the metabolic effects of smoking seem to be increasingly overridden by several other unfavourable health behaviours of smokers...|$|R

40|$|Background: Whether {{abdominal}} {{obesity is}} related to coronary artery calcification (CAC) is not known. Objective: We investigated the relations of <b>waist</b> <b>girth</b> and waist-hip ratio (WHR) to CAC in 2951 African American and white young adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study. Design: The present study was a cross-sectional and observational cohort study. Using standardized protocols, we measured CAC in 2001 – 2002 by using computed tomography and measured waist and hip girths in 1985 – 1986 (baseline), 1995 – 1996 (year 10), and 2001 – 2002 (year 15, <b>waist</b> <b>girth</b> only). CAC was classified as present or absent, whereas <b>waist</b> <b>girth</b> and WHR were placed in sex-specific tertiles. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, race, clinical center, physical activity, cigarette smoking, education, and alcohol intake, baseline <b>waist</b> <b>girth</b> and WHR were directly associated with a higher preva-lence of CAC 15 y later (P for trend 0. 001 for both). The odds ratios (ORs) for CAC in the highest versus lowest tertiles of <b>waist</b> <b>girth</b> and WHR were 1. 9 (95 % CI: 1. 36, 2. 65) and 1. 7 (1. 23, 2. 41), respectively. <b>Waist</b> <b>girth</b> and WHR at year 10 and <b>waist</b> <b>girth</b> at year 15 similarly predicted CAC. These associations persisted after ad-ditional adjustment for systolic blood pressure, fasting insulin con-centrations, diabetes, and antihypertensive medication use but be-came nonsignificant after additional adjustment for blood lipids. Conclusions: Abdominal obesity measured by <b>waist</b> <b>girth</b> or WHR is associated with early atherosclerosis {{as measured by the}} presence of CAC in African American and white young adults.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if there is a significant variance between the results of two differing methods of determining <b>waist</b> <b>girth</b> measurements and how this variance impacts a subject's disease risk stratification. Past research has shown a correlation between the absolute <b>waist</b> <b>girth</b> measurement and an increased risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The standard measurement used for determining <b>waist</b> <b>girth</b> uses the narrowest location between the xyphoid process (tip of the sternum) and the umbilicus (belly button). Recent guidelines published by the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA) have altered the procedures for locating the <b>waist</b> <b>girth</b> measurement. This measurement requires the professional to measure the subject at the level of the iliac crest (top most point of the ilium or hip bone). The waists of one hundred one subjects were assessed at the two sites described above. In addition, the height, weight, age and gender of each subject were recorded. Comparisons were made among the subjects by dividing them into categories according BMI classification, gender, and age.

In each selected village, 200 individuals aged ≥ 45 years were chosen based on simple random sampling method. From 6006 individuals, information on demographic characteristics, smoking and drinking status was obtained by interview. Blood pressure, height, weight, and <b>waist</b> and hip <b>girth</b> were measured. Fasting blood sugar was measured in a 10 -percent subsample. Contextual data were from official reports. Multi-level regression modelling with adjustment for individual and contextual variables was used. Results Contextual variables associated with CVD risk factors included: remoteness of village with higher blood pressure and fasting blood sugar, high proportion of Yi minority with drinking, high literacy rate with a lower rate of smoking and a lower mean waist-hip ratio, and high average income with lower systolic blood pressure and body mass index (BMI) but higher FBS.

Furthermore, 33 normal weight or slightly overweight subjects (23 male, 10 female) were studied as a control group. Obese subjects of both sexes were found to have higher values of WHR than non-obese; conversely visceral:subcutaneous fat area ratio (VSR) values did not differ significantly. Significant correlation between WHR and BMI was present both in males (r = 0. 41, P < 0. 01) and in females (r = 0. 54, P < 0. 01). In normal weight males significant correlations between WHR and visceral fat area or VSR were found. In obese males these correlations were much weaker. In normal weight females a significant correlation was found between waist circumference and visceral fat area, whereas in obese females no positive correlations were found between anthropometric measurements and CT indices of visceral fat distribution.

Purpose: To determine the prevalence of HTGW and the influence of fitness on the relationship between HTGW and coronary risk among 137 healthy women (54 ± 9 year; body mass index (BMI) = 28 ± 6 kg/m 2). Methods: HTGW was defined as <b>waist</b> <b>girth</b> > 88 cm and TG > 150 mg/dl. The metabolic triad was defined as insulin > 31 pmol/l, Apo B > 69 mg/dl and LDL-C > 84 mg/dl. Fitness was assessed with a maximal treadmill exercise test. Results: The sample prevalence of HTGW (n= 15) was 11 % (95 % CI= 5. 7 – 16. 0 %). Apo B (P= 0. 04) and insulin (P= 0. 0001) increased across quintiles of <b>waist</b> <b>girth,</b> and LDL-C (P= 0. 004) increased across quintiles of TG. Metabolic triad prevalence was highest (67 %, n= 10) among HTGW women and lowest (22 %, n= 26) among non-HTGW women. A trend for higher coronary heart disease CHD risk factors was observed among HTGW compared with non-HTGW women. Among the HTGW group, a trend for lower CHD risk factors was observed among fit (≥ 6. 5 METs, n= 7) versus unfit women...|$|E
40|$|Independently of {{the amount}} of adipose tissue, certain {{patterns}} of fat distribution increase the risk of non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Although the ratio of waist to hip (WHR) circumferences has been consistently related to diabetes mellitus, it is possible that only two measures do not completely characterize fat topography. The current study, therefore, examines the cross-sectional relation of six <b>girths</b> (<b>waist,</b> hip, neck, bust, wrist, and ankle) to diabetes mellitus in 43, 595 women. As compared with non-diabetics, Quetelet index (kg/m 2) and all circumferences were elevated among diabetics. Stratified analyses showed that WHR, and waist, neck, and bust girths were consistently related to diabetes independently of the degree of overweight. As estimated from a logistic regression model that simultaneously controlled for age and all anthropometric variables, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was positively related to Quetelet index, and to the waist, bust, and neck girths, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1. 4 to 2. 6. However, diabetes was inversely related to hip (OR = 0. 61) and ankle (OR = 0. 73) girths; p less than 0. 005 for each association. Although cross-sectional in nature, these results suggest that an adverse body fat distribution {{is not limited to the}} abdominal region, but that a relative preponderance of adipose tissue in various regions of the upper body is associated with diabetes mellitus in women...|$|R
40|$|Aim:  To develop {{prediction}} equations {{for total}} and regional (trunk, abdominal, arms and legs) body fat using surface anthropometric measures in children aged 6 – 17 years. Methods:  This was a cross-sectional correlation study of 70 Caucasian children aged 6 – 17 years recruited {{from a larger}} randomly sampled population-based study. The independent variables included age, mass, height, body mass index, <b>waist</b> and hip <b>girth,</b> and skinfold thicknesses at eight sites. Subscapular/triceps skinfold ratio was also calculated and entered as an independent variable. The dependent variables were total body percentage fat, and fat mass for total body, trunk, abdominal region of interest, arms and legs measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Partial least squares regression {{was used to determine}} the best predictive equation for fat percentage or fat mass in each body region in each sex. Results:  Sex-specific prediction equations were developed with high coefficients of determination (r²), ranging from 0. 869 to 0. 936 in boys and from 0. 900 to 0. 979 in girls, absolute bias was low, and limits of agreement were narrow. Conclusion:  Equations were developed, which were able to predict total and regional body fat of Caucasian children aged 6 – 17 years using surface anthropometric measurements with high predictive accuracy.

40|$|AbstractPoor adiposities are {{risk factors}} for major morbidities, but reports on how these relate with gait {{function}} of stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation is sparse and need further investigation. A convenience sample of 94 ambulatory stroke survivors and 94 matched apparently healthy individuals were assessed for adiposity markers (body mass index, <b>waist</b> circumference, thigh <b>girth,</b> waist-hip ratio, and percent body fat) and gait parameters (cadence, step length, stride length, stride width, gait velocity, and cycle). Mean age of the stroke and apparently healthy participants were 57 ± 5. 2 years and 56. 9 ± 4. 8 years, respectively. We found significant (p< 0. 05) relationships between waist circumference and each of gait cycle (r= 0. 67) namely, cadence (r=− 0. 68), stride length (− 0. 62), step length (− 0. 61), and gait velocity (− 0. 75). Fairly similar correlations existed between body mass index, waist-hip ratio, percent body fat, thigh girth, and each of gait parameters, with only the thigh girth significantly correlating with stride width (r= 0. 79). Obesity more than triples the odds of low gait velocities (odds ratio: 3. 28; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 60 – 6. 74). Findings provide clinicians with likely influence of adiposities on gait parameters of stroke patients. This may inform treatment decision and help to prioritize interventions through adiposity management for stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation...|$|R
