500|$|Eve's {{character}} and storylines initially elicited {{a positive response}} from Passions cast members. Johnson praised the show for its use of its African American characters like Eve. He appreciated the show's representation of [...] "a full African American family" [...] on daytime television with serious storylines, not [...] "just a flash in the pan". According to Johnson, the Russell family was also well-received by African American viewers. He said {{the chance to work}} with Tracey Ross, who he called the it girl for the African American community following her appearance on Star Search, influenced his acceptance of the role. Marshall commented on the absurdity of her character's rivalry with Eve, particularly their fight in the Crane mansion. She went on to praise Ross' acting, and said: [...] "t's a gift as an actor to have a good relationship with your scene partner when you're always the aggressor because you can go <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to go and not be afraid." ...|$|E
500|$|Heller was {{responsible}} for writing the episode's voice-over, despite his dislike of the task. He said that despite it being his [...] "400th version," [...] he was [...] "still not happy with it." [...] He believed that an early scene in which spoils are distributed from a cart in front of Pompey represented the first real sense of how the series would depict city life. He said, [...] "I {{think this is the}} first time that we get sense of the version of Rome that the show is pushing," [...] which was a very different version than viewers may have been used to. To him, Rome was [...] "colorful and painted" [...] and cosmopolitan. A later scene featuring Cicero the Younger in the Senate proved difficult to film because of the large number of Italian extras who did not speak English. In the DVD audio commentary, he said that [...] "this is one of those scenes <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> really great assistant directors, because all of these Italian extras who have no idea whatsoever what [...] saying, so to keep them interested and focused and concentrated on what's going on is a real trick." ...|$|E

500|$|Marshall based her {{understanding}} of Liz on the character's relationship with Eve, which served as the primary focus for her character development and story arcs. Liz was initially {{not included in the}} show's descriptions of Eve's past. In the 2001 tie-in novel , Eve is characterized as the only child of [...] "too-busy Harvard history Professor Warren Johnson and journalist Tanya Lincoln Johnson". Marshall felt Liz was irredeemable for her actions against Eve and her love interest Julian Crane. Interpreting the character as having a form of mental illness due to her repeated sexual abuse, Marshall said that [...] "very emotion she has it twisted". Ross added to Marshall's commentary by recommending that Liz should get [...] "some serious electroshock therapy". Marshall found Liz's rivalry with Eve to be absurd, particularly a scene in which they fight in the Crane mansion. She went on to praise her working relationship with Ross, saying: [...] "t's a gift as an actor to have a good relationship with your scene partner when you're always the aggressor because you can go <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to go and not be afraid." ...|$|E

Steve Taffe, manager of instructional strategy at MECC, a developer and publisher of educational software, explained his excitement about the Classic: [...] " [...] is terrific – both because it's a Mac {{and because of that}} low price. Everyone can now afford a Macintosh." [...] Scholastic, an educational software developer, was also confident of Apple's ability to compete with MS-DOS machines, stating: [...] "They are just as cost-effective and as powerful as MS-DOS computers, but the Apples will have a superior comfort-level." [...] Sue Talley, Apple's manager of strategic planning in education, said of the Classic: [...] "we see it going into applications <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> a fair number of powerful stations, but where color is not a big issue." [...] Talley mentioned that it was most suited for writing labs and other basic productivity uses. Many schools decided not to buy the Macintosh Classic {{because of the lack of}} a color monitor, an option which the higher-priced Macintosh LC had. The popular Apple IIe Card also increased the LC's appeal to schools. Although the Classic was more popular at first, by May 1992 the LC (560,000 sold) was outselling the Classic (1.2 million).|$|E

I {{do not mean}} merely {{glittering}} or brilliant: {{it is easy to}} scratch white seagulls out of black clouds, and dot clumsy foliage with chalky dew; but when white is well managed, it ought to be strangely delicious,--tender as well as bright,--like inlaid mother of pearl, or white roses washed in milk. The eye ought to seek it for rest, brilliant though it may be; and to feel it as a space of strange, heavenly paleness {{in the midst of the}} flushing of the colors. This effect you can only reach by general depth of middle tint, by absolutely refusing to allow any white to exist except <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> it, and by keeping the white itself subdued by gray, except at a few points of chief luster.|$|E

My sons have often landed there, for we do a certain trade in the summer from the island in fish and other matters with the natives there. If it pleases you my son Ronald, who is hardy and intelligent, shall land with you and accompany you as your retainer while you remain in Ireland. The people there speak a language quite different to that which you use in the lowlands of Scotland and in England, but the language we speak among ourselves closely resembles it, and we can be easily understood by the people of the mainland.
