5|$|Ostrach {{was a small}} village, with a {{population}} of 300. The village belonged to the Cistercian Imperial Abbey of Salem, an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on Lake Constance. The village was largely dedicated to farming, although a stretch of the imperial post road connected it and Pfullendorf. A <b>wide,</b> <b>flat</b> plain, marshy in places, stretched between the base of the Pfullendorf heights and the village; low lying hills ringed the valley, which was creased by a small stream from which the village takes its name. Ostrach itself lies almost at the northern end of this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. The two armies faced each other across this small and, at that time of that year, very soggy valley.|$|E
5|$|The building's western façade has {{a central}} {{entryway}} with double doors, {{topped by a}} six-light transom and flanked by engaged pilasters. Its gable, sheathed in aluminum siding, incorporates a gabled pediment and the building's perimeter {{is surrounded by a}} <b>wide,</b> <b>flat</b> frieze. The building's southern elevation has wooden windows with 12-over-12 double-hung sashes on brick window sills. Its basement level has one entrance, flanked by wooden double-hung sash windows and four casement windows. The northeastern elevation has three stained-glass windows on the main level, with three wooden eight-over-eight double-hung sash windows; a single wooden six-over-six double-hung sash window is in the gable. The building is roofed with asphalt shingles, and a brick chimney is along the slope of the northern elevation's roof line. Its northeastern elevation has five wooden 16-over-16 double-hung sash windows on the main level and four on the lower level, in addition to two wooden four-over-four sash windows.|$|E
5|$|The road then {{continues}} roughly north and crosses a largely open area of pasture. The SouthCare emergency helicopter is stationed {{to the east}} of the road not far after its intersection with Lanyon Drive, and further on, a prison is located to the west. Approaching the northern end of the pasture, Jerrabomberra Creek flows to the east. At the northern end is the Hindmarsh Drive interchange. The highway passes underneath Hindmarsh Drive and continues over Jerrabomberra Creek. A further interchange, passing over Canberra Avenue is a little further on, along with an overpass above the Canberra railway line branch, and an interchange above Newcastle Street. The road then doglegs across a <b>wide</b> <b>flat</b> and terminates at Morshead Drive, just across the Molonglo River. In 2010 the average annual daily traffic count was approximately 43,000 vehicles per day, at this final section just prior to the northern terminus.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1620s, styles were relaxing. Ruffs were {{discarded}} {{in favor}} of wired collars which were called rebatos in continental Europe and, later, <b>wide,</b> <b>flat</b> collars. By the 1630s and 1640s, collars were accompanied by kerchiefs similar to the linen kerchiefs worn by middle-class women in the previous century; often the collar and kerchief were trimmed with matching lace.|$|E
25|$|The SBR {{property}} {{was once the}} site of extensive coal mining, an industry for which the state of West Virginia is known. The remnants of long abandoned surface mines within the property have created <b>wide</b> <b>flat</b> areas that tier the terrain {{into a series of}} benches, effectively pre-grading and excavating the property, and allowing for many of the roads and infrastructure on the property to begin construction with manageable earth moving.|$|E

25|$|The N20 {{continues}} south {{heading out}} of the massif central and into {{the valley of the}} river Aveyron via Caussade. The road heads south west in the <b>wide</b> <b>flat</b> valley to Montauban. Then it comes to a junction with the N113 (NarbonneBordeaux) along the River Garonne. The A62 autoroute (Autoroute des Deux Mers) crosses the road. The N20 turns south running along the east bank of the river into the industrial city of Toulouse.|$|E
25|$|Gliding {{requires}} universal body modifications, as seen {{in present-day}} vertebrates such as some rodents and marsupials, which have grown <b>wide,</b> <b>flat</b> expansions of skin for this purpose. The flying dragons (genus Draco) of Indonesia has modified its ribs into gliders, and even some snakes can glide through the air by spreading their ribs. The main difference is that while vertebrates have an inner skeleton, primitive insects had a flexible and adaptive exoskeleton.|$|E
25|$|The Southern {{states are}} {{commonly}} associated with stock car racing and its most prominent competition NASCAR, {{which is based in}} Charlotte, North Carolina.

25|$|There {{were other}} bow fibula {{variations}} of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. The Divided Bow type has an arched bow and a long foot. The arch {{was made up of}} two, or even three, separate, but parallel, arches. These arches are either wide and flat or narrow and tall. The Trident fibula has a rounded arch and long foot and a <b>wide,</b> <b>flat</b> head plate with three points. The entire fibula looks like a trident. Claims that this was the standard fibula of the Roman navy are unfounded.|$|E
25|$|Advanced players {{improve their}} {{performance}} {{through a number}} of accoutrements. Vibration dampeners may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel. Racket handles may be customized with absorbent or rubber-like materials to improve the players' grip. Players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry and head bands or bandanas to keep the sweat out of their eyes as well. Finally, although the game can be played in a variety of shoes, specialized tennis shoes have <b>wide,</b> <b>flat</b> soles for stability and a built-up front structure to avoid excess wear.|$|E
25|$|Sited on {{the edge}} of the Liao River plains, Anshan has <b>wide</b> <b>flat</b> lands in the west and central regions that develop into hilly and the mountainous terrain on the eastern fringes. The area is rich in mineral wealth {{including}} iron ore, coal, magnesite, talcum and jade. The plains of western Anshan are good for agriculture. The large flat fields make it ideal for modern agricultural methods. In total, Anshan contains 24480 hectares of arable land accounting for 26.4% of the total land area. One agricultural product that Anshan has become well known for is the production of Nangua Pears.|$|E

25|$|His pupil was Meindert Hobbema (1638–1709), {{best known}} for his {{atypical}} Avenue at Middelharnis (1689, London), a departure from his usual scenes of watermills and roads through woods. Two other artists with more personal styles, whose best work included larger pictures (up to a metre or more across), were Aelbert Cuyp (1620–1691) and Philips Koninck (1619–1688). Cuyp took golden Italian light and used it in evening scenes with a group of figures in the foreground and behind them a river and wide landscape. Koninck's best works are panoramic views, as from a hill, over <b>wide</b> <b>flat</b> farmlands, with a huge sky.|$|E
25|$|The {{maiden voyage}} of the Livadia {{revealed}} that her <b>wide</b> <b>flat</b> bottom was highly prone to damage by wave slamming. She spent her brief {{career as a}} yacht in the docks and was used for her intended purpose only once, carrying Grand Dukes Constantine and Mikhail across the Black Sea. Alexander III {{had no interest in}} resurrecting an inherently flawed ship, and in August 1881 Livadia was moored in Nikolaev and then hulked and stripped of her former luxuries. Her engines were removed and reused on the Russian cruisers. The rusty hulk saw some use during World War I and was finally decommissioned in 1926.|$|E
25|$|The scapula is a <b>wide,</b> <b>flat</b> bone {{lying on}} the {{thoracic}} wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include {{the muscles of the}} rotator cuff—the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. These muscles attach {{to the surface of the}} scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the glenohumeral joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula.|$|E

50|$|The Rutten Maksutov-Cassegrain (also {{called a}} Rumak or Sigler Maksutov) has a {{separate}} secondary mirror {{mounted on the}} inner surface of the meniscus corrector, sometimes similar to the corrector/mirror holder configurations found in commercial Schmidt-Cassegrains. This provides an extra degree of freedom in correcting aberration by changing the curvature of the corrector and the secondary independently. Specifically it allows the designer to aspherize the secondary to provide a much <b>wider</b> <b>flat</b> field than traditional spot Maksutovs, with less off-axis coma. Mounting the secondary on the corrector also limits diffraction spikes. This version is named after the work of Dutch optical designer Harrie Rutten.|$|R
