5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing.</b> So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E
5|$|Original Floyd {{frontman}} Syd Barrett {{recorded his}} album Barrett {{around the same}} time as Atom Heart Mother, with assistance from Gilmour and Wright. He occasionally visited his old band's sessions to see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{were other}} folk-music records, {{commercial}} folk-music records, like those by the Kingston Trio. I never really was an elitist. Personally, I liked the Kingston Trio.

5|$|While FireRed and LeafGreen are remakes of Red and Green (Pokémon Green {{was only}} {{released}} in Japan, whereas the American version was Blue), they contain usability enhancements {{such as a}} contextual tutorial feature which allows players to look up data {{at any point in}} the game. Additionally, when continuing a saved game, players are shown the last four actions they performed, allowing them to remember <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{the plans}} for I-70 extended, a transcontinental route would again be {{attempted}} across the San Rafael Swell. The area west of Green River was so remote that survey crews followed wild horses with jeeps to survey parts of the route. According to a story told at the highway's dedication, by an engineer who surveyed the highway, his group was approached by a sheep rancher and asked <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing.</b> The rancher fell over laughing when he was told they were building a freeway.|$|E
5|$|None of them played instruments, so I {{was left}} to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing,</b> throwing it out there.|$|E
50|$|Stage 3 Violent Performances: The subject {{continues}} {{to act out}} violently and {{they feel that they}} get inner confidence by acting like this and that in turn builds their self-esteem. With their actions being executed, they feel like they get a knack for it and they incorporate it into their daily activity. In this stage they feel most comfortable with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> and do not feel like <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> anything wrong. The subject feels like they have gained celebrity status to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> and within this stage is the defining moment of whether or not they will continue to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|R

5|$|On July 12, 1939, Szilárd and Wigner {{drove in}} Wigner's car to Cutchogue on New York's Long Island, where Einstein was staying. When they {{explained}} {{about the possibility}} of atomic bombs, Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (I did not even think about that). Szilárd dictated a letter in German to the Belgian Ambassador to the United States. Wigner wrote it down, and Einstein signed it. At Wigner's suggestion, they also prepared a letter for the State Department explaining <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> and why, giving it two weeks to respond if it had any objections.|$|E
5|$|That wasn't just a {{faith in}} {{herself and her}} talent, but also the ability to let herself go, to pray to God, and to trust in what would happen. These were, by far, her most inspiring words to date, letting others know that no matter <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing,</b> no matter how {{difficult}} things were, with help they would win through. Musically, the piece had a restrained dance beat, very Mowtownish, that owed {{a little more to}} gospel, with a chorus - sung by Mariah, Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from the verse to repeat and drive and its very positive message home.|$|E
25|$|During the Born to Run tours, Springsteen and Clemons would {{occasionally}} duplicate the pose onstage {{for several seconds}} after a song while the stage lights were dim.

The timing of the patrols varied so raiders would not know when the next plane would appear.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad gave Abdullah ibn Jahsh a letter, {{but not to}} be read {{until he}} had {{traveled}} for two days and then {{to do what he}} was instructed to do in the letter without putting pressure on his companions.

25|$|Some birds seem to {{lack the}} {{perception}} of grief or quickly accept it- for example, Mallard hens, although shocked for a moment when losing one of their young to a predator, will soon return to doing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> before the predator attacked. However, some other waterbirds, such as Mute swans, are known to grieve {{for the loss of}} a partner or cygnet, and are known to engage in pining for days, weeks or even months at a time.|$|E
25|$|Flashbulb memory {{occurs when}} a very vivid memory of a traumatic, emotional, or {{significant}} event is recalled. Researchers typically use public {{events such as the}} John F. Kennedy assassination and 9/11 as cues when studying flashbulb memories. Participants are asked to recall very specific information such as where they were, how they felt, and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> when the event was taking place. Memories of these events are easily recalled and the individual believes their account of the event to be perfectly accurate.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. UPN network {{presented}} two one-hour {{episodes of}} Iron Chef USA hosted by William Shatner around Christmas 2001. These shows were neither a critical nor popular success, {{perhaps because the}} show focused little on cookinga {{major part of the}} Japanese programme. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, the chefs refused to say <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing,</b> and the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.|$|E

Concerned about Ford and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> with the Shelby Cobra, GM planned to manufacture 100 Grand Sport Corvettes, but only five were actually built. They were driven by historic drivers such as Roger Penske, A. J. Foyt, Jim Hall, and Dick Guldstrand among others. Today the five cars (001-005) are all held by private owners, and are among the most coveted and valuable Corvettes ever built. 002 is exhibited in the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum and is in running condition.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, some {{residents}} of Minnesota were being offered cards by First National of Omaha, at similar terms.

Marquette threatened to take the Omaha bank to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary if their practice continued.|$|E
25|$|Irving was {{promoted}} to colonel in February 1943, and had 20,000 women serving under her when the AWAS reached its peak strength in 1944. At {{the end of the}} war she encouraged AWAS members to undertake further training to find jobs in the civilian labour force, but only a small proportion of servicewomen did so. Irving left the Army in January 1947 when the AWAS was disbanded. She later wrote to all her former officers to inquire after their welfare and ask <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> in the post-war world.|$|E
