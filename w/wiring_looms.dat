40|$|In this paper, the Unstructured Transmission Line Modelling (UTLM) method {{based on}} a {{tetrahedral}} mesh is applied to model the electromagnetic coupling into <b>wire</b> <b>looms</b> and bundles with multiple cores that are typical of an aircraft system, when {{they are exposed to}} plane wave illuminations. The impact on the electromagnetic coupling into wires of both bundle configuration and the positioning of the bundle relative to simple structures are investigated using the UTLM method with explicit meshing of the wires. The work not only confirms that UTLM method as a powerful tool for dealing with <b>wire</b> <b>looms</b> and bundles but provides invaluable information on the margins to be expected in key experimental waveform parameters such as peak amplitude and frequency response...|$|R
50|$|In 1944 {{one of the}} few {{verified}} {{instances of}} sabotage occurred at Tocumwal, when major sections of the <b>wiring</b> <b>looms</b> in 12 B-24s were cut and removed. This put the aircraft out of service for several months until the damage could be assessed, replacement looms fabricated in the USA, then installed by Consolidated technicians flown to Australia to do the work. The sabotage was believed to have been carried out by a Japanese cell that had been under cover in Australia since prior to the war, however no one was ever captured nor convicted of the act.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the start}} of the Second World War, the Government decided to {{disperse}} certain production to locations away from obvious bombing targets. This led to a shadow factory at Cowbridge House, Malmesbury, Wiltshire, being established by Ekco. This was followed by other shadow factories at Aylesbury, Woking, Preston, and Rutherglen. The wartime headquarters of Ekco was based at Aston Clinton House in Buckinghamshire. Following the outbreak of war, the Southend-on-Sea factory was evacuated apart from the bakelite moulding shop whose large moulding presses could not be moved easily. Less than a year later, the empty factory was re-equipped to make <b>wiring</b> <b>looms</b> for aircraft such as the Avro Lancaster.|$|E

That time was spent designing a complete portable studio setup, including stage backdrops, curtains, lighting, staging and a stereo PA system. Portable nineteen inch equipment frames were designed and linked to other equipment using custom made <b>wiring</b> <b>looms</b> used for quick dismantling while touring. This new system of mobile equipment was designed for the Computer World tour and replaced the previous [...] "messy" [...] system. Kraftwerk spent three years designing the newer system. The newer studio could be set up in about two hours and was far easier to transport whilst touring. The Kling Klang 12k PA system was also designed to be portable and matched the grey colour of the equipment frames.|$|E

5000|$|In January 2017, {{a further}} two year delay was announced, pushing the {{expected}} first delivery to mid 2020. This resulted from moving the avionics bay and <b>wiring</b> <b>looms</b> and in March 2017 the flight certification program was extended from 2500 to 3000 flying hours. [...] Mitsubishi didn't confirm. Four {{of the five}} delays were caused, at least partly, by failures to document work for certification or similar failures. As a result, development cost ballooned to 350 billion yen (US$3.17 billion) and the project might never able to fully recover its costs.Mitsubishi originally planned to use five flight test aircraft and two ground test aircraft but one or two additional aircraft will also be needed following this introduction of a two-year delay to mid-2020.Seattle engineering consultants Aerotec L.L.C. saw problems for avionics and its wiring certification: damage could cause single point of failure, due to fire, water flooding from a ruptured waterline or from part penetration of an engine explosion.This necessitated hardware changes in the bays, now frozen, but the electrical wiring interconnection system have to be reconfigured with hired specialist Latecoere.In June 2017, 940 hours of flight tests have been done and the four prototypes have an above 98% availability.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an additive manufacturing technology {{that has the}} potential to print plastic components with integral conductive polymer electronic circuits. This could have a major impact in the fields of robotics and mechatronics as {{it has the potential to}} allow large <b>wiring</b> <b>looms,</b> often an issue with complex robotic systems, to be printed as an integral part of the products plastic shell. This paper describes the development of a novel Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process in which the layers of material that make up the part are deposited as curved layers instead of the conventional flat layers. This opens up possibilities of building curved plastic parts that have conductive electronic tracks and components printed as an integral part of the plastic component, thereby eliminating printed circuit boards and wiring. It is not possible to do this with existing flat layer additive manufacturing technologies as the continuity of a circuit could be interrupted between the layers. With curved-layer fused deposition modeling (CLFDM) this problem is removed as continuous filaments in 3 dimensions can be produced, allowing for continuous conductive circuits...|$|E

40|$|The {{recession}} that climaxed in 1982 / 83 tested {{the management of}} {{both large and small}} companies. Organisations with histories of good industrial relations found that they were forced to layoff staff and, in the midst of these redundancies, found that goodwill and trust with employees and unions disappeared. This paper examines one Australian Company that was forced to reduce its staff from 971 to 588 and examines the way in which this was done so that trust and goodwill with employees and the trade unions was maintained. From this, using the model designed by Kuhn as a tool, the author examines the implications this has for personnel management in general as we head for the turn of the twenty-first century. This article describes a case study of an actual situation, and in so doing demonstrates that the ’post-capitalistic ’ management style can work.

40|$|Combining {{advanced}} sensor technologies, with optimised {{data acquisition}} and diagnostic and prognostic capability, structural health monitoring (SHM) systems provide real-time {{assessment of the}} integrity of bridges, buildings, aircraft, wind turbines, oil pipelines and ships, leading to improved safety and reliability and reduced inspection and maintenance costs. The implementation of power harvesting, using energy scavenged from ambient sources such as thermal gradients and sources of vibration in conjunction with wireless transmission enables truly autonomous systems, reducing the need for batteries and associated maintenance in often inaccessible locations, alongside bulky and expensive <b>wiring</b> <b>looms.</b> The design and implementation of such a system however presents numerous challenges. A suitable energy source or multiple sources capable of meeting the power requirements of the system, over the entire monitoring period, in a location close to the sensor must be identified. Efficient power management techniques must be used to condition the power and deliver it, as required, to enable appropriate measurements to be taken. Energy storage may be necessary, to match a continuously changing supply and demand {{for a range of}} different monitoring states including sleep, record and transmit. An appropriate monitoring technique, capable of detecting, locating and characterising damage and delivering reliable information, whilst minimising power consumption, must be selected. Finally a wireless protocol capable of transmitting the levels of information generated at the rate needed in the required operating environment must be chosen. This paper considers solutions to some of these challenges, and in particular examines SHM {{in the context of the}} aircraft environment...|$|E
