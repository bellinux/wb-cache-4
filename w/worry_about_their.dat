Given no other choice, Kolish contacted his only remaining adult relative, a brother who lived in Hollywood, and left instructions for the care of Sarria and his family.|$|E

25|$|When two of Liza's female {{teachers}} (who live together) go {{on vacation}} during spring break, she volunteers {{for the job of}} taking care of their home and feeding their cats. The two girls stay at the house together, but in an unexpected turn of events a Foster Academy administrator discovers Liza and Annie together. Liza is forced to tell her family about her relationship with Annie, and the headmistress of her school organizes a meeting of the school's board of trustees in order to expel Liza. The board rules in favor of Liza staying at Foster, and she is allowed to keep her position as student president. However, the two teachers, who in the process are discovered to be gay, are fired. After their initial shock at discovering the girls together, the teachers are very supportive and {{go out of their way}} to reassure Liza not to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> dismissal, but a few ignorantly insensitive responses end up pushing Liza to leave Annie.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{individual}} and household-level determinants of economic insecurity in post-socialist countries. Exploring subjective, backward- and forward-looking measures of economic insecurity, the paper focuses on: 1) the perceptions of past affordability of primary commodities; and 2) <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> consumption in the future. We find that low affordability of primary commodities and big <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> future consumption are experienced by rural residents, people with poor health and households headed by females, less-educated and unemployed persons. In addition, low affordability is reported by people with low incomes and non-Russian ethnic minorities, while high affordability is reported by people for whom remittances are {{the main source of}} income. <b>Worries</b> <b>about</b> primary commodities are more prevalent among ‘younger’ households, big-city dwellers and people receiving moderate amounts of remittances. People who have experienced lower affordability of primary commodities in the recent past report higher <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> consumption in the future...|$|R

25|$|The Luftwaffe's {{production}} {{problems in}} 1941 lay {{not on the}} dilettantism of the Nazi leadership, but with a military leadership which {{did not understand the}} difficulties in producing modern weapons in large numbers and who evinced little <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> enemy's capabilities. Udet, who had replaced Milch in technical and production affairs, possessed neither the temperament or technical background to do the job. The Chief of the General Staff, Hans Jeschonnek, displayed little interest in non-operational matters and the requirements of production and planning. Thus operational plans and production plans were not synthesised. In the coming campaigns, with increased commitment of the Luftwaffe, production remained the same. Production had always risen in 1933 to 1937, but thereafter it was allowed to level off, and did not pick up again until 1942. From 1 September 1939 to 15 November 1941, 16 revisions of production and planning were called for and designed, but none were carried through.|$|E
25|$|The book {{created a}} {{reaction}} in China, sparking follow-up essays by Chinese writers who were {{taken aback by}} the Phan's description of Vietnamese life under French colonial rule. It generated gloomy pieces by Chinese writers who predicted that their nation would suffer a similar fate if they failed to modernize. One such Chinese response later became a teaching text at the Tonkin Free School in Hanoi, a school run by Phan's contemporaries to promote the independence movement. However, Phan did not receive much of a reaction in terms of aid towards his independence efforts, since the book made Chinese readers <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> own future. The book had a much better reception among Vietnamese readers. Phan and a colleague, Đặng Tử Kính, left Japan {{for the first time in}} August 1905, carrying 50 copies of the book that were to distributed throughout Vietnam, of which further copies were made inside the country. Phan's direct writing style, without the use of allegories, upset traditionalists but made the book more accessible to literate people who had not been trained in classical literature.|$|E

500|$|In the 2007 book Children's Literature and Culture, writer Harry Edwin Eiss chastised the {{depiction}} of Blair's bulimia. [...] "If handled properly, the inclusion of her illness could have provided a powerful lesson for young adult readers who <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> weight and food consumption. Unfortunately, Cecily von Ziegesar, {{the author of the}} series, presents a seriously flawed treatment of the problem. In a failed attempt at humor, the writer regards Blair's sickness as just another source of gossip," [...] he said. Emily Nussbaum of New York magazine had similar comments, calling the bulimia [...] "more of an icky weakness than a full-fledged pathology." [...] However, she went on to commend Blair as [...] "hilariously self-centered".|$|E

In the song, Spears sings about being in love with a bad boy and outlaw, and pleads to her mother to not <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> relationship. [...] "Criminal" [...] received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its organic and refreshing feel in comparison {{with the rest of the}} album. After the release of Femme Fatale, the song charted on the South Korean International chart.

500|$|When Anders and Tyrol {{detonate}} {{the bomb}} {{at the beginning}} of the episode, one of the Number Three (D'anna) models was to film a propaganda film in front of Laura Roslin's (Mary McDonnell) school at the time, but that was cut. Also, Jammer (Dominic Zamprogna) was originally considered the suicide bomber at the end, but was changed to Duck because he had less to live for after his wife's death. In the original drafts, the resistance was not planning suicide bombings, but [...] "freaking the Cylons out" [...] by imprisoning many of them in a secret underground prison, torture them for information, and leave them alive instead of killing them, as they would resurrect otherwise. This would make the Cylons <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> missing comrades. However, Moore later realized that suicide bombings would be [...] "really potent and really powerful." [...] When writing the scenes involving Duck leading to the suicide bombing, Moore got [...] "emotionally caught up in it," [...] adding [...] "as I was writing these scenes of him standing in the police ranks, we know he's got the belt on. What's he gonna do? And then, oh my God, he actually does it. I mean, it's really horrifying stuff. But it's true. That's why I want to do it. It really happens. People do this." [...] The producers were initially worried that the Sci Fi Channel would not allow the inclusion of the bombing scene, but to Moore's surprise, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern did not object to it.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. It was the second script Daniels wrote for the show. He thought the staff had previously done many episodes where Homer [...] "wasn't good at anything", so he {{tried to figure out}} something Homer was really good at, and he {{came up with the idea}} of Homer being a good husband. While Bart had been the star of the show during the early years, by Season 5, the focus had clearly shifted to Homer. Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner David Mirkin commented: [...] "Bart, to write him accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he's our main rock of the whole series. Homer's IQ is fairly flexible, he won't necessarily understand how to open a door at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded." [...] Mirkin was very fond of the fact that Homer and Marge have the biggest fight they have ever had on the show in the episode, and he thought it was a [...] "really great" [...] exploration of their marriage. He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> relationship. Mirkin had been asked many times why Marge and Homer are still together, to which he replied that all people stay together even if they argue, [...] "there's some sort of connection".|$|E

2500|$|When adopted {{children}} grow into young adults, many <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> health. For many {{adopted children}}, their adoptive families are given little to {{none of their}} medical history, especially if the adoption was international. This can be {{due to lack of}} information {{on the part of the}} biological family, type of adoption or circumstance in which the adoptee was found (for example being left at an orphanage in a foreign country). Simple trips to the doctor or dentist, for something as small as a check up, can bring about great worry because there is so many unknowns to ones health when the person is adopted. Anxiety over lack of medical history may become worse for those who are seeking to get married and start a family. If one of the parents is unaware of medical history, having a child becomes much more difficult. The risks of being unable to conceive, or the child being born with certain health issues are higher because parental medical history is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|Citizens {{and governments}} have been {{concerned}} with misuse of social networking services by children and teenagers, in particular in relation to online sexual predators. For instance, there is a study which suggests the children are {{not too far from}} inappropriate content on YouTube. Overuse of social networking may also make children more susceptible to depression and anxiety. Governments are taking action to better understand the problem and find some solutions. A 2008 panel concluded that technological fixes such as age verification and scans are relatively ineffective means of apprehending online predators. In May 2010, a child pornography social networking site with hundreds of members was dismantled by law enforcement. It was deemed [...] "the largest crimes against children case brought anywhere by anyone". Girls in particular are also known to be at more of a risk online using social networks than boys. According to the article, High Tech or High Risks: Moral Panics About Girls Online, it suggests that young girls are more at risks because they are often represented through [...] "products of play" [...] in transgressive poses because they often manipulate other users online by making themselves look older than what they actually appear which can attract sexual predators. Many parents of teenage girls <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> safety online because of the many manipulations there are online and on social networking sites.|$|E
2500|$|Though using profanity on occasion, Butters {{does not}} indulge in foul-mouthed {{language}} {{as often as}} the other children on the show, instead preferring to use minced oaths; [...] "oh hamburgers" [...] is one he uses frequently, as well as [...] "gee whiz" [...] mostly in earlier seasons. Butters speaks with a mild stutter and tends to fidget with his hands. The other characters perceive him as [...] "nerdy", and he obliviously maintains a wholesome attitude and mild disposition despite the tragedy and abuse that he frequently encounters. His happy-go-lucky persona {{has been described as}} resembling that of a typical 1950s sitcom child character, and is usually presented {{in stark contrast to the}} harsh treatment he receives at the hands of his friends and strict parents, including his mother's deranged attempt to murder him after discovering his father's bisexuality, as well as when his grandmother happens to be in town and constantly bullies him during her stay. Stone describes him as embodying [...] "permanent innocence". [...] Butters, however, sees himself as a problem child because his parents tell him so and often expresses remorse at being [...] "out-of-control". Exceptions to this include the episode [...] "The Ungroundable", in which Butters makes his parents <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> ability to ground him when he refuses to be punished. This rebellious behavior begins after he joins the vampire kids at his school, but ends when he helps the Goth kids burn down a Hot Topic store. He is also known for being gullible, quickly believing anything told to him by others and tending to do whatever he is told to do with little protest, no matter how ridiculous these things seem to be. As such, he is always made an unknowing accomplice in Cartman's various devious schemes. There are cases, however, where Butters has shown a darker side, such as in episodes like [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] and [...] "Butterballs"; in the latter of which he viciously assaulted Dr. Oz and verbally castigated his abusive grandmother.|$|E
