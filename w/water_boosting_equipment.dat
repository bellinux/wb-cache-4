50|$|Just as {{a person}} {{shouting}} drowns out someone whispering, the boost in RF watts of power into the cell telephone system can overtake and control that system—in total or only a few, or even only one, conversation. This strategy requires only more RF power, and thus it is more simple than other types of secret control. Power <b>boosting</b> <b>equipment</b> can be installed anywhere there can be an antenna, including in a vehicle, perhaps even in a vehicle on the move. Once a secretly boosted system takes control, any manipulation is possible from simple recording of the voice or data to total blocking of all cell phones in the geographic area.|$|R
50|$|Midlands Innovation is a {{group of}} eight {{universities}} in the Midlands of England. It was formed (as M5) in August 2012 by the universities of Birmingham, Leicester, Loughborough, Nottingham and Warwick in order to <b>boost</b> <b>equipment</b> sharing between member institutions, following the success of the N8 Research Partnership. In December 2012 the group, which had added Aston University, launched its online equipment sharing database. In March 2015, Chancellor George Osborne announced that the Midlands Innovation universities would lead the £60 million Energy Research Accelerator project. The was re-announced in April 2016 as a £180 million project comprising the £60 million previously announced from the UK government and £120 million from the private sector. The consortium was re-launched as Midlands Innovation in May 2016.|$|R

50|$|The {{productivity}} of agriculture {{is enhanced by}} a well-developed use of fertilizers and the traditional abundance of <b>water,</b> <b>boosted</b> since the Middle Ages by the construction (partly designed by Leonardo da Vinci) of a wide net of irrigation systems. Lower plains are characterized by fodder crops, which are mowed up to eight times a year, cereals (rice, wheat and maize) and sugarbeet. Productions of the higher plains include cereals, vegetables, fruit trees and mulberries. The higher areas, up to the Prealps and Alps sectors of the north, produce fruit and wine. Cattle (with the highest density in Italy), pigs and sheep are raised.|$|R
2500|$|In {{subterranean}} arsenic removal (SAR), aerated groundwater is recharged {{back into}} the aquifer to create an oxidation zone which can trap iron and arsenic on the soil particles through adsorption process. The oxidation zone created by aerated <b>water</b> <b>boosts</b> {{the activity of the}} arsenic-oxidizing microorganisms which can oxidize arsenic from +3 to +5 state [...] No chemicals are used and almost no sludge is produced during operational stage since iron and arsenic compounds are rendered inactive in the aquifer itself. Thus toxic waste disposal and the risk of its future mobilization is prevented. Also, it has very long operational life, similar to the long lasting tube wells drawing water from the shallow aquifers.|$|R

50|$|The Rangipo {{region is}} largely uninhabited. It {{is used by}} the New Zealand Army, based at Waiouru in the south, and by the Rangipo prison farm in the north and Rangipo {{underground}} HEP station to the east. During the 1960s The Tongariro power scheme redirected the flow of water from many of the streams and rivers that drain the central peaks. The water was channelled into canals, tunnels and storage lakes to provide water for 2 HEP stations at Rangipo and Tokaanu. The water then flowed into Lake Taupo increasing its input by 20%. Most of the Tongariro river flow is not included in the power scheme due to its importance as a breeding area for brown and rainbow trout. The extra <b>water</b> <b>boosted</b> the amount of water available to the 10 other HEP stations on the Waikato River which flows from {{the north end of the}} lake and is its only exit.|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} between human activity and landscape pattern {{has been a}} hot research topic {{during the last few}} decades. However, scholars used to measure human activity by social, economic and humanistic indexes. These indexes cannot directly reflect human activity and are not suitable for fine-grained analysis due to the coarse spatial resolution. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a method that obtains the intensity of human activity from GPS trajectory data, collects landscape information from remote sensing images and further analyzes the {{interaction between}} human activity and landscape pattern at a fine-grained scale. The Lijiang River Basin is selected as the study area. Experimental results show that human activity and landscape pattern interact synergistically in this area. Built-up land and <b>water</b> <b>boost</b> human activity, while woodland restrains human activity. The effect of human activity on landscape pattern differs by the land cover category. Overall, human activities make natural land, such as woodland and water, scattered and fragmented, but cause man-built land, such as built-up land and farmland, clustered and regular. Nevertheless, human activities inside and outside urban areas are the opposite. The research findings in this paper are helpful for designing and implementing sustainable management plans...|$|R

40|$|Pt {{nanoparticles}} with controlled size (2, 4, and 6 nm) are synthesized {{and tested}} in ethanol oxidation by molecular oxygen at 60 °C to acetaldehyde {{and carbon dioxide}} both in the gas and liquid phases. The turnover frequency of the reaction is 80 times faster, and the activation energy is 5 times higher at the gas-solid interface compared to the liquid-solid interface. The catalytic activity is highly dependent {{on the size of}} the Pt nanoparticles; however, the selectivity is not size sensitive. Acetaldehyde is the main product in both media, while twice as much carbon dioxide was observed in the gas phase compared to the liquid phase. Added <b>water</b> <b>boosts</b> the reaction in the liquid phase; however, it acts as an inhibitor in the gas phase. The more water vapor was added, the more carbon dioxide was formed in the gas phase, while the selectivity was not affected by the concentration of the water in the liquid phase. The differences in the reaction kinetics of the solid-gas and solid-liquid interfaces can be attributed to the molecular orientation deviation of the ethanol molecules on the Pt surface in the gas and liquid phases as evidenced by sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy. &# 169; 2014 American Chemical Society. close 2...|$|R

30|$|The {{viscosity}} of nanocomposite PPG after {{thermal degradation}} was measured. After an extended time period, gel degrades into a viscous polymer solution. This viscous polymer solution will then move into deeper {{regions of the}} reservoir to increase the viscosity of the flood <b>water</b> and <b>boost</b> polymer flooding process. Thus the higher the post-degradation gel viscosity, the better its ability to improve polymer flooding process. The viscosity of the degraded solution was measured using a Brookfield viscometer with a shear rate of 0 RPM to 100 RPM using a # 18 or # 34 spindle. The viscosity measured at 6 RPM was recorded as the reported value.|$|R
