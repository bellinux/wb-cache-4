5|$|When the BBC {{commissioned}} a second Quatermass serial in 1955, Tate {{was eager to}} participate and play the Professor again. Production was due to begin in September, and on 7 August 1955 he produced his first television play, Night <b>Was</b> <b>Our</b> Friend. Only sixteen days after this, late at night on 23 August, he collapsed outside his home in London. He had suffered a heart attack, and despite being rushed to hospital in Putney he died soon afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong concluded: The {{responsibility}} for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that <b>was</b> <b>our</b> small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E

25|$|Lee enjoyed basic medical studies after {{entering}} the medical department. He finished his first research paper in his freshman year, {{which was published}} in the Taiwanese Medical Magazine (台灣醫學雜誌). After graduating in 1940, Lee decided to quit clinical medicine and keep on studying. He became the assistant of Tsungming Tu, who was researching on basic medical studies and, at the time, the only Taiwanese professors in the medical department. He once said, To gain honor for Taiwan, dignity for the Taiwanese, I chose to follow Professor Tu instead of several other Japanese professors. Because I thought Professor Tu <b>was</b> <b>our</b> people, and we should help him.|$|E

Yet it was her mother's {{interests}} in Theosophy, the I AM Activity, and Christian Science that had the most influence on Elizabeth. In Theosophy and the I AM Activity she heard about the Ascended Masters, Karma, and Reincarnation; in Christian Science she was told that matter was not the only reality and that the spirit part of us made in the image of God <b>was</b> <b>our</b> true nature. Prophet stayed with Christian Science until she met Mark Prophet at the age of 22.|$|E

25|$|Marian shrines {{account for}} major veneration centers and pilgrimage sites for Roman Catholics. According to Bishop Francesco Giogia, {{at the end}} of the 20th century, the most visited Catholic shrine in the world was that of the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico City. In third place <b>was</b> <b>Our</b> Lady of Aparecida in Brazil, with the non-Marian shrine of San Giovanni Rotondo in second place. The visual effect of Marian pilgrimages can be dramatic, e.g. on May 13 and October 13 of each year close to one million Catholic pilgrims walk the country road that leads to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima. Around 2 million pilgrim journey up Tepeyac hill on December 12 each year to visit the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe. While in 1968 Aparecida had about four million pilgrims, the number has since reached eight million pilgrims per year.|$|E
25|$|Some 200 {{yards in}} advance of our position, which we were holding at a terrible cost, was a fence built high and strong. The troops in advance had tried to scale the fence and reform under that hell of fire. They were {{actually}} torn in shreds and wedged into the fence. The cry came to us for volunteers to pull down the fence. Instantly there sprang from the long line, fast being shortened as the ranks closed up over the dead, seventy-six volunteers. We ran straight for the fence amid a hail of iron and lead, the dead falling all about us, but to reach the fence <b>was</b> <b>our</b> only thought. A part of the force reached it, and, as one would grasp a rail it would be sent flying {{out of his hands}} by rifle-shots. The fence leveled, we made the attempt to return, and it was as hot for us on the retreat, as it had been on the advance. Few escaped death or wounds. I had almost regained my regiment, when I was hit. The line then successfully pressed on, and the 'Sunken Road,' or ' Bloody Lane,' as it is now known, was within our lines.|$|E

500|$|James Brown {{was a major}} {{contributor}} to social dance. He popularized several fad dances in the 1970s such as the Mashed Potato, the Boogaloo, and the Good Foot.
