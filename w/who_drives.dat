40|$|Context: Authorizing {{powered two-wheeler}} drivers {{to drive in}} lanes {{reserved}} to buses is a measure that is sometimes mentioned to improve mobility conditions for these users. But what effect would this measure have on {{the safety of the}}se users and on the safety of the other users with whom they share the traffic space? Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} contribute elements to help answer this question. More precisely, the objective is to estimate the risk of having an accident per kilometer driven by powered two-wheeler drivers <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> in bus lanes and to compare this risk with that of powered two-wheeler drivers <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> in general traffic lanes. Method: Using the bodily injury accidents recorded by the police over two years on thirteen roads in the city of Marseille and a campaign of periodical observations of powered two-wheeler traffic, we estimated the risk per kilometer driven by powered two-wheeler drivers <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> in bus lanes and compared it with that of drivers <b>who</b> do not <b>drive</b> in them. Results: The results show that the risk for powered two-wheeler drivers <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> in bus lanes of being involved in a bodily injury accident is significantly higher than the risk run by drivers <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> in general traffic lanes. For the thirteen roads studied, it is on average 3, 25 times higher (95 % CI: 2, 03; 5, 21). Conclusion: In the current situation, powered two-wheeler drivers <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> in bus lanes are less safe than those <b>who</b> <b>drive</b> in general traffic lanes. The analysis of police reports suggests that part of this increased risk comes from collisions between automobile drivers turning right and powered two-wheelers driving in the bus lane who continue straight ahead...|$|R
5|$|Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round: Indy's eleven-year-old Chinese sidekick, <b>who</b> <b>drives</b> the 1936 Auburn Boat Tail Speedster {{which allows}} Indy to escape {{during the opening}} sequence. Quan was chosen {{as part of a}} casting call in Los Angeles. Around 6000 actors auditioned {{worldwide}} for the part: Quan was cast after his brother auditioned for the role. Spielberg liked his personality, so he and Ford improvised the scene where Short Round accuses Indy of cheating during a card game. He was credited by his birthname, Ke Huy Quan.|$|E

5|$|The poem {{opens with}} the {{marriage}} of king Volsung's daughter Signy to Siggeir, king of the Goths. The bridal feast is interrupted {{by the arrival of}} a stranger, the god Odin in disguise, <b>who</b> <b>drives</b> a sword into a tree-trunk. Though everyone tries to draw the sword, Volsung's son Sigmund is the only man who can do it. The disappointed Siggeir takes his new wife home, inviting Volsung to visit him. When Volsung does so he is killed by Siggeir, and his sons are taken prisoner. While in captivity they are all killed by a wolf, apart from Sigmund who escapes into the forest. Signy sends Sigmund her two sons to help him in avenging their family, but Sigmund only accepts Sinfjotli, the hardier of the two. Sigmund and Sinfjotli kill Siggeir and burn down his hall, then return to their ancestral home, the hall of the Volsungs. Sigmund marries Borghild, while Sinfjotli goes abroad with Borghild's brother, quarrels with him, and kills him. On his return Sinfjotli is poisoned by Borghild, and she is turned out by Sigmund, who instead marries Hiordis. Sigmund is killed in battle, and the pregnant Hiordis is taken to live in the hall of King Elf in Denmark.|$|E

25|$|The {{most notable}} {{appearance}} of the chariot in Greek mythology occurs when Phaëton, the son of Helios, {{in an attempt to}} drive the chariot of the sun, managed to set the earth on fire. This story led to the archaic meaning of a phaeton as one <b>who</b> <b>drives</b> a chariot or coach, especially at a reckless or dangerous speed. Plato, in his Chariot Allegory, depicted a chariot drawn by two horses, one well behaved and the other troublesome, representing opposite impulses of human nature; the task of the charioteer, representing reason, was to stop the horses from going different ways and to guide them towards enlightenment.|$|E

25|$|As Elijah was {{described}} as ascending into heaven in a fiery chariot, the Christian missionaries who converted Slavic tribes likely found him an ideal analogy for Perun, the supreme Slavic god of storms, thunder and lightning bolts. In many Slavic countries Elijah is known as Elijah the Thunderer (Ilija Gromovnik), <b>who</b> <b>drives</b> the heavens in a chariot and administers rain and snow, thus actually taking the place of Perun in popular beliefs. Perun is also sometimes conflated with the legendary hero Elijah of Murom. The feast of St. Elias is known as Ilinden in South Slavic, and {{was chosen as the}} day of the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising in 1903; it is now the holiday of Republic Day in the Republic of Macedonia.|$|E

25|$|The two {{decide to}} marry {{on the same}} day as lesbian couple Reese Williams and Bianca Montgomery.

The player can then either accept the challenge, and keep the race if they win it, or decline, in which case, the minor crew will automatically retake the race, and the territory if too many races are lost.|$|R
