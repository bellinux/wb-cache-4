25|$|In 1916, Potter wrote a tale called The Oakmen {{in a story}} {{letter to}} her niece Nancy, and, {{as a result of}} her failing eyesight, {{commissioned}} Ernest Aris to develop her designs with the expectation the book would be published by Warne. The publisher doubted the originality of the plot and rejected the book, which <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> because Potter was disappointed with Aris's work.|$|E
25|$|Maclean {{and others}} urged Asquith {{to stand in}} the Spen Valley {{by-election}} in December 1919, but it is unclear whether he ever considered the idea. This <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> as it had become clear that Labour were going to fight the seat hard and they defeated Sir John Simon when Lloyd George insisted on splitting the Liberal vote by running a Coalition Liberal candidate.|$|E
25|$|This <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> because Northcote was {{the first}} Australian Governor-General {{to have to deal}} with {{political}} instability. In doing this, he sought the advice of the Chief Justice of the newly created High Court of Australia, Sir Samuel Griffith. In April 1904 the Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin, resigned, and was succeeded in quick succession by the Labor leader Chris Watson, the Free Trade leader George Reid and then Deakin again. Both Watson and Reid asked Northcote to dissolve Parliament before their resignations, and in both cases he refused. At this time no-one doubted that the Governor-General had a discretion in these cases. It is a measure of Northcote's standing that all these leaders respected his decisions.|$|E

25|$|Bompas' journey {{began on}} June 30, 1865, {{when he left}} London for Liverpool, {{from where he was}} to take a steamer to New York. From New York Bompas {{travelled}} to Niagara via the Hudson River and railway, subsequently making his way to Chicago, La Crosse and St. Paul. Upon reaching St. Cloud, a problem presented itself to Bompas' travelling party. In 1862, a Sioux massacre occurred, and the local Indians were wary of another attack. However, Bompas was advised that they would respect the English flag. Although the party did not have an English flag on hand, Bompas took initiative and crafted a banner for their ox-carts. This <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> as Indians who had ridden up in their horses to survey the ox-cart party left them alone once they spotted their flags.|$|E
25|$|The {{report on}} Duke Wiser, {{mentioned}} above, {{on the other}} hand confirms Hasels point of view: Duke von Wiser, who had been given administrative powers over the forestry department in Friedrichstal, {{had been a member of}} Hubertia since 1877. Krutina {{on the other hand}}, who originated the quoted report, <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> a member of Hubertia. If one would assume that Kurtina sides with Wiser due to their connection within their common fraternity, then we should be able to deduct supportive words instead of criticism. What surprises though is that the report itself speaks in a critical, if not negative, tone where Krutina denies Wiser any passion for his work: He refers to him as a mediocre hunter, something that is unlikely to be said between friends portraying each other outside. If there would have been unfair connections between members of Hubertia, then Krutina's reporst would likely have resulted in a more positive view of Wiser and the situation.|$|E
500|$|The first {{message to}} reach Bonaparte {{regarding}} the disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 August at his {{camp on the}} road between Salahieh and Cairo. The messenger was a staff officer sent by the Governor of Alexandria General Jean Baptiste Kléber, and the report had been hastily written by Admiral Ganteaume, who had subsequently rejoined Villeneuve's ships at sea. One account reports {{that when he was}} handed the message, Bonaparte read it without emotion before calling the messenger to him and demanding further details. When the messenger had finished, the French general reportedly announced [...] "Nous n'avons plus de flotte: eh bien. Il faut rester en ces contrées, ou en sortir grands comme les anciens" [...] ("We no longer have a fleet: well, we must either remain in this country or quit it as great as the ancients"). Another story, as told by the general's secretary, Bourienne, claims that Bonaparte was almost overcome by the news and exclaimed [...] "Unfortunate Brueys, what have you done!" [...] Bonaparte later placed much of the blame for the defeat on the wounded Admiral Blanquet, falsely accusing him of surrendering Franklin while his ship was undamaged. Protestations from Ganteaume and Minister Étienne Eustache Bruix later reduced the degree of criticism Blanquet faced, but he never again served in a command capacity. Bonaparte's most immediate concern however was with his own officers, who began to question the wisdom of the entire expedition. Inviting his most senior officers to dinner, Bonaparte asked them how they were. When they replied that they were [...] "marvellous," [...] Bonaparte responded that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> since he would have them shot if they continued [...] "fostering mutinies and preaching revolt." [...] To quell any uprising among the native inhabitants, Egyptians overheard discussing the battle were threatened with having their tongues cut out.|$|E

2500|$|The Italian hero Giuseppe Garibaldi {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous people in Europe as a proponent of liberty; Washington sent a diplomat to invite him to become an American general. [...] Garibaldi {{declined}} the offer because he would not be given supreme power over all the armies, and because the United States was not yet committed to abolishing slavery. [...] Historians agree that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> because he was too independent in thought and deed to have worked smoothly with the U.S. government.|$|E
2500|$|Ji favored {{trade with}} Western Europe and foreign investment, {{one of the}} first in the {{government}} to do so, because he believed that China needed Western technology in order to develop. But he also insisted that this foreign trade should be balanced, adding that Beijing would have to conduct marketing efforts to promote Chinese goods abroad. Some criticized him for this openness to the West and for his American education and contacts, saying that he [...] "drank too much American water." [...] His brother, Chaoji, later commented that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> that Chaoding was divorced from his wife, Harriet, for their marriage would have prevented him from playing {{a major role in the}} Party. He then married Luo Jingyi, another Chinese student activist who had joined the Communist Party in the United States in the 1920s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{journalist}} Alexander McKee {{cast doubt}} on the meaningfulness of the list of targets mentioned in the 1953 USAF report, pointing out that the military barracks listed as a target were a long way out of the city and were not in fact targeted during the raid. The [...] "hutted camps" [...] mentioned in the report as military targets were also not military but were camps for refugees. It is also stated that the important Autobahn bridge {{to the west of the}} city was not targeted or attacked, and that no railway stations were on the British target maps, nor any bridges, such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe River. Commenting on this, McKee says: [...] "The standard whitewash gambit, both British and American, is to mention that Dresden contained targets X, Y and Z, and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked, whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus, except for one or two mere accidents, they escaped". McKee further asserts [...] "The bomber commanders were not really interested in any purely military or economic targets, which <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> for they knew very little about Dresden; the RAF even lacked proper maps of the city. What they were looking for was a big built up area which they could burn, and that Dresden possessed in full measure." ...|$|E

2500|$|New South Wales had won 10 Sheffield Shields on the trot - {{though they}} would be ousted by Victoria {{by the end of}} the season - and had a team that was {{stronger}} than most Test sides; captain Richie Benaud, vice-captain Neil Harvey, Bobby Simpson, Grahame Thomas, Norm O'Neill, Brian Booth, Alan Davidson, Ray Flockton, Johnny Martin and Frank Misson. Ted Dexter won the toss and batted of course, but the MCC innings hinged on Geoff Pullar's 132. Even that was lucky as the Lancashire opener edged the ball to Simpson in the first over who dropped it, just to show that even the best slip fielders are not infallible. Pullar continued to struggle and give other chances, but he put this behind him and stuck to his work, which <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as only Dexter (42) and Cowdrey (50) stayed to help him out. 180/2 sank to 303/9 thanks to Benaud (3/61) and Martin (4/122), but tailend [...] "George" [...] thumped 30 to bring the total up to 348 a few minutes before stumps. Thomas survived one ball from Fred Trueman, successfully appealed for light and they all trooped back to the pavilion. On the second day Dexter resorted to his negative tactics of bowling on the leg stump with an on-side field, which was meant to restrict strokeplay. In this he failed as New South Wales rattled up 408/5 in the day, causing Benaud the remark that he had better change his way of thinking. Grahame Thomas was quickly bowled by Trueman (1/45), who then left the field with fibrositis and the MCC bowling attack lost all its bite. Simpson made 110 – his fourth hundred in four matches – and added 234 for the second wicket with Norm O'Neill, who had lost a few pounds and overcame his bad form to make 143 like a man on a mission. Booth (41), Harvey (63), Davidson (55), Flockton (62 not out) and Benaud (40 not out) kept the scoreboard moving at a fair rate and Benaud declared during the lunch break on the third day having made 124 runs in that morning to bring the total to 532/6. Davidson (1/11) removed David Sheppard for 7 and then it was all the spinners. Benaud took his best first class innings haul of 18-10-18-7 and Martin (2/32) picked up the wickets of Dexter and Cowdrey as the tourists crumbled to 104 all out to lose by an innings and 80 runs. It was New South Wales first innings victory over the MCC, and by definition their greatest victory over the English tourists.|$|E
