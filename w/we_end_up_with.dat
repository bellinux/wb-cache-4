25|$|It {{seems that}} {{on the level of}} the organ, the leaf may be the {{ancestor}} of the flower, or at least some floral organs. When we mutate some crucial genes involved in flower development, <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a cluster of leaf-like structures. Thus, sometime in history, the developmental program leading to formation of a leaf must have been altered to generate a flower. There probably also exists an overall robust framework within which the floral diversity has been generated. An example of that is a gene called LEAFY (LFY), which is involved in flower development in Arabidopsis thaliana. The homologs of this gene are found in angiosperms as diverse as tomato, snapdragon, pea, maize and even gymnosperms. Expression of Arabidopsis thaliana LFY in distant plants like poplar and citrus also results in flower-production in these plants. The LFY gene regulates the expression of some gene belonging to the MADS-box family. These genes, in turn, act as direct controllers of flower development.|$|E
500|$|Some {{scientists}} now {{consider that the}} effects of global dimming have masked the effect of global warming to some extent and that resolving global dimming may therefore lead to increases in predictions of future temperature rise. According to Beate Liepert, [...] "We lived in a global warming plus a global dimming world and now we are taking out global dimming. So <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the global warming world, which will be much worse than we thought it will be, much hotter." [...] The magnitude of this masking effect is one of the central problems in climate change with significant implications for future climate changes and policy responses to global warming.|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the second}} season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a B+. The review stated that [...] "untangling this web of shifting allegiances and identities requires intense concentration. Hang on, though; the payoff's worth it". Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode an A, noting that it was [...] "X-Files in top form". He praised how the character of Samantha Mulder was presented, saying that [...] "In the seasons to come, <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> enough Samantha's [...] to fill a clown-car, but here, the reveal is shocking, effective, and unsettling"; and also felt that the episode's flashforward cold open was particularly well-handled. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, wrote that [...] "Colony" [...] presents a moral dilemma for the characters, noting that [...] "on the surface Mulder's quest appears righteous, however, {{the results of his}} quest would suggest otherwise", and adding [...] "generally the ideology that focuses on a single life's (be that human or alien) importance is successful, whereas Mulder's ideology of finding the truth at all costs is not". Duchovny's portrayal of Fox Mulder in this episode has been cited {{as an example of the}} character's reversal of traditional gender roles—his openness and vulnerability when confronted with what he believes is his prodigal sister casts him [...] "in a pattern typically engendered as female." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{suspension}} of operations at {{three out of four}} BPI plants, members of the media and leaders were invited by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to tour the BPI facility that remained open in South Sioux City, Nebraska. The founders of BPI gave campaign contributions to Branstad in 2010, and to other candidates' campaigns. Branstad stated to ABC News that the contributions were not a factor in his decision regarding having the event. Texas Governor Rick Perry, Nebraska Lieutenant Governor Rick Sheehy, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, and South Dakota Lieutenant Governor Matt Michels, toured the South Sioux City, Nebraska, plant in an attempt to allay [...] "inaccurate information" [...] that they stated as having caused [...] "an unnecessary panic among consumers". The publicity tour emerged with the promotional slogan, [...] "Dude, it's beef!" [...] News reporters were not allowed to ask employees at BPI any questions during the tour. BPI asserts that social media and ABC News [...] "grossly misrepresented" [...] their product. BPI eventually sued ABC News for defamation. On March 28, 2012, Branstad stated, [...] "The problem is, we take this off the market, then <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a fatter product that's going to cost more and it's going to increase the obesity problem in this country". Safeway and other retailers that have removed the product from their shelves or product lines have stated they will not raise the price of their beef. Branstad also stated that he would recommend that Iowa state public schools continue to use ground beef which contains the product, and stated plans to [...] "send a letter to the state's public schools, encouraging them to continue to buy LFTB".|$|E
500|$|Mick LaSalle gave {{a largely}} {{negative}} review. [...] "A.I. exhibits all its creators' bad traits {{and none of}} the good. So <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg." [...] Dubbing it Spielberg's [...] "first boring movie", LaSalle also believed the robots {{at the end of the}} film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the [...] "useless" [...] Jar Jar Binks, yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic Albert Einstein. Peter Travers gave a mixed review, concluding [...] "Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick's darker side of the future." [...] But he still put the film on his top ten list that year for best movies. David Denby in The New Yorker criticized A.I. for not adhering closely to his concept of the Pinocchio character. Spielberg responded to some of the criticisms of the film, stating that many of the [...] "so called sentimental" [...] elements of A.I., including the ending, were in fact Kubrick's and the darker elements were his own. However, Sara Maitland, who worked on the project with Kubrick in the 1990s, claimed that one of the reasons Kubrick never started production on A.I. was because he had a hard time making the ending work. James Berardinelli found the film [...] "consistently involving, with moments of near-brilliance, but far from a masterpiece. In fact, as the long-awaited 'collaboration' of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment." [...] Of the film's highly debated finale, he claimed, [...] "There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick's vision left off and Spielberg's began." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2007, the BBC {{soap opera}} EastEnders caused {{controversy}} when the character Minty Peterson (played by Cliff Parisi) made {{a reference to}} the disaster. During the episode car mechanic Minty said: [...] "Five years out of Europe because of Heysel, because they penned you lot in to stop you fighting on the pitch and then what did <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with?</b> Hillsborough." [...] This prompted 380 complaints and the BBC apologised, saying that the character was simply reminding another character, former football hooligan Jase Dyer, that the actions of hooligans led to the fencing-in of football fans. Ofcom also received 177 complaints.|$|E
2500|$|Warren's critics {{found him}} a boring person. [...] "Although Warren was an {{important}} and courageous figure and although he inspired passionate devotion among his followers...he was a dull man and a dull judge," [...] observed Dennis J. Hutchinson. [...] According to Justice Potter Stewart, Warren’s philosophical foundation were the [...] "eternal, rather bromidic, platitudes in which he sincerely believed" [...] and [...] "Warren's great strength was his simple belief in the things we now laugh at: motherhood, marriage, family, flag, and the like." [...] He was highly moralistic but not particularly cerebral, with his biographer Bernard Schwartz concluding that with [...] "Warren's bluff masculine bonhomie, his love of sports and the outdoors, and his lack of intellectual interests or pretensions, <b>we</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a typical representative of the middle America of his day." ...|$|E
