5000|$|A <b>wire</b> <b>list</b> {{is made in}} {{spreadsheet}} or list format. It {{shows the}} electrical assembly people what wires are to be connected and to where. When it is printed out on paper, {{it is easy for}} the assembly people to check off conductors as they are connected. The <b>wire</b> <b>list</b> contains at a minimum each wire name, terminal name, and wire model number or gage. It may also contain the wire termination device model numbers, voltage classes, conductor class (high-voltage, medium voltage, or control wiring), etc.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, the sorted, {{optimized}} <b>wire</b> <b>list</b> {{is printed}} out {{for use by}} machine operators, {{and turned into a}} tape or card deck for the machine. Machine-readable copies of this valuable production data are often archived at the same time.|$|E
5000|$|After {{recording}} Alien Soundtracks, John Lambdin {{left the}} band. Their third studio album, Half Machine Lip Moves, {{was released in}} 1979. Half Machine Lip Moves continued in the vein of the previous album, but heavier, with Creed's feedback guitar more to the fore. Edge's rough and ready drumming on this album included hitting pieces of scrap metal. Half Machine Lip Moves remains their best-known work, and was listed at No. 62 in The <b>Wire</b> <b>list</b> of [...] "100 Records That Set the World on Fire (While No One Was Listening)".|$|E

50|$|The <b>wire</b> <b>list</b> is then sorted alphabetically into {{an optimal}} {{assembly}} sequence. Bottom wires are placed before top wires. Long wires are usually placed first within a level so that shorter wires will hold longer wires down. This reduces vibration of the longer wires, making the board more rugged in a vibrating environment {{such as a}} vehicle. Placing all the wires of a certain size and level {{at the same time}} makes it easier for an assembly technician to use precut, prestripped wires while using a semiautomated wire-wrapping machine. Wires of different colors, but the same size are also sorted to be placed together.|$|E
40|$|Quicklist, a {{preprocessor}} for {{an existing}} <b>wire</b> <b>list</b> program that cuts {{the description of}} the <b>wire</b> <b>list</b> by about 67 percent over previous methods, is described. Quicklist uses two different methods to shorten the input data. The first of these is the use of parentheses to allow a compact way of describing signal names which increment (or decrement) by one, i. e., typical signal names in a bus. The other method used is the equal sign. Using this symbol in a signal list says {{that the rest of the}} signals on that chip are the same as those on the previous chip described. Quicklist is intended to be the basis of a computer aided logic design system...|$|E
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{was designed}} for a <b>wire</b> <b>list</b> net sort problem. A branch and bound algorithm for the metric traveling salesman problem is presented for this. The algorithm is a best bound first recursive descent where the bound {{is based on the}} triangle inequality. The bounded subsets are defined by the relative order of the first K of the N cities (i. e., a K city subtour). When K equals N, the bound is the length of the tour. The algorithm is implemented as a one page subroutine written in the C programming language for the VAX 11 / 750. Average execution times for randomly selected planar points using the Euclidean metric are 0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 42, and 3. 13 seconds for ten, fifteen, twenty, and twenty-five cities, respectively. Maximum execution times for a hundred cases are less than eleven times the averages. The speed of the algorithms is due to an initial ordering algorithm that is a N squared operation. The algorithm also solves the related problem where the tour does not return to the starting city and the starting and/or ending cities may be specified. It is possible to extend the algorithm to solve a nonsymmetric problem satisfying the triangle inequality...|$|E
