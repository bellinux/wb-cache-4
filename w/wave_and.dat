5|$|A complex {{formation}} {{involving a}} tropical <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> a gale over the Gulf of Tehuantepec formed Tropical Depression One-E on May 24. It slowly strengthened {{into the first}} tropical storm of the season two days later. Alma then turned north, moving {{near the edge of}} a subtropical ridge over Mexico. Its rate of intensification picked up, and Alma became a hurricane on May 28. Alma reached Category3 intensity on May 30. The hurricane began to weaken almost immediately thereafter under the influence of wind shear and cool water. Alma rapidly fell apart, and degenerated into a weak low pressure area by June 1.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Holly Compton (September 10, 1892– March 15, 1962) was an American {{physicist}} {{who won the}} Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for his 1923 {{discovery of}} the Compton effect, which demonstrated the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation. It was a sensational discovery at the time: the wave nature of light had been well-demonstrated, {{but the idea that}} light had both <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> particle properties was not easily accepted. He is also known for his leadership of the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, and served as Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis from 1945 to 1953.|$|E

5|$|Back to the Egg is {{the seventh}} and final studio album by the British-American band Wings, {{released}} in 1979 on Columbia Records in America, and on Parlophone in the UK. Co-produced by Chris Thomas, the album reflects band leader Paul McCartney's embracing of contemporary musical trends such as new <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> punk, and marked the arrival of new Wings members Laurence Juber and Steve Holley. Back to the Egg adopts a loose conceptual theme around {{the idea of a}} working band, and its creation coincided with a period of considerable activity for the group, which included making a return to touring and work on several television and film projects.|$|E

40|$|Plasma <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> instabilities are {{integrally}} {{involved with}} the plasma "pickup" process and the mass loading of the solar wind (thus the formation of ion tails and the magnetic tails). Anisotropic plasmas generated by solar wind-comet interactions (the bow shock, magnetic field pileup) cause the generation of plasma waves which in turn "smooth out" these discontinuities. The plasma <b>waves</b> evolve <b>and</b> form plasma turbulence. Comets are perhaps the best "laboratories" to study <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> turbulence because over time (and distance) one can identify the <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> their evolution. We will argue that comets in some ways are better laboratories than magnetospheres, interplanetary space and fusion devices to study nonlinear <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> their evolution...|$|R
40|$|Observations of currents, <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> {{sediment}} transport were {{made during the}} LEACOAST 2 experiment. The objective is to understand the {{sediment transport}} in this energetic environment in combined <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> currents. For this {{it is necessary to}} calculate the bed shear stress. The use of observed data for Reynolds’ stress calculations is problematical for combined <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> currents. Direct Reynolds’ stress calculations in combined <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> currents are contaminated by waves even though the instrument should be outside the wave boundary layer (although within the tidal current boundary layer) even when the observations are corrected for tilt. In theory there should be no contribution from the irrotational wave motion in the covariance method of obtaining the bottom stress but in practice a very small error in tilt can produce an error contribution from the wave motion which can overwhelm the turbulent contribution. It is not straightforward to remove the effect of <b>waves,</b> since <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> turbulence co-exist at wave frequencies. Various methods for separation of <b>waves</b> <b>and</b> turbulence are examined...|$|R
5|$|Before the 1960s, {{explicit}} sexuality of {{any kind}} was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a counterculture. New <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, {{faster and more}} {{aggressive}} styles such as hardcore punk (e.g. Minor Threat), street punk (e.g. the Exploited), and anarcho-punk (e.g. Crass) had become the predominant mode of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued {{a broad range of}} other variations, giving rise to post-punk and new <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> later indie pop, alternative rock, and noise rock. By the 1990s, punk rock had re-emerged in the mainstream, as pop punk bands such as Green Day and the Offspring brought the genre widespread popularity.|$|E

They throw Cain from the helicopter to the ground to be eaten by zombies, including the now-turned Dr. Ashford. The survivors escape in the chopper as the nuclear bomb detonates over the City Hall, catching the chopper in the blast <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> forcing it to crash.

A large high pressure system over the northern Gulf of Mexico forced the system southward, where it developed significant convection. The system developed a warm core, and on October 1 the storm organized into Tropical Storm Larry while located 300mi (483km) east-southeast of Tampico, Mexico.|$|E

The ninth tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the season, Isis developed on September 1 from an interaction between a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> a large surface circulation to the southwest of Mexico. It moved northward, striking the extreme southeastern portion of the Baja California peninsula before attaining hurricane status in the Gulf of California.

The remnants persisted for several days before dissipating in the U.S. state of Idaho.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all moving particles—particularly subatomic particles such as electrons—exhibit {{a degree of}} wave-like behavior. Erwin Schrödinger, fascinated by this idea, explored {{whether or not the}} movement of an electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than as a particle. Schrödinger's equation, published in 1926, describes an electron as a wavefunction instead of as a point particle. This approach elegantly predicted many of the spectral phenomena that Bohr's model failed to explain. Although this concept was mathematically convenient, it was difficult to visualize, and faced opposition. One of its critics, Max Born, proposed instead that Schrödinger's wavefunction described not the electron but rather all its possible states, and thus could be used to calculate the probability of finding an electron at any given location around the nucleus. This reconciled the two opposing theories of particle versus wave electrons and the idea of wave–particle duality was introduced. This theory stated that the electron may exhibit the properties of both a <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> a particle. For example, it can be refracted like a <b>wave,</b> <b>and</b> has mass like a particle.|$|E

At the time x-rays were an important means of investigating atomic structures, but the concept that light had both <b>wave</b> <b>and</b> particle properties, as demonstrated by Arthur Compton, was not universally accepted.
