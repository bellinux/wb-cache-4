5|$|Blue whale strandings are {{extremely}} uncommon, and, {{because of the}} species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of. When strandings do occur, they can {{become the focus of}} public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed up near Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Due to Langmuir's efforts, and the {{research}} of Schaefer at General Electric, the concept of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on December 20, 1946 by seeding a cloud. This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project Cirrus, the first large study of cloud physics and weather modification. Its most important goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to weaken hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{everything}} was always harmonious between {{the king and}} the archbishop. In 1156, Theobald supported the efforts of Osbert de Bayeux, {{who was accused of}} poisoning William the Archbishop of York, to secure a trial for his alleged crimes in an ecclesiastical court rather than in the royal court. The crime had taken place during Stephen's reign, but Stephen's death had prevented Osbert from being tried in 1154. The delay allowed the shifting of the trial to the church courts, which Henry opposed. Although Theobald's position displeased the king no open rupture ensued. Theobald himself admitted to the papacy in 1154 that English custom <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> clergy for crimes in the secular courts.|$|E

5|$|While {{preparing}} for his southern journey, Shackleton gave instructions to Edgeworth David {{to lead a}} Northern party to Victoria Land to carry out magnetic and geological work. The party <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to reach the Magnetic Pole, and was {{to carry out a}} full geological survey in the Dry Valley area. David's party consisted of himself, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay. It would be a man-hauling party; the dogs remained at base to be used for depot-laying and other routine work. The party had orders to plant the Union Jack at the Magnetic Pole and to take possession of Victoria Land for the British Empire. After several days' preparatory work, they started out on 5 October 1908, drawn for the first few miles by the motor car.|$|E
5|$|In late 1959, James Lawson {{and other}} members of the NCLC's {{projects}} committee met with department store owners Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch counters. Both men declined, saying that they would lose more business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small groups of students purchased items at the stores and then sat at their lunch counters and attempted to order food. Their goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch counters, the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were low-key and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them.|$|E
5|$|Ludvig G. Braathen died on 27 December 1976 {{while he}} was still CEO. He was succeeded by his son Bjørn G. Braathen, who had {{returned}} to the company a few years earlier. In 1977, Braathens SAFE made NOK10 million in profit on the Trondheim route and NOK4 million on the routes from Oslo to Kristiansand and Stavanger. At the same time, the airline lost NOK6 million on the routes to from Oslo to Ålesund, Molde and Kristiansund, and NOK18 million on the coastal routes between Stavanger and Tromsø. From 1 October 1978, the company also introduced 50% youth discount for people under 26 years. From 1 May 1978, there was introduced a NOK100 tax on international charter flights. The same year, Braathens SAFE bought 15% of Bergenske Dampskibsselskab, that owned 51% of the travel agency Bennett Reisebureau. This <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to secure influence over the chain, that was also owned 31% by SAS. A new, neutral ticketing system, SMART, was introduced in 1980 for all travel agents in Norway and Sweden. Following this, Braathens SAFE sold its stake in Bergenske with a profit.|$|E

5|$|The Persian army {{seems to}} have made slow {{progress}} through Thrace and Macedon. News of the imminent Persian approach eventually reached Greece in August thanks to a Greek spy. At {{this time of year}} the Spartans, de facto military leaders of the alliance, were celebrating the festival of Carneia. During the Carneia, military activity was forbidden by Spartan law; the Spartans had arrived too late at the Battle of Marathon because of this requirement. It was also the time of the Olympic Games, and therefore the Olympic truce, and thus it would have been doubly sacrilegious for the whole Spartan army to march to war. On this occasion, the ephors decided the urgency was sufficiently great to justify an advance expedition to block the pass, under one of its kings, Leonidas I. Leonidas took with him the 300 men of the royal bodyguard, the Hippeis. This expedition <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to gather as many other Greek soldiers along the way as possible and to await the arrival of the main Spartan army.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to get some of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms {{he is going to be}} there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{were the}} reigning UEFA Cup champions, they had beaten Belgian team Club Brugge 4–3 on {{aggregate}} {{to win the}} 1975–76 UEFA Cup. Liverpool entered the competition as English champions having won the 1975–76 Football League First Division. They were drawn against the Northern Irish champions Crusaders in the first round. The first leg was a home tie at Anfield, which Liverpool won 2–0 courtesy of a Phil Neal penalty and a John Toshack goal. The second leg away at Seaview, was won 5–0 by Liverpool. Four of the goals were scored within nine minutes {{of the end of}} the match, to make the scoreline seem more one-sided than the match actually was. Liverpool won the tie 7–0 and were drawn against Turkish champions Trabzonspor in the second round. The first leg was played in Turkey at Hüseyin Avni Aker Stadium. Liverpool's plan <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to avoid defeat, however that plan failed when Trabzonsor were awarded a penalty midway through the second half. Trabzonspor converted the subsequent penalty and won the match 1–0. Liverpool recovered in the second leg at Anfield. Three goals early in the first half meant they won the match 3–0 to win the tie 3–1 on aggregate and progress to the quarter-finals.|$|E

5|$|The Brindle Tails {{desperately wanted}} Clayton {{out of the}} governor's office. Conveniently, Lieutenant Governor James M. Johnson was a Brindle Tail, so the natural course of action <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> {{to get rid of}} Clayton and let Johnson succeed him. Clayton was well aware of their plans, and when he left the state briefly for New York on {{business}} concerning the Holford Bonds, he informed no one. When Johnson, who was at home some distance from the capital, found out he tried to head to the capital to take control and have Clayton arrested and impeached. He arrived too late. Subsequently, after Johnson made a speech demanding changes in the administration, the Minstrels started to target Johnson. On January 30, 1871, they introduced articles of impeachment in the General Assembly against him. The chief charge was that Johnson, acting as the President of the Senate, had administered the oath of office to Joseph Brooks, who had recently been elected as state senator, and then recognized him on the floor. Although this was legitimately within his powers as the lieutenant governor to do, he escaped impeachment by only two votes. The scrutiny of the proceedings seriously damaged his reputation, even though he had done nothing wrong, and his political career never recovered.|$|E
