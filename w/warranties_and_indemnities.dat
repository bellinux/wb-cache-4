40|$|This article {{explains}} {{the notion of}} free and open source software (‘FOSS’) and the reasons why governments throughout the world are giving it close consideration. In particular, it highlights key legal issues facing the adoption and development of FOSS by governments. From the aspect of government procurement the article examines the models used by governments to create {{a level playing field}} for the supply of FOSS, intellectual property <b>warranties</b> <b>and</b> <b>indemnities</b> and the operation of the Trade Practices Act. In terms of government development of FOSS, the article considers the licensing mechanisms that will be implemented in the development and distribution of such software. In the final section, the article assesses the threat software patents and the current SCO litigation provide for FOSS. The article concludes by emphasising that governments need to be fully aware of this landscape to assess what is the most effective technology available...|$|E
40|$|Governments {{are such}} {{significant}} purchasers of IT {{products and services}} that their purchasing decisions have a substantial impact on the world’s IT marketplace. This fact {{calls into question the}} wisdom of decisions by a few policymakers (on national, state, and local levels) around the world that have sought to require that governmental procurement officials give varying degrees of preference to open source software (OSS) when evaluating competing software solutions, claiming, among other things, that such preferences are justified because OSS is cheaper and more interoperable than proprietary software and needs government handicapping in order to enter the market to compete with established proprietary software providers. Such procurement preferences for specific technology solutions or software licensing/business models, whether overt or implicit, are bad public policy and do not reflect the realities of the current IT marketplace. They arbitrarily force product uniformity and vendor lock-in, thereby significantly impeding the benefits of choice, competition, and innovation that flow from technical solutions based on multiple interoperable sources. As a result, governments are prevented from securing the best technical solution available. This approach is particularly imprudent given the current rapid convergence of technologies in an increasingly heterogeneous IT eco-system that permits the ability to choose and combine the best proprietary and best open source products to forge an ideal solution. But software procurement preferences are not simply bad public policy. As demonstrated, court decisions in Brazil and Belgium indicate that they may also be per se illegal under well-established principles of law including equal protection and non-discrimination. Accordingly, policymakers should develop procurement policies that are neutral with respect to specific technologies or platforms and that allow the governmental decisionmaker to choose the best alternative [...] OSS or proprietary software [...] in a particular situation based on reasonable, objective criteria, including (1) total cost over the projected life of the product; (2) interoperability; (3) reliability; (4) vendor support; (5) ease of use; (6) security; and (7) availability of <b>warranties</b> <b>and</b> <b>indemnities</b> for intellectual property claims...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to granting rights and imposing {{restrictions on the}} use of copyrighted software, software licenses typically contain provisions which allocate liability and responsibility between the parties entering into the license agreement. In enterprise and commercial software transactions these terms often include limitations of liability, <b>warranties</b> <b>and</b> <b>warranty</b> disclaimers, <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> if the software infringes intellectual property rights of others.|$|R
40|$|In 1956 the Supreme Court in Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corp. implied a {{warranty}} of workman-like {{performance in}} stevedoring contracts.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) and commuter rail agencies often share rights-of-way {{with each other and}} with freight railroads. Negotiating agreements that govern the shared use of infrastructure can be challenging, especially on issues such as liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity.</b> As requested, this report discusses (1) the liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions in agreements among passenger and freight railroads, and the resulting implications of these provisions; (2) federal and state court opinions and Surface Transportation Board (STB) decisions related to contractual liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions of passenger and freight railroad agreements; (3) factors that influence the negotiations of liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions among passenger and freight railroads; and (4) potential options for facilitating negotiations of liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions. GAO obtained information from all existing and proposed commuter rail agencies, Amtrak, and major freight railroads through site visits or telephone interviews. GAO analyzed the liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions in agreements between commuter rail agencies, Amtrak, and freight railroads. GAO also reviewed federal and state laws, STB decisions, and court cases related to liability <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> provisions. The Department of Transportation and STB had no comments on the report. Amtrak provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate. GAO is not making recommendations in this report. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{first section}} {{describes}} {{the historical development of}} contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity,</b> from {{a contractual obligation}} to a court implied obligation followed by an expansion to various federally regulated fields. The second section investigates the ERISA fiduciary sections, their differences with traditional trust law, their legislative history, and the purposes of ERISA. The third section examines the position of the various federal courts on the issue of contribution or <b>indemnity</b> <b>and</b> their rationales, along with that of the commentators. Since ERISA generally does not permit actions against nonfiduciaries, this article excludes those opinions dealing with contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> between a fiduciary and a non-fiduciary, most of which appeared prior to the Supreme Court's pronouncement with respect to non-fiduciaries. The fourth section provides the solution pursuant to the Supreme Court's directive for finding contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> for a federal statute, finds that the statutory language does not support contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity,</b> <b>and</b> shows that the solution of disallowing contribution <b>and</b> <b>indemnity</b> comports with the legislative history and the purposes of ERISA...|$|R
40|$|Along with {{increasing}} the warranty period for complex systems, reducing the warranty servicing costs {{has become an}} issue of great importance to the manufacturers. One possible {{way to reduce the}} expected warranty servicing cost is by making sound decision on the product <b>warranty</b> <b>and</b> maintenance strategies. Therefore, <b>warranties</b> (basic <b>warranty</b> <b>and</b> extended <b>warranty)</b> <b>and</b> maintenance (corrective and preventive) are strongly interlinked and of great interest to both manufacturers and customers. This paper is the first identifiable academic literature review to deal with <b>warranty</b> <b>and</b> maintenance. It provides a classification scheme for the articles that link <b>warranty</b> <b>and</b> maintenance published between 2001 and 2011 covering 44 journals and proposes a taxonomy scheme to classify these articles. Nine hundred articles were identified for their relevance to <b>warranty</b> <b>and</b> were carefully reviewed. One-hundred and twenty-two articles were subsequently selected for their relevance to maintenance and included in the classification. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
