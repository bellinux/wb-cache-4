There she wrote 100 pages of a novel called The Villain, which was never published. The work was scrapped, but ended up {{being part of the}} basis for The Odd Woman. According to author Jane Hill, it <b>was</b> <b>while</b> working on The Odd Women that Godwin transitioned from linear narratives to more complex structures where the plot interweaves past and present events.|$|E

5|$|Despite this protest, {{two sets}} of {{illustrations}} for Candide were produced by the French artist Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune. The first version was done, at Moreau's own expense, in 1787 and included in Kehl's publication of that year, Oeuvres Complètes de Voltaire. Four images were drawn by Moreau for this edition and were engraved by Pierre-Charles Baquoy. The second version, in 1803, consisted of seven drawings by Moreau which were transposed by multiple engravers. The twentieth-century modern artist Paul Klee stated that it <b>was</b> <b>while</b> reading Candide that he discovered his own artistic style. Klee illustrated the work, and his drawings were published in a 1920 version edited by Kurt Wolff.|$|E

5|$|Given the {{difficulty}} of the task of educating his brother while earning a living, Jacques-Joseph decided to send his younger brother to the well-regarded school of the Abbé Dussert in November 1802, where Champollion would stay until the summer of 1804. During this period, his gift for languages first became evident: he started out learning Latin and Greek, but quickly progressed to Hebrew and other Semitic languages such as Arabic, Syriac and Chaldean. It <b>was</b> <b>while</b> a student here that he took up interest in Ancient Egypt, likely encouraged in this direction by Dussert and his brother, both orientalists.|$|E

5|$|In ecclesiastical affairs, Hugh {{attended}} the 1163 Council of Tours {{that was held}} by Pope Alexander III. In 1179 he {{attended the}} Lateran Council at Rome.

This council condemned some of Gilbert de la Porrée's teachings, and consecrated Foliot as Bishop of Hereford.

It <b>was</b> <b>while</b> filming Goldfinger that Connery also became a fan of golf.|$|E

5|$|When Guggenheim {{closed her}} gallery in 1947 {{to move to}} Venice, artists like Pollock had to find new representation. The Betty Parsons Gallery, which opened the {{previous}} year, began representing Pollock, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still. Parsons was already representing Adolph Gottlieb, Hedda Sterne and Theodoros Stamos. It <b>was</b> <b>while</b> Pollock showed at Parsons' gallery that he started making his iconic drip-paintings in 1947. It was also here that Barnett Newman exhibited his first breakthrough works in 1950. Rothko, who had arrived at his distinctive mural sized paintings in 1947, first exhibited them at the Parsons Gallery.|$|E
5|$|When old enough, Brunt was {{enrolled}} at Ellesmere College, where his mischievous streak became quickly apparent through pranks and dares; once, {{while in the}} sanatorium with mumps, he slipped a laxative into the matron's tea. Nevertheless, he is fondly remembered at the school. It <b>was</b> <b>while</b> he was at Ellesmere that he contracted measles, resulting in his need to wear glasses. An enthusiastic sportsman, Brunt played cricket, hockey, rugby, water polo and wrestling. He was the only pupil at the school to tackle the headmaster while playing rugby, injuring the older man's knee in the process.|$|E
5|$|According to his autobiography, it <b>was</b> <b>while</b> {{he was in}} {{bed with}} a fever that Wallace thought about Thomas Malthus's idea of {{positive}} checks on human population growth and {{came up with the idea}} of natural selection. Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of Ternate at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that on the basis of the journal he kept at the time, he was on the island of Gilolo. From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E

By the end of 1929, Briskin was the assistant general manager of Columbia, and {{on a visit to}} New York City signed several Broadway playwrights to long-term contracts with the studio, including Elmer Harris, Jo Swerling, and Paul Hervey Fox. Not only was Briskin active in the production office at Columbia, but he also played on Columbia's baseball team, which competed in the Motion Picture Baseball League.
