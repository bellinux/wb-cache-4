5|$|The commonness and {{centrality}} {{of wine in}} daily life in biblical times is apparent from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible. Positively, for example, <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> used {{as a symbol of}} abundance, and of physical blessing. Negatively, <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> personified as a mocker and beer a brawler, and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgment and wrath.|$|E
5|$|The art of {{preparing}} <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> described in Manasollasa from grape and sugarcane, with unusual sources being based on brewing of Talimadya (palm), Narikelasava (coconut) and Khajurasava (date).|$|E
5|$|Conclusions on dietary {{components}} have {{at times}} {{been difficult to}} ascertain as results have differed between population-based studies and randomised controlled trials. There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly red <b>wine,</b> <b>is</b> associated with lower risk of AD. There is tentative evidence that caffeine may be protective. A number of foods high in flavonoids such as cocoa, red wine, and tea may decrease the risk of AD.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wines</b> <b>are</b> {{produced}} {{under three}} different labels. Their very best <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> labelled Strewn Terroir, including their red Strewn Three meritage. Their general <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> simply labelled Strewn.|$|R
50|$|All of Inniskillin's <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> VQA <b>wines</b> {{and most}} <b>are</b> varietal, and their range of table <b>wines</b> <b>is</b> marketed in five levels.|$|R
50|$|Strictly speaking, natural <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> <b>wines</b> that <b>are</b> {{produced}} {{without adding}} or removing anything during winemaking, although some growers add tiny quantities of sulphites at bottling, so that strictly speaking their <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> not natural <b>wines,</b> but 'only' organic (and possibly biodynamic).|$|R
5|$|In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning (chapter 38), the enthroned {{figure of}} High {{explains}} that Odin gives {{all of the}} food on his table to his wolves Geri and Freki and that Odin requires no food, for <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> to him both meat and drink. High then quotes the above-mentioned stanza from the poem Grímnismál in support. In chapter 75 of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál {{a list of names}} for wargs and wolves is provided that includes both Geri and Freki.|$|E
5|$|New York Riesling {{generally}} has a characteristic effervescent light {{body with a}} similarly light, mellow flavor. The wine can be dynamic though rarely robust, and ranges from dry to sweet. New York is also a notable producer of Riesling-based Ice Wine, although {{a large majority of}} New York Ice <b>Wine</b> <b>is</b> made from Vidal blanc and Vignoles.|$|E
5|$|The general {{principle}} behind {{the process of}} qiyas {{is based on the}} understanding that every legal injunction guarantees a beneficial and welfare satisfying objective. Thus, if the cause of an injunction can be deduced from the primary sources, then analogical deduction can be applied to cases with similar causes. For example, <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> prohibited in Islam because of its intoxicating property. Thus qiyas leads to the conclusion that all intoxicants are forbidden.|$|E
25|$|As {{in much of}} {{the ancient}} world, sweet white <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> the most highly {{regarded}} style. <b>Wines</b> <b>were</b> often very alcoholic, with Pliny noting that a cup of Falernian would catch fire from a candle flame drawn too close. <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> often diluted with warm water, occasionally seawater.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} local grape varieties {{appear to}} have <b>been</b> lost. Jordanian <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> therefore of necessity made from imported varieties of Vitis vinifera. Red <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> made using Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Shiraz and Pinot Noir. White <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> made using Chardonnay, Muscat, Pinot Gris, Gewurztraminer and Chenin Blanc.|$|R
50|$|The Yulupa Series <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> bottled {{exclusively}} for the restaurant market. Varietals include Chardonnay, White Zinfandel, Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, and a sparkling wine called Cuvée Brut. Grapes for these <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> sourced from across California and bottles list California on the labels as the appellation. These <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> considered budget <b>wines.</b>|$|R
5|$|Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc {{was one of}} {{the first}} fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in {{commercial}} quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. The <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> usually consumed young, as it does not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.|$|E
5|$|Carménère wine has a {{deep red}} color and aromas found in red fruits, spices and berries. The tannins are gentler and softer than those in Cabernet Sauvignon {{and it is a}} medium body wine. As a result many find it can be drunk easily with fish. Although mostly used as a {{blending}} grape, wineries do bottle a pure varietal Carménère which, when produced from grapes at optimal ripeness, imparts a cherry-like, fruity flavor with smoky, spicy and earthy notes and a deep crimson color. Its taste might also be reminiscent of dark chocolate, tobacco, and leather. The <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> best to drink while it is young.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the wine}} {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, kosher wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines began to be produced and consumed after {{the introduction of the}} Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> {{generally}} {{cut with}} water. The drinking of akraton or [...] "unmixed wine", though {{known to be}} practised by northern barbarians, was thought {{likely to lead to}} madness and death. <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> mixed in a krater, from which the slaves would fill the drinker's kylix with an oinochoe (jugs). <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> also thought to have medicinal powers. Aelian mentions that the wine from Heraia in Arcadia rendered men foolish but women fertile; conversely, Achaean <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> thought to induce abortion.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{of the red}} <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> {{meant to}} be {{consumed}} [...] "while waiting for Hermitage and Cote-Rotie to mature." [...] The best <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> found {{in the south and}} the vines in this region can be upwards of 100 years old. Generally the <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> defined by the young fruit that makes them very drinkable while young.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, Móinéir, a fruit <b>wine,</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} by Wicklow Way Wines. Currently, a strawberry wine, and a blackberry & elderberry <b>wine,</b> <b>are</b> {{produced by the}} company.|$|R
5|$|Riesling {{wines are}} often {{consumed}} when young, {{when they make}} a fruity and aromatic wine which may have aromas of green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Since only castles {{built of}} stone and walled towns {{had been able to}} resist Mongol attacks, {{following}} the withdrawal of the Mongols the kings encouraged both the landowners and the townspeople to build stone fortifications. New stone fortresses were built, for example, at Codlea, Rimetea, and Unguraş. The process of urbanization was characterized by the predominance of the Saxon towns: out of the eight towns in Transylvania, only Alba Iulia and Dej were situated in the counties. A charter referring to inns, bakeries, and bathhouses in Rodna proves the city-like way of life of its inhabitants. Salt was still the most important item of trade in this period, but trading with oxen, maidservants, and <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> also documented in royal charters.|$|E
5|$|The apéritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E
50|$|Wissett <b>Wines</b> <b>are</b> {{produced}} at the Valley Farm Vineyards by Elaine Heeler and Vanessa Tucker, {{who brought the}} business in 2014, Wissett <b>Wines</b> <b>was</b> established in 1987.|$|R
50|$|The Central Otago <b>wine</b> region <b>is</b> the world's southern-most {{commercial}} wine growing region. Central Otago's best-known <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> its Pinot noirs, but many white <b>wine</b> varieties <b>are</b> also popular. The Central Otago <b>Wine</b> Region <b>is</b> the formal geographic indication for wines grown in Central Otago.|$|R
50|$|The rosé <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> {{made from}} Cabernet Franc, Sauvignon, Côt, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier, Pinot gris, Pineau d'Aunis, Gamay and Grolleau grape varieties. These <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> dry in character.|$|R
5|$|The main {{buyers of}} {{medicine}} made from slow lorises are middle- to upper-class women {{between the ages}} of 25 and 45 who primarily use loris rice wine tonic to alleviate the pain of childbirth. One bottle of <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> made by mixing rice wine with the carcasses of three dead animals. Minority groups in Cambodia also use loris-based medicine for treating broken bones, asthma, and sexually transmitted diseases. A survey by primatologist Anna Nekaris etal. (2010) showed that these belief systems were so strong that the majority of respondents expressed reluctance to consider alternatives to loris-based medicines.|$|E
5|$|The {{most popular}} {{alcoholic}} drink in Switzerland is wine. Switzerland is notable for {{the variety of}} grapes grown {{because of the large}} variations in terroirs, with their specific mixes of soil, air, altitude and light. Swiss <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> produced mainly in Valais, Vaud (Lavaux), Geneva and Ticino, with a small majority of white wines. Vineyards have been cultivated in Switzerland since the Roman era, even though certain traces can be found of a more ancient origin. The most widespread varieties are the Chasselas (called Fendant in Valais) and Pinot noir. The Merlot is the main variety produced in Ticino.|$|E
5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is interesting that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E
5000|$|The white <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> made of Mauzac, Sauvignon blanc or Muscadelle, Len de l'El and Ondenc, local grape varieties. Table wines, dessert {{wines and}} {{sparkling}} <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> all made.|$|R
5000|$|... "When {{compared}} {{with data from}} non-drinkers, the cumulative lifetime consumption {{of all types of}} alcohol in grams of ethanol… beer, spirits, red wine and fortified <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> not related to risk. The consumption of white <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> inversely associated with risk…. The uniformly reduced risk estimates for the lifetime number of drinks of white <b>wine</b> <b>were</b> based on small numbers…." ...|$|R
50|$|A notable {{difference}} for <b>wines</b> <b>is</b> that DOCG labelled <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> analysed and tasted by government-licensed personnel before being bottled. To prevent later manipulation, DOCG <b>wine</b> bottles then <b>are</b> sealed with a numbered governmental seal across the cap or cork.|$|R
5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> a blend of vintages. Vintage champagne must spend {{a minimum of three}} years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E
5|$|As the Scions mourn their fallen comrade, Aymeric parleys for aid in Ishgard's {{defense against}} Nidhogg's forces. Minfilia and Alphinaud reluctantly pledge {{the support of}} the Scions and Crystal Braves, though the other Grand Company leaders decline to provide assistance, citing {{domestic}} troubles and remembering Ishgard's reticence during the three Garlean invasions. The adventurer leads a band of volunteers at the Steps of Faith, Ishgard's main bridge. They manage to repel the attack and a victory celebration is held at Ul'dah with the hopes of pressuring Ishgard to rejoin the Alliance. At the banquet, Sultana Nanamo Ul Namo privately discloses to the Warrior of Light that she plans to dissolve the monarchy in order to erode the power of the Syndicate which is the source of much of Ul'dah's corruption. However, the sultana's <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> poisoned and Teledji Adeledji bursts in to accuse the player of regicide just as Nanamo takes her last breath. Adeledji brings the adventurer forward to the banquet with his charges and denounces Raubahn for his negligence. Enraged, Raubahn murders Adeledji but Lolorito, another scheming Syndicate member, takes this as proof of Raubahn's guilt and has him arrested. The Crystal Braves are revealed to be in the pay of Lolorito and attempt to apprehend the fleeing Scions who are taken out one by one. Only a humbled Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light manage to escape with the help of Raubahn's son Pipin Tarupin. Cid takes them to Coerthas where the grateful Ishgardians grant them asylum from the Syndicate's pursuers.|$|E
25|$|Vienna, {{along with}} Paris, Santiago, Cape Town, Prague, Canberra, Bratislava and Warsaw , {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} world capital cities with its own vineyards. The <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> served in small Viennese pubs known as Heuriger, which are especially numerous in the wine growing areas of Döbling (Grinzing, Neustift am Walde, Nußdorf, Salmannsdorf, Sievering), Floridsdorf (Stammersdorf, Strebersdorf), Liesing (Mauer) and Favoriten (Oberlaa). The <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> often drunk as a Spritzer ("G'spritzter") with sparkling water. The Grüner Veltliner, a dry white <b>wine,</b> <b>is</b> the most widely cultivated wine in Austria.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{more or less}} {{dry white}} <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> most common among the {{sparkling}} wines, but sparkling rosé and red <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> also produced, as well as wines of varying sweetness.|$|R
