The two breeds' names and origins were mixed once moved into England and the Americas. The dog from Labrador became the large, long-furred dog <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> know today, and the dog from Newfoundland became the Labrador.|$|E

25|$|Theories {{also help}} place {{events in a}} causal context that is greater than common sense alone can provide, because commonsense {{causation}} is inherently limited by what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> experience. Theoretical formulations are therefore used as intermediaries to link natural effects to natural causes.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{building blocks}} of experience, i.e. objective knowledge, are now in place. First there is the sensibility, which supplies the mind with intuitions, {{and then there is}} the understanding, which produces judgments of these intuitions and can subsume them under categories. These categories lift the intuitions up out of the subject's current state of consciousness and place them within consciousness in general, producing universally necessary knowledge. For the categories are innate in any rational being, so any intuition thought within a category in one mind is necessarily subsumed and understood identically in any mind. In other words, we filter what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> hear.|$|E
500|$|Music was {{incorporated}} {{as an essential}} part of the film; there are [...] "very specific bands" [...] placed in band posters in some parts, such as in the selection of the band poster on the walls of the bar. Kusama said [...] "he music was a huge component of the movie" [...] and this is first evident with [...] "the songs that <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> hear performed, but then, just the vibe of the movie actually". She said, [...] "As the movie progresses, it becomes a pretty clearly music-oriented movie. It's sort of a youth movie. Some of those bands were totally made up and some of them are not." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{budgetary}} constraints, {{both the}} on-set and post-production sound was poorly recorded. Anderegg wrote that this, {{in combination with}} Welles' fast-paced camera movements and editing, makes the Shakespearean dialogue more difficult to understand. Many scenes are shot in long shots or with character's backs facing the camera, most likely for practical purposes when actors were not present, creating more sound problems. [...] "In effect," [...] Anderegg writes, [...] "Welles generates a constant tension between what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> what we hear, a tension that points to the ambiguous status of language in its relation to action." [...] During the Battle of Shrewsbury sequence Welles used a complex and layered soundtrack that included the sounds of swords and armor clanking, soldiers grunting and screaming, bones breaking, boots {{in the mud and}} the film's musical score to add to the chaos of the scene.|$|E

500|$|Dalrymple {{advances}} {{that the kind}} of sentimentality that he wishes to draw attention to is [...] "an excess of emotion that is false, mawkish, and over-valued by comparison with reason" [...] and which is performed [...] "in full public view". Dalrymple contends that [...] "Sentimentality is the expression of emotion without judgment. Perhaps it is worse than that: it is the expression of emotion without an acknowledgement that judgment should enter into how we should react to what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> hear. It is the manifestation of a desire for the abrogation of an existential condition of human life, namely the need to always and never unendingly to exercise judgment. Sentimentality is therefore childish and reductive of our humanity". In this chapter he also takes issue with a number of assertions made by the philosopher Robert C. Solomon, including that sentimentality does not manipulate emotions, cause false emotions to be shown, or distort perception and interfere with rational thought.|$|E
500|$|Author Gary Tillery draws {{parallels}} between Harrison's approach to [...] " [...] {{through the motions}} of living in the material world" [...] and the way someone in the 21st century might play a virtual reality game. Tillery writes that [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> experience during the game is actually an illusion" [...] – or maya in the Hindu belief to which Harrison subscribed – and that [...] "hat does matter in the great scheme of things is to wake up from the dreamlike state we mistake for reality." [...] Speaking at a 1974 press conference, in reply to whether there was a [...] "paradox" [...] between his spiritualism and the lifestyle of a musician, Harrison conceded: [...] "It is difficult... You can go to the Himalayas and miss it completely and [...] be stuck in the middle of New York and be very spiritual... I think one by one we all free ourselves from the chains that we have chained ourselves to, whatever we're chained to." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hanson's best-known work is Patterns of Discovery (1958), {{in which}} he argues that what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> {{perceive}} is not what our senses receive, but is instead filtered sensory information, where the filter is our existing preconceptions [...] a concept later called a 'thematic framework.' He cited optical illusions such as the famous old Parisienne woman (Patterns of Discovery, p.11), which {{can be seen in}} different ways. Hanson drew a distinction between 'seeing as' and 'seeing that' which became a key idea in evolving theories of perception and meaning. He wanted to formulate a logic explaining how scientific discoveries take place. He used Charles Sanders Peirce's notion of abduction for this.|$|E
2500|$|Northrop Frye {{believed}} that the [...] "merging of imagination and time is the axis on which all Blake's thought turns.""Ah! Sun-flower" [...] (with its constrictions of space-time and its hint at creative, energetic imagination as a potential way out) {{seems to be an}} example of this dialectic, as the various responses of critics outlined below show. Another key to Blake's thought mentioned by Frye is that for [...] "Blake,...the fall of man" [...] (see:Fall of Man) [...] "and the creation of the physical world were the same event." [...] The world <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> live in is therefore a [...] "fallen" [...] natural world (a world of [...] "Generation") in which, since [...] "God is Man", humans are [...] "miserable in the state of nature." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bordwell {{has called}} the film opaque with {{characters}} {{that are difficult to}} interpret, unexplained conflicts, and major plot points that occur off-camera. Godard also sometimes frames characters to make them unrecognizable to the audience, films scenes with overlapping dialogue of characters on and off screen, and uses ellipses in scenes to create gaps in time. He also sometimes cuts to black frames, objects in the scene, or landscapes while dialogue from the scene is still heard. These techniques make the film both difficult to interpret and to comprehend. Bordwell believes [...] "we ought to find problems of comprehension fascinating. They remind us of storytelling conventions we take for granted, and they push toward other ways of spinning yarns, or unraveling them." [...] Bordwell believes that [...] "blocking or troubling our story-making process serves to re-weight the individual image and sound. When we can't easily tie what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> hear to an ongoing plot, we're coaxed to savor each moment as a micro-event in itself, like a word in a poem or a patch of color in a painting." ...|$|E
