5|$|The bulk of {{the route}} runs through forested areas, {{especially}} near the Učka range and near Pazin, with agricultural land in between those areas– most of it located between the Ivoli and Lupoglav interchanges. The final section of the route, near Opatija and the A7 motorway, runs through coastal areas affected by urbanization. The route crosses no major <b>watercourses,</b> although creeks adjacent to or spanned by the route drain into the Pazinčica and Boljunčica rivers, or directly into the Adriatic Sea {{in the case of}} <b>watercourses</b> flowing down Učka's eastern slopes. The Učka Tunnel contains a spring discovered during its construction and used for the water supply of Opatija ever since.|$|E

The suitability of the given measures was determined {{on the basis of}} the current state of the <b>watercourse.</b> In the chosen section there is a sedimentation reservoir with a boulder chute that has been subjected to an assessment of the stability of the slope surface. Then the HEC-RAS program is used to verify the flow capacity of the whole flow channel for the one-year flow Q 1 condition. Subsequently, the vegetation accompaniment and the coastal vegetation of the selected section of the <b>watercourse</b> were designed in order to naturally connect the <b>watercourse</b> to the surrounding forest vegetation...|$|R

5|$|During 2009 and 2010, {{work was}} {{undertaken}} to upgrade sluice gates, <b>watercourses,</b> and culverts to enable seasonal flooding of Southlake Moor {{during the winter}} diverting water from the Sowy River onto the moor. It {{has the capacity to}} hold 1.2 million cubic metres as part of a scheme by the Parrett Internal Drainage Board to restore ten floodplains in Somerset. In spring, the water is drained away to enable the land to be used as pasture during the summer. The scheme is also used to encourage water birds.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba is at {{the centre}} of the Hudson Bay {{drainage}} basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major <b>watercourses</b> include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock geology of {{the parish}} {{comprises}} rocks formed in the Santonian and Campanian ages of the Cretaceous period and the Eocene age of the Palaeogene period. In places these are overlain by younger Quaternary drift material: river terrace and head deposits, clay-with-flints, and alluvium—the last found only in the valley floors of the larger <b>watercourses.</b> On Puddletown Heath (now mostly covered by Puddletown Forest) are more than 370 solution hollows or sinkholes; these constitute the largest concentration of hollows on the heathlands in the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} habitats of {{this species}} were the semi-arid savanna, thornveld, and light woodland typical of southern Africa. When settled agriculture arrived in its range about a thousand years ago, it adapted to cultivated land, and since the arrival of settlement, it has moved into towns. The Cape sparrow prefers habitats with an annual rainfall of less than , though in desert areas it is usually found near <b>watercourses</b> or watering holes. While it occurs in urban centres, it prefers parks, gardens, and other open spaces, and has a low reproductive success in more built-up areas.|$|E
5|$|They live {{throughout}} rainforest, dry sclerophyll (Eucalyptus) forest, open woodland, Pandanus thickets, paperbarks, mangroves, <b>watercourses,</b> and wetter {{areas of}} semi-arid regions, {{as well as}} parks, gardens, and golf courses in urban areas. The understory in eucalypt-dominated woodland where the blue-faced honeyeater is found is most commonly composed of grasses such as Triodia, but sometimes it {{is made up of}} shrubs or small trees such as grevilleas, paperbarks, wattles, Cooktown ironwood (Erythrophleum chlorostachys) or billygoat plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana). One study in Kakadu National Park found that blue-faced honeyeaters inhabited mixed stands of eucalypts and Pandanus but were missing from pure stands of either plant.|$|E
5|$|But geology also {{provided}} an alternate route, albeit across foreign territory. The valleys of the Red and Minnesota Rivers {{lay in the}} beds of Glacial Lake Agassiz and its prehistoric outlet Glacial River Warren; the lands exposed when these bodies of water receded were flat plains between low uplands covered by prairie grasslands. At the Traverse Gap, only a mile (1.6 km) of land separated the Bois des Sioux River, a source stream of the Red (which flowed north to Hudson Bay) and the Little Minnesota River, a source stream of the Minnesota River (tributary to the Mississippi, which flowed south to the Gulf of Mexico). The valley floors and uplands of the <b>watercourses</b> along this gently graded route provided a natural thoroughfare to the south. The eyes of the colonists therefore turned to the new United States, both {{as a source of}} supplies and an (illegal) outlet for their furs.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{assessment}} process for the ten routes, two remained. One was route 1, the original suggestion which used the existing course of the South Forty-Foot Drain for most of its length, while the second was a new route, designated as route 11. Route 11 had become the preferred route by the summer of 2014. It involves widening the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to Surfleet, to a point near to the Black Hole Drove pumping station. A new lock would be needed at this location, but would connect to a new channel, rather than {{to the rest of the}} drain. It would pass under a new bridge on the A151, and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock. An environmental survey of other <b>watercourses</b> near to the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The brown honeyeater is {{seasonally}} nomadic {{across its}} local area {{in response to}} flowering food plants. For example, there are marked increases in numbers in Toowoomba in south-east Queensland during winter, and in the Northern Territory the range contracts during the dry season. It is commonly found among mangroves in coastal areas including black mangroves (Rhizophora mucronata). It is often in woodlands that merge into the mangroves, such as those dominated by Banksia, Melaleuca or Callistemon, and widespread in sclerophyll forests and eucalypt woodlands. In the arid and semi-arid inland of Australia it is most often recorded in Acacia, Grevillea and Hakea shrubland along <b>watercourses,</b> and at bores, springs and drainage lines. It visits flowering shrubs in parks and gardens, and occurs in remnant patches of trees on travelling stock routes.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} boobook {{is found}} across Australia, although is scarce in more arid regions such as western New South Wales, southwestern and western Queensland, much of South Australia {{away from the}} coast and interior Western Australia and Northern Territory. In drier areas it is generally found along <b>watercourses</b> such as the Darling and Paroo Rivers, and Lake Eyre basin. It is found on numerous offshore islands such as Groote Eylandt, Melville Island, Mornington Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria and many islands off eastern Australia. It is found in southern New Guinea, Roti, Timor and surrounding islands in Indonesia. It is found {{in a wide range}} of habitats, from forest and open woodland to scrubland and semi-desert areas. In Australia it resides in mainly Eucalypt forests. It has adapted to landscapes altered by human activity and is found in farmland and suburban areas as long as there are some scattered trees. In fact, it can adapt to any habitat as long as there are some trees present.|$|E
