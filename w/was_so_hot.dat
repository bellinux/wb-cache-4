5|$|Jolly Green 67 flew east at first, {{further into}} {{territory}} {{held by the}} North Vietnamese, before it turned southeast for a few kilometers, when a fire {{broke out in the}} left engine. Pieces of the tail rotor struck the main rotor, and the aircraft rolled and crashed on its left side, burning ferociously. No rescue beepers were heard. The entire crew was listed as MIA and presumed killed: Capt. Peter Hayden Chapman II (pilot), Capt. John Henry Call III (co-pilot), TSgt. William Roy Pearson, TSgt. Allen J. Avery (para-rescuemen), TSgt. Roy D. Prater (Crew Chief), and Sgt. James Harold Alley (combat photographer). The fire consuming the helicopter <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> it melted parts of the aircraft and continued to burn for three more days.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} heros {{throughout}} the exhausting {{five days of}} play, but with a doubt, the most unsung of them was Greg Matthews, who scored 44 and 27 not out and took five wickets in each innings. His stamina and resilience were absolutely staggering, especially on the last day, when he bowled 39.5 overs just about consecutively to keep us {{in the game and}} then ultimately tie it. Making his feat all the more noteworthy in the eyes of his fellow players was the fact that he wore two sleeveless sweaters throughout the day. Actually, he gave one to the umpire when he fielded and only wore them both when he was bowling. We just shook our heads in disbelief, because it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> with 90 degree humidity, but as usual Greg had a theory. He explained that nomadic herders in the desert wore woollen coats because they kept the cool air in, thus acting as a kind of air-conditioner.|$|E
500|$|Konnan {{was still}} working in Mexico while under {{contract}} to WWF, and was also simultaneously appearing in a Mexican telenovela aimed at children called [...] "El abuelo y yo". As he was becoming more popular in Mexico, he was not as focused on making it in America. Konnan recollected, [...] "Wrestling <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> in Mexico, because they had lifted this 30-year ban on wrestling on TV in Mexico City. I was able to capitalize on that wrestling boom. I was wrestling three times in one day on many weekends. The amount of work was incredible. It was like when Raw and Nitro were going head-to-head and there was work for everybody." ...|$|E

In between takes I had about 5 fans on me, one {{up the front}} of my dress, one up the back of my dress. I was wearing trainers againâ€”I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E
500|$|As a boy, {{inventor}} George Escol Sellers knew Eckfeldt; as Sellers's {{father was}} {{partner in a}} firm which sold machinery to the Mint Bureau, Eckfeldt often dined at his house. [...] In the final years both of the 19th century and of Sellers's life, he published his memoirs, including memories of the first Philadelphia Mint. [...] He recalled in 1812 peering through a window to see cents coined, and Eckfeldt coming into the room to stop the work {{at the end of}} the day. [...] Seeing the young Sellers, he had the boy come in, had him place a cent planchet on the press, and struck it for him. [...] Sellers nearly dropped it because it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot,</b> and Eckfeldt reminded him it had been cold when placed in the press. Eckfeldt bade him keep the coin until he learned why the cent had become hot, and then he could spend it on candy.|$|E
500|$|Bound for Glory 2006 {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews. Chris Sokol of the Slam Sports {{section of the}} Canadian Online Explorer rated the event a 7 out of 10. Sokol commented on the overall event stating that {{it was full of}} [...] "several surprises, a card full of good matches and crowd that <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> it would've melted the Impact Zone." [...] When it came to feelings on the bouts, James Caldwell said he felt that the main event match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was [...] "slightly above-average for a Jarrett PPV title match." [...] Caldwell also felt that the NWA World Tag Team Championship match was [...] "just a notch below Sabin-Senshi for match of the night so far." [...] Wade Keller rated the Tag Team Championship match 4 stars out of 5, the TNA X Division Championship match 3 and 3/4 stars, and the main event 2 and 1/2 stars. The event was released on DVD on January 30, 2007 by TNA Home Video.|$|E

500|$|The band's early tour {{vehicle was}} a [...] "tiny V6 that was running on three cylinders, {{and it was}} not getting enough air, so it would drive really slowly," [...] {{recalled}} Wentz. [...] "We had to turn on the hot air to reach the speed limit, so we had the heat on all the time in 120 degree weather. It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> it melted the plastic molding around the windows. When it rained, we'd get all wet." [...] John Janick of Fueled by Ramen had heard an early version of a song online and cold-called the band members at their apartment, first reaching Stump and later talking to Wentz for an hour. Rob Stevenson from Island Records eventually offered the band a [...] "first-ever incubator sort of deal," [...] in which they gave the band money to sign with Fueled by Ramen for the group's one-off debut, knowing they could [...] "upstream" [...] the band to radio on the sophomore record. Fueled by Ramen, at the time the smallest of independent labels clamoring to sign the band, would effectively release the group's debut album and help build the band's ever-expanding fanbase before the group moved to Island. The band again partnered with O'Keefe at Smart Studios, bringing together the three songs from the demo and recording an additional seven songs in nine days. The band, according to Stump, didn't [...] "sleep anywhere that we could shower [...] There was a girl that Andy's girlfriend at the time went to school with who let us sleep on her floor, but we'd be there for maybe four hours at a time. It was crazy." [...] As the band progressed and the members' roles became more defined, Wentz took lyrics extremely seriously in contrast to Stump, who had been the group's primary lyricist up to that point. Arguments during the recording sessions led to what [...] "most reductively boils down to Wentz writing the lyrics and Stump writing the melodies." ...|$|E
2500|$|The common media {{image of}} Custer's {{appearance}} at the Last Stand - buckskin coat and long, curly blonde hair - is wrong. Although he and several other officers wore buckskin coats on the expedition, they took them off and packed them away because it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot.</b> According to Soldier, an Arikara scout, [...] "Custer took off his buckskin coat and tied it behind his saddle." [...] Further, Custer- whose hair was thinning- joined a similarly balding Lieutenant Varnum and [...] "had the clippers run over their heads" [...] before leaving Fort Lincoln.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{remarkable}} turnaround, Lewis {{became the most}} bankable country star in the world. [...] He <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> in 1970 that his former Smash producer Shelby Singleton, who purchased Sun Records from Sam Phillips in July 1969, {{wasted no time in}} repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. [...] One of his latter unreleased Sun recordings, [...] "One Minute Past Eternity," [...] was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent Mercury hit [...] "She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye." [...] Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following The Golden Cream of the Country with A Taste of Country later in 1970.|$|E

2500|$|... "We had to {{go through}} torture to perfect the process of putting it on", Stanley {{admitted}} in 1996. [...] "I can remember plenty of times when I blinded myself with black eye make-up...In the beginning, the white was a zinc oxide cream which you can buy in any pharmacy. We didn't know what we were doing; we just wanted white faces...and the zinc oxide beating spraying ourselves with white paint. We eventually worked our way up to what's called 'clown white.' The two best brands are made by Stein's and Max Factor... At first, the black was Maybelline waterproof eyeliner, but it would crack because it's only meant to draw a line around your eye, not a whole star. Now we use black grease sticks, which are a more solid form of greasepaint. The silver that Peter and Ace use is made by Stein's, and it comes in bottles in either metallic gold or metallic silver...The only time we have problems is in situations of extreme heat. I remember doing a show when it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> and humid that the make-up literally ran off our faces. Between songs we'd run {{to the side of the}} stage to slap on more clown white!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{recording}} session {{occurred in}} April 2005 {{in the garage}} of Stevens' Nashville, Tennessee home, which {{was used as a}} temporary studio. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> in that garage the first session", guitarist Chris Rohman recalled in an interview. [...] "We go in there and we don't have the songs, we don't know what we're doing, we're stressed, he's stressed, and it's like 90 degrees [...] in the studio. Nobody wanted to be there." [...] Stevens began playing over the chords to [...] "I'm Not Alright", initially titled as [...] "I'll Be Fine", and at that point the band decided to rework the song's lyrical theme. [...] "We're not going to lie. We're {{not going to try to}} sit here and try to sugarcoat what's happening right now or say something because it sounds good. I'm not alright", Matt Hammit said. The previous material they had written was lyrically [...] "shifted to the stuff we were going through at [...] point". [...] "I'm Not Alright", which became the album's lead single, was rewritten and represented the themes of brokenness and confession on The Face of Love. Mark Graalman noted: [...] "It's been an unbelievably hard year for the band. But we've learned to rely on Godâ€™s grace, and we've learned to be honest and transparent. [...] Being honest and transparent means not faking it; it has to be OK to say, 'No, I'm not alright'." ...|$|E
2500|$|General Churchill's {{command of}} {{approximately}} 5500 Confederates found themselves facing a Union Army under Union Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand totaling over 33,000 {{along with a}} Naval Taskforce {{under the command of}} Admiral David D. Porter. On the morning of January 11 McClernand's forces were deployed in an arc facing Fort Hindman and its rifle-pits. [...] Churchill's defenses were manned by Colonel James Deshler's brigade on the left and Colonel Robert Garland's brigade on the right. One section of 6 pound guns from Hart's Battery, under the command of Lieutenant E.A. DuBose was stationed, on the right flank of the 10th Texas Cavalry (dismounted). McClernand's infantry attacked around 1:00pm and made little progress at first. [...] At the same time Porter's gunboats moved in to attack aided by Colonel Lindsey's brigade across the river. Within an hour the fort's east face was reduced to rubble and its artillery silenced. [...] Captain Hart's battery, owing to its initial effectiveness in creating casualties and stopping repeated Union assaults, was singled out for special attention from Union fire, including sharpshooters. Colonel James Desher observed that the fire <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hot</b> that it became impossible for any of Hart's men to show themselves with out being struck. At 4:30pm McClernand was planning to order one massive assault against the defenders when white flags of surrender began to appear. The battle ended with some confusion. Porter's gunboats picked up infantry from Lindsey's brigade and ferried them across the river who climbed into the crumbling remains of Fort Hindman. [...] General Steele entered the rifle-pits under a flag of truce to discuss surrender with Colonel Deshler. [...] As the two conferred, Deshler noticed Steele's men continually moving closer and demanded they be ordered to stop or he'd open fire again. [...] General Sherman arrived on the scene to personally seek out Churchill. [...] However, Sherman stood by as Churchill and Colonel Garland became involved in an argument over surrendering. [...] Garland claimed he had been ordered to surrender while Churchill denied giving such an order. [...] Colonel Deshler rode up from his front and declared to the group he had not surrendered at all and insisted on renewing the fight. Sherman ended the argument by pointing out the Union forces had all but occupied the Confederate's works. [...] Some Union soldiers had even began disarming the Confederates. From all accounts, Hartâ€™s Battery served their guns professionally and courageously during the siege. Col. Robert R. Garland's report stated: ...|$|E
