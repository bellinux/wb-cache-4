In February 1995 a $15 million agreement was reached to reimburse workers and businesses affected by the fire. While not admitting any liability, the $15 million minus legal fees was paid by E/R Partners and <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> uninsured losses for businesses and workers in One Meridian and the surrounding damaged buildings.|$|E
5|$|However, the Rashtrakuta kings also patronized Hinduism's {{followers}} of the Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta faiths. Almost all of their inscriptions begin with an invocation to god Vishnu or god Shiva. The Sanjan inscriptions tell of King Amoghavarsha I sacrificing a finger from his left hand at the Lakshmi temple at Kolhapur to avert a calamity in his kingdom. King Dantidurga performed the Hiranyagarbha (horse sacrifice) and the Sanjan and Cambay plates of King Govinda IV mention Brahmins performing such rituals as Rajasuya, Vajapeya and Agnishtoma. An early copper plate grant of King Dantidurga (753) shows an image of god Shiva and the coins of his successor, King Krishna I (768), bear the legend Parama Maheshwara (another name for Shiva). The kings' titles such as Veeranarayana showed their Vaishnava leanings. Their flag had {{the sign of the}} Ganges and Yamuna rivers, perhaps copied from the Badami Chalukyas. The famous Kailasnatha temple at Ellora and other rock-cut caves attributed to them show that the Hinduism was flourishing. Their family deity was a goddess by name Latana (also known as Rashtrashyena, Manasa Vindyavasini) who took the form of a falcon to save the kingdom. They built temples with icons and ornamentation that satisfied the needs of different faiths. The temple at Salotgi <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> {{followers of}} Shiva and Vishnu and the temple at Kargudri <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> worshipers of Shiva, Vishnu and Bhaskara (Surya, the sun god).|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 TGS event, it was {{revealed}} that Hope's silver hair <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> Lightning, but when her hair color was decided as pink, Hope received the silver hair coloring instead. Hope's Academy uniform for XIII-2 was designed by Hideo Minaba. While he was portrayed as sensitive and vulnerable in XIII, for XIII-2, the game's director wished to portray Hope as a more mature, authoritative person. According to Toriyama, how Hope matured, as seen through Lightning's eyes, formed one of the main story themes for Lightning Returns. He was originally going to have a third unique design for the game, but the team eventually decided to settle on his original teenage appearance. In a later interview, he said that while the character was much liked by the team, he felt that Hope lacked the heroic image that could make him a leading character. Watanabe later said that he felt Hope helped complete Lightning's character and enable her to grow as a person. Hope is voiced by Vincent Martella in English and Yūki Kaji in Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Funding {{problems}} delayed construction even further. In February 1982, President Ronald Reagan proposed cutting Metro construction funds by 21.4 {{percent to}} just $295 million a year. Planned Green Line construction constituted 40.5 percent of Metro's construction budget, and the cuts threatened {{to cancel the}} entire Green Line. To African American community leaders, the cuts were evidence that Metrorail <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> suburban white commuters while inner city African Americans were relegated to taking Metrobus. Despite the funding troubles, Metro planned to seek contractors in March 1982 for a $60 million contract to tunnel under the Anacostia River, a $60 million contract to build the Anacostia Station, and a $100 million contract to build the Navy Yard Station. But on March 16, 1982, Judge Ramsey barred Metro from spending any money {{on the construction of}} the Rosecroft Raceway route for the southern half of the Green Line. Judge Ramsey held that Metro had decided to shift the Green Line route without properly advertising the public hearings, which the transit system would now be required to hold (delaying construction of the Green Line and Anacostia Station by at least a year). Although Metro had advertised the hearings, Judge Ramsey said, the advertisements contained the same wording flaws that had precipitated the Maryland lawsuit. Metro subsequently scheduled new hearings for June 1982.|$|E

25|$|The secular {{history of}} Canada depicts Bishop Strachan {{as an ally}} of the landed gentry of the {{so-called}} Family Compact of Upper Canada, opposed to the political aspirations of farmers and bourgeoisie for responsible government. Nonetheless, Strachan played considerable part in promoting education, as founder of Kings College (now the University of Toronto) and Trinity College. The Clergy reserves, land which had been reserved {{for use by the}} non-Roman Catholic clergy, became a major issue in the mid-19th century. Anglicans argued that the land <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> their exclusive use, while other denominations demanded that it be divided among them.|$|E

At a nearby synagogue, they reveal their intentions: they believe the 216-digit number <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> them to bring about the messianic age, as the number represents the unspeakable name of God. Max refuses, insisting that whatever the source of the number is, it has been revealed to him alone.|$|E
25|$|Casual {{matchmaking}} allows players, alone, or in a {{party with}} invited friends, to be randomly matched against others. The game servers will attempt to match the gathered players in party via a dynamic queue with others based on general skill level, only broadening outside this search range if {{it takes a long}} time to find matching players. Blizzard works to adjust this matchmaking approach to making sure players will find matches of people with roughly equivalent skill level. For example, in June 2016, Blizzard removed the option for players to avoid specific opponents; the option <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> players to be able ignore trolls, but instead found that highly skilled players were being put on these avoidance lists and were having difficulty finding games or would be matched with new and less-skilled players.|$|E
25|$|Failure {{to resolve}} the issues before the Long Parliament led to armed {{conflict}} between Parliament and Charles I in late 1642, {{the beginning of the}} English Civil War. Before joining Parliament's forces Cromwell's only military experience was in the trained bands, the local county militia. He recruited a cavalry troop in Cambridgeshire after blocking a valuable shipment of silver plate from Cambridge colleges that <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> the king. Cromwell and his troop then rode to, but arrived too late to take part in, the indecisive Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. The troop was recruited to be a full regiment in the winter of 1642 and 1643, making up part of the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester. Cromwell gained experience in a number of successful actions in East Anglia in 1643, notably at the Battle of Gainsborough on 28 July. He was subsequently appointed governor of Ely and a colonel in the Eastern Association.|$|E

25|$|By {{design the}} trireme <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> day-long journeys, with no {{capacity}} {{to stay at}} sea overnight or carry the necessary provisions to sustain the men it carried. There were, however, storage facilities on board large enough to provide each crewman with the 2 gallons (7.6 L) of fresh drinking water {{he would need to}} stay hydrated each day. This meant that all those aboard were dependent upon the land and peoples of where they landed each night for supplies. Sometimes this would entail traveling up to eighty kilometres in order to procure the necessary provisions. In the Peloponnesian War, the beached Athenian fleet was caught unawares on more than one occasion, while out looking for food (Battle of Syracuse and Battle of Aegospotami). The cities, which suddenly found themselves needing to provide for all these sailors were usually agreeable and did not mind the extra business, but those in charge of the fleet and/or mission had {{to be careful not to}} completely deplete the 'host' city of resources.|$|E

She is thwarted by the kings' page ("Thief! Thief!"). When Amahl wakes to find the page grabbing his mother, he attacks him ("Don't You Dare!"). Seeing Amahl's defense {{of his mother and}} understanding the motives for the attempted theft, King Melchior says she may keep the gold as the Holy Child will not need earthly power or wealth to build his kingdom ("Oh, Woman, You Can Keep That Gold"). The mother says she has waited all her life for such a king and asks the kings to take back the gold. She wishes to send a gift but has nothing to send. Amahl, too, has nothing to give the Child except his crutch ("Oh, No, Wait"). When he offers it to the kings, his leg is miraculously healed ("I Walk, Mother"). With permission from his mother, he leaves with the kings to see the Child and give his crutch in thanks for being healed.|$|E

Triple H was originally scheduled to win his first championship at the event, but Austin refused to drop it to him, believing Triple H was not over enough with the crowd yet, so Mankind would be used as a transitional champion, dropping the title to Triple H the next night on Raw Is War. Austin would get his rematch at No Mercy against Triple H, but he lost after The Rock accidentally struck him with a sledgehammer that <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> Triple H. When Survivor Series rolled around, Triple H was still champion. Austin was booked into a Triple Threat match for the WWF Championship against Triple H and The Rock. However, Austin was run down by a car in the parking lot. Big Show would replace Austin in the match and would win the WWF Championship. Austin then underwent neck surgery by Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, due to Austin's injury from the piledriver at SummerSlam two years prior. He was away for a nine-month rehabilitation, with the car angle as his reason for leaving.|$|E

Blaming himself for what has transpired, Max swears off alcohol, shaves his head, and informs Victor and Marcelo that he is going undercover into Nova Esperança to save Fabiana. He gets lost in the sprawling favela, but is assisted by Detective Wilson Da Silva (Stephen Girasuolo), who reveals that the Crachá Preto have engaged in illicit deals with the Brancos, and suspects that Victor and UFE might also be involved. Max eventually finds Fabiana, only for her to be executed by Serrano. Marcelo and Fabiana's sister Giovanna (Shirley Rumierk) are kidnapped, as the UFE raid the favela. Max follows the raid and witnesses UFE collaborate with the Crachá Preto, selling them the people they arrested during the assault. Max then witnesses the Crachá Preto necklace Marcelo, and escapes with Giovanna. Fleeing from the militia, Giovanna is rescued by Passos, but Max is abandoned, later saved by Da Silva.|$|E
25|$|On the Tour's return, {{the format}} of the race settled on between 20-25 stages. Most stages would last one day but the {{scheduling}} of 'split' stages continued well in to the 1980s. 1953 saw the introduction of the Green Jersey 'Points' competition. National teams contested the Tour until 1961. The teams were of different sizes. Some nations had more than one team and some were mixed in with others to make up the number. National teams caught the public imagination but had a snag: that riders might normally have been in rival trade teams the rest of the season. The loyalty of riders was sometimes questionable, within and between teams. Sponsors were always unhappy about releasing their riders into anonymity for the biggest race of the year, as riders in national teams wore the colours of their country and a small cloth panel on their chest that named the team for which they normally rode. The situation became critical {{at the start of the}} 1960s. Sales of bicycles had fallen and bicycle factories were closing. There was a risk, the trade said, that the industry would die if factories were not allowed the publicity of the Tour de France. The Tour returned to trade teams in 1962. In the same year, Émilion Amaury, owner of le Parisien Libéré, became financially involved in the Tour. He made Félix Lévitan co-organizer of the Tour, and it was decided that Levitan would focus on the financial issues, and Jacques Goddet on the sporting issues. The Tour de France <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>for</b> professional cyclists, but in 1961 the organisation started the Tour de l'Avenir the amateur version.|$|E
