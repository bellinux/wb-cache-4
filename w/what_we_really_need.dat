Form a computational viewpoint, {{it is important to know}} what part of mathematics can be done by mechanical algorithms, and, even for the part that can’t be done mechanically, we want to know how constructive are the objects we deal with. Furthermore, it is sometimes the case that this computational analysis allows us to find connections between constructions in different areas of mathematics, and in many cases to obtain a deeper understanding of mathematical objects being analyzed. My work is quite diverse in terms of the techniques I have used, the approaches I have taken, and the areas of mathematics that I have analyzed. However, my background area is Computability Theory, and most of my work can be considered as part of this branch of Mathematical Logic...|$|R
5000|$|The Governor {{signed the}} budget bill on January 14, 1966. The bill {{contained}} an annual allocation of $359,000 for the Kentucky Authority for Educational Television. That meant that construction would occupy {{the next two}} years, assuming Blazer's offer were accepted.So the network's earliest possible on-air starting date was now fixed: {{it could be the}} fall of 1968. Until the station sites belonged to the state, FCC applications would not be acted on and federal matching funds would go to other states that were ready to use them. I wrote to Joe Bell in the Governor's office on January 14, 1966, urging that he request the Governor to answer Blazer's letter of November 29, 1965. I pointed out again that we could not get any action on our applications to United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) for what was now potentially two million dollars in matching funds (one million from HEW and a matching one million from Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC)) until we had ownership of the transmitter sites.A not inconsiderable element of that urgency was that Blazer was seriously ill and he was planning to leave for Arizona any day now {{to get out of the}} cold.Lucile called on February 24, 1966. She told me that the Governor had called Paul. I repeated that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> was for the sites to be secured by a private party so that they could then be transferred to the state with a minimum of paper work and in the least possible time. Paul, she said, was seriously ill and might be unable to act. She said if this situation continues - and she appreciates our urgency - she'd get together with friends and raise the money to buy the sites. Hating to look this gift horse in the mouth, I still had to apprise her of our need for an expert to actually buy the land, since the money alone, if it had to be spent by and through the state, would put us back in the same old pickle. Oil and refining Company's Fred Nall went to work acquiring the land.the end I got a call from Paul Blazer. He wondered how much we had committed of the money he had made available to us. I told him about $15,000, which surprised him greatly. Nall had done a good job, I told him, and had managed to get a number of the thirteen statewide sites donated.We exchanged compliments on Nall and then Blazer, President and godfather of Ashland Oil, said with simple sincerity, [...] "It was good of Ashland Oil to lend Nall to us."The short answer is that Paul's intercession enabled the network plans to proceed even though, for Paul, the entire purpose was to find a way to bring the benefits of educational television to the schools in Ashland.|$|R

40|$|At last {{there are}} some signs that Victoria has a Labor {{government}} that deserves the name, writes David Hayward THE best Labor governments charge into office raring to go. They’ve got lots to do and too little time to do it. They enjoy the big following that accompanies governments of passion. The Bracks government has so far not played it this way, and has veered {{too far to the}} right to be feted as a Labor champion. But as it approaches the midway point of its second term, things are starting to look much better. The Bracks government’s most recent budget was undoubtedly its best, and it deserved the warm accolades it received. After a cautious first term, spending is now on its way up in real terms, and the state’s public service is, thankfully, being rebuilt. Under Steve Bracks, public service employment is up by 38, 000, or 18 per cent, which is more {{than the rest of the}} states and territories combined. By the end of this financial year, government expenses will have risen by 40 per cent, a significant rise on any criteria. Capital works will be a record $ 2. 3 billion, or more than double the level when Labor came to power. All this spending has not sent the Treasury broke, for it has been made possible by rapid economic growth. Government spending will account for only a slightly larger share of the state’s economy this year than it did in Jeff Kennett’s last. Nor have taxes skyrocketed as some would have us believe, for they have simply maintained their share of a booming economy. Yes, stamp duties have provided more than their share, but let’s not forget that they follow the housing market, rising when it goes up and shrinking when it falls. They are a consequence, not a cause of more expensive housing. And throughout it all Labor has delivered a succession of large budget surpluses that have earned it the title of the nation’s most frugal administration. Where has the money gone? Most of the cash has poured into health, which has enjoyed a 50 per cent spending boost over the past five years. The latest figures suggest that per capita spending on hospitals is now almost 30 per cent more than the all-state average. And while there’s still so much more to be done, this is because we are getting older and with old age comes ill health and a rising medical bill. Bracks has also put 2800 teachers back into the schools where they belong, but it will take another term and another 1500 jobs before we employ the same number of state teachers that we did when Joan Kirner crept out of office more than a dozen years ago. Nevertheless, falling student numbers have enabled Labor to cut class sizes to levels we haven’t seen before, and this is a major achievement. The number of school support staff has also risen to record levels, and the government has gradually broadened its focus away from primary schools to the middle years of secondary schooling as well. Education Minister Lynne Kosky has recently pledged a new school funding formula that is based on need, as well as a performance regime that tries to improve schools in stress, and a school management framework that is devolved, yet inclusive, and premised on the idea of collective improvement rather than self interest. The harsh language of competition and a rugged individualism has, thankfully, given way to a policy framework designed to lift all children in state schools to new highs, rather than just the few in the wealthiest suburbs. Labor is also turning heads with its new approach to water management. Its recently released white paper has won glowing approval for its market-based pricing designed to conserve our water in combination with a substantial increase in the concessions to low-income households and especially those with large families. It is a clever mix of efficiency and equity to the benefit of the environment, of which Labor can be justly proud. And then, of course, there is the democratisation of the upper house, which Bracks quite rightly points to as his government’s greatest achievement. All this is not to say that Steve Bracks has become a Gough Whitlam, or that Labor has suddenly turned red. It continues to be heavily constrained by a budget framework that was first constructed by Alan Stockdale. Its community building initiatives are more rhetoric than reality, and public-private partnerships are still in favour, when everyone who looks closely at them sees a neat way for private financiers to fleece us all. And this government has been strangely reluctant to renationalise public transport, when that was the obvious thing to do. It has decided to privatise the Mitcham to Scoresby freeway, even though it could easily have debt-funded the road itself at a substantial saving. It is in the process of squandering a cool $ 125 million on a badly designed first home owners’ subsidy, which will give a lucky few new home buyers $ 6000 to spend on whatever they wish, when the money should have been used on public housing and the homeless. It has decided to set up another Competition Commission, when <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>needed</b> was a Commission for Effectiveness and Equity to give Labor’s priorities a better balance. These are all disappointments, and they show that there is considerable room for improvement. But remember, Labor is still only halfway through its second term and it’s got a lot of untapped talent. Labor governments typically begin with a cracking first generation of ministers full of ideas, who eventually retire to leave holes that are increasingly hard to fill. This will not be a problem for the Bracks government, for there is an untapped, swollen back bench waiting for something to do, as well as junior ministers now ready for a bigger challenge. Some ministerial retirements perhaps induced by a mid-term shuffle could indeed be beneficial, so that the likes of John Lenders, Jacinta Allan, Gavin Jennings, Tim Holding and Rob Hudson can leave their mark in the way that Labor ministers ought to. The best Labor governments know that time is their enemy, for their better days are always behind them. The Bracks government has charted a different course, and there is good reason for believing that it’s precisely because of this that its best days lie ahead.
