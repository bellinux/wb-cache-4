He coined the term [...] "guild socialism," [...] and in 1914, his writing for the publication was compiled as National Guilds: an Inquiry into the Wage System and a Way Out. He helped found the National Guilds League, but following disagreements with G. D. H. Cole over strategy, and The New Ages move to supporting social credit, he ceased theoretical work.|$|E
5000|$|Under the {{influence}} of reformers such as Boris Kidrič and Milovan Đilas, Yugoslavia experimented with ideas of <b>workers</b> <b>self-management</b> where workers influenced {{the policies of the}} factories in which they worked and shared a portion of any surplus revenue.

Likewise, the names of the regional branches were changed accordingly. LCY consisted of the following regional bodies: ...|$|E
5000|$|Socialist critics often criticize social {{democracy}} on {{the grounds}} that it fails to address the systemic issues inherent to capitalism, arguing that ameliorative social programs and interventionism generate issues and contradictions of their own, thus limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system. The American democratic socialist philosopher David Schweickart contrasts social democracy with democratic socialism by defining the former as an attempt to strengthen the welfare state and the latter as an alternative economic system to capitalism. According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently [...] "humanized", and that any attempt to suppress its economic contradictions will only cause them to emerge elsewhere. For example, attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation, and too much job security would erode labour discipline. In contrast to social democracy, democratic socialists advocate a post-capitalist economic system based on either market socialism combined with <b>workers</b> <b>self-management,</b> or on some form of participatory-economic planning.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that Serbia - along with the other Southeast European {{successor}} states of former Yugoslavia - emerged from a country recognized for its specific labour-managed institutional arrangement. The paper recalls the main premises of the literature on the labour-managed firm and the theoretical contributions on participatory forms of management that seem most relevant to a transition economy like Serbia’s. It proceeds to analyze the main changes that occurred in Serbia during transition to a market economy, illustrating some of its specific features and how privatization led to the conversion of <b>workers</b> <b>self-management</b> into property rights. In order to analyze the role of employees in decisionmaking, and more generally their current position in privatized and newly established private firms, a survey was undertaken in 2013 based on a questionnaire for managers in 69 Serbian firms. The survey suggests that internal relations in enterprises are relatively undeveloped, particularly regarding the distribution of responsibilities in decision making at various organisational levels, hampering the efficient fulfilment of firms’ objectives. It appears that decision-making processes are usually designed {{in such a way as}} to give an excessive role to the owner as the exclusive decision-maker. The position of workers seems to be particularly poor regarding their rights to be informed, to make proposals, and/or to participate in decision-making in general. Moreover, even traditional workers’ rights are neglected (unionization, collective bargaining etc.). The survey also suggests that in those firms with a more active role of workers, there is a higher degree of workers’ satisfaction and loyalty to the firm...|$|E
50|$|While {{professional}} {{special interest}} groups were on the rise, so too were worker organizations, especially in the cities. Beyond the formation of trade unions, factory committees of workers rapidly developed on the plant level of industrial centers. The factory committees represented the most radical viewpoints of the time period. The Bolsheviks gained their popularity within these institutions. Nonetheless, these committees represented the most democratic element of 1917 Russia. However, this form of democracy differed from and went beyond the political democracy advocated by the liberal intellectual elites and moderate socialists of the Provisional Government. Workers established economic democracy, as employees gained managerial power and direct control over their workplace. <b>Worker</b> <b>self-management</b> became a common practice throughout industrial enterprises. As workers became more militant and gained more economic power, they supported the radical Bolshevik party and lifted the Bolsheviks into power in October, 1917. However, the Bolsheviks envisioned party-led control of the economy. Therefore, <b>worker</b> <b>self-management,</b> the ultimate form of economic democracy, disappeared when the Bolsheviks gained control of Russia.|$|R

50|$|Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels held a broad {{characterization}} of socialism, characterized by {{some form of}} public or common ownership {{of the means of}} production and <b>worker</b> <b>self-management</b> within economic enterprises, and where production of economic value for profit would be replaced by an ex ante production directly for use, which implied some form of economic planning and planned growth in place of the dynamic of capital accumulation, and therefore the substitution of commodity-based production and market-based allocation of the factors of production with conscious planning.|$|R

Management is chosen by the worker, not appointed by the State, not elected by the community at large and not selected by a board of directors elected by stockholders. Ultimate authority rests with the enterprise's workers, following the one-person, one-vote principle.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, {{there are}} two major forms of {{management}} or [...] "social control" [...] for socially owned organizations, both of which can exist alongside the two major modes of social ownership. The first variant of control is public management, where enterprises are run by management held accountable to an agency representing the public either at the level of national, regional or local government. The second form of social control is <b>worker</b> <b>self-management,</b> where managers are elected by the member-workers of each individual enterprise or enterprises are run according to self-directed work processes.|$|R
50|$|Early {{arguments}} against {{the utilization of}} central economic planning for a socialist economy were brought up by proponents of decentralized economic planning or market socialism, including Leon Trotsky, Peter Kropotkin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. In general, it was argued that centralized forms of economic planning that excluded participation by the workers involved in the industries would not be sufficient at capturing adequate amounts of information to coordinate an economy effectively, while also undermining socialism {{and the concept of}} <b>worker's</b> <b>self-management</b> and democratic decision-making central to socialism. However, no detailed outlines for decentralized economic planning were proposed by these thinkers at this time.|$|R

5000|$|A strike may {{consist of}} workers refusing to attend work or {{picketing}} outside the workplace {{to prevent or}} dissuade people from working in their place or conducting business with their employer. Less frequently workers may occupy the workplace, but refuse either {{to do their jobs}} or to leave. This is known as a sit-down strike. A similar tactic is the work-in, where employees occupy the workplace but still continue work, often without pay, which attempts to show they are still useful, or that <b>worker</b> <b>self-management</b> can be successful.

50|$|Oskar Lange {{responded to}} Mises' {{assertion}} that socialism and social {{ownership of the}} means of production implied that rational calculation was impossible by outlining a model of socialism based on neoclassical economics.

In Lange's view, this model qualified as socialist because the means of production would be publicly owned with returns to the public enterprises accruing to society as a whole in a social dividend, while <b>worker's</b> <b>self-management</b> could be introduced in the public enterprises.|$|R

Autonomism originated in Europe in the seventies and eighties, specifically around the Autonomia and Autonomen radical social movements in Italy and Germany.
