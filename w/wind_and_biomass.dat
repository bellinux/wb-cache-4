5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet. The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, <b>wind,</b> <b>and</b> <b>biomass</b> energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the plan called for an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E
25|$|Brazil {{needs to}} add 6000 MW of {{capacity}} {{every year in}} order to satisfy growing demand from an increasing and more prosperous population. The Brazilian Ministry of Energy has decided to generate 50% of new supplies from hydropower, 30% from <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>biomass</b> such as bagasse, and 20% from gas and other sources. Wind in the North-East is strongest during the dry season when hydropower plants produce less, so the two energy sources are seasonally complementary.|$|E
25|$|Renewable {{energy use}} has grown {{much faster than}} even advocates had anticipated. Wind {{turbines}} generate 39 percent of Danish electricity, and Denmark has many biogas digesters and waste-to-energy plants as well. Together, <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>biomass</b> provide 44% of the electricity consumed by the country's six million inhabitants. In 2010, Portugal’s 10 million people produced more than half their electricity from indigenous renewable energy resources. Spain’s 40 million inhabitants meet one-third of their electrical needs from renewables.|$|E

Three months later, in November 2006, Romney cut $7million from the maintenance budget for the state's parklands (the sixth largest state park system in the country). He also cut {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} from the budget for environmental law enforcement, efforts to promote cleaner water in communities, and hazardous waste cleanup.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the {{electricity}} {{generated by the}} nuclear power plants of Angra 1 and Angra 2 represented 2.7% of the national energy output, approximately 14 tWh. While Angra 3 remains under construction {{and is expected to}} become operational in 2018, there have been no moves to build the four new nuclear plants as outlined by PNE 2030. In 2012, a review of the PNE 2030 was commissioned, so as {{to take into account the}} increasing share of renewable sources like <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>biomass</b> in the Brazilian energy matrix and the consequences of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan. This updated study was expected to come out in 2013, as a PNE2035. However, that did not happen. Presently, the website of EPE states that a PNE 2050 is currently in development.|$|E

2500|$|The {{proposed}} EEG (2016) is {{a continuation}} of the EEG (2014). [...] It replaces prescribed feed-in tariffs with an auction system for the majority of renewable technologies. [...] It repeats the deployment corridors specified in the EEG (2014) to control the uptake of renewable electricity over the next decade and to ensure that future renewable energy targets are honored. [...] This corridor will be maintained by auctioning only a defined capacity each year. [...] Only those renewables projects that bid successfully will receive EEG support for the electricity they supply over the following 20years. [...] Each technology – photovoltaics, onshore wind, offshore <b>wind,</b> <b>and</b> <b>biomass</b> – will get an auction design tailored to its needs. [...] Small renewables installations of under 750kW capacity or under 150kW for biomass will not be required to tender and will continue to receive conventional feed-in tariffs. [...] Bidders from other European countries will be able to compete in the auctions for up to 5% of the annual capacity, under certain conditions. [...] The new auction system should cover more than 80% of the new renewable electricity capacity.|$|E
