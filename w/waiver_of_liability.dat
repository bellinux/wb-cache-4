40|$|Launch {{activities}} are increasingly performed by private entities and launch participants {{deal with a}} complex legal environment. The Space Treaties provide a framework placing liability for non-governmental activities on the launching State and the duty to authorize and supervise them on the appropriate State. Launch participants are subject to specific regulation in certain States or are under institutional State control in others. They also have to comply with general domestic law <b>of</b> <b>liability.</b> Limited insurance availability {{led to the development}} of contractual risk allocation techniques, the inter-participants <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> and claims, inspired by NASA practice. This thesis offers a contribution with the synthesis of information, so far scattered, on today's legal environment, providing an overview of the norms at play in this field to allow the grasp of their relative weight and interactions in the assessment <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> risk attached to launch activities. This synthesis reveals a legal framework presently lacking the predictability necessary for an efficient liability risk management: (1) inter-participants <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> suffer the weaknesses of all limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses; they also lack uniformity and implementation rigor; (2) the Space Treaties contain ambiguous terms preventing predictable determination of the State liable for damage and the State obliged to authorize and supervise launch activities, and do not reflect the de facto primary <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> launch operators. This thesis offers a contribution to the advancement of legal work on these problems by suggesting new approaches emphasizing the need for: (1) harmonization <b>of</b> inter-participants <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> to improve their consistency and validity and ensure identical flow-down by all participants; (2) improvements of the Outer Space Treaty, Liability Convention and Registration Convention for their implementation to non-governmental launch activities. Although the launch community is small and the need for lawmaking is not as compelling as in fields such as aviation. Nevertheless, tailored adjustments to the present legal framework are required and proposed in this thesis through model clauses and an international instrument, both of which are submitted for further thinking and contribution by those sharing the opinion that creative lawmaking is now necessary to prepare for tomorrow's endeavors...|$|R

50|$|The {{legality}} of big boy letters {{themselves in the}} United States Securities markets {{is a matter of}} dispute. This is because the primary lawsuit parties seek to avoid with such letters is one under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which contains a provision, Section 29(a), that <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> for securities fraud are void. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which includes the financial District of New York, has enforced agreements similar to big boy letters strictly against the buyer. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which includes Delaware, which is the state of incorporation for many publicly held companies, has given greater weight to the anti-waiver provisions of the Securities Exchange Act, although it has not completely ignored these agreements in considering all facts and circumstances of a transaction. As of 2008, Commissioners and staff from the Securities and Exchange Commission have expressed concern about the legal enforceability of Big Boy Letters. Two commissioners have stated that even if the letters provide a defense in private securities litigation, that they are not a defense in an SEC enforcement action.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} test the core claim of {{scholars}} in the nexus of contracts tradition—that private ordering {{as a process of}} bargaining creates optimal rules. We do this by analyzing empirical evidence in the context of <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> provisions. These provisions allow companies to eliminate monetary damages for breach of the duty of care through amendments to the articles of incorporation. With all states allowing some form of these provisions, they represent a good laboratory to examine the bargaining process between management and shareholders. The contractarian approach would suggest that shareholders negotiate with management to obtain agreements that are in their best interests. If a process of bargaining is at work as they claim, the opt-in process for <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> provisions ought to generate a variety of approaches. Shareholders wanting a high degree of accountability would presumably not support a <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability.</b> In other instances, shareholders might favor them in order to attract or retain qualified managers. Still others would presumably want a mix, allowing waiver but only in specified circumstances. Our analysis reveals that the diversity predicted by a private ordering model is not borne out by the evidence with <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> provisions for Fortune 100 companies. All states permit such provisions and in the Fortune 100, all but one company has them. Moreover, they are remarkably similar in effect, waiving liability to the fullest extent permitted by law. In other words, one categorical rule was merely replaced by another, dealing a significant blow to the contractarian thesis...|$|E

40|$|The 2004 Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act {{provided}} {{the first national}} statute dedicated to private commercial spaceflight, further elaborated by a Chapter in the Code of Federal Regulations. A major element of that regulation concerns the “informed consent” requirement, which constitutes the main condition upon which a private commercial spaceflight operator is allowed to fly paying passengers into the edge of outer space and back. The requirement as such does not automatically equate with a statutory <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> passenger <b>liability,</b> which was {{a major reason for}} a handful of individual US states to add by way of statutes such immunity from liability in order to attract private commercial spaceflight operators. Notably, this concerns so far Virginia, Florida, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, and California.

40|$|Assisted living {{facilities}} {{claim that}} negotiated risk agreements give residents {{the freedom to}} act against facility advice. On the contrary, negotiated risk was proposed originally to waive a facility’s liability for inadequate care, and liability waiver remains a significant component of negotiated risk. This Article offers the first detailed legal analysis of state negotiated risk laws. Due to negotiated risk’s dueling definitions – based either on the against-facility-advice scenario or the inadequate care scenario – state law is marked by ambiguity and inconsistency. Currently, fifteen states address negotiated risk in law, and an additional state has developed a standardized negotiated risk form. This Article places each of these states into one of eight categories, depending generally {{on the extent to}} which negotiated risk is used purportedly to resolve disputes, plan care, consent to inadequate care, or waive liability. This Article recommends that negotiated risk be abandoned, and that all references to negotiated risk be eliminated from state law. Negotiated risk is in fact not necessary for a resident to act against facility advice. In nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, a resident undisputedly has the right to act against facility advice, with no need to negotiate an agreement with the facility. Also, any <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> facility <b>liability</b> is unenforceable as a violation of public policy. In health care settings, courts uniformly refuse to enforce a consumers’ <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> a provider’s <b>liability.</b> Finally, the term “negotiated risk” is too compromised to be of any further use. Negotiated risk has no settled definition, and state law definitions are generally vague enough to accommodate both the against-facility-advice scenario and the inadequate care scenario...|$|R

40|$|LLM (Import and Export Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The law of {{contract}} in South African affords parties the freedom {{to enter into a}} contract and who they wish to enter with. The general requirements for a legally enforceable contract are consent, good faith, and the sanctity {{of contract}}. The contractual freedom of parties also offers them freedom to choose the terms of their contract. Part of these terms is the freedom to incorporate exemption clauses in contracts. An exemption clause is a <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> or the apportionment of risk {{in the event of an}} occurrence materialising as defined in the contract. Exemption clauses have become the norm rather than the exception and parties must therefore expect a contract to contain an exemption clause, albeit unfair. Until recently, there was no legislation that declared exemption clauses as unfair. The Consumer Protection Act is South Africa's first legislative regulation on unfair contract terms and the <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability.</b> The Act does not address the contractual freedom of parties to incorporate exemption clauses and whether they will be unenforceable in the light of section 48. The Act cannot be implemented without considering the freedom of contract to rely on exemption clauses.

40|$|Corporate law {{scholarship}} {{is replete with}} those who favor an enabling approach to regulation, with companies having the right to opt in to particular requirements or regimes. Opting in (or out) permits private ordering and allows for efficient relationships that are a product of bargaining between owners and managers. This paper tests the core claim of scholars in the nexus of contracts tradition - that private ordering {{as a process of}} bargaining creates optimal rules. We do this by analyzing empirical evidence in the context of <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> provisions. The article examines the history of these provisions, emphasizing that they arose in Delaware not from an effort to overturn Van Gorkom but from a decision to intervene in the market for D&O insurance. In other words, their genesis was owed to a desire to interfere with market forces with respect to insurance. The Delaware model allowed companies to opt in to a regime that eliminated monetary damages for breach of the duty of care through amendments to the articles of incorporation. The contractarian approach would suggest that shareholders and management would use this authority to negotiate agreements that are in their mutual best interests. If a process of bargaining is at work as they claim, the opt-in process ought to result in a variety of practices, with some companies adopting <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> provisions, others not, while still others modify the provisions to only waive liability in particular circumstances. These provisions, therefore, represent a laboratory for determining whether, and the degree to which, bargaining to achieve more efficient private arrangements actually occurs. Our analysis reveals that the diversity predicted by a private ordering model is not borne out by the evidence. Instead, the evidence shows that one categorical rule (liability for breach of the duty of care) was merely replaced by another (no liability for a breach of the duty of care), with no evidence that the change increased efficiency. The article demonstrates that bargaining does not take place as the contractarian thesis would predict and that the so called private ordering does not necessarily result in greater efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Banks are optimally opaque institutions. They produce {{debt for}} use as a trans-action medium (bank money), which {{requires}} that information about the backing assets not be revealed, so that bank money does not fluctuate in value, reduc-ing its efficiency in trade. This need for opacity conflicts with the production of information about investment projects, necessary for allocative efficiency. How can information be produced and not revealed? Financial intermediaries exist to hide such information; they are created and structured to keep secrets. For the economy as a whole, this can be accomplished by a separation in how firms finance themselves; they divide into bank finance and capital market/stock mar-ket finance based on how well they can be used to maintain information away from liquidity markets. Firms with large projects, risky projects or projects easy to evaluate {{are less likely to be}} financed by banks. ∗We thank Michael Woodford and seminar participants at Columbia, MIT, Rutgers, Universite de Montreal, Wharton and the SED Meetings at Cyprus for useful comments.
