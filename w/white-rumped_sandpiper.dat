The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared and stock doves, whitethroat, linnet, stonechat, dunnock and rock pipit. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|E

25|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper</b> is a nearctic migrant. After {{breeding}} {{in northern}} Canada and Alaska, it flies over the Atlantic Ocean {{to spend the}} majority of its non-breeding period in South America, particularly along the Patagonian coast in both Chile and Argentina. It also frequently visits Fracasso Beach, Argentina. Many shorebirds concentrate in this area due to the abundance of intertidal invertebrates, especially clams. The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper</b> has also been spotted in Venezuela, Suriname, Brazil and Paraguay during its migration. They are rare but regular vagrants to western Europe and a rare vagrant to Australia.|$|E
30|$|Observations at East Bay 1999 – 2007 {{suggest that}} ruddy turnstones nest early {{relative}} to the other three species, and <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpipers</b> nest late and {{over a longer period}} (Smith et al. 2010). The elevated (albeit, non-significant) levels of mercury in the eggs of <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpipers</b> relative to ruddy turnstones, and the great variability in concentrations for <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpipers</b> are consistent with an effect of amount time spent foraging on the breeding grounds. In the future, testing for an effect of nest initiation date on egg mercury concentration (with a larger sample size) could provide some insight into how pre-breeding activities (e.g., foraging) affect mercury dynamics.|$|R
50|$|The Central Coast section {{offers many}} bird species of its own. The Matagorda Bay area {{contains}} American oystercatchers, Hudsonian godwits, and <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpipers.</b> The Corpus Christi area features groove-billed anis, olive sparrows, long-billed thrashers, Couch's kingbird, black skimmers, and black-crowned night herons.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{for which}} the site is of {{conservation}} significance include breeding Falkland steamer ducks, ruddy-headed geese, gentoo penguins (500 pairs), Magellanic penguins and white-bridled finches, as well as migratory <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (15,000 individuals). The ponds behind the beach and dunes support many waterbirds including black-necked swans, Chiloe wigeons, Patagonian crested ducks, flying steamer ducks, yellow-billed pintails, silver and yellow-billed teals, and silvery and white-tufted grebes.|$|R
25|$|While on mudflats, the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper</b> forages by probing {{in shallow}} waters and in mud {{but can also}} pick up some items from the surface. When {{they are in the}} tundra, they must probe deeply in the moss and other vegetation.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper</b> vocalizations {{consists}} of a repeating “pip, pip, pip …” Their call has a distinctive metallic “tzeep” note which makes them easily identifiable among a flock of shorebirds. It resembles the sound of two pebbles scraping against one another.|$|E
25|$|Weather {{patterns}} play {{a crucial}} role in determining the migration route. Birds like to travel so that the temperature, pressure and humidity work with the tailwinds. Strong winds can blow birds off of their regular migration route. For example, the effects of a large storm lead to a higher presence of the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper</b> on the King George Islands.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{studies have}} {{surveyed}} bird populations at this site. The International Shorebird Survey in 1988 counted 155,000 shorebirds at Big Quill Lake. Surveys between 1989 and 1992 at Middle and Little Quill Lakes found one-day peaks of 101,900 birds. The most comprehensive study conducted, involving all three lakes, {{resulted in a}} count of 197,155 birds. The site is an important staging and breeding area for the endangered piping plover. Other species identified throughout the complex include [...] "85,000 geese, 100,000 ducks, and 12,000 cranes", as well as black-bellied plover, sanderlings, Hudsonian godwits, red knots, stilt <b>sandpipers,</b> <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> semipalmated sandpipers, long-billed dowitchers, red-necked phalaropes, and lesser yellowlegs. Additionally, in the mid-1990s several whooping cranes were observed using the area for staging during fall migration.|$|R
25|$|The warming of {{the climate}} has led {{to changes in the}} number of {{individuals}} and the length of their stay in the South Shetland Islands. <b>White-rumped</b> <b>sandpipers</b> are now observed more frequently in this area as a result of both long and short term climate variations. The higher air temperatures, which occur {{as a result of the}} northern winds, bring warm, moist air which creates more open habitats and better food resources that allow these birds to persist and survive. Migration routes, as well as both winter and summer foraging grounds, may also be altered.|$|R
50|$|Buff-breasted {{sandpipers}} {{are suspected}} to have hybridized with the <b>white-rumped</b> or Baird's <b>sandpiper.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper</b> {{is placed}} in class Aves, which is {{contains}} all birds. As a shorebird, it {{is placed in}} the order Charadriiformes along with gulls, alcids, plovers and oystercatchers. Its family, Scolopacidae, encompasses all sandpipers, and as a stint it is classified in the genus Calidris. It is classified as monotypic species, meaning that no population differentiation or subspecies have been described.|$|E
25|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper</b> inhabits {{relatively}} vegetated {{patches of}} the tundra. More specifically, {{they live in}} the marshy, heavily vegetated, hummocky arctic tundra of Alaska and Canada during the breeding season. They can be found in various types of wetlands while migrating. During the winter months they inhabit a variety of freshwater and saltwater habitats such as lagoons, estuaries and marshes. In general, they tend to avoid sandy beaches and fast moving water.|$|E
25|$|Their diet {{consists}} {{primarily of}} small invertebrates including: molluscs, crustaceans, annelids and both adult and larval insects. They are mainly reported to eat aquatic invertebrates. Although it was previously thought they only consumed invertebrates, {{it has been}} shown that seeds also make up a portion of the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper</b> diet. This discovery lead to the idea that they might be opportunistic feeders depending on time, season and habitat. Stones and algae have also been found in their stomachs but these are most likely ingested by accident. The stones are of the same general shape and size as the seeds so it could be a case of mistaken identity. Algae could also be accidentally ingested through aquatic feeding.|$|E
30|$|The four shorebird {{species in}} this study appear to have {{elevated}} egg mercury levels when compared to an earlier study (i.e., Hargreaves et al. 2010, 2011). The eggs used by Hargreaves et al. (2010, 2011) were collected in 2008 from the same four species at the same study site (East Bay). Mean total egg mercury concentrations for each species {{in this study}} were at least three times greater than the results from Hargreaves et al. (2011), and the ranges of egg mercury levels found in each study did not overlap. A similar pattern of contamination was observed in Hargreaves et al. (2011) where black-bellied plovers and ruddy turnstones had the lowest egg mercury concentrations. However, in contrast to our study, they observed the highest egg mercury concentrations among the semipalmated plovers, rather than the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (Hargreaves et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|We {{found no}} {{differences}} in egg mercury concentrations between the species with declining numbers (black-bellied plovers, ruddy turnstones) and the species with stable or increasing numbers (<b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> semipalmated plovers). These results do not support mercury contamination as a primary contributor to shorebird declines in North America, but ours is not a definitive test. Our sample is small and drawn from a single site, and studies of contaminants in the wild are extremely complex undertakings, with many variables to consider. It is possible that detrimental population-level effects of mercury are not showing up in the shorebird embryonic stage; mercury contamination may be affecting shorebirds at some other stage in their life history, such as at overwintering sites or feeding during migration stopovers. In nature, organisms can be exposed to a toxic “cocktail” consisting of multiple contaminants, possibly acting antagonistically or synergistically with one another depending on life history stage, as mercury and selenium sometimes do (as in mallard ducks; Heinz and Hoffman 1998).|$|R
40|$|To {{examine how}} habitat use by {{sandpipers}} (Calidris spp.; Baird’s sandpipers, dunlin, least sandpipers, pectoral sandpipers, semipalmated sandpipers, stilt <b>sandpipers,</b> and <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpipers)</b> varies {{across a broad}} suite of environmental conditions, we conducted surveys at wetlands throughout the spring migratory period in 2013 and 2014 in 2 important stopover regions: the Rainwater Basin (RWB) in Nebraska, USA, and the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) in South Dakota, USA. Because providing adequate energetic resources for migratory birds is {{a high priority for}} wetland management, we also measured invertebrate abundance at managed wetlands in the RWB to determine how food abundance influences the occupancy and abundance of sandpipers on wetlands throughout the migratory period. To quantify habitat use, we surveyed wetlands every 7 – 10 days in both regions and visually estimated wetland attributes. Our results indicate that invertebrate abundance predicted occupancy, but not abundance, of sandpipers at wetlands in the RWB. The wetland vegetation characteristics that predict sandpiper occupancy are similar in both regions, but wetlands in the PPR support a higher abundance of sandpipers than wetlands in the RWB. Our results suggest that sandpipers make stopover decisions that balance local and regional wetland conditions. Managers should maintain the cues (i. e., mudflat) and ecological conditions beyond invertebrate abundance that predict sandpiper habitat use to successfully provide resources for sandpipers during migratory stopover if that is a goal of wetland management...|$|R
25|$|Only {{the females}} {{incubate}} the eggs. Once the female has laid the eggs, the male stops displaying {{and leaves the}} breeding grounds. This is unlike {{other members of the}} calidris genus where incubation is shared between males and females; therefore, the trait of male incubation has been independently lost in this species. There are only three documented species who have been known to share this behaviour. This development seems bizarre since experiments have shown that a decrease in the amount of male care is linked to a decrease in male fitness by lowering the number of male descendants that survive. One explanation for this evolution is that a decrease in male care allows the males to explore other breeding options. This hypothesis ties in {{with the fact that the}} <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper</b> is polygynous; males will mate with several females but females will only mate with one male.|$|E
500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Calidris fuscicollis) {{is a small}} shorebird that breeds in the {{northern}} tundra of Canada and Alaska.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Landsat- 5 Thematic Mapper imagery {{was used}} to produce a 17 -habitat {{classification}} of Prince Charles Island, Foxe Basin, Northwest Territories, {{through a combination of}} supervised and unsupervised approaches. Breeding shorebirds and habitats were surveyed at 35 study plots in July 1989. Habitat-specific breeding densities calculated from these observations were used to estimate total populations of breeding shorebirds on the island based on areas of habitat derived from the classified image. Breeding densities were further modelled in two ways: first, to adjust for distance from the coast, where regression analyses found a significant relationship between distance and density, and second, to include only those pixels of areas considered suitable for breeding, using results of a proximity analysis to determine habitat associations between known breeding locations (pixels) and other habitats. Six species of shorebirds were found breeding on Prince Charles Island, with a combined population (after modelling) estimated at 294000 pairs. Comparison of breeding densities and estimated populations of shorebirds with those recorded at other arctic locations indicated that Prince Charles Island supports highly significant numbers of shorebirds, especially <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpipers</b> and red phalaropes. Comparison of reference areas of known habitat with those on the classified image indicated classification accuracy averaged over 90 %. Remote sensing appears to offer a reliable method for assessing habitats and regional breeding populations of birds in at least some areas, providing that classification methods are carried out in a carefully controlled manner. Use of the method over broad areas of the Arctic would require considerable work to recalibrate imagery for different geographic regions...|$|R
40|$|This was an {{interesting}} summer, with range expansions of multiple species continuing in all directions, but predominantly northward. Exceptions to the northward trend were Trumpeter Swan, which bred south of its usual western Sandhills range, and Sedge Wren, which may be occurring in June in northeast Nebraska in greater numbers. Moving eastward are Western Wood-Pewee, which now overlaps with westward-moving Eastern Wood-Pewee in Lincoln Co, Cordilleran Flycatcher in the Pine Ridge, and Lesser Goldfinch in the west. Song Sparrow is also expanding south and west. No fewer than 16 species are moving north and/or northwestward. Several species were seen more westerly including Broad-winged Hawk, nesting again in North Platte, Yellow-throated Vireo in the Niobrara River Valley, and Carolina Wren across a broad front. Species expanding in a northward direction include Acadian and Scissor-tailed Flycatchers, Summer Tanager in the east, Ash-throated Flycatcher in the west, and Blue-gray Gnatcatcher and Northern Mockingbird statewide. Species moving north primarily in the Missouri River Valley include Fish Crow, Prothonotary Warbler, and Louisiana Waterthrush. Red-shouldered Hawk bred at its new location in Lancaster Co. Black-billed Cuckoos were found in greater numbers than in recent years. Puzzling is the increase in fall records of <b>White-rumped</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> in recent years; have they started to migrate inland in fall? For rarity buffs, White-tailed Kite, Inca Dove, and Fish Crow provided some hot weather excitement.

40|$|Only {{once before}} has a nesting record of Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor) been {{reported}} in Lancaster County. This report is in The Nebraska Bird Review, December 1985. Employees of the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission discovered two fledglings at a site in the northeast {{part of the county}} at 98 th and Ashland Road. The two fledglings were found in a wet meadow. They were accompanied by two male and one female phalaropes. The sighting was made on 13 June 1985. On 7 June 1991 I visited Arbor Lake, a recently purchased salt marsh about one mile north of Interstate 80 along North 27 th Street. This site is currently being managed by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission for the city of Lincoln. My reason for visiting the site was {{to see what kind of}} birds utilized the area. In the area that day I saw a female Orchard Oriole building a nest in an American elm tree along the west bank of Little Salt Creek as it parallels North 27 th Street for part of the creek 2 ̆ 7 s reach to the north. In the same area I found a male and female Blue Grosbeak. Not too far to the north, Arbor Lake spread itself over the landscape attracting the following birds: 4 Killdeer, 1 Spotted Sandpiper, 3 male Blue-winged Teals, 2 female and 1 male Mallards, 3 Semipalmated <b>Sandpipers,</b> 4 <b>White-rumped</b> <b>Sandpipers,</b> about 40 Red-winged Blackbirds, 1 male WIlson 2 ̆ 7 s Phalarope, and a number of Bank Swallows flying low over the marsh. The male phalarope came flying toward me from afar as I advanced eastward through the transition zone of the marsh. The lone male tries to lead me from the area with an aerial distraction display. I made no attempt to find the nesting site, but worked my way into the marsh to see the shorebirds farther to the east using a tripod-held spotting scope...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper</b> is a {{relatively}} small bird measuring only [...] The top of its body is a dull grey-brown color {{and it has a}} white eye stripe.

2500|$|As {{with most}} shorebirds, the {{courtship}} {{behavior of the}} <b>white-rumped</b> <b>sandpiper</b> involves an aerial component. During courtship the male and the female fly upward side by side at an angle. At about [...] above the ground they stop about [...] apart and hover with shallow, rapidly vibrating wingbeats. The male remains above the female and repeatedly releases a series of “poing-zee” notes. They hover between 5 and 10 seconds before descending to the ground slowly and silently and land about [...] apart. During their downward glide their wings are held together in a “V” position above their backs. A few minutes later they initiate a second paired flight identical to the first one. However, once they have landed on the ground the male begins to chase the female. The chase ends when the male does a wing raising display, which is common in many sandpiper species.|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of BiologyBrett K. SandercockMonitoring {{programs}} {{indicate that}} numerous shorebird populations {{are subject to}} on-going declines. The U. S. Shorebird Conservation Plan lists twenty-seven shorebird species as species of high concern and seven as highly imperiled, including the Buff-breasted Sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis). One hypothesis for ongoing population declines is exposure to toxic chemicals and pollutants. The purpose of this project was to characterize plasma cholinesterases (ChEs) of migratory shorebirds and address potential exposure to organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate (CB) pesticides. Consumption or contact with these pesticides can cause mortality {{and a variety of}} sub-lethal effects. Buff-breasted Sandpipers and other upland shorebirds are particularly likely to encounter agrochemicals due to their habitat use at the non-breeding grounds. I sampled migratory shorebirds over three seasons, during north- and southbound migration in 2006 and 2007 in Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska and during the non-breeding season in 2007 in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. I collected blood samples and footwashings from reference sites, where OP and CB pesticides were not used, and agricultural sites, where these two insecticides were recommended for control of crop pests. I assessed several variables known to affect plasma ChE activity including body size, date of capture, time of capture, condition, sex, and region. Small-bodied species had higher levels of ChE activity in plasma than large-bodied species. Plasma ChE activities varied with date of capture in 3 of 5 species sampled in North America. Sex differences were significant in 1 of 4 species tested. Plasma acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was higher among <b>White-rumped</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> sampled in North America but {{there was no difference between}} regions among Buff-breasted Sandpipers. Time of capture and individual condition did not affect plasma ChE activity. Estimates of exposure to ChE inhibitors were addressed in five species. Plasma AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities of Buff-breasted Sandpipers were lower at agricultural sites in South America but BChE activity was higher at agricultural sites in North America. There were no differences between sites in four other species tested. A meta-analysis across all species indicated that in 4 of 6 comparisons habitat type had a negative effect on AChE activity consistent with exposure to ChE inhibitors but there was a regional positive effect of agricultural habitat on BChE activity in North America. Comparison of body mass between sites suggested that use of habitats with potential pesticide application did not affect mass gain. Project results suggest that 1 of 5 shorebird species tested was exposed to ChE-inhibiting pesticides at the non-breeding grounds and future monitoring is necessary to assess potential effects at the population level. This study highlights the importance of complete sampling and addressing variability in plasma ChEs before making estimates of exposure to OP and CB pesticides. It provides the first estimates of migratory shorebird exposure to OP and CB pesticides, a potential conservation issue. Future research should include continued monitoring of Buff-breasted Sandpiper ChE levels and habitat use. Other sources of anthropogenic declines such as habitat loss and illegal hunting should be investigated for species that did not show evidence of exposure...|$|R
