25|$|Ireland, angered {{that he had}} {{received}} no publicity even after three murders, killed again within three days. He met and courted 33-year-old Andrew Collier, a housing warden, and the pair went to Collier's home in Dalston. After entering the flat there was a disturbance outside and both men <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> to investigate. Ireland gripped a horizontal metal bar that ran across the window. He later forgot to wipe the bar for fingerprints during his usual cleanup phase. The police found these prints.|$|E
2500|$|... "As soon as I {{touched upon}} the {{question}} of Jews and Judaism, the serenity of the meeting ended at once. Hitler turned his back to me, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and started drumming {{his fingers on the}} pane [...] Still, I went on, voicing our complaints. Hitler suddenly turned around, went to a small table from which he took a water glass and furiously smashed it on the floor. In the face of such diplomatic behavior, I had to consider my mission terminated".|$|E
2500|$|Aziz Salha {{was arrested}} in 2001. He {{admitted}} to being {{one of those who}} broke into the police station and [...] to choking one of the soldiers while others beat him bloody.

In 2004, an Israeli court convicted him for the murder of Nurzhitz and sentenced him to life imprisonment. In October 2011 he was controversially released as part of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange.|$|E

6000|$|... "Out at the back," [...] replied Mr. Travers. [...] "If you <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{you can see}} him. Now, do put {{something}} round your shoulders, there’s a good girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [FERRAND goes {{behind the}} screen. WELLWYN {{closes the door}} into [...] <b>the</b> house, then <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> draw <b>the</b> curtains. He [...] {{suddenly}} recoils and stands petrified with doubt.] ...|$|R
60|$|The count <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> opened it, {{and called}} his friends below to come up.|$|E
60|$|And then Leicester {{got up and}} whistled and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{and stood}} {{with his back to}} Dorinda.|$|E
60|$|Guy now <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Maître Leroux {{had been}} {{directing}} his servants {{in the formation}} of the barricades.|$|E

60|$|It was, however, {{too late}} to get away by the passage. A rugged {{knocking}} had begun upon {{the door of the}} front room. Wildeve, who had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> came back.|$|R
6000|$|... [He goes out. DICK {{continues}} <b>to</b> arrange <b>the</b> [...] flowers, than <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{and looks}} [...] out. He comes back. The door is opened by [...] CHARLES, who announces MRS. CROWLEY.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{sat down}} and rested her chin on her hand, staring at nothing. Kirk <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and looked out.|$|E
60|$|When {{the door}} had closed behind her he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and flung it wide, {{although}} the night was foul.|$|E
60|$|After tea, as it {{drew near}} to six o'clock, he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> All was dark outside. The sea was roaring.|$|E

60|$|Pierre laughed, {{and ran out}} of the room, for old Christopher {{was getting}} impatient. His mother <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and stood there.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had had you for {{a little}} longer, Mary," [...] he said, [...] "perhaps I {{should have been a}} better man. <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> please, and tell me if that man is still there." ...|$|R
