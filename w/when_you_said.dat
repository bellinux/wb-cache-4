500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Paul van der Grijp believes Oviri {{was intended}} [...] as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin's persona as a [...] "civilised savage". [...] The artist {{wrote in his}} final letter to Morice that [...] "You were wrong that day <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> I was wrong to say I was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work {{there is nothing that}} can surprise or disconcert, except the fact that I am a savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Never Gonna Dance Again" [...] {{is about}} the {{break-up}} of a relationship which is set on a dancefloor. During the chorus, Sugababes sing the lines [...] "I lost the rhythm <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> it's over / As the final record starts to fade, I feel the dancefloor turning colder". The Guardians Alexis Petridis and Schultz have both noted that the song's lyrical content is reminiscent to that of George Michael's song, [...] "Careless Whisper".|$|E
2500|$|And [...] when Moses {{said to his}} people, [...] "O my people, indeed {{you have}} wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [...] So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves. That is best for [...] you {{in the sight of}} your Creator." [...] Then He {{accepted}} your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful. And [...] <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "O Moses, we will never believe you until we see Allah outright"; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thought no evil of you, George,--except {{that you}} were changed to me. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> came, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> nothing to me. Do you not remember?' ...|$|R
60|$|Oddly enough, I {{encountered}} neither. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> everything, for {{in every}} other way the conditions could scarcely have been fouler.|$|R
6000|$|The old man glanced {{about him}} like one who seeks {{a way of}} escape. At last--"If say it you must," [...] he growled, [...] "say it here and now. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> it, go." ...|$|R
2500|$|Afterward, Jack {{returns to}} the Rabinowitz home. He kneels at his father's bedside and the two {{converse}} fondly: [...] "My son—I love you." [...] Sara suggests that it may help heal his father if Jack takes his place at the Yom Kippur service. Mary arrives with the producer, who warns Jack that he'll never work on Broadway again if he fails to appear on opening night. Jack can't decide. Mary challenges him: [...] "Were you lying <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> your career came before everything?" [...] Jack is unsure if he even can replace his father: [...] "I haven't sung Kol Nidre since I was a little boy." [...] His mother tells him, [...] "Do what is in your heart, Jakie—if you sing and God is not in your voice— your father will know." [...] The producer cajoles Jack: [...] "You're a jazz singer at heart!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{just now}} that you would do {{anything}} for father, you didn’t mean it, then?" [...] said Joan. [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you’d die for me, you—" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, CONTRADICTED me: that's what I mean,--once <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> those rocks were volcanic, once <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{the flower}} you picked was a poppy. I didn't let {{on at the}} time, for it wasn't my say; but all the while you were talking I might have laid for you--" ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> all this, ladies, and more,--for {{more will}} suggest itself to your woman's wit,--say {{to them with}} St Paul--"And yet show we unto you a more {{excellent}} way,"--a nobler argument--and that is Charity.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sedan-chair! Put your 'ead in a bag. That was a palanquin. Don't yer know a palanquin <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see it?' <b>said</b> Ortheris {{with great}} scorn.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{look pretty}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> smile," [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. Oakley thoughtfully. She {{continued}} to look closely at her. [...] "You are in trouble," [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|MARGARET. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'snap' I {{caught the}} biscuit in my mouth.|$|E
60|$|HARRY. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{you could}} come round I asked {{somebody}} I want you very much to meet.|$|E
60|$|BLUNTSCHLI. If {{you were}} twenty-three <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> those {{things to me}} this afternoon, I shall take them seriously.|$|E
6000|$|... "My brother {{asked if}} young Sydney {{was at home}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> left," [...] <b>said</b> Edward, for Gerald would not take the trouble to repeat the question.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lucky <b>you</b> stopped <b>when</b> <b>you</b> did," [...] <b>said</b> Tom as {{he walked}} around the machine. [...] "If you hadn't we might have had all four tires busted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{you did not}} {{hesitate}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were asked!' <b>said</b> Annette, sighing; and Violet at once blushed, smiled, and sighed, as she spoke her quick conscious 'No, no!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess you}} noticed that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> one wouldn't have {{expected}} to find those Chinamen here Barclay didn't answer it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I say,'--Una {{lowered her}} voice--'you know that funny feeling of things having {{happened}} before. I felt it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Mus' Reynolds."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean to {{tell the}} jury then that you don't know what you meant <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> the thing had been talked over; do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was {{so sorry}} that I {{was not at}} home <b>when</b> <b>you</b> called, Glastonbury,' <b>said</b> his Grace; 'but I thought I should soon hear of you at grandmamma's.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think I {{mentioned}} to <b>you,</b> Richards, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came here,' <b>said</b> Mr Dombey, with a frown, 'that I wished {{you to see}} as little of your family as possible.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was looking}} at this stone <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came,' he <b>said.</b> 'Bonifazio has brought it me from Milan, but I am afraid I cannot afford it. It is very tempting.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What did {{you mean}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> I could have given you no worse news than that of his coming alone?" [...] she {{questioned}} suddenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Did Mr. Armadale seem surprised,' I asked, 'when {{you told}} him of our engagement, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{it was to be}} kept a secret from everybody?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even so, I heard you," [...] said Joseph, {{with some}} acerbity; [...] "and I {{would wish to}} know {{precisely}} what you meant <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'Hem! hem!' like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it wants}} resolution, Terence, and I {{am afraid that}} you are {{deficient}} in that. It must not be half-and-half. You have got to say to yourself, 'This is glorious; I never enjoyed myself so well in my life,' and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> that and {{feel that it is}} quite true, the whole thing will be over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{come back}} some time, Tessa," [...] said Tito, taking her under the cloisters {{to the door}} of the church. [...] "You must not cry--you must go to sleep, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> your beads. And here is money to buy your breakfast. Now kiss me, and look happy, else I shall not come again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the good?" [...] {{he broke}} in, gloomily. [...] "You don't know what I {{wanted you to}} know. I come down here for {{to find out the}} man as once owned this,"--he pulled the lock of hair out of his pocket again--"and you can't help me. I didn't believe it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first <b>said</b> so, but I do now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A very humble one. But I hope {{to rise in}} the world. Were {{you really}} in earnest <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that you could love a man of lowly position?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Was--was {{that what}} you meant, that day we thought you dying, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> to me--for it was to me you spoke, to me alone--that it was better so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am dying, Polly; I know that, or I wouldn't {{have sent}} for ye. It {{was a good}} day for you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> no to what I asked you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Can you ruffle your fur <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are angry, or purr <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are pleased?' <b>said</b> she. And {{again the}} {{duckling}} {{had to admit}} that he could do nothing but swim, which did not seem of much use to anybody.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{evidence}} to show that this John Stumpy was the man who robbed me of my money. Of course I knew it was so <b>when</b> Kate and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> so, but outsiders now know it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She never {{telegraphs}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{would expect}} it--only <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't," [...] <b>said</b> the old man. [...] "She likes to drop on me suddenly; she thinks she'll find me doing something wrong. She {{has never done}} so yet, but she's not discouraged." ...|$|R
