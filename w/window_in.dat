50|$|Built at {{the point}} when late Romanesque style was fading and Gothic rising, the {{rectangular}} prayer hall features a pair of Romanesque columns supporting groin vaults. The <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the thick stone walls are simple gothic arches. The <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the adjoining study hall, the so-called Rashi Shul, have rounded Romanesque arches. The women’s section of the prayer hall has Romanesque <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the eastern wall, and gothic <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the western wall.|$|R

50|$|The side <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the driver's cab in {{the class}} 101 {{featured}} swiveled <b>windows,</b> <b>in</b> order to avoid a window well, which often proved to be susceptible to corrosion (the <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> class 145 and 152 were continued to be counter-sunk). All windows and doors are completely pressurized {{by means of a}} special sealant section.|$|R
5|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry, dressed with freestone. It {{measures}} 45 feet by 14 feet 6inches (14 by 4.4metres). The building is largely 12th-century in construction, with {{the walls and}} a narrow lancet <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the south wall dating from that time; another window at {{the east end of}} the south wall is rectangular and dates from the late 14th or early 15th centuries, with a more modern <b>window</b> <b>in</b> between. The east wall and window, with stone tracery and an ogee-topped light in a pointed arch, are from the 14th century. Some of the windows use atypical green glass, and some have frames made out of wood.|$|E
5|$|The college's graphic {{identity}} {{represents the}} shape of a <b>window</b> <b>in</b> Harkins Hall with a flame inside, representing Veritas, or Truth, the official college motto. The college motto was borrowed from the Dominican Order, and has been used since the college's inception.|$|E
5|$|A {{friend of}} Huseby helped {{the police in}} the negotiations. At 18:30, the {{aircraft}} was out of beer, so Huseby made an agreement that he would throw the gun out of the <b>window</b> <b>in</b> exchange for more beer. This was delivered by a civilian police officer. The aircraft was then immediately stormed by special forces and Huseby arrested. No-one was injured in the hijacking.|$|E

5000|$|Starting in the Middle Ages, glass {{became more}} widely produced, {{and used for}} <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> buildings. Stained glass became common for <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> cathedrals and grand civic buildings.|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} tall pointed arched <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the side walls. Stained glass hopper windows {{replaced}} the original casement <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> 1972. The end {{walls and the}} attached vestibules have small pointed arched windows.|$|R
5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, which turned up at 5am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all {{the doors and windows}} to the house were shut, except for the <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1208 and 1520, Southwell Minster has its Norman façade intact, {{except for}} the {{insertion}} of a large <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the Perpendicular Style to give light to the Norman nave. The particular fame of Southwell is its late-13th-century chapter house, which contains the most famous medieval floral carvings in England, described by Nikolaus Pevsner as “throbbing with life”.|$|E
5|$|Dating from 1098 to 1493, Gloucester Cathedral has a Norman nave {{with massive}} masonry piers, {{and a fine}} 15th-century Perpendicular tower, but its main feature is the eastern end, reconstructed in the 14th century as an early example of Perpendicular Gothic and with the largest medieval <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the world, the area of a tennis court. The cloisters have the {{earliest}} example of fan-vaulting.|$|E
50|$|Theodore Roosevelt Memorial <b>Window</b> - {{installed}} <b>in</b> the Matinecock Masonic Lodge building <b>in</b> 1926. The <b>window</b> {{was designed}} and crafted by local artisan Oliver Smith, who had studied <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> cathedrals in England and France. Smith was also responsible for design of new stained glass <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> Christ Church.|$|R
50|$|Dynasty Warriors 5 Special (Shin Sangoku Musou 4 Special) {{is another}} {{expansion}} to the game. This game {{was released on}} December 22, 2006 on the Xbox 360 and Microsoft <b>Windows</b> <b>in</b> Japan and shortly thereafter for <b>Windows</b> <b>in</b> Taiwan.|$|R
5000|$|The tower {{dates from}} 1715. The {{rest of the}} church was timber framed, then rebuilt in stone in 1870 by R. C. Hussey. [...] The {{original}} <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the tower were replaced by <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> Gothic style in 1899.|$|R
5|$|Jesé {{struggled}} {{to settle in}} Paris, however, {{and by the end}} of the year he had only started in one of his nine league appearances for the club. His lack of form and infrequent game time, which totaled 358 minutes, prompted manager Unai Emery to suggest that he would be leaving the club during the January transfer <b>window</b> <b>in</b> order to rediscover his form.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{structures}} {{within an}} 800-metre (half-mile) radius, including {{the entire community}} of Richmond, were obliterated. A pressure wave snapped trees, bent iron rails, demolished buildings, grounded vessels, and scattered fragments of Mont-Blanc for kilometres. Hardly a <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the city proper survived the blast. Across the harbour, in Dartmouth, there was also widespread damage. A tsunami created by the blast wiped out the community of Mi'kmaq First Nations people {{who had lived in}} the Tufts Cove area for generations.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June, United hosted {{its annual}} celebrity tournament. That same day, the club made more {{headlines}} when they announced that Fred {{would be allowed}} to join Australian A-League side, Melbourne Heart on a summer transfer in July. The exact date was not disclosed, although mid-season transfer <b>window</b> <b>in</b> MLS opens on 15 July and closes 31 August.|$|E
50|$|Mount St. Joseph {{contains}} several {{stained glass}} windows created by Harry Clarke or his studios. Three <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the infirmary, three later <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the chapel of the college and a 1960s window dedicated to St. Patrick for the abbey church.|$|R

5|$|On 21 September 2017, Chelsea {{announced}} that Costa {{would return to}} Atlético {{at the start of}} the next transfer <b>window</b> <b>in</b> January 2018. On 26 September 2017, it was {{announced that}} after passing medical tests Costa signed a contract with Atlético. He would be registered and able to play after 1 January 2018, due to a transfer ban imposed on Atlético.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash {{wondered}} if the cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens from elsewhere in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow <b>window</b> <b>in</b> which sabre swings register as enemy hits. CVG recommended drawing {{a map of the}} maze, without which it was easy to get lost. While Sabre Wulf had some flicker issues, said Sinclair User, the game altogether met Ultimate's high quality benchmarks.|$|E
5|$|Several suicides also darkened the {{reputation}} of the Ritz in the postwar years, including that of horse trainer Peter Beatty from the sixth floor <b>window</b> <b>in</b> October 1949, and that of French gangster Baron Pierre de Laitre, who strangled love interest Eileen Hill to death in his second floor room in March 1953 when she refused to marry him, before killing himself by stuffing a silk sock down his throat.|$|E

5|$|The east <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the Lady Chapel {{was largely}} {{replaced}} and restored {{in the mid}} 19th century. However, it does contain some 14th-century stained glass pieces, including male heads and heraldic symbols. Some of the early glass is also incorporated into the Tree of Jesse which goes across nine lights.|$|E
5|$|The last {{stage of}} Curvilinear or Flowing Decorated Gothic, is {{expressed}} in tracery of very varied and highly complex forms. Many {{of the largest and}} most famous windows of England date from 1320–30 and are in this style. They include the south transept rose window known as the “Bishop’s Eye” at Lincoln, the “Heart of Yorkshire” <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the west end of York and the famous nine-light east window of Carlisle.|$|E
5|$|The {{stained glass}} in the east window, dated 1856, was made by William Wailes. The glass in a south <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the chancel of 1909 was made by Morris & Co. The east <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the north aisle, dated 1920 is by Irene Dunlop. The stained glass window {{to the left of}} the pulpit was donated by the Greg family of Styal Mill. The stained {{glass in the}} window at the west end of the north aisle is to the memory of the wife of Edward John Bell, rector from 1870 to 1907, and was made by Clayton and Bell in 1877. The tower holds a ring of six bells, hung for change ringing, five of which were cast in 1787 by Rudhall of Gloucester, and the sixth by Charles and George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1847. A seventh, unused, bell dates from 1686 and has been noted as being of {{historical}} importance by the Church Buildings Council of the Church of England. The parish registers begin in 1629, and the churchwardens' accounts in 1612.|$|E
