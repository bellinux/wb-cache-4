500|$|Viggo Johansen (1851–1935), who {{had studied}} at the Royal Academy with Michael Ancher (also without graduating), first went to Skagen in 1875. An {{active member of the}} group, he married Anna Ancher's cousin Martha Møller in 1880. From 1885, he {{exhibited}} in Paris where he was inspired by Claude Monet. His paintings took on lighter tones as he had noted the absence of black in the works of the French artists and considered his own earlier works too dark by comparison. Monet's use of colour is reflected in his painting [...] (1890). The work displays stronger contrasts than his earlier paintings, depicting the red-bearded Christian looking out towards the light at the foot of his bed where the flaming gold and white sunlight streams down onto the little blue cupboard on the wall. Among the works he painted in Skagen are [...] (1884) which depicts his wife Martha arranging flowers, and the much brighter [...] (1885) showing four fishermen who have pulled their boat up onto the beach while one of their wives hopes there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> for the evening meal. After falling out with P.S. Krøyer in 1891, Johansen's relationship with the Anchers was strained and he and his family did not visit Skagen for several years but finally returned in 1903.
