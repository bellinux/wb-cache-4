40|$|Three {{different}} lizard {{species can}} be found at the great pasture of Hajúbagos. These are the balkan or crimean <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis taurica), the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) and the green lizard (Lacerta viridis). All of them are protected by law in Hungary but while sand lizard and green lizard is common all over the country, the amount of the balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> is decreasing. The main cause of this regrettable possession is the habitat degradation and thus habitat loss. Namely balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> not only prefers but suffers open sand grasslands and these kinds of habitats are disappearing in Hungary. Due to the fact that the extensive animal grazing lost its importance, open sand pastures started to change, succession can be realized. Thus grass closing constantly what is favourable for sand lizard and green lizard. Furthermore sand <b>lizard</b> and balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> share roughly the same food source and moreover green lizard could possibly pass into a predator of balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> juveniles also. Therefore sand lizard and green lizard became competitors (or predators) of balkan <b>wall</b> <b>lizard</b> and the proportion of the three species compared to each other is changing. My aim is to examine the vegetation change and simultaneously monitor the amount of the mentioned three lizard species. After all I would like to make a well established proposal on the management of protected grasslands...|$|R
