2500|$|Food {{security}} is a condition related to the supply of food, and individuals' access to it. Concerns over food security have existed throughout history. There is evidence of Granaries being in use over 10,000 years ago, with central authorities in civilizations including ancient China and ancient Egypt being known to release food from storage in times of famine. At the 1974 <b>World</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Conference</b> the term [...] "food security" [...] was defined {{with an emphasis on}} supply. Food security, they said, is the [...] "availability at all times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices". Later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition. The final report of the 1996 World Food Summit states that food security [...] "exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life".|$|E
