The present study examined {{the relative importance of}} SNS in maintaining LDRR compared to GCRR, particularly with regard to the use of SNS to express involvement (via relational maintenance behaviors) and to gauge a partner's involvement (via partner surveillance and jealousy) in the relationship. An online survey was conducted among predominantly young adult Facebook users <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a romantic relationship (N= 272). Results showed that participants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a LDRR reported higher levels of relational maintenance behaviors through SNS than participants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a GCRR. Also, as compared to participants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a GCRR, participants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a LDRR used SNS more for partner surveillance and experienced higher levels of SNS jealousy...|$|R
