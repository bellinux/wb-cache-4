Colbert has never met Rowling and the book has not been approved by her or Warner Brothers (the owner of the film rights to the Harry Potter novels). He was given permission to publish it as long as he noted on the cover that it had not been approved by Rowling.|$|E
5|$|In 1925–26, <b>while</b> <b>teaching</b> at the Dalhousie Law School, Macdonald took {{additional}} {{courses in}} law at Columbia University in New York, mainly by correspondence. He used these courses {{as the basis}} for full-time graduate work at the Harvard Law School in Boston, Massachusetts in 1928. Harvard's faculty members saw the law as an instrument for social improvement. That view was reflected in Macdonald's 1929 doctoral thesis on the responsibility of property holders under civil law.|$|E

In 1966 he was sent as one of Indonesia's representatives at the UN, and in 1968 he became Indonesia's ambassador to the US; during this time he received several honorary doctoral degrees. He also advised foreign minister Adam Malik. After returning to Indonesia in 1971, Soedjatmoko held a position in several think tanks. After the Malari incident in January 1974, Soedjatmoko was held for interrogation {{for two and a}} half weeks and accused of masterminding the event. Although eventually released, he could not leave Indonesia {{for two and a half}} years. In 1978 Soedjatmoko received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding, and in 1980 he was chosen as rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo. Two years after returning from Japan, Soedjatmoko died of cardiac arrest <b>while</b> <b>teaching</b> in Yogyakarta.|$|E
5|$|Arrington {{grew up in}} a {{large family}} in Idaho, where he and his family were members of the LDS Church.

5|$|The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter: A Treasury of Myths, Legends, and Fascinating Facts is a {{guide to}} the fictional Harry Potter universe, written by David Colbert. It explores the {{references}} to history, legends, and literature in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels. Colbert conceived the idea for The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter while quizzing his nephew and nieces about the mythological references in the novels. He later wrote the book <b>while</b> <b>teaching</b> a seminar on self-publishing to graduate students at the University of North Carolina. The book was published in March 2001, without approval from Rowling, and has since received positive reviews from critics. An updated version of The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter was published in 2004 by Berkley Books.|$|E
5|$|<b>While</b> <b>teaching</b> at Holmewood {{he set up}} a 12½ inch {{reflector}} {{telescope at}} his home, which he kept into his old age. He developed a particular interest in {{the far side of the}} Moon, a small part of which is visible from Earth as a result of the Moon's libration; the Moon was his specialist subject throughout his life. He claimed to have discovered and named the Mare Orientale (Eastern Sea) in 1946, along with Hugh Percy Wilkins, though he later conceded that German astronomer Julius Heinrich Franz should be credited with the discovery. The feature had been observed several times since telescopic observations began. Moore described the short-lived glowing areas on the lunar surface, and gave them the name transient lunar phenomena in 1968.|$|E

5|$|<b>While</b> <b>teaching</b> at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Saëns put less of {{his energy}} into {{composing}} and performing, {{but after he}} left in 1865 he pursued both aspects of his career with vigour. In 1867 his cantata Les noces de Prométhée beat {{more than a hundred}} other entries to win the composition prize of the Grande Fête Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi. In 1868 he premiered the first of his orchestral works to gain a permanent place in the repertoire, his Second Piano Concerto. Playing this and other works he became a noted figure in the musical life of Paris and other cities in France and abroad during the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|<b>While</b> <b>teaching</b> he was {{consulted}} by {{the county}} commissioner and helped {{to set up the}} courts and laws in Yamhill County. In March 1850, he began practicing law in Oregon, appearing for three cases before judge Orville C. Pratt held at a local tavern. After receiving payment for his services, he sent $100 back to Ohio to Henry Kennon to pay off some debt. That summer he worked for Peter H. Burnett’s brother, Elder Glen Burnett, running his store while Burnett was in California acquiring supplies. While working at the store he sold many supplies to the local Native Americans and learned some Chinook jargon from them.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, Fillmore turned 21 and {{was thus}} legally {{independent}} of his father. He taught school in East Aurora, and accepted {{a few cases}} in {{justice of the peace}} courts, which did not require the practitioner to be a licensed attorney. He moved to Buffalo the following year, continued his study of law, first <b>while</b> <b>teaching</b> school, and then in the law office of Asa Rice and Joseph Clary; he also became engaged to Abigail Powers. In 1823, he was admitted to the New York bar, and declined offers from Buffalo law firms to return to East Aurora and establish a practice as the town's only lawyer. Later in life, Fillmore stated that he initially lacked the self-confidence to practice in the larger city of Buffalo; his biographer, Paul Finkelman, suggested that after being under others' thumbs all his life, Fillmore enjoyed the independence of his East Aurora practice. On February 5, 1826, Millard and Abigail wed. They had two children, Millard Powers Fillmore (1828–1889) and Mary Abigail Fillmore (1832–1854).|$|E

5|$|Johnson wrote a {{considerable}} part of Irene in 1737 <b>while</b> <b>teaching</b> at Edial Hall School, the academy he had founded in 1735. Johnson spent his evenings {{working on his}} play while ignoring his wife Elizabeth (known as Tetty). This provoked David Garrick, his student, to perform a skit mocking the incidents, although the incidents he portrayed were more than likely his own fabrications. However, the play was written mostly for Mrs. Johnson; she was fond of it and {{hoped it would be}} a success. Her belief in the play inspired Johnson to finish it and push to have it performed. When Edial Hall failed, Johnson travelled to London and brought the unfinished manuscript with him. In 1737, Johnson tried to submit Irene to Charles Fleetwood, the owner-manager of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, but Fleetwood rejected it on the grounds that there was no patron and his theatre was catering to other types of performances. Johnson tried in 1741 to have the unperformed play printed, but this too failed. He seems to have continued to revise it over the next several years, since a manuscript notebook contains draft material made not earlier than June 1746.|$|E
5|$|Kepler's {{first major}} astronomical work, Mysterium Cosmographicum (The Cosmographic Mystery) , {{was the first}} {{published}} defense of the Copernican system. Kepler claimed to have had an epiphany on July 19, 1595, <b>while</b> <b>teaching</b> in Graz, demonstrating the periodic conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the zodiac: he realized that regular polygons bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional polyhedra. He found {{that each of the}} five Platonic solids could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical orbs; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively—octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, cube—Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its orbital period: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough.|$|E
5|$|Scrushy {{soon found}} himself {{living in a}} Selma trailer park and working manual labor jobs to support his family. After a run-in with a boss, Scrushy quit his job hauling cement and {{decided to return to}} school. He earned his GED, and at his mother's advice, began {{studying}} respiratory therapy at Wallace State Community College. After a year at Wallace State, Scrushy transferred to Jefferson State Community College and later entered the respiratory therapy program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Upon graduating from UAB's program, Scrushy was offered a position teaching at the university, where he was promoted to director during his two and a half year tenure. Scrushy divorced his wife, with whom he had two children, and took a position teaching at Wallace State Community College in Dothan, Alabama. <b>While</b> <b>teaching</b> at Wallace State, Scrushy met and married his second wife, Karen Brooks. The two had four children before they divorced in 1996. In early June 1997, Scrushy married Leslie Anne Jones in Jamaica, with guests such as Martha Stewart attending. The group met at the HealthSouth Hangar at the Birmingham International Airport and boarded a chartered Boeing 727 to Jamaica. Together Richard and Leslie have had three children.|$|E
