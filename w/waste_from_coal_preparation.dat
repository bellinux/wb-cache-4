40|$|The project {{proposal}} was approved {{for only the}} phase I period. The goal for this Phase I project was to develop an industrial model that can perform continuous and efficient dewatering of fine coal slurries of the previous flotation process to fine coal cake of {approx} 15 % water content from 50 - 70 %. The feasibility of this model should be demonstrated experimentally using a lab scale setup. The Phase I project was originally for one year, from May 2005 to May 2006. With DOE approval, the project was extended to Dec. 2006 without additional cost from DOE to accomplish the work. Water {{has been used in}} mining for a number of purposes such as a carrier, washing liquid, dust-catching media, fire-retardation media, temperature-control media, and solvent. When coal is cleaned in wet-processing circuits, waste streams containing water, fine coal, and noncombustible particles (ash-forming minerals) are produced. In many <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> plants, the fine waste stream is fed into a series of selection processes where fine coal particles are recovered from the mixture to form diluted coal fine slurries. A dewatering process is then needed to reduce the water content to about 15 %- 20 % so that the product is marketable. However, in the dewatering process currently used in <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> plants, <b>coal</b> fines smaller than 45 micrometers are lost, and in many other plants, coal fines up to 100 micrometers are also wasted. These not-recovered coal fines are mixed with water and mineral particles of the similar particle size range and discharged to impoundment. The <b>wasted</b> water <b>from</b> <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> plants containing unrecoverable coal fine and mineral particles are called tailings. With time the amount of wastewater accumulates occupying vast land space while it appears as threat to the environment. This project developed a special extruder and demonstrated its application in solid-liquid separation of coal slurry, tailings containing coal fines mostly less than 50 micron. The extruder is special because all of its auger surface and the internal barrier surface are covered with the membranes allowing water to drain and solid particles retained. It is believed that there are four mechanisms working together in the dewatering process. They are hydrophilic diffusion flow, pressure flow, agitation and air purging. Hydrophilic diffusion flow is effective with hydrophilic membrane. Pressure flow is due to the difference of hydraulic pressure between {{the two sides of the}} membrane. Agitation is provided by the rotation of the auger. Purging is achieved with the air blow from the near bottom of the extruder, which is in vertical direction...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{flotation}} {{system was}} used to process fine <b>coal</b> feeds supplied <b>from</b> <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> plants. The system consisted of an inverted fluidized bed arranged above a system of inclined channels. High fluidization (wash water) fluxes were imposed through a distributor enclosing the free-surface, producing strong positive bias of up to 2. 4 cm/s, ideal for desliming. High gas fluxes of up to 2. 6 cm/s, {{in excess of the}} flooding condition, were also imposed. The presence of the inclined channels prevented the entrainment of gas bubbles into the tailings stream. This paper, which is the third in a series, examines, for the first time, the hydrodynamic performance of this system on two actual plant feeds, each known to be difficult to wash. The first feed was a poorly liberated coal with particle size < 260 µm and 69 % feed ash. The second was a well liberated coal with nominal size < 125 µm and 83 % less than 38 µm.

30|$|Research on {{minimizing}} possible hazards {{associated with}} trace elements {{is an important}} part of coal utilization technology. It may therefore be possible to reduce the environmental impacts associated with trace elements if the concentrations of key trace elements in coal are reduced by <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> technology (Senior et al. 2000). It is useful to subject a series of samples of different petrographic (mineral and maceral) characteristics by float-sink studies to learn more about the modes of trace element occurrence. Float-sink separation has been used in a number of studies to evaluate the partitioning of individual trace elements between organic-rich and mineral-rich fractions of coal samples, based mainly on correlations between element concentration on factors such as separation density and ash yield. The contents of trace elements in organic and inorganic components were studied by many researchers in this way (Gluskoter et al. 1977; Solari et al. 1989; Martinez-Tarazona et al. 1992; Pires et al. 1997; Klika et al. 1997; Klika and Kolonaznik 2000; Querol et al. 2001; Wagner and Tlotleng 2012; Oliveira et al. 2013; Equeenuddin et al. 2016; Bai et al. 2017). The effectiveness of float-sink separation of partitioning individual elements and identifying any element “affinities” are limited by the particle size at which the separation is carried out as mineral particles may still be present in the low-density fraction, even in a finely-ground coal. Although partitioning indicated at fine particle size (e.g. in the laboratory) is also not necessarily reproduced when <b>coals</b> are separated <b>from</b> coarser particle sizes in industrial preparation plants, it is still effective to evaluate the organic affinities and potential removability of particular trace elements (Bai et al. 2002; Tang et al. 2005; Wang and Li 2007; Song et al. 2010; Bai et al. 2014). It is worth noting that the reject materials <b>from</b> <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> of such cases may become even more enriched in the same trace elements, so that preparation may simply move the environmental impacts on the utilization plant to the waste disposal site.|$|R

The work was based on the results of mercury speciation in the gas and the solid fly ash before and after mercury retention.

The fly ashes were sampled <b>from</b> conventional <b>coal</b> combustion in air and oxy-combustion power plants. The main mercury species identified in the raw fly ashes and after they were subjected to an oxy-combustion atmosphere were mercury bound to organic matter and HgS, the ratio of these species depending on the characteristics of the ashes. The results obtained indicate that fly ashes are the route of mercury oxidation in an oxy-combustion atmosphere, although they hardly retain any mercury unless the unburned carbon content is high.
