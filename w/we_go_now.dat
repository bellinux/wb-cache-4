6000|$|... "I {{felt that}} you would {{want me to tell}} them. Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> at once?" [...] said Deronda, much {{relieved}} by this unwavering compliance.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall camp early, so {{that you}} may sleep long and win strength," [...] he said gently. [...] "And if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now,</b> we shall be the quicker to bed." ...|$|E
50|$|Can <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> Home <b>Now</b> is {{the ninth}} studio album by the folk trio The Roches, {{released}} in 1995 on Rykodisc.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "not <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> {{had better}} <b>go</b> some {{morning when the}} troops are parading there. <b>We</b> must <b>go</b> <b>now</b> and look out our lodgings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{has been}} too much talk of killing. <b>We</b> will <b>go</b> <b>now.</b> I take the thorn-pointed thing, Thuu, because I have fought and worsted thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> {{and hear}} what the scoring says? Every {{one is going to}} the other end now--shall we join them? I think my uncle is looking toward me. He perhaps wants me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Goot-a-bye, Mrs. Smet-thirst," [...] {{said the}} Celebrity. [...] "Zank {{you for a}} most charming visit. My friend Cootaboot and me <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> to shoot a few holes. You will lend me clobs, friend Cootaboot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} kindly excuse us," [...] struck in Mrs. Gladman, {{addressing}} Mr. Clodd {{with an air}} of much politeness, [...] "we shall just have time, if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now,</b> to catch our solicitor before he leaves his office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We will," [...] we {{said very}} earnestly. [...] "But {{meantime}} as our paper goes to press this afternoon <b>we</b> must <b>go</b> <b>now.</b> In fifty years {{we will come}} back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Mrs. Gardiner {{would be}} happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a little dance on New Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing <b>we</b> should <b>go,</b> <b>now</b> what shall <b>we</b> wear?" ...|$|R
50|$|After a tour {{interrupted}} {{by the death of}} their father, The Roches released Can <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> Home <b>Now</b> (1995), the last original recording they released as a trio until 2007.|$|R
6000|$|Predestination, GNADENWAHL, Herr General: what is orthodoxy on Predestination, {{with these}} accompaniments! [For Wreech, see Benekendorf, v. 94; for Schulenburg, ib. 26;--and Militair-Lexikon, iii. 432, 433, and iv. 268, 269. Vacant on the gossiping points; {{cautiously}} official, both these.] <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> to the Second Letter and the Third,--from Landsberg about a fortnight later:-- ...|$|E
60|$|If <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> {{and look}} on these innumerable epitaphs, the pathos and the irony are strangely fled. They do not stand merely to the dead, these foolish monuments; they are pillars and legends {{set up to}} glorify the {{difficult}} but not desperate life of man. This ground is hallowed by the heroes of defeat.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{must be the}} {{pedigree}} of that made-up horse-lie,' said he, 'the thing that I carry to Umballa. Better that <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now.</b> Those who search bags with knives may presently search bellies with knives. Surely there is a woman behind this. Hai! Hai! in a whisper to the light-sleeping old man. 'Come. It is time--time to go to Benares.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> in <b>now,</b> don't {{talk much}} to me, but make {{yourself}} agreeable {{to all the}} others, and then go straight home to the inn, and don't come here until after the funeral." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will come}} with me?" [...] said Madame. [...] "Come. Together <b>we</b> will <b>go</b> to Knarborough and bring back the naughty Ciccio. Come with me, because I haven't all my strength. Yes, you will? Good! Good! Let us tell the young men, and <b>we</b> will <b>go</b> <b>now,</b> on the tram-car." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{pale face}} of the red-haired man seemed a shade paler, but he was silent and composed, and Sir Walter went up to Nolan with marked courtesy, saying, [...] "Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> outside <b>now,</b> and get this {{business}} done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Spanish race, sir, is {{prolific}} {{of remarkable}} characters in every rank of life. [...] . I propose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> into the billiard-room, which is cool, {{for a quiet}} chat. There's never anybody there till after five. I could tell you episodes of the Separationist revolution that would astonish you. When the great heat's over, we'll take a turn on the Alameda." ...|$|E
6000|$|Such {{tears in}} her eyes, and such love in her face. I could not make my darling out. Should I go to Richard's by myself? I said. No, Ada thought I had better not go by myself. Would she go with me? Yes, Ada thought she had better go with me. Should <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now?</b> Yes, let us go now. Well, I could not {{understand}} my darling, with the {{tears in her}} eyes and the love in her face! ...|$|E
60|$|But drown or swim, here's {{overboard}} with care! Cheer up, Jarl! Ha! Ha! how merrily, yet terribly, we sail! Up, up--slowly up--toiling up the long, calm wave; then {{balanced on}} its summit a while, like a plank on a rail; and down, we plunge headlong into the seething abyss, till arrested, we glide upward again. And thus did <b>we</b> <b>go.</b> <b>Now</b> buried in watery hollows--our sail idly flapping; then lifted aloft-- canvas bellying; and beholding the furthest horizon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> in <b>now,</b> Dave?" [...] Dick asked excitedly, {{for they}} were still {{standing}} among the rocks, which broke off abruptly opposite {{the mouth of the}} Canyon, those in front of it evidently having been swept away by the torrents flowing down it.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{the walk}} where we turn up to it. But <b>we</b> must not <b>go</b> <b>now.</b> I'll show it you some other time, if you'd {{like to see}} it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>went</b> {{back to the}} house, and {{ascended the}} main stairway, which led up to a large central hall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not speak}} to her, my brother," [...] whispered Isabel, [...] "and do not seek to behold her face, as yet. It will pass over now, ere long, I trust. Come, shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now?</b> Take Delly forth, but do {{not speak to}} her. I have bidden all good-by; the old people are in yonder room in the rear; I am glad that they chose not to come out, to attend our going forth. Come now, be very quick, Pierre; this is an hour I like not; be it swiftly past." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes!" [...] she replied, graciously. [...] "I have {{an answer}} ready for you. You are so abrupt. Listen to what I propose. We will go {{together}} to your office and see whether {{it is true that}} Mr. Weatherley has not returned. If he has really disappeared, and I think that anything which I can tell you will help, perhaps then I will do as you ask. It depends a great deal upon what you find in those papers. Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now,</b> or would you like to stay here a little longer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've 'lowed that we'll keep back 'bout {{a dollar}} to buy papers with, an' then, if {{both of us}} work mighty hard, it won't be more'n {{three or four days}} before we can have a pretty good lot of stuff. You'll keep right on shinin', an' I'll do my level best with papers, while Ikey 'tends to the stand till he gets well. 'Cordin' to my way of thinkin', we can build up a good trade there if we hustle; an' that's what we've got to do {{wherever}} <b>we</b> <b>go.</b> <b>Now,</b> {{what do you say to}} it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{stopped as}} if thinking. [...] "Do {{you want me}} to call him in?" [...] she said quietly, but without the least trace of archness or coquetry. [...] "Would you rather he were here--or shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> out <b>now</b> and meet him? I'll say you just came as I was going out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not for}} squaws {{to inquire}} into the plans of men, but {{as there is no}} secret in {{what we are going to}} do, I may tell you, mother, that women and {{children}} have not yet learned to live on grass or air. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> just <b>now</b> to procure fresh meat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I do not,' {{answered}} Anita. 'I {{mean this}} very spot. To find {{something like it}} would require months. What I want, as I have told you over and over again, is a real cot with a real rill, to which <b>we</b> can <b>go</b> <b>now</b> and live {{for a little while}} that unsophisticated life for which my soul is longing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{the only}} view I care to show you now," [...] {{he said at the}} crest. [...] "There was a better one beyond there. But--it has been defiled.... Those hills! I knew you would like them. The space of it! And ... yet----. This view--lacks the shining ponds. There are {{wonderful}} distant ponds. After all I must show you the other! But you see there is the high-road, and the high-road has produced an abomination. Along here <b>we</b> <b>go.</b> <b>Now.</b> Don't look down please." [...] His gesture covered the foreground. [...] "Look right over the nearer things into the distance. There!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Volontiers, Michie, as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now.</b> But there come a {{time when}} I, even I, who am twenty year on her, do not know whether it is right or left. Ze rock--he vair' hard. Ze snag, he grip you like dat," [...] and Xavier twined his strong arms around Nick until he was helpless. [...] "Ze bar--he hol' you by ze leg. An' who is to tell you how far he run under ze yellow water, Michie? I, who speak to you, know. But I know not how I know. Ze water, {{sometime}} she tell, sometime she say not'ing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Karenin {{seemed to}} weigh his words. He spoke very deliberately. 'I {{do not care}} a rap about your future--as women. I do not care a rap {{about the future of}} men--as males. I want to destroy these {{peculiar}} futures. I care for your future as intelligences, as parts of and contribution to the universal mind of the race. Humanity is not only naturally over-specialised in these matters, but all its institutions, its customs, everything, exaggerate, intensify this difference. I want to unspecialise women. No new idea. Plato wanted exactly that. I do not want to go on as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>now,</b> emphasising this natural difference; I do not deny it, but I want to reduce it and overcome it.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went,</b> my mood <b>now</b> overpast. I was as {{sober and}} {{self-contained}} as was my habit. And soon thereafter came my Lord Gambara--a rare {{thing to happen}} in the afternoon.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{pressure}} is off us now and we've got another race tomorrow and another round at Abu Dhabi. <b>We</b> can <b>go</b> out <b>now,</b> enjoy {{it and have}} some fun! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>we</b> will <b>go</b> <b>now,</b> shall we?--and return later," [...] said Deronda, {{laying a}} gentle {{pressure}} on Mrs. Meyrick's arm, and she immediately complied. He {{was afraid of}} any reference to the facts about himself which he had kept back from Mordecai, and he felt no uneasiness now in {{the thought of the}} brother and sister being alone together.|$|R
