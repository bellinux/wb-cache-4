5000|$|The first <b>mixer</b> <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> motor {{is thought}} to be the one invented by American Rufus Eastman in 1885. [...] The Hobart Manufacturing Company was an early {{manufacturer}} of large commercial mixers, and they say a new model introduced in 1914 {{played a key role in}} the mixer part of their business. The Hobart KitchenAid and Sunbeam Mixmaster (first produced 1910) were two very early US brands of <b>electric</b> <b>mixer.</b> Domestic <b>electric</b> <b>mixers</b> were rarely used before the 1920s, when they were adopted more widely for home use.|$|R
30|$|Mix {{in a large}} bowl, a {{concentrated}} solution of unflavored gelatin, water and ethanol. For 500 ml of hot water, add 100 grams of gelatin and 30 ml of ethanol as a preservative. To obtain greater or lesser amount of mixture you will only {{need to make the}} corresponding conversion ratios using a simple rule of three and if required you can add clothing artificial colorant to give desired color to the phantom. Mix it <b>with</b> the <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> for 2 minutes, allow to stand 30 minutes. Then remove the foam on the surface with a spoon. Fill the bowl or tupperware with the mix and let it cool for 2 hours in the fridge. Meanwhile a metal rod is used to shape the mold of the eyeball, making a circle with a small mound that will simulate the shape of the cornea, which will represent the sagittal plane to view it with the ultrasound. In the same way and with smaller pieces of metal, will be made molds of smaller structures as the lens, iris, the retina detached etc. Can be used as guide, ultrasound of normal eye or a drawing fron an anatomy book. In order to increase echogenicity of the shapes made, use the body oil to fill the prints in the already hard gelatin. 6 impressions of eyeballs for the different simulations will be made.|$|R
25|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> is {{a kitchen}} {{appliance}} used for whipping, beating, and folding food ingredients.

The first <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> was invented by Rufus M. Eastman in 1885. U.S. patent #330,829 for the first <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> was filed by Eastman on March 6, 1885, and issued on November 17, 1885.|$|R

50|$|Sarawakian modern layered cakes can {{be divided}} into two categories: cakes with {{ordinary}} layers and cakes with patterns, motifs, or shapes. All must have at least two colours. The cake can be baked in an oven or microwave. The batter uses butter or vegetable oil, milk and eggs, and requires a strong arm or <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> to be properly prepared. The baked cake has a high, firm texture and the layers are fastened together with jam or a similarly sticky sweet substance.

50|$|In Greece, one of {{the most}} popular coffees is a {{variation}} of iced coffee called Frappé, invented by a Nescafe represenatative Dimitrios Vakondios in 1957.

Subsequently, milk is optionally added followed by ice cubes, and the remainder is topped with water. It became well known outside of Greece as a result of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, during which many tourists became fond of it and an article in the Los Angeles Times was published about it.http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/food/la-fo-frappe18aug18,1,6434354.story?coll=la-headlines-pe-food Since its founding, Frappe became a very popular drink in Cyprus, and in Romania.|$|R
50|$|Concave cakes are {{commonly}} made with eggs, egg yolk, low gluten flour, honey {{and a small}} portion of sugar. Regardless of ingredients, the procedure for making the cakes is fairly consistent in all recipes. First, preheat the oven at around 170 degree Celsius, at the same time, mix the 1 eggs and 3 egg yolks by adding sugar and honey which depend on preference. The mixture will be creamed by using a wooden spoon or <b>electric</b> <b>mixer.</b> The gluten flour will be added and stir them softly for a while. Then, pour the mixture into molds.

[...] Additionally, the modern method typically uses an extra raising agent, and some recipes call for an extra-soft butter or margarine.

25|$|Mayonnaise {{can be made}} by {{hand with}} a whisk, or fork, or with the aid of an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to {{disperse}} the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|R
