5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the {{vicinity}} of Roxy Ann Peak for the past 8,000 to 10,000 years. The first inhabitants were semi-nomadic, most likely living off edible bulbs and large mammals such as mastodons and giant bison. Within the last millennium, the region became home to the Latgawa Native American tribe, <b>who</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> peak Al-wiya. They probably used the mountain for gathering acorns and hunting black-tailed deer and small birds, animals which are still abundant there.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Chris Carter, <b>who</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> episode {{one of his}} {{favorite}} episodes to write, created the episode as a way to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father. The episode contained several elaborate special effects; effects producer Mat Beck considered the sequence where Mulder has a vision of Deep Throat and his father {{to be one of the}} most difficult of the season.|$|E

5|$|The first correct {{name was}} {{published}} in 1803 by Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher, <b>who</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> species Agaricus cirrhatus. French mycologist Lucien Quélet transferred it to Collybia in 1879, resulting in the binomial by which it is currently known. The species had also been transferred to Microcollybia by Georges Métrod in 1952 and again by Lennox in 1979 (because Métrod's transfer was considered a nomen nudum, and thus invalid according to nomenclatural rules); the genus Microcollybia has since been wrapped into Collybia.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving, was {{announced}} {{as a reward}} for contributing to the Idle Thumbs podcast revival Kickstarter. The game was released to Kickstarter backers in July 2012, and later offered as a purchasable title on Steam, which included Gravity Bone as an additional feature. The game, though not a direct sequel in story to Gravity Bone, follows the main character in a heist with two other characters that goes very wrong. The title was critically acclaimed by reviewers, <b>who</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> very short but non-linear storytelling of Thirty Flights a novel use of the video game medium.|$|E

When the police arrived at the scene they transported him to a local hospital, Santos was released two days after. During this time Santos was also suffering from mental illnesses, including memory loss due to Alzheimer's disease. Despite his health he made final presentations in some of Puerto Rico's municipalities where he received recognitions in San Juan and Ponce. Santos was also {{invited to participate in}} a music festival in Cuba, where he was supposed to receive a homage, but he was unable to attend.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th century, {{what is now}} Great Marlborough Street was land {{belonging}} to the Mercer's Company. It was surrendered to Henry VIII in 1536. The land was subsequently owned by local brewer Thomas Wilson. His son, Richard, inherited this in 1622 who sold it to William Maddox, <b>who</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> estate Millfield. In 1670, Maddox's son, Benjamin, let the land to James Kendrick for 72 years, who in turn sub-let what is now Great Marlborough Street to John Steele. The land remained undeveloped, with building focusing on Tyburn Road (now Oxford Street) to the north.|$|E
5|$|One 30-minute {{practice}} session {{was held on}} Thursday before the two races. Bird, <b>who</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Circuit de Monaco his favourite track in the GP2 Series, was the fastest driver {{with a time of}} one minute and 21.512 seconds on super-soft tyres, 0.057 seconds faster than teammate Tom Dillmann in second. Evans was third-fastest, ahead of Jolyon Palmer. Marcus Ericsson and Johnny Cecotto Jr. were fifth and sixth. Leimer was seventh-fastest, Nasr eighth, Rio Haryanto ninth and Calado completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Only minor off-track excursions were reported with Stéphane Richelmi spinning at La Rascasse corner and stalled in his attempt to continue driving. Nasr narrowly avoided impacting the barriers at the Swimming Pool complex and Coletti, Leimer, Calado and Kevin Giovesi all ran deep into the track's run-off areas at various points in the half hour session.|$|E
5|$|Research on RNA {{has led to}} many {{important}} biological discoveries and numerous Nobel Prizes. Nucleic acids were discovered in 1868 by Friedrich Miescher, <b>who</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> material 'nuclein' since it {{was found in the}} nucleus. It was later discovered that prokaryotic cells, which do not have a nucleus, also contain nucleic acids. The role of RNA in protein synthesis was suspected already in 1939. Severo Ochoa won the 1959 Nobel Prize in Medicine (shared with Arthur Kornberg) after he discovered an enzyme that can synthesize RNA in the laboratory. However, the enzyme discovered by Ochoa (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was later shown to be responsible for RNA degradation, not RNA synthesis. In 1956 Alex Rich and David Davies hybridized two separate strands of RNA to form the first crystal of RNA whose structure could be determined by X-ray crystallography.|$|E

5|$|The racial {{segregation}} of local schools {{meant that the}} nearest white school was several miles away; Bakshi obtained his mother's permission to attend the nearby black school with his friends. Bakshi was the only white student in the classroom. Most {{of the students had}} no problem with Bakshi's presence, but a teacher sought advice from the principal, <b>who</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> police. Fearing that segregated whites would riot if they learned that a white student was attending a black school, the police removed Bakshi from his classroom. Meanwhile, his father had been suffering from anxiety attacks. Within a few months, the family moved back to Brownsville, where they rarely spoke of these events.|$|E
5|$|A {{bipartisan}} {{group of}} MPs formed a Conciliation Committee in early 1910 and proposed a Conciliation Bill {{that would have}} brought the vote to a million women, {{so long as they}} owned property. While the bill was being discussed, the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's Liberal government reneged on a promise to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill. A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, <b>who</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> day Black Friday, complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature. Davison was not one of the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the Crown Office in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.|$|E
