Our own aircraft has been grand in its relentless hammering of the foe. All those efforts are appreciated but our greatest homage goes to Callaghan, Scott and their men who with magnificent courage against seemingly hopeless odds drove back the first hostile attack and {{paved the way}} for the success to follow. To them the men of Cactus lift their battered helmets in deepest admiration.|$|E

President Clinton singled Bentsen out for applause during his final State of the Union address in 2000, saying: 'In 1993 we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, which you'll all remember won passages in both Houses by just a single vote.

500|$|Most other {{movements}} of the mass are parodies of music from earlier cantatas, dating {{back as far as}} 1714. Wenk points out that Bach often used parody to [...] "bring a composition to a higher level of perfection". The original musical sources of several movements are known, for others they are lost but the score shows that they are copied and reworked. Bach selected movements that carried a similar expression and affekt. For example, [...] (We give you thanks) is based on [...] (<b>We</b> <b>thank</b> you, God, <b>we</b> <b>thank</b> you) and the [...] (Crucified) is based on the general lamenting about the situation of the faithful Christian, [...] (Weeping, lamenting, worrying, fearing) which Bach had composed already in 1714 as one of his first cantatas for the court of Weimar.|$|E
