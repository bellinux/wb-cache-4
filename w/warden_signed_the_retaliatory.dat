40|$|This comment {{evaluates the}} {{availability}} of <b>the</b> <b>retaliatory</b> eviction defense to periodic tenants in Washington State in light of a recent appellate court decision, Stephanus v. Anderson, denying periodic tenants the defense where the statutorily required twenty day termination notice is provided. An analysis of the basic policies underlying the Act, to ensure safe, sanitary housing conditions and to prohibit landlords 2 ̆ 7 retaliatory actions against tenants exercising their rights to attain decent housing conditions, indicates periodic tenants be allowed to assert <b>the</b> <b>retaliatory</b> eviction defense.

Based on these considerations, this comment concludes that Washington State courts should recognize {{the availability of}} <b>the</b> <b>retaliatory</b> eviction defense to periodic tenants...|$|R
