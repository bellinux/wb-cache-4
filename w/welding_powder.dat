Almost overnight the Muurame factory’s manufacturing was moved to Vammala. According to MD Seppo Suuriniemi, at that time the company was able to take on the manufacturing of around 1000 hospital beds at a time.

40|$|International audienceThermal plasma {{generated}} {{either by}} transferred arc or by plasma torches {{are involved in}} many industrial processes including, for example, cutting, <b>welding,</b> <b>powder</b> synthesis or coating elaboration by plasma spray techniques. The common feature is that electrical energy is converted into thermal energy, which must be transferred differently following {{the goal of the}} technique. Cutting requires a high thermal flux density to the anode in order to optimize both the accuracy and the speed of cutting. On the opposite, heat transfer to the anode of a plasma spray torch needs to be reduced, as much as possible, in order to slow down the nozzle erosion which is responsible, among other problems, of the monotonic deviation of the torche performances over a long time scale. This presentation is devoted to a general approach of the physical processes concerning an electric arc, thermally constricted and confined in the channel of a plasma torch nozzle. Experimental results characterizing both stationnary and transient behaviour of the generated plasma flow will be described.

40|$|Nowadays, technologists {{in charge}} of repair, restoration, modernization, and {{utilization}} of engineering and other tangible objects widely use the concepts "renovation" and "renovation technologies" pioneered at BMSTU. In forming a new field of science these concepts, in the proper sense of the word, are of composite, generalized character. They concern all the activities and technologies aimed at increasing an object resource or its lifecycle extension, including object material recycling. In the cutting-edge renovation technologies an object (part, assembly, machine, etc.) damaged in the operating process {{is considered to be}} an initial billet. In renovation, one of the most widespread kinds of initial billets is a damaged part. Such a part can be used again, if, for example, it has saved its material properties in full measure while only contact surfaces or parts of these surfaces have become damaged, and at a point of renovation they can be restored for recycling. If a part has lost its initial properties in full bulk of material, it may be reusable in the assemblies and machines with less rigid requirements for material properties. Or in case of properties loss below the permissible level a damaged part-billet is utilized. Thus, the part-billet state at the point of renovation defines the kind of renovation technology and the main (basic) technological method to effect on the damaged part, as well as a set and a sequence of technological methods in general manufacturing process of renovation. However renovation technologies are used not only at the repair and restoration stages after operation-service. So, at the manufacturing stage of a new product to provide the quality to raise a resource are applied the same technological methods as renovation technologies for the objects damaged at the stage of operation. Besides, it is known that at the manufacturing stage a part quality depends not only on the last operation, but also on the features of power effects of all previous operations beginning with the material for initial billet of new product. As expertise based on different kinds of manufacturing shows in producing the traditional billets (castings, forged pieces, welded assemblies), the inherent renovation technologies are widely used to eliminate the faulty parts. Consequently, blank products damaged at the stage of their manufacturing can be considered to be another most widespread kind of initial billets in renovation technologies. A renovated object material itself with its properties to be mandatory changed, in renovation may be considered as a further specific kind of initial billet. Earlier it was not stated. It {{should be noted that the}} term" renovation technologies" refers to all kinds of technologies which enable "extending the product lifecycle" i. e. tangible object – product of manufacturing processes. It is the same classification notion as, for example, a concept "methods of primary forming" when it comes to the methods, which simultaneously in full blast of material form a structure and a product shape (castings, shaping, <b>welding,</b> <b>powder</b> metallurgy, etc.). Thus, renovation technologies also include an entire group of processing methods to increase or extend an object resource at all stages of its lifecycle. These may be, for example, methods such as thermal treatment, strengthening technology, coating processes, etc. And all the objects subjected to the power deposition of abovementioned methods may be, respectively, considered to be the initial billets for renovation A special kind of initial billets in renovation also include, for example, manufacturing processes in case of their restructuring or improvement, reconstructed industries, shops, and factories. Besides, these are engineering drawings paperwork, guidance documentation, and reference literature, when making their amendments, complements or improvement. Thus, a view of initial billet is in compliance with the tasks to be solved in renovation and with the manufacturing processes, which provide the best quality, performance report, and guarantee of durability for the objects, materials, manufacturing processes, which are damaged, morally and physically outdated, new, but do not meet the specified requirements. </p...|$|E

25|$|Friction {{extrusion}} {{was invented}} at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended {{primarily as a}} method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state <b>welding</b> of <b>powders</b> or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.|$|R

40|$|The {{continued}} {{drive for}} increased efficiency, performance and reduced costs for industrial gas turbine engines demands extended use of high strength-high temperature capability materials, such as nickel based superalloys. To {{satisfy the requirements}} of the component design and manufacturing engineers these materials must be capable of being welded in a satisfactory manner.

Advanced coatings are by vacuum plasma method, HVOF, laser surface alloying, plasma <b>powder</b> <b>welding</b> and ion beam assisted coatings. Laser surface alloying is being considered as the most versatile technique which {{can be used to make}} high performance surface alloys. This helps in saving huge cost of costly materials, which are un-necessarily used in bulk alloying as well as the processing does not interfere with the bulk properties...|$|R
