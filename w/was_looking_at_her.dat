500|$|But unlike {{previous}} allegorical literature {{with these}} themes, such as John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1678), Sherwood domesticated her story—all {{of the actions}} in the children's day-to-day lives are of supreme importance because they relate directly to their salvation. Emily, for example, succumbs to the temptation to eat some forbidden plums: “no eye <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> but the eye of God, who sees every thing we do, and knows even the secret thoughts of the heart; but Emily, just at that moment, {{did not think of}} God." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{flashing}} scene, Carell told Flannery that he [...] "wasn't staring at" [...] her breasts, rather, he <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> clavicle. Despite what it appears on camera, Flannery {{was not completely}} topless, as she was wearing pasties. The scene was shot several times; Flannery admitted that the shooting was excruiating {{and it felt like}} they had been shooting the one scene for [...] "14 hours". To preserve Flannery's modesty, the series' monitors were shut off and the memory card for the digital camera was removed. Carell actually took pictures during the Christmas party shoot. All of the photos were released online.|$|E

When Hawks (an older friend of the crew) asked a lighting tech who he would rather drop a light on, Hepburn agreed to behave on set. A variation of this scene, with Grant yelling [...] "Quiet!", was incorporated into the film.|$|E

500|$|In early 2007, it was {{reported}} that Madonna was recording songs with American singer Justin Timberlake for her upcoming eighth studio album. Later, it was also announced that record producers Timbaland and Pharrell Williams were working with her on the album, and Timbaland confirmed that a song titled [...] "Candy Shop" [...] was being produced by Williams. On July 2007, a demo of the song, titled [...] "Candy Store", leaked online, but was quickly removed following copyright issues. [...] "Candy Shop" [...] was the first song Madonna and Williams worked on together. The latter recalled, [...] "we were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, give me some hot shit.' I <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we just worked and made it." [...] Madonna stated during an interview with Q magazine that [...] "Candy Shop", along with album track [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You", was among her favorite songs, [...] "I love 'Candy Shop' cos it's cheeky and fun, and I feel it sort of represents the sassy side of me; the fun, sassy side of me. And I just love the way it sounds. And I love candy!".|$|E
500|$|With Interview magazine, Madonna {{explained}} her inspirations {{behind the}} songs and the music of Hard Candy. She said that [...] "probably in many respects most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an unconscious way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes. And {{then a lot of}} times, six months later, eight months later, I go, 'Oh, that's what I wrote that song about.' But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that.'" [...] "Candy Shop" [...] is the opening track of the album. Produced by Williams, the song uses the word candy as a metaphor for sex. Williams said, [...] "We were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, give me some hot shit.' I <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we just worked and made it." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "4 Minutes", was initially known as [...] "4 Minutes to Save the World". The song's development was motivated by a sense of urgency to save the planet from destruction, and how people can enjoy themselves in the process. According to Madonna, the song inspired her to produce the documentary I Am Because We Are. The song features vocals by Timberlake and Timbaland. An uptempo dance song with an urban, hip hop style, it also incorporates Timbaland's bhangra beats. The instrumentation used in the song includes brass, foghorns and cow bells. The song's lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed.|$|E
