50|$|If {{a vessel}} is adrift {{and not being}} {{propelled}} by any instrument or device, {{it is said to}} <b>be</b> <b>underway,</b> not making way. The concept of whether a vessel is, or <b>is</b> not, <b>underway</b> has important legal ramifications. For example, in many jurisdictions a child must be wearing a personal flotation device at the time the vessel <b>is</b> <b>underway.</b>|$|R

She was wrecked on 30 May 1815 during a storm at Waenhuiskrans, near Cape Agulhas, South Africa, {{with the loss}} of 372 lives – only six on board survived.

5|$|Caltrans {{engineer}} Jacob Dekema {{announced in}} April1969 that construction on SR76 {{and the nearby}} SR 78 between I-5 and US395 would be delayed until work <b>was</b> <b>underway</b> on I-5 and US395 <b>was</b> <b>underway,</b> or at least until 1976. Nevertheless, a widening project was commissioned in 1970 between Pauma Reservation Road and Cole Grade Road, well east of US395. The next year, construction began on a new interchange between the future routing of SR76 and I-5, near Oceanside Harbor and Camp Del Mar in Camp Pendleton. The expansion of SR76 appeared on the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO) regional government plan in late 1974. At that time, there was an effort by the City of Oceanside to have SR76 included as a scenic highway, but SR76 has not {{been included in the}} system. The Chamber of Commerce decided to continue efforts to have SR76 expanded at the end of 1974.|$|E

5|$|Gen. Lee {{arrived on}} the {{battlefield}} at about 2:30 p.m., as Rodes's men were in mid-attack. Seeing that a major assault <b>was</b> <b>underway,</b> he lifted his restriction on a general engagement and gave permission to Hill to resume his attacks from the morning. First in line was Heth's division again, with two fresh brigades: Pettigrew's North Carolinians and Col. John M. Brockenbrough's Virginians.|$|E

5|$|In 1865, {{powers were}} granted {{to extend the}} line from Newport Pagnell to Olney {{and then on to}} meet the Northampton and Peterborough Railway at Wellingborough. Construction <b>was</b> <b>underway,</b> and a bridge had been {{completed}} when the extension was abandoned in 1871. Olney was later served by a station on the Midland Railway's Bedford–Northampton line from 1872, that line closing in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that a major}} Japanese attack <b>was</b> <b>underway,</b> Puller {{requested}} reinforcement. At 03:45, the 3rd Battalion, 164th Infantry, {{commanded by}} Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall and being held in reserve, was fed piecemeal into Puller's line. In spite of the darkness and intermittent heavy rain, the Army National Guard troops were placed in Puller's defences before daybreak.|$|E
5|$|The Marines {{began their}} attack, codenamed Operation Vigilant Resolve, on 5 April. The overall ground {{commander}} in Anbar, 1st Marine Division commander General James Mattis, initially {{planned to use}} his only available units, 1st Battalion 5th Marines and 2nd Battalion 1st Marines. They would push in from {{the east and west}} and methodically contain the insurgents. This plan <b>was</b> <b>underway</b> when on 9 April, General Sanchez ordered an immediate halt.|$|E

5|$|While {{fundraising}} {{to preserve}} the work <b>was</b> <b>underway,</b> the city of Santa Monica filed an application in May 2012 to nominate the sculpture for landmark status.

5|$|After 24 hours, only 2,500 {{men of the}} 101st and 2,000 of the 82nd Airborne {{were under}} the control of their divisions, {{approximately}} a third of the force dropped. This wide dispersal had the effect of confusing the Germans and fragmenting their response. The 7th Army received notification of the parachute drops at 01:20, but Rundstedt did not initially believe that a major invasion <b>was</b> <b>underway.</b> The destruction of radar stations along the Normandy coast in the week before the invasion meant that the Germans did not detect the approaching fleet until 02:00.|$|E

5|$|After a {{few years}} of {{unsteady}} peace, in 1648 the Second English Civil War broke out, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by Scottish forces. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by the nearby Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection <b>was</b> <b>underway</b> across Kent. Sandown Castle declared for the King, and the soldier and former naval captain Major Keme then convinced the garrisons at Deal and Walmer to surrender. Sandgate Castle probably joined the Royalists as well. With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast, or military aid sent to the Scots.|$|E

Erie Canal Harbor eventually opened on July 2, 2008.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, {{what would}} become DE 4 existed as a county road. The road from Stanton to Wilmington was paved four years later and the portion west of Stanton was paved by 1936. In 1936, work <b>was</b> <b>underway</b> to improve the road between Stanton and Newport by {{widening}} and resurfacing it, with completion a year later. In 1957, Maryland Avenue between Silview and Boxwood Road was widened to four lanes and the one-way pair along Market Street and Justis Street in Newport was established.|$|E
