5|$|As might befit {{a country}} that plays home to innumerable {{international}} organisations, the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, located in Geneva, is not only continental Europe's oldest graduate school of international and development studies, but also <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> be {{one of its most}} prestigious.|$|E
5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> be correct.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the movie}} {{is set in the}} fashion world, most {{designers}} and other fashion notables avoided appearing as themselves for fear of displeasing U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who is <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> have been the inspiration for Priestly. Still, many allowed their clothes and accessories {{to be used in the}} film, making it one of the most expensively costumed films in history. Wintour later overcame her initial skepticism, saying she liked the film and Streep in particular.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{something that}} Kant notoriously {{claimed to be}} possible, but which Kant scholars today <b>widely</b> <b>believe</b> <b>to</b> be impossible: unification of all three formulations of the Categorical Imperative. Part 1 of this paper tells a broad-brush story of how I understand Kant’s theory of practical reason and morality, showing how the three formulations of the Categorical Imperative appear {{to me to be}} unified. Part 2 then provides clear textual support for each premise in the argument for my interpretation...|$|R
50|$|The term is {{also used}} as an analogy to the Aristotelian idea that a {{physical}} vacuum is impossible, and therefore the idea must be rejected. This was <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> up <b>to</b> the time of Rene Descartes.|$|R

5|$|By July 22, with Dean still missing, Eighth Army {{appointed}} Church {{commander of}} the 24th Infantry Division and promoted him to major general. Dean was <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> have been killed until October 1950, when US forces captured a North Korean soldier named Lee Kyu Hyun near P'yongyang. Lee {{had been assigned to}} live with Dean for a month as an interpreter. Lee was interviewed throughout late 1950 but US military leaders still generally thought Dean was dead.|$|E
5|$|Franz Ferdinand was an {{advocate}} of increased federalism and <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> favor trialism, under which Austria-Hungary would be reorganized by combining the Slavic lands within the Austro-Hungarian empire into a third crown. A Slavic kingdom {{could have been a}} bulwark against Serb irredentism, and Franz Ferdinand was therefore perceived as a threat by those same irredentists. Princip later stated to the court that preventing Franz Ferdinand's planned reforms was one of his motivations.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, {{local media}} {{reported}} that the Badminton Association of Malaysia confirmed {{that one of the}} nation's top shuttlers tested positive for dexamethasone after urine samples were taken during the World Championships in late August. The identity of the shuttler was not revealed but was <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> be Lee Chong Wei. Dexamathasone is not a performance-enhancing drug but a commonly-administered anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that is not illegal when used off-season for injury rehabilitation, but deemed illegal if discovered in an athlete's body during competition.|$|E
50|$|Dominic Daly (1770 - June 5, 1806) was an Irishman who {{immigrated to}} America some time around 1800, and was {{executed}} for murder, {{in what has}} <b>widely</b> been <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> be a miscarriage of justice.|$|R
50|$|Tachyonic {{particles}} are hypothetical particles that travel faster than light. These would allow superluminal communication, {{and for this}} reason are <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> not <b>to</b> exist. By contrast, tachyonic fields - quantum fields with imaginary mass - certainly do exist, and exhibit superluminal group velocity under some circumstances. However, such fields have luminal signal velocity and do not allow superluminal communication.|$|R

He prefers the marble Laocoön and his Sons {{in the palace}} of Titus (<b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> be the statue that {{is now in the}} Vatican) to all the pictures and bronzes in the world (XXXVI:37). The statue is attributed by Pliny to three sculptors from the island of Rhodes: Agesander, Athenodoros (possibly son of Agesander) and Polydorus.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 1983, {{the wooden}} {{rear of the}} cabinet was pried open with a crowbar and the cup was stolen again. Four men were tried and convicted in {{absentia}} for the crime. The trophy has never been recovered, and it is <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> have been melted down and sold. Only one piece of the Jules Rimet Trophy has been found, the original base which FIFA had kept in a basement of the federation's Zürich headquarters prior to 2015.|$|E
5|$|Radiocarbon dating {{determined}} that the papyrus is medieval, and further analysis of the language led most scholars to conclude it was copied from the Gospel of Thomas. The fragment's provenance and similarity to another fragment from the same anonymous owner <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> be fake further supported a consensus among scholars that the text is a modern forgery written on a scrap of medieval papyrus.|$|E
50|$|Al Jazirah Al Hamra {{is a town}} to {{the south}} of the city of Ras al-Khaimah in the United Arab Emirates. It is known for its {{collection}} of abandoned houses and other buildings, including a mosque, which are <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> locally <b>to</b> be haunted. The town was originally home to three tribes and ruled by the Al-Zaab tribe, which was rehoused in Abu Dhabi following a dispute with the Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah.|$|R
50|$|As a {{periodical}} {{that reported}} on the lives and activities {{of many of the}} islands entertainment, sports, and political personalities, the magazine was no stranger to controversy. In 1994, a discovery by a Vea employee caused a wide international controversy, when the employee ran across some documents that Puerto Rico was the actual birthplace of famous Mexican singer, Luis Miguel, and not Mexico, as it had been <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> prior <b>to</b> the discovery.|$|R

5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was first discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> be one of the main neural mechanisms by which memories are stored in the brain.|$|E
5|$|In later {{editions of}} the book, Darwin traced {{evolutionary}} ideas {{as far back as}} Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.|$|E
5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as it is <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> be the first painting, {{since the fall of}} Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, {{it is one of the}} first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were to walk into the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E
5000|$|One {{tale that}} is <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> and seems <b>to</b> come from many {{different}} sources is that 563 women {{picked up by the}} army in March and April and held in military brothels are not being released because they are pregnant beyond the point at which abortions are possible.|$|R

5|$|Weisberger is <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> have based Miranda on Anna Wintour, the {{powerful}} editor of Vogue. Wintour reportedly warned major fashion designers {{who had been}} invited to make cameo appearances as themselves in the film that they would be banished from the magazine's pages if they did so. Vogue and other major women's and fashion magazines have avoided reviewing or even mentioning the book in their pages. Wintour's spokespeople deny the claim, but costume designer Patricia Field says many designers told her {{they did not want to}} risk Wintour's wrath.|$|E
5|$|As an anointed queen, Mary {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the power of any court to try her and refused to attend the inquiry at York personally (she sent representatives), but Elizabeth forbade her attendance anyway. As evidence against Mary, Moray presented the so-called casket letters—eight unsigned letters purportedly from Mary to Bothwell, two marriage contracts, and a love sonnet or sonnets {{said to have been}} found in a silver-gilt casket just less than one foot (30cm) long, decorated with the monogram of King Francis II. Mary denied writing them, arguing that her handwriting was not difficult to imitate, and insisted they were forgeries. They are <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> be crucial as to whether Mary shares the guilt for Darnley's murder. The chair of the commission of inquiry, the Duke of Norfolk, described them as horrible letters and diverse fond ballads, and sent copies to Elizabeth, saying that if they were genuine they might prove Mary's guilt.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 and 2001, Ijaz was {{involved}} in efforts to broker a ceasefire in Kashmir, the cause of multiple wars between India and Pakistan since independence. He {{held a series of}} meetings with senior Indian and Pakistani government officials as well as senior Kashmiri leaders in both Indian and Pakistani-held Kashmir from November 1999 until January 2001, traveling to India secretly on out-of-passport visas. Following months of clandestine negotiations between militant Kashmiri commander Abdul Majid Dar and A. S. Dulat, then-chief of India's intelligence directorate, Dar declared a unilateral ceasefire in the Himalayan enclave on July 25, 2000. The initial ceasefire was aborted by a hard-line militant faction within Dar's Hizbul Mujahideen, <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> have been supported by Pakistani intelligence. In order to gain Pakistani support for India's peace efforts in Kashmir, Ijaz met Gen. Pervez Musharraf in Islamabad in May 2000. Musharraf reluctantly agreed to back the ceasefire plan despite opposition from hardliners in the ranks of Pakistan's armed forces and intelligence services.|$|E
50|$|The {{prestige}} of Khomeini and the hostage taking was further enhanced when an American attempt {{to rescue the}} hostages failed because of a sand storm, <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> in Iran <b>to</b> {{be the result of}} divine intervention. Another long-term effect of the crisis was harm to the Iranian economy, which was, and continues to be, subject to American economic sanctions.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes, {{people in}} society form {{conventional}} {{ideas about what}} {{other people in the}} past considered to be conventional wisdom. For example, take the following sentence: [...] "It is <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> that prior <b>to</b> Christopher Columbus people thought the world was flat, but in actuality, scholars of that time had long accepted that the earth is a sphere." ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{commentators}} {{have claimed that}} Flammarion produced the image to propagandize the myth that medieval Europeans <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> the Earth <b>to</b> be flat. In his book, however, Flammarion never discusses the history of beliefs about {{the shape of the}} Earth. His text suggests that the image is simply a fanciful illustration of the false view of the sky as an opaque barrier.|$|R
5|$|A {{tree nursery}} was {{established}} at Kinloch in 1960 {{in order to}} support a substantial programme of re-introducing twenty native species including silver birch, hawthorn, rowan and holly. The forested area, which consists of over a million re-introduced native trees and shrubs, is essentially confined to the vicinity of Kinloch and the slopes near this site surrounding Loch Scresort and on nearby Meall á Ghoirtein. The island's flora came to widespread attention with the 1999 publication of the book A Rum Affair by Karl Sabbagh, a British writer and television producer. The book told of a long-running scientific controversy over the alleged discovery of certain plants on Rùm by botanist John William Heslop-Harrison—discoveries that are now considered to be fraudulent. Heslop Harrison is <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> have placed many of these plants on the island himself to provide evidence for his theory about the geological development of the Hebridean islands. Nonetheless, the native flora offers much of interest. There are rare arctic sandwort and alpine pennycress, endemic varieties of the heath spotted-orchid and eyebright, as well as more common species such as sundew, butterwort, blue heath milkwort and roseroot. A total of 590 higher plant and fern taxa have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|In 1931–32, Fingleton capitalised on {{illnesses}} to teammates to gain {{a regular}} position for New South Wales and then make his debut for Australia. He secured {{a position in the}} state team after Archie Jackson developed terminal tuberculosis and made 93 and 117 in his first two innings for the season, his highest scores to that point. He was then called into the Test squad and made his debut in the Fifth and final Test of the season against South Africa after Bill Ponsford fell ill. On a pitch rendered hostile by rain, Fingleton made 40 in an innings victory, surpassing the entire aggregate scored by the South Africans in their first innings. The following season, Fingleton enhanced his reputation for defiance in difficult conditions by scoring an unbeaten century against the Bodyline attack in a tour match despite suffering multiple bruises, and compiling 83 in the low-scoring Second Test, Australian's only Test win of the series. However, he made a pair in the next Test and the controversy over England's bowling peaked with the leaking of Woodfull's admonishment of Warner over England's tactics. At the time, Fingleton was <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> be responsible for the leak, although he always denied it and blamed Bradman. Over time, Fingleton's view has become more widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{air raids}} on Singapore raised {{the morale of}} the island's {{civilian}} population. They were seen as heralding Singapore's liberation from Japan's oppressive rule, though civilians were generally careful to hide this belief from Japanese occupation personnel. The B-29s were <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> be invulnerable, and civilians were cheered by their apparent ability to attack the Japanese at will. In an attempt to counter this view, the occupation authorities exhibited wreckage from downed B-29s and surviving crew members as well as film footage of a Superfortress being shot down. This propaganda campaign was not successful. The Japanese also failed in their attempts to rouse Singapore's Muslim population against the raids by highlighting damage suffered by a mosque on 11January and 24February, the latter a raid which coincided with the celebration of Muhammad's birthday. Another factor which contributed to public support for the raids was that the policy of targeting military installations meant that {{only a limited number of}} civilians became casualties, and the American bombing came to be seen as highly accurate. The expectation of further attacks caused the prices of food and other commodities to rise, however, as people stockpiled necessities; Japanese attempts to stop this hoarding and profiteering were not successful.|$|E

25|$|Adi Shankara is also widely {{credited}} with commentaries on other scriptural works, {{such as the}} Vishnu sahasranāma and the Sānatsujātiya, but both these are considered apocryphal by scholars who have expressed doubts. Hastamalakiya-bhasya is also <b>widely</b> <b>believed</b> in India <b>to</b> be Shankara's work and it is included in Samata-edition of Shankara's works, but some scholars consider {{it to be the}} work of Shankara's student.|$|R
50|$|Even {{before the}} Second World War began in September 1939, the British {{government}} had {{prepared for the}} evacuation of over a million vulnerable people, mainly children, from the towns and cities to safe areas in the countryside away from the risk of enemy bombing.
