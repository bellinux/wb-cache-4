5|$|The {{three main}} {{islands of the}} Monach Islands (Heisgeir), Ceann Iar, Ceann Ear and Shivinish are {{connected}} at low tides. It is said {{that at one time}} it was also possible to walk all the way to Baleshare, and on to North Uist, five miles away at low tide. In the 16th century, a large tidal wave was said to have <b>washed</b> <b>the</b> route away.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of uplift and erosion was {{concurrent}} with and followed the above events, creating a major unconformity. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in Colorado and are now famous for their dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age volcanic rock around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that <b>washed</b> <b>the</b> sediment into the Cretaceous Seaway that longitudinally divided North America to the east.|$|E
5|$|Early on September14, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} to a tropical depression. It weakened slowly while moving northeastward across the Deep South, before dissipating near Athens, Georgia on September15. Operationally, {{it was considered}} the third tropical cyclone of the season. A telegraph from the Weather Bureau headquarters in Washington, D.C. warned vessels to remain in port for portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Strong gales were experienced along the coast from eastern Louisiana to western Florida and severely disrupted telegraph services in the region. The remnants brought heavy rains from Virginia to New England. Rough seas {{along the coast of}} New Jersey <b>washed</b> <b>the</b> schooner Willie ashore.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{practice}} of <b>washing</b> <b>the</b> wool {{rather than the}} sheep evolved {{from the fact that}} hotter water could be used to <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> wool, than that used to <b>wash</b> <b>the</b> sheep.

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} led {{to moderate}} to severe inland flooding, with high waters reported along U.S. Route 460 in Prince George County, U.S. Route 17, and several other roads. The rainfall led to river flooding, including minor to moderate flooding along the Rivanna and James Rivers, moderate flooding along the Appomattox River, and moderate to major flooding along the Meherrin, Nottoway, and Blackwater Rivers. In Isle of Wight County, a driver attempted to cross high water on the James River Bridge and was killed when the water <b>washed</b> <b>the</b> car off of the road.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was known}} for his public demonstrations of piety, and appears to have been {{genuinely}} devout. He promoted rich, luxurious Church services, and, unusually for the period, attended mass at least once a day. He gave generously to religious causes, paid for the feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans. He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have <b>washed</b> <b>the</b> feet of lepers. Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, particularly to the abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E
5|$|The restorers <b>washed</b> <b>the</b> {{surfaces}} using {{a variety}} of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of calcium carbonate were treated by the application of a solution of dimethylformamide. The final step was the application of a weak solution of acrylic polymer to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.|$|E

25|$|The {{city was}} built {{as the new}} capital of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, {{dedicated}} to his new religion of worship to the Aten. Construction started in or around Year 5 of his reign (1346 BC) and was probably completed by Year 9 (1341 BC), although it became the capital city two years earlier. To speed up construction of the city most of the buildings were constructed out of mud-brick, and white <b>washed.</b> <b>The</b> most important buildings were faced with local stone.|$|E

25|$|The girl's broken feet {{required}} {{a great deal}} of care and attention, and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the feet were unbound, they were <b>washed,</b> <b>the</b> toes carefully checked for injury, and the nails carefully and meticulously trimmed. When unbound, the broken feet were also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl's feet were often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The feet were also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off.|$|E
25|$|The {{find was}} taken to the farm where Maggie (later Mrs Nicholl) <b>washed</b> <b>the</b> items in a sink. At that time they did not realise they were made from gold. The hoard was {{eventually}} sold to the British Museum for six hundred pounds. It consisted of a miniature ship, complete with fittings and oars; two necklets, a bowl and a torc (or hollow collar). The find was described as a lump of mud when initially shown. Moreover, the boat had been so badly damaged by the plough that it took a goldsmith to later work out its structure.|$|E
25|$|One other {{significance}} of the Clallam disaster may be that when the Princess Sophia went aground in October 1918, in Lynn Canal, her captain, undoubtedly familiar with the Clallam sinking, refused to put the passengers into the boats, even though rescue vessels were at hand, due to the bad sea conditions which it must have seemed to him would make evacuation of the stranded vessel a greater danger than remaining on board. This {{proved to be a}} fatal misjudgment in the Princess Sophiaâ€™s case, as the sea and wind came up during the night, <b>washed</b> <b>the</b> Sophia off the rocks, and drowned all aboard.|$|E

25|$|The club's colors {{at first}} were not cream. They {{started out with}} a white kit which had the badge on the chest.

However, when the club received the jerseys, they found that they were no longer white, but yellow. The laundry workers had forgotten to remove the badges from the jerseys and consequently the red color from the badges mixed with the white jerseys giving it a yellow tint. The club {{had no choice but to}} use the jersey to play. They managed to win that game and a few others as well and thus the club kept the new-colored kit as a good-luck charm.|$|E
25|$|Nerthus is {{revered by}} Reudignians, Aviones, Angles, Varinians, Eudoses, Suardones and Nuithones. Nerthus is {{believed}} to directly interpose in human affairs. Her sanctuary is on an island, specifically in a wood called Castum. A chariot covered with a curtain {{is dedicated to the}} goddess, and only the high priest may touch it. The priest is capable of seeing the goddess enter the chariot. Drawn by cows, the chariot travels through the countryside, and wherever the goddess visits, a great feast is held. During the travel of the goddess, the Germanic tribes cease all hostilities, and do not lay their hands upon arms. When the priest declares that the goddess is tired of conversation with mortals, the chariot returns and is washed, together with the curtains, in a secret lake. The goddess is also <b>washed.</b> <b>The</b> slaves who administer this purification are afterwards thrown into the lake.|$|E
25|$|The final {{qualifier}} of the knockout {{stage was}} contested by the Sylhet Royals and Chittagong Kings. Royals lost to Gladiators in the Race to the Final while Kings beat Duronto in the Eliminator Final {{to keep their}} hopes alive. The match was originally scheduled to play at 17 February 2016. But rain <b>washed</b> <b>the</b> game out and the game was decided {{to play on the}} next day which was also the rest day. Chittagong skipper Mahmudullah won the toss of the semifinal and asked Royals to bat first. Royals scored 149 for 7 wickets in 20 overs. Elton Chigumbura scored the highest score of unbeaten 42 while skipper Rahim scored 36. Their partnership of 58 in the fifth wicket helped Kings to post 149 on board. Enamul Haque jnr. and Kevon Cooper took two wickets each for Kings. Kings' start for the chase of 150 wasn't good as 2 wickets fallen just for 4 runs. But later on score of 44 and 33 from Ryan ten Doeschate and Nurul Hasan respectively helped Kings to chase down the target with three wickets in hand and five balls to spare. As a result of this match Royals were eliminated from the tournament and Kings joined Glaidiators in the Final.|$|E
