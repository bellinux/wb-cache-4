500|$|The post-hardcore {{sound of}} Box Car Racer {{inspired}} {{the change in}} tone and experimental nature the band approached Blink-182 with. Hoppus described his desire for the album to experiment with different arrangements in a 2002 interview: [...] "Before, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> guitar sound that we changed a little bit through the record. This time {{we want to try}} a whole different setup for each song." [...] Hoppus recalled that Barker entered the production process by urging the band to [...] " [...] as the next Blink-182 record — {{think of it as the}} first Blink-182 record." [...] The members were also inspired after hearing [...] by Bad Astronaut and its expansive sound. [...] "Once the door was opened by Tom and Travis with Box Car Racer, Mark started to be more on board with that concept. He was also more flexible and the next Blink album was able to be a pretty big departure from the previous two", said assistant engineer Sam Boukas. [...] "Box Car Racer opened the door in that sense and I think the three of them wanted to be more creative and have more creative liberty on that next album." ...|$|E

[...] he answered, and {{he smiled}} at the {{challenge}} from the somewhat lonely elevation which he knew the thoughts of his neighbors kept, aloof from the sordid levels of politics and business. [...] "Why, Nancy, haven't <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>one,</b> right here in Leatherwood?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, that's certain. But these fellows {{have done}} it to me again and again. I shouldn't wonder if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> to-night in the very same way. I'm sure, {{by the look of}} these rascals, that they would do {{anything}} of a reckless, stupid nature just now." ...|$|E

"Ah! {{you come}} of a masterful race," [...] said Jasper, {{shaking his head}} gravely, [...] "you're never content when ye've got enough, but must always be killing God's creatures right and left for pure sport. Haven't <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> grey goose already for supper, an' that's enough for two men surely. Of course I make no account o' the artist, poor cratur', for he eats next to nothin'. Hows'ever, as your {{appetite}} may be sharper set than usual, I've no objection to bring down another for ye." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{called to}} that man--HE had his wits about him--I {{called to him}} to come and speak to me. It would be {{a quarter of an}} hour at least before the town engine could reach us. The horror of {{remaining}} inactive all that time was more than I could face. In defiance of my own reason I persuaded myself that the doomed and lost wretch in the vestry might still be lying senseless on the floor, might not be dead yet. If we broke open the door, might we save him? I knew the strength of the heavy lock--I knew the thickness of the nailed oak--I knew the hopelessness of assailing the one and the other by ordinary means. But surely there were beams still left in the dismantled cottages near the church? What if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>one,</b> and used it as a battering-ram against the door? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stayin' {{power is}} what we want, doctor!" [...] exclaimed Uncle Beamish. [...] "Where would your fast trotter be in drifts like these, I'd like to know? <b>We</b> <b>got</b> the right horse when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> this <b>one,</b> but I wish we had been goin' this fast all the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he resumed, [...] "I {{crept up}} and seized the fellow by the leg. He dropped his rifle, and Carnally slipped away. We'd {{arranged}} that if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> out <b>one</b> {{was not to}} stop for the other." ...|$|R

60|$|We {{found one}} homely inn with two small bedrooms, kept by a kindly Basque woman. I {{got him to}} bed, and that night shared his room, and after {{an hour or so}} of sleep he woke up in a raging fever and with a {{wandering}} mind, cursing Neal and repeating long, inaccurate lists of figures. He was manifestly a case for a doctor, and in the morning <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> in. He was a young man from Montpelier, just beginning to practise, and very mysterious and technical and modern and unhelpful. He spoke of cold and exposure, and la grippe and pneumonia. He gave many explicit and difficult directions.... I perceived it devolved upon me to organise nursing and a sick-room. I installed a religieuse in the second bedroom of the inn, and took a room for myself in the inn of Port de Luzon, {{a quarter of a mile}} away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> {{and they}} got one. 'Bout three months ago my cousin Bud, {{fourteen}} year old, was riding through the woods on t'other side of the river, and didn't have no weapon with him, which was blame' foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin' after him with his {{gun in his hand}} and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and 'stead of jumping off and taking to the brush, Bud 'lowed he could out-run him; so they had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud seen it warn't any use, so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old man he rode up and shot him down. But he didn't git much chance to enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid HIM out." ...|$|E
60|$|ALL CHILDREN have nicknames, {{and we had}} ours. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> apiece early, {{and they}} stuck to us; but Joan was richer in this matter, for, as time went on, she earned a second, and then a third, and so on, and we gave them to her. First and last she had {{as many as half}} a dozen. Several of these she never lost. Peasant-girls are bashful naturally; but she surpassed the rule so far, and colored so easily, and was so easily embarrassed in the {{presence}} of strangers, that we nicknamed her the Bashful. We were all patriots, but she was called the Patriot, because our warmest feeling for our country was cold beside hers. Also she was called the Beautiful; and this was not merely because of the extraordinary beauty of her face and form, but because of the loveliness of her character. These names she kept, and one otherthe Brave.|$|E

6000|$|... "Son, {{it happens}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the wrong <b>one.</b> Our {{long-haired}} pard hyar--Mister Riggs--him {{with the big}} gun--he waltzes up with this sassy kid instead of the woman Beasley wanted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Milton and Allardyce both {{thought he}} {{deserved}} it. If he'd been playing instead of Rand-Brown, they wouldn't have scored at all probably, and <b>we</b> should have <b>got</b> <b>one</b> more try." ...|$|R
60|$|From {{this point}} we began to descend toward the Bulkley, {{which is the most}} easterly fork of the Skeena. Soon after {{starting}} on our downward path we came to a fork in the trail. One trail, newly blazed, led to the right and seemed {{to be the one to}} take. We started upon it, but found it dangerously muddy, and so returned to the main trail which seemed to be more numerously travelled. Afterward we wished we had taken the other, for <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> of our horses into the quicksand and worked for more than three hours in the attempt to get him out. A horse is a strange animal. He is counted intelligent, and so he is if he happens to be a bronco or a mule. But in proportion as he is a thoroughbred, he seems to lose power to take care of himself--loses heart. Our Ewe-neck bay had a trace of racer in him, and being weakened by poor food, it was his bad luck to slip over the bank into a quicksand creek. Having found himself helpless he instantly gave up heart and lay out with a piteous expression of resignation in his big brown eyes. We tugged and lifted and rolled him around from one position to another, each more dangerous than the first, all to no result.|$|E
60|$|It is {{scarcely}} necessary to add, that we English and Americans soon repented of the step we had taken. I heartily wished myself {{on board the}} Hope, again, and the master's prophecy became true, much sooner, perhaps, than he had himself anticipated. This time, I conceive that my disgust was fully justified; though I deserved the punishment I was receiving, for entering so blindly into a service every way so inferior to that to which I properly belonged. The bread in this ship was wholesome, I do suppose, but it was nearly black, and such as I was altogether unused to. Inferior as it was, we got but five pounds, each, per week. In our navy, a man gets, per week, seven pounds of such bread as might be put on a gentleman's table. The meat was little better than the bread in quality, and quite as scant in quantity. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> good dish in the Stadtdeel, and that we got every morning. It was a dish of boiled barley, of which I became very fond, and which, indeed, supplied me with the strength necessary for my duty. It {{was one of the}} best dishes I ever fell in with at sea; and I think it might be introduced, to advantage, in our service. Good food produces good work.|$|E
60|$|Twice {{we stopped}} {{to fix the}} {{machinery}} and laid a good while, once in the night; but it wasn't dark enough, and he was afeard to skip. But the third time we had to fix it there was a better chance. We laid up at a country woodyard about forty mile above Uncle Silas's place a little after one at night, and it was thickening up and going to storm. So Jake he laid {{for a chance to}} slide. We begun to take in wood. Pretty soon the rain come a-drenching down, and the wind blowed hard. Of course every boat-hand fixed a gunny sack and put it on like a bonnet, the way they do when they are toting wood, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> for Jake, and he slipped down aft with his hand-bag and come tramping forrard just like the rest, and walked ashore with them, and when we see him pass out of the light of the torch-basket and get swallowed up in the dark, we got our breath again and just felt grateful and splendid. But it wasn't for long. Somebody told, I reckon; for in about eight or ten minutes them two pals come tearing forrard as tight as they could jump and darted ashore and was gone. We waited plumb till dawn for them to come back, and kept hoping they would, but they never did. We was awful sorry and low-spirited. All the hope we had was that Jake had got such a start that they couldn't get on his track, and he would get to his brother's and hide there and be safe.|$|E

6000|$|... "Look at that--though {{you ought}} {{to see it in}} summer. Not an inch wasted. Where <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> thin crop, they get four fat crops. An' look at the way they crowd it--currants between the tree rows, beans between the currant rows, a row of beans close {{on each side of the}} trees, an' rows of beans along the ends of the tree rows. Why, Silva wouldn't sell these five acres for five hundred an acre cash down. He gave {{grandfather}} fifty an acre for it on long time, an' here am I, workin' for the telephone company an' putting' in a telephone for old Silva's cousin from the Azores that can't speak American yet. Horse-beans along the road--say, when Silva swung that trick he made more outa fattenin' hogs with 'em than grandfather made with all his farmin'. Grandfather stuck up his nose at horse-beans. He died with it stuck up, an' with more mortgages on the land he had left than you could shake a stick at. Plantin' tomatoes wrapped up in wrappin' paper--ever heard of that? Father snorted when he first seen the Porchugeeze doin' it. An' he went on snortin'. Just the same they got bumper crops, an' father's house-patch of tomatoes was eaten by the black beetles. We ain't got the sabe, or the knack, or something or other. Just look at this piece of ground--four crops a year, an' every inch of soil workin' over time. Why, back in town there, there's single acres that earns more than fifty of ours in the old days. The Porchugeeze is natural-born farmers, that's all, an' we don't know nothin' about farmin' an' never did." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{expedition}} under {{command of}} Brevet Major-General Wilson, consisting of twelve thousand five hundred mounted men, was delayed by rains until March 22d, when it moved from Chickasaw, Alabama. On the 1st of April, General Wilson encountered {{the enemy in}} force under Forrest near Ebenezer Church, drove him in confusion, captured three hundred prisoners and three guns, and destroyed the central bridge over the Cahawba River. On the 2d he attacked and captured the fortified city of Selma, defended by Forrest, with seven thousand men and thirty-two guns, destroyed the arsenal, armory, naval foundry, machine-shops, vast quantities of stores, and captured three thousand prisoners. On the 4th he captured and destroyed Tuscaloosa. On the 10th he crossed the Alabama River, and after sending information of his operations to General Canby, marched on Montgomery, which place he occupied on the 14th, the enemy having abandoned it. At this place many stores and five steamboats fell into our hands. Thence a force marched direct on Columbus, and another on West Point, both of which places were assaulted and captured on the 16th. At the former place <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> thousand five hundred prisoners and fifty-two field-guns, destroyed two gunboats, the navy yard, foundries, arsenal, many factories, and much other public property. At the latter place we got three hundred prisoners, four guns, and destroyed nineteen locomotives and three hundred cars. On the 20th he took possession of Macon, Georgia, with sixty field-guns, one thousand two hundred militia, and five generals, surrendered by General Howell Cobb. General Wilson, hearing that Jeff. Davis {{was trying to make}} his escape, sent forces in pursuit and succeeded in capturing him on the morning of May 11th.|$|E
6000|$|As they breakfasted {{they talked}} matters over. Harry {{said that he}} was certain that the {{thickness}} of the stone was not sufficient for them to break it up by blasting. [...] "We shall have to try some other plan. It is equally certain that we cannot smash the stone with the sledge-hammers, and I don't think that the wedges would break it. Of course if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>one</b> stone out it would be comparatively easy to lift the next, as we could put the crowbars under it. If we can do it in no other way, we must drill a line of holes close to each other right across the stone, and we might then break off the piece between them and the crack and get our crowbars under the slab. It might be worth while to drill holes a foot apart, from the point where we have begun {{to the other end of}} the room. Of course if we found that gravel and stones were everywhere under the slabs we should learn nothing; but the opening to the chambers is probably covered by another stone, and if we found that, we could put in one or two more holes so as to be sure that it was flat, in which case we might smash it somehow. Of course, if we don't come upon a flat stone we shall conclude that they put a layer of sand and fine gravel over the slabs covering the vaults, and must then, as I say, get up one stone and gradually lift all the rest, clearing out the gravel as we go to the depth of a foot or so. In that way we shall make sure that we shall not miss any chamber there may be.|$|E
