Consistent with principles of procedural fairness, we find that the way in which control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> — in particular whether control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> symmetrically on both principals and agents and whether both parties have a say in whether control <b>is</b> <b>imposed</b> — affects how agents respond to control.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Saladin's reign as sultan in Egypt, upon the encouragement of his adviser, Qadi al-Fadil, Christians were prohibited from employment in the fiscal administration, but various Ayyubid emirs continued to allow Christians to serve in their posts. A number of other regulations <b>were</b> <b>imposed,</b> including the bans on alcohol consumption, religious processions, and the ringing of church bells. Conversion of formerly high-ranking Christians and their families to Islam took place throughout the early period of Ayyubid rule. According to historian Yaakov Lev, the persecution of non-Muslims had some permanent effects on them, but nonetheless, the effects were local and contained. To manage Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids permitted Europeans—mainly Italians, but also French and Catalans—to settle in Alexandria in large numbers. However, {{in the aftermath of}} the Fifth Crusade, 3,000 merchants from the area were arrested or expelled.|$|E
