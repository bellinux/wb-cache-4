"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] {{began as}} two {{different}} demos, one variously called [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] and [...] "69" [...] (which eventually {{evolved into the}} B-side [...] "Lady with the Spinning Head") and an alternately arranged demo called [...] "Light My Way". Over {{the course of the}} recording sessions, U2 added various overdubs to the song, but producer Brian Eno believed these additions negatively impacted the track. Eno aided the group in editing down the song, and he explained his assistance as such: [...] "I'd go in and say, 'The song has gone, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> liked about this song is not there anymore. Sometimes, for example, the song would have disappeared under layers of overdubs." ...|$|E
500|$|Keenan and Jones {{met through}} {{a mutual friend}} in 1989. After Keenan played a tape {{recording}} for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band. They started jamming together and were {{on the lookout for}} a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing in their sessions because he [...] "felt kinda sorry for them," [...] as other invited musicians were not showing up. Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour. Early on, the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the pseudophilosophy [...] "lachrymology". Although [...] "lachrymology" [...] was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions differently: [...] "Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> need to find out, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve." ...|$|E
500|$|Weisman's science journalism style uses {{interviews}} with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, {{while maintaining the}} [...] "cool and dispassionate ...of a scientific observer rather than an activist". Weisman said he purposely avoided the activist label: [...] "Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already agree with them. It's nice to get some affirmation for <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but I wanted to write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it." [...] Richard Fortey compares the book to the works of Jared Diamond, Tim Flannery and E.O. Wilson, and writes that The World Without Us [...] "narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity". Mark Lynas in the New Statesman noted that [...] "whereas most environmental books sag {{under the weight of}} their accumulated bad news, The World Without Us seems refreshingly positive". Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying [...] "if the planet can recover from the Permian, it can recover from the human".|$|E

I hope you didn't {{find what you}} wanted not to find, or get off at the station where there wasn't any, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>you</b> {{expected}} wouldn't happen to you during the three years you've been away." ...|$|R

2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Dublin in 1991 to record at the [...] "Elsinore" [...] mansion on the Dalkey coastline. [...] The band {{continued to work}} on the song there, adding various overdubs, but not finding a mix they were satisfied with. [...] The Edge thought that they had the foundation for the song, but that it needed [...] "foreground". [...] Eno interceded, explaining to the group that [...] "One" [...] was among the sessions' tracks in which [...] "The song has gone, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> liked about this song is not there anymore", and that the track had [...] "disappeared under layers of overdubs". He created his own mix, which gave the band a better idea of an arrangement they liked. [...] Eno wanted the band to remove the melancholy elements of the song and persuaded them to remove the acoustic guitar from the song. He also worked with Lanois and the Edge to [...] "undermine the 'too beautiful' feeling", which is why they added the [...] "crying guitar parts that have an aggression to them".|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, The Exorcists {{critical}} reputation {{has grown}} considerably. The film currently has an 87% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, based on 67 reviews the website collected. Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel {{placed it in}} the top five films released that year. BBC film critic Mark Kermode believes the film to be the best film ever made saying [...] "There's a theory that great films give back to you <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> bring to them. It's absolutely true with The Exorcist—it reflects the anxieties of the audience. Some people think it's an outright horror-fest, but I don't. It was written by a devout Catholic who hoped it would make people think positively about the existence of God. William Peter Blatty, who wrote the book, thought that if there are demons then there are also angels and life after death. He couldn't see why people thought it was scary. I've seen it about 200 times and every time I see something I haven't seen before." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Go back in {{the house}} and lie down, Granny," [...] said he kindly. [...] "I am going to get something, and <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> may <b>be</b> <b>you</b> shall have your share."

5000|$|The Friends EP by {{the band}} Ween was {{released}} on CD June 19, 2007 and was set to be released on 12" [...] in July 2007.
