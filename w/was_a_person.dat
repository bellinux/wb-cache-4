5|$|John Baldwin <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> whose views {{seemed to}} {{run counter to}} the {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although he was not an abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender. His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> within the meaning of the statute.|$|E

However, past critics had also argued that Sultan Iskandar <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> with a turbulent temper. These claims were made by citing records of past notorious incidents, which include an experience of being disinherited from being the Tunku Mahkota of Johor (or Crown Prince in English) by his father, in 1961, as well as a series of alleged criminal acts occurring between the 1970s and the 1990s which were published in the press and provoked widespread moral outrage within the Malaysian public.|$|E

Crossing sweepers also found their way into 19th-century fiction and artwork, including a novel by Charles Dickens and a popular painting by William Powell Frith.|$|E

25|$|Authorities {{are divided}} on whether Rabbi {{recorded}} the Mishnah in writing or established {{it as an}} oral text for memorisation. The most important early account of its composition, the Iggeret Rav Sherira Gaon (Epistle of Rabbi Sherira Gaon) is ambiguous on the point, although the Spanish recension leans to {{the theory that the}} Mishnah was written. However, the Talmud records that, in every study session, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> called the tanna appointed to recite the Mishnah passage under discussion. This may indicate that, even if the Mishnah was reduced to writing, it was not available on general distribution.|$|E
