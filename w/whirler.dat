50|$|Damaged or {{abnormal}} stereocilia {{that are}} a result of genetic mutations often cause hearing loss and other complications, and can be passed down to children. In a recent study, researchers studied mice that inherited a mutated hair cell gene called whirlin, which leads to shorter and fatter stereocilia that are organized in additional rows and that often die off after birth. No current therapies or reparative measures exist to replace such defective hair cells in humans. In order to correct this mutation, researchers injected a gene therapy containing the corrected gene into the inner ear of mice with the genetic mutation. The therapy restored stereocilia to normal lengths and eliminated the additional rows of stereocilia in newborn <b>whirler</b> mice. Despite the restoration of hair cells, the treated <b>whirler</b> mice exhibited no signs of improved hearing ability following testing after one month and after three months of treatment. Further studies are looking to understand why the restoration of the stereocilia did not improve the hearing ability of the mutated mice.|$|E

It was his only hit; one of the follow-up singles was the sonically similar [...] "Let's Do the Boston Monkey", recorded for Enjoy Records.|$|R
60|$|The whole {{expanse of}} the Downs escarpment, {{so far as the}} grey haze {{permitted}} him to see, was set with wind-wheels to which the largest of the city was but a younger brother. They stirred with a stately motion before the south-west wind. And here and there were patches dotted with the sheep of the British Food Trust, and here and there a mounted shepherd made a spot of black. Then rushing under the stern of the aeropile came the Wealden Heights, the line of Hindhead, Pitch Hill, and Leith Hill, with a second row of wind-wheels that seemed striving to rob the downland <b>whirlers</b> of their share of breeze. The purple heather was speckled with yellow gorse, and on the further side a drove of black oxen stampeded before a couple of mounted men. Swiftly these swept behind, and dwindled and lost colour, and became scarce moving specks that were swallowed up in haze.|$|R

40|$|Stereocilia, finger-like {{projections}} {{forming the}} hair bundle on the apical surface of sensory hair {{cells in the}} cochlea, are responsible for mechanosensation and ulti-mately the perception of sound. The actin cytoskeleton of the stereocilia contains hundreds of tightly cross-linked parallel actin filaments in a paracrystalline array and it is vital for their function. Although several genes have been identified and associated with stereocilia development, the molecular mechanisms responsible for stereocilia growth, maintenance and organisation of the hair bundle have not been fully resolved. Here we provide further characterisation of the stereocilia of the <b>whirler</b> mouse mutant. We found {{that a lack of}} whirlin protein in <b>whirler</b> mutants results in short stereocilia with larger diameters without a corresponding {{increase in the number of}} actin filaments in inner hair cells. However, a decrease in the actin filament packing density was evident in the <b>whirler</b> mutant. The elec-tron-density at the tip of each stereocilium was markedly patchy and irregular in the <b>whirler</b> mutants compared with a uniform band in controls. The outer hair cell stereocilia of the <b>whirler</b> homozygote also showed an increase in diameter and variable heights within bundles. The number of outer hair cell stereocilia was sig-nificantly reduced and the centre-to-centre spacing between the stereocilia was greater than in the wildtype. Our findings suggest that whirlin plays an important role in actin filament packing and dynamics during postnatal stereocilium elonga...|$|E
6000|$|In New Zealand {36a} 'the natives {{regarded}} the wind {{as an indication}} of the presence of their god,' a superstition not peculiar to Maori religion. The 'cold wind' felt blowing over the hands at spiritualistic seances is also regarded (by psychical researchers) {{as an indication of}} the presence of supernatural beings. The windy roaring noise made by the bull-roarer might readily be considered by savages, either as an invitation to a god who should present himself in storm, or as a proof of his being at hand. We have seen that this view was actually taken by an Australian woman. The hymn called 'breath,' or haha, a hymn to the mystic wind, is pronounced by Maori priests at the moment of the initiation of young men in the tribal mysteries. It is a mere conjecture, and possibly enough capable of disproof, but we have a suspicion that the use of the mystica vannus Iacchi was a mode of raising a sacred wind analogous to that employed by <b>whirlers</b> of the turndun. {36b} ...|$|R
40|$|Part of topic : Ambiances and territories in transformationInternational audienceAtmosphere {{refers to}} an impalpable {{condition}} with the capacity to influence our feelings. Making an urban atmosphere means creating an impalpable condition through the execution {{of a series of}} specific operations: spatial, geometrical, sound acoustic, and climatic. This operation signifies the transformation of the qualitative into the quantitative, the non-measurable into the measurable, and the intangible into the tangible. This paper discusses the Combinatorial Architecture methodology, which was developed by the author as a proposal for a methodological model for architectural design. The methodology was developed in the research Lab Non-Linear Solutions Unit at the GSAPP Columbia University, consisting in the manipulation of attributes and building blocks to determine quantitative and qualitative parameters of a public space. Recent case studies explore two different ways in which Combinatorial Architecture can transform public spaces: The first case study, Instant Installation, First Street Green Park, commissioned by the City of New York, shows how the combinatorial methodology can be used to develop multiple configurations and transform the ambiance of an existing urban setting. The second case study, the wind turbine park the <b>Whirlers,</b> presented in 2014 at the RENFORUS Conference at UNESCO, shows how the Combinatorial Architecture methodology can be used to develop unprecedented forms of public spaces connecting renewable energies and urban life...|$|R
40|$|Hearing in mammals {{depends upon}} the proper {{development}} of actin-filled stereocilia at the hair cell surface in the inner ear. Whirlin, a PDZ domain-containing protein, is expressed at stereocilia tips and, by virtue of mutations in the whirlin gene, is known to {{play a key role}} in stereocilia development. We show that whirlin interacts with the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein, erythrocyte protein p 55 (p 55). p 55 is expressed in outer hair cells in long stereocilia that make up the stereocilia bundle as well as surrounding shorter stereocilia structures. p 55 interacts with protein 4. 1 R in erythrocytes, and we find that 4. 1 R is also expressed in stereocilia structures with an identical pattern to p 55. Mutations in the whirlin gene (<b>whirler)</b> and in the myosin XVa gene (shaker 2) affect stereocilia development and lead to early ablation of p 55 and 4. 1 R labeling of stereocilia. The related MAGUK protein Ca 2 +-calmodulin serine kinase (CASK) is also expressed in stereocilia in both outer and inner hair cells, where it is confined to the stereocilia bundle. CASK interacts with protein 4. 1 N in neuronal tissue, and we find that 4. 1 N is expressed in stereocilia with an identical pattern to CASK. Unlike p 55, CASK labeling shows little diminution of labeling in the <b>whirler</b> mutant and is unaffected in the shaker 2 mutant. Similarly, expression of 4. 1 N in stereocilia is unaltered in <b>whirler</b> and shaker 2 mutants. p 55 and protein 4. 1 R form complexes critical for actin cytoskeletal assembly in erythrocytes, and the interaction of whirlin with p 55 indicates it plays a similar role in hair cell stereocilia...|$|E
40|$|In {{hair cells}} of all vertebrates, a mechanosensory bundle is formed by stereocilia with {{precisely}} graded heights. Unconventional myosin-XVa {{is critical for}} formation of this bundle because it transports whirlin and perhaps other molecular components responsible for programmed elongation of stereocilia to the stereocilia tips. A tip of a stereocilium {{is the site of}} stereocilia growth and one of the proposed sites of mechano-electrical transduction. In adult shaker 2 mice, a mutation that disables the motor function of myosin-XVa results in profound deafness and abnormally short stereocilia that lack stereocilia links, an indispensable component of mechanotransduction machinery. Therefore, it was assumed that myosin-XVa is required for proper formation of the mechanotransduction apparatus. Here we show that in young postnatal shaker 2 mice, abnormally short stereocilia bundles of auditory hair cells have numerous stereocilia links and ‘wild type’ mechano-electrical transduction. We compared the mechanotransduction current in auditory hair cells of young normal-hearing littermates, myosin-XVa-deficient shaker 2 mice, and <b>whirler</b> mice that have similarly short stereocilia but intact myosin-XVa at the stereocilia tips. This comparison revealed that the absence of functional myosin-XVa does not disrupt adaptation of the mechanotransduction current during sustained bundle deflection. Thus, the hair cell mechanotransduction complex forms and functions independently from myosin-XVa-based hair bundle morphogenesis...|$|E
40|$|MYOSIN XV is a motor {{protein that}} {{interacts with the}} PDZ domain-containing protein WHIRLIN and {{transports}} WHIRLIN to {{the tips of the}} stereocilia. Shaker 2 (sh 2) mice have a mutation in the motor domain of MYOSIN XV and exhibit congenital deafness and circling behavior, probably because of abnormally short stereocilia. <b>Whirler</b> (wi) mice have a similar phenotype caused by a deletion in the third PDZ domain of WHIRLIN. We compared the morphology of Whrnwi/wi and Myo 15 sh 2 /sh 2 sensory hair cells and found that Myo 15 sh 2 /sh 2 have more frequent pathology at the base of inner hair cells than Whrnwi/wi, and shorter outer hair cell stereocilia. Considering the functional and morphologic similarities in the phenotypes caused by mutations in Myo 15 and Whrn, and the physical interaction between their encoded proteins, we used a genetic approach to test for functional overlap. Double heterozygotes (Myo 15 sh 2 /+, Whrnwi/+) have normal hearing and no increase in hearing loss compared to normal littermates. Single and double mutants (Myo 15 sh 2 /sh 2, Whrnwi/wi) exhibit abnormal persistence of kinocilia and microvilli, and develop abnormal cytoskeletal architecture. Double mutants are also similar to the single mutants in viability, circling behavior, and lack of a Preyer reflex. The morphology of cochlear hair cell stereocilia in double mutants reflects a dominance of the more severe Myo 15 sh 2 /sh 2 phenotype over the Whrnwi/wi phenotype. This suggests that MYOSIN XV may interact with other proteins besides WHIRLIN that are important for hair cell maturation...|$|E
40|$|A {{complex of}} {{proteins}} scaffolded by the PDZ protein, whirlin, reside at the stereocilia tip and {{are critical for}} stereocilia development and elongation. We have shown that in outer hair cells (OHCs) whirlin {{is part of a}} larger complex involving the MAGUK protein, p 55, and protein 4. 1 R. Whirlin interacts with p 55 which is expressed exclusively in outer hair cells (OHC) in both the long stereocilia that make up the stereocilia bundle proper as well as surrounding shorter microvilli that will eventually regress. In erythrocytes, p 55 forms a tripartite complex with protein 4. 1 R and glycophorin C promoting the assembly of actin filaments and the interaction of whirlin with p 55 indicates that it plays a similar role in OHC stereocilia. However, the components directly involved in actin filament regulation in stereocilia are unknown. We have investigated additional components of the whirlin interactome by identifying interacting partners to p 55. We show that the actin capping and severing protein, gelsolin, is a part of the whirlin complex. Gelsolin is detected in OHC where it localizes to the tips of the shorter rows but not to the longest row of stereocilia and the pattern of localisation at the apical hair cell surface is strikingly similar to p 55. Like p 55, gelsolin is ablated in the <b>whirler</b> and shaker 2 mutants. Moreover, in a gelsolin mutant, stereocilia in the apex of the cochlea become long and straggly indicating defects in the regulation of stereocilia elongation. The identification of gelsolin provides for the first time a link between the whirlin scaffolding protein complex involved i...|$|E
40|$|Numerous new {{mutations}} at {{the brown}} (b) locus in mouse chromosome 4 {{have been recovered}} {{over the years in}} germ-cell mutagenesis experiments performed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A large series of radiation- and chemical-induced b mutations known to be chromosomal deletions, and also known to be prenatally lethal when homozygous, were analyzed by pairwise complementation crosses as well as by pseudodominance tests involving flanking loci defined by externally visible phenotypes. These crosses were designed {{to determine the extent of}} each deletion on the genetic and phenotype map of the chromosomal region surrounding the b locus; the crosses also provided basic data that assigned deletions to complementation groups and defined four new loci associated with aberrancies in normal development. Specifically, the pseudodominance tests identified deletions that include the proximally mapping <b>whirler</b> (wi) and the distally mapping depilated (dep) genes, thereby bracketing these loci defined by visible developmental abnormalities with landmarks (deletion breakpoints) that are easily identified on the physical map. Furthermore, the complementation crosses, which were supplemented with additional crosses that allowed determination of the gross time of lethality of selected deletions, defined four new loci required for normal development. Homozygous deletion of one of these loci (b-associated fitness, baf) results in a runting syndrome evident during postnatal development; deletion of one locus [l(4) 2 Rn] causes death in the late gestation/neonatal period; and deletion of either of two loci [l(4) 1 Rn or l(4) 3 Rn] results in embryonic death, most likely in pre-, peri- or postimplantation stages. The placement of these new functionally defined loci on the evolving molecular map of the b region should be useful for continuing the analysis of the roles played in development by genes in this segment of chromosome 4...|$|E
