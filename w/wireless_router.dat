500|$|When an {{interviewer}} in 1988 {{asked about the}} Bulletin Board System jargon in his writing, Gibson answered [...] "I'd never so much as touched a PC when I wrote Neuromancer"; he was familiar, he said, with the science-fiction community, which overlapped with the BBS community. Gibson similarly did not play computer games despite appearing in his stories. He wrote Neuromancer on a 1927 olive-green Hermes portable typewriter, which Gibson described as [...] "the kind of thing Hemingway would have used in the field". By 1988 he used an Apple IIc and AppleWorks to write, with a modem ("I don't really use it for anything"), but until 1996 Gibson {{did not have an}} email address, a lack he explained at the time to have been motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing. His first exposure to a website came while writing Idoru when a web developer built one for Gibson. In 2007 he said, [...] "I have a 2005 PowerBook G4, a gig of memory, <b>wireless</b> <b>router.</b> That's it. I'm anything but an early adopter, generally. In fact, I've never really been very interested in computers themselves. I don't watch them; I watch how people behave around them. That's becoming more difficult to do because everything is 'around them'." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” For army, the {{mobility}} of an entire communi-cation network is desirable. A large mobile communication network inevitably involves a large network of <b>wireless</b> <b>routers.</b> The throughput of a large network of <b>wireless</b> <b>routers</b> critically depends on distributed medium access control (MAC). In this paper, we present a MAC scheme to be called opportunistic synchronous array method (O-SAM). The O-SAM is distributed, locally executable and exploits channel fading opportunistically. We illustrate the throughput of a large network of <b>wireless</b> <b>routers</b> based on the O-SAM in comparison to other variations. I...|$|R

40|$|Low-cost <b>wireless</b> <b>routers</b> are {{changing}} the way people connect to the Internet. They are also very cheap, albeit quite limited, Linux boxes. These attributes make them ideal candidates for <b>wireless</b> mesh <b>routers.</b> In <b>wireless</b> mesh networks, redundant multipath is essential for achieving fast, lossless handoff as mobile devices roam throughout the coverage area. Implementing it in user level on low-cost <b>wireless</b> <b>routers</b> greatly degrades the achievable throughput due to CPU limitations. This paper presents a novel mechanism for redundant multipath routing in kernel space. We show an architecture that integrates this mechanism in a wireless mesh system, resulting in a high-throughput 802. 11 mesh network with fast handoff over low-cost routers. ...|$|R
