Kohlrautz gave Wiesenthal and fellow prisoner Arthur Scheiman passes to go to town, accompanied by a Ukrainian guard, to buy stationery.

5|$|The {{children}} {{were put into}} {{the care of a}} nanny, as was usual in upper-class families at the time. The first nanny was dismissed for insolence and the second for abusing the children. This second woman, anxious to suggest that the children preferred her to anyone else, would pinch Edward and Albert whenever they <b>were</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> presented to their parents so that they would start crying and be speedily returned to her.

5|$|Néstor {{established}} {{a law firm}} that Cristina joined in 1979. The firm worked for banks and financial groups that filed eviction lawsuits, which had a growing rate at the time because the 1050 ruling of the Central Bank had increased the interest rates for mortgage loans. The Kirchners acquired twenty-one land lots at cheap prices as they <b>were</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> auctioned. Their law firm defended military personnel accused of committing crimes during the Dirty War. Forced disappearances were common at the time, but unlike other lawyers the Kirchners never signed a habeas corpus. Julio César Strassera, prosecutor in the 1985 Trial of the Juntas against the military, critizised the Kirchners' lack of legal actions against the military, and considered their later interest in the issue a form of hipocrisy.|$|E
5|$|With the People's Republic of China {{entering}} the Korean War in late 1950, the conflict had {{entered a new}} phase. To prevent North Korea from falling under United Nations (UN) control after the UN landing at Incheon, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) entered Korea and launched a series of surprise attacks against the UN forces near the Sino-Korean border {{at the end of}} 1950. The resulting battles at the Ch'ongch'on River Valley and the Chosin Reservoir forced the UN forces to retreat back to the 38th parallel by December 1950, with Chinese and North Korean forces recapturing much of North Korea. On the Korean western front, after the United States Eighth Army suffered a disastrous defeat at the Ch'ongch'on River, the Eighth Army retreated back to the Imjin River while setting up defensive positions around the South Korean capital of Seoul. Although the US Eighth Army was ordered to hold Seoul for as long as possible, General Douglas MacArthur planned a series of withdrawals to the Pusan Perimeter under the assumption that UN forces <b>were</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overwhelmed in Korea. General Walton Walker, commander of the US Eighth Army, was killed in a traffic accident on December 23, and Lieutenant General Matthew B. Ridgway assumed command of the Eighth Army on December 26, 1950. At the UN, a ceasefire along the 38th parallel was proposed to China on December 11, 1950 in order to avoid any further escalation of hostility between China and the US.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea for}} the railway was first {{proposed}} in February 1958 by then Vice-Premier and Director of the National Planning Commission, Li Fuchun, during an inspection tour of Hainan.

Leaving Brest on 16 December this consisted of 43 sail, 14,450 troops, 41,644 stand of arms, a supply of green cockades and 5,000 uniforms taken from the royalists at Quiberon, which, by an ironic turn of fate, <b>were</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used against the country which had supplied them. General Hédouville remained behind with orders to prepare immediately a reinforcement of 14–15,000 men, a squadron of cavalry and as much artillery as possible.|$|E
25|$|The band {{began to}} fall apart when Þorsteinn Magnússon left. He {{released}} a solo album Líf in 1982, under the name Stanya. The remaining four members continued playing together; however, the band broke up in June 1983. Soon after, a small EP was released through label Gramm, with the title Lunaire, which featured the title song {{as well as two}} other tracks recorded in Copenhagen. In 1992, Þeyr albums <b>were</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reissued by Smekkleysa, but the negotiations were abandoned. However, a CD titled Mjötviður til Fóta was released in 2001. This compilation featured tracks taken from Mjötviður Mær and Iður til Fóta and is currently the only CD released by Þeyr.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a rise in}} sectarian killings {{during the}} truce, which 'officially' lasted until February 1976. Loyalists, fearing they <b>were</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forsaken by the British {{government}} and forced into a united Ireland, increased their attacks on Irish Catholics/nationalists. Loyalists killed 120 Catholics in 1975, the vast majority civilians. They hoped to force the IRA to retaliate and thus end the truce. Some IRA units concentrated on tackling the loyalists. The fall-off of regular operations had caused unruliness within the IRA and some members, with or without permission from higher up, engaged in tit-for-tat killings. Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) members, and current or {{former members of the}} Official IRA, were also involved.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the band}} {{seemed to have}} {{maintained}} their momentum and recovered well from the split of the original lineup, they <b>were</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hit by a serious tragedy. Unknown {{to the rest of}} Level 42, guitarist Alan Murphy was suffering from AIDS, something which he himself may have been aware of before joining the band. At the time, his previous band Go West had been stalled by internal disagreements, and one of Murphy's reasons for joining Level 42 was to ensure that he spent his last days playing the music that he loved. During 1989, Murphy contracted pneumonia: weakened by his existing condition, his decline was rapid and he died on 19 October 1989.|$|E
25|$|The Task Force {{sought the}} {{endorsement}} of both the LDS Church and the BSA. The Church’s General Scouting Committee decided to recommend the Varsity Scouting program “with some reservations”. However, the Presidency of the Young Men grew increasingly uneasy {{and asked for a}} delay in implementation. New materials developed by the Church to support the Aaronic Priesthood Quorums had been developed and <b>were</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released. They felt that a simultaneous introduction of the Varsity Scouting program and the Aaronic Priesthood materials would “muscle the quorum program into the background” and that “the expectations made of the local leaders will become complicated beyond their capacity”. They went on to put forth an alternative plan that did not involve Varsity Scouting.|$|E
25|$|The three INLA men {{rushed through}} the {{turnstile}} leading to A wing's exercise yard. Peeling away a pre-cut section of wire fence, they {{climbed onto the}} roof of A wing and dropped into the forecourt where the Renault van containing Wright had just started to move forward towards the exit gates. The van was ordered to stop by the armed INLA men, however, the driver, John Park, thinking {{that he and the}} other officer <b>were</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken hostage, intended to accelerate through the partially opened gates in a bid to escape. He was prevented from doing so when the gates were automatically shut. The other prison officers stationed at the forecourt gates had spotted the men on the roof, and assuming there was a prison escape in progress, activated the alarm system. The van was ten feet away from the gates when it came to a halt. Neither of the two prison officers inside the van was armed.|$|E

That same year Tłoczyński won singles titles at Bedford, St. Andrews, Carlisle and the covered court tournaments in LLandudno and Torquay. In May 1951 he was victorious in the doubles event of the Sutton Coldfield Hardcourts Tournament partnering Peter Hare. Although his efforts were fruitless in the singles competition as he was subdued in the final against Peter Cawthorn. In October he was {{a finalist for the}} Covered Court Championships of the United Kingdom facing eventual victor Geoffrey Paish. In 1952 he entered the Connaught tournament where he reached the doubles final together with Anthony John Mottram where they were stopped by Cawthorn-Tregonning. Between 1950–1952 he won the Scottish Hard Court Championships three consecutive years. In 1954 he captured the North of England Championship title by defeating Matthew Farhang Mohtadi in three sets although Mohtadi found success in the doubles final against Tłoczyński/Pryor.|$|E
500|$|Border {{communities}} {{on both sides}} suffered acute disruption. Farms, coal mines and even houses were split in two by the sudden closure of the border.

[...] Another 3,000residents, realising that they <b>were</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> expelled from their homes, fled to the West.
