5|$|Adventure was {{conceived}} as a graphical version of the 1977 text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure. It took developer Warren Robinett approximately one year to design and code the game, during which time he had to overcome a variety of technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties <b>with</b> <b>management</b> within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first widely known video game Easter egg, a secret room containing text crediting himself for the game's creation. Robinett's Easter egg became a tradition for future Atari 2600 titles.|$|E

5|$|On 9 October 1941, President Roosevelt {{approved}} the atomic program after he convened {{a meeting with}} Vannevar Bush and Vice President Henry A. Wallace. To control the program, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall. Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy, because the Army had more experience <b>with</b> <b>management</b> of large-scale construction projects. He also agreed to coordinate the effort {{with that of the}} British, and on 11 October he sent a message to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, suggesting that they correspond on atomic matters.|$|E
5|$|Rosenborg had {{originally}} planned to build additional commercial facilities and a tower hotel during the 2002 construction, {{but this was}} canceled. At the 2011 annual meeting, the plans were again launched by Skutle, who stated that construction might start as early as 2011. In March 2005, Rosenborg announced {{plans to build a}} retractable roof over the pitch and lay artificial turf. The roof was estimated to cost NOK100 million, and the club estimated that it could generate NOK30 million per year in increased revenue from concerts and events. By 2007, the roof plans were delayed, <b>with</b> <b>management</b> stating that it would be necessary to complete the construction of all stands before a roof was built, and that they believed the stadium would soon be expanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was also}} positively received; for example, Hendrix from GamePro shared his {{opinion that the}} game did well <b>with</b> <b>management</b> of the games time. Nelson and Hendrix from IGN and GamePro both emphasized their enjoyment of the games action elements. GameSpot, while feeling that the action elements were {{the primary focus of}} the game, still liked the wide variety of role-playing elements present. Nelson from IGN, however, wished that the role-playing elements had been reduced even further in favor of the action parts of the game. All three reviewers compared the game to The Legend of Zelda, such as Mielke from GameSpot who had discussed the game to release as a direct competitor to that series. Both GameSpot and IGN felt that the comparison was invalid, as Musashi focused much more on action than role-playing, resulting in a game that was not a direct competitor at all.|$|E

5|$|In the 2008–09 season, Buffon {{was once}} again sidelined by several injuries. From September through January, reserve goalkeeper Alexander Manninger held his {{position}} between the sticks, gaining praise for his deputising. Due to recurring injuries, Manninger's performances and Juventus's poor form {{towards the end of}} the season (as Buffon was seen despondent whilst the team drew with both Lecce and Atalanta), there were further rumours that Buffon was displeased and wanted to part ways with the club. He admitted he was disappointed with the current results, but assured that he had no intention of leaving. After a discussion <b>with</b> <b>management,</b> he said he was reassured about the club's future and signed a contract extension to 2013. Buffon and Juventus finished the season on a high note, with two victories, finishing in second place behind Internazionale. They were knocked out of the Coppa Italia semi-finals by eventual champions Lazio and of the Champions League in the round of 16 by Chelsea. Buffon was nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2009 for the sixth consecutive season since first being nominated in 2004.

5|$|The Impact Global Championship is a {{professional}} wrestling world heavyweight championship owned by the promotion Impact Wrestling, formerly Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). From June 2002 to May 2007, TNA used the NWA World Heavyweight Championship as their primary championship due to {{an agreement with the}} National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). On May 13, 2007, the NWA abruptly ended the arrangement and retrieved control of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On the same night, TNA were set to host their annual Sacrifice pay-per-view event, in which the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was to be defended by then-champion Christian Cage against Kurt Angle and Sting in a three-way match. Angle won the match and on the following episode of TNA's television program Impact! on May 17, was declared the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. He was stripped of the championship later in the program, <b>with</b> <b>Management</b> Director Jim Cornette citing a problematic finish to the title match.
