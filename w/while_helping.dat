5|$|Gaddafi {{was ready}} now for an {{offensive}}. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invested Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Abéché, assuming {{control of the}} main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, <b>while</b> <b>helping</b> with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed a few thousand regular troops to the offensive, {{and most of these}} were artillery and logistic units. This may have been due to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be read as a Chadian internal affair.|$|E

5|$|The {{borders in}} the region had been disputed since the American {{purchase}} of Alaska from Russia in 1867, {{and most of the}} influx of prospectors were American. Amid fresh concerns that the United States might annex the gold fields, the mounted police were tasked to assert Canadian control along the border line. The force set up control posts at the borders of the Yukon and at easily controlled mountain passes, equipping the posts with Maxim guns. The police checked for illegal weapons and prevented the entry of criminals and collected customs duties, <b>while</b> <b>helping</b> protect and guide the flow of migrants, mediating in their disputes and providing practical advice.|$|E

5|$|When Governor Isaac Shelby {{announced}} he would not seek reelection, Garrard's friends encouraged {{him to become a}} candidate. The other announced candidates were Benjamin Logan and Thomas Todd. Logan was considered the favorite in the race due to his military heroism <b>while</b> <b>helping</b> settle the Kentucky frontier. However, his oratory was unpolished, and his parliamentary skills were weak, despite his considerable political experience. Todd, who had served as secretary of all ten Kentucky statehood conventions, had the most political experience, but his youth was considered a disadvantage by some. Garrard benefited from his political connections in Bourbon County, and many held him in high regard due to his work in the Baptist church.|$|E
5|$|<b>While</b> <b>helping</b> fix a woman's car engine on {{the side}} of the road in Middletown, Connecticut, Andrew Stockston (Adam Grupper) sees a {{sequence}} of red and green flashing lights and is hypnotized into a suggestive state.

Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) reveals that similar cases have ended with the victims being returned, but left insane from the trauma of the incident. All the victims were academics and accomplished in their respective fields.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances, {{like other}} {{emergency}} vehicles, {{are required to}} operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect {{to stay off the}} road. Also, the ambulance crew's responsibilities to their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as seat belts. Research has shown that ambulances {{are more likely to be}} involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in injury or death than either fire trucks or police cars. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable. When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found that on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in ambulances <b>while</b> <b>helping</b> patients, as 27 paramedics died during ambulance trips in the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|E

He {{led the team}} to the MHSAA Division 2 quarterfinals where they lost to {{eventual}} state champion Farmington Hills Harrison 3323. He began getting scholarship offers starting with Cincinnati, but as a lifelong Michigan fan, he hoped for an offer from Michigan once they abandoned Rich Rodriguez' spread offense and hired head coach Brady Hoke and offensive coordinator Al Borges. Before Michigan made him an offer on March 28, 2011, he also received offers from Bowling Green and Toledo. He gave Michigan a verbal commitment on May 10, 2011. He became Michigan's first commit {{of the class of}} 2013 in order to eliminate recruiting distractions. Once he committed, he actively recruited prospects for the team.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{discover}} his nemesis's secret identity, Osborn exposes Spider-Man to a gas that nullifies the hero's spider-senses. This allows Osborn to stalk Spider-Man until he learns that his nemesis is Peter Parker, {{a college student}} (and his son's classmate). While Parker is going about his civilian life, Osborn surprises and knocks him out with an asphyxiation grenade, taking him to his waterfront base. After unmasking himself to Parker, the latter goads him into recounting how he became Green Goblin, and uses the time to break free. In the ensuing battle, Spider-Man accidentally knocks Osborn into a mass of electrical wires, wiping out his memory. Feeling sorry for his nemesis, and wishing to avoid the shame that would befall the Osborn family (and by extension, Parker's best friend Harry), Spider-Man destroys the Green Goblin costume in the resulting fire and tells the authorities that Osborn lost his memory <b>while</b> <b>helping</b> to defeat the Green Goblin.|$|E

Kazuma's friend Kunihiko Kimishima gives him a mission to defeat another native Alter user. However, a man known as Ryuho from HOLY captures Kazuma in the aftermath. Ryuho tries to interrogate Kazuma over an unknown Alter user (later dubbed Crystal) who killed his mother and dog. Using a woman from HOLY named Mimori Kiryu as a hostage, Kazuma manages to return to his house. When native Alter users are captured by HOLY, Kazuma enters a forest where he finds Crystal. After fighting Crystal, Kazuma's Alter receives a power up. Shortly afterwards, it is revealed the Great Uprising was caused by a similar event in a parallel universe where all creatures are independent thinking Alters. Kazuma goes on a rampage against HOLY after Kinishima dies <b>while</b> <b>helping</b> him during one of his fights. Shortly afterwards, Kazuma and Ryuho fight, but during the battle, they open a gateway to the parallel universe, causing another uprising and attracting the attention of the Mainland government.|$|E

Logan and Yukio arrive later and, using Ichirō's X-ray machine, {{discover}} a robotic parasite attached to Logan's heart, suppressing his healing ability. Logan cuts himself open and extracts the device. During the operation, Shingen attacks but Yukio holds Shingen off {{long enough for}} Logan to recover and kill Shingen. Logan follows Mariko's trail {{to the village of}} Ichirō's birth, where he is captured by Harada's ninjas. Logan is placed in a machine by Dr. Green, who reveals her plans to extract his healing factor and introduces him to the Silver Samurai, an electromechanical suit of Japanese armour with energized swords made of adamantium. Mariko escapes from Harada, who believes he is acting in Mariko's interests, and frees Logan from the machine. Harada sees the error of his ways and is killed by the Silver Samurai <b>while</b> <b>helping</b> Logan escape.|$|E
5|$|The Creeper sneaks out and escapes while Donelly and Gates {{infiltrate}} his hideout {{and discover}} Jimmy's corpse. Donnelly also finds a newspaper clipping {{with a man}} named Hal Moffet {{and two of his}} friends, Clifford Scott (Tom Neal) and Virginia Rogers (Jan Wiley), during their college days. The police visit Clifford and Virginia, who are now married and wealthy. Clifford tells the officers during college, Hal was a handsome college football star who competed with Clifford for Virginia's affections. One day, <b>while</b> <b>helping</b> Hal prepare for a chemistry exam, a jealous Clifford deliberately gave him the wrong answers, resulting in Hal being asked by Professor Cushman to remain after class for extra work. While working on a chemistry experiment, Clifford walks by the window with Virginia to boast. Furious, Hal hurls a beaker to the ground, accidentally causing an explosion that disfigures his face. Donnelly speculates that Hal is the Creeper, and that he killed Professor Cushman and Joan because he holds them partially responsible for his accident.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} Bonwit Teller store {{remained as}} one of Trump Tower's retail offerings until March 1990, when Bonwit Teller's parent company declared bankruptcy and closed the Trump Tower location. In July of that year, Galeries Lafayette {{announced that it would}} sign a 25-year lease to move into the space previously occupied by Bonwit Teller, a move that expanded Galeries Lafayette's business to the United States <b>while</b> <b>helping</b> Trump pay off the debts incurred by the tower's construction and operation. The new store opened in September 1991 after a $13.7 million renovation, but was unprofitable upon opening, losing a net $3.6 million in the first year alone because it had only made $8.4 million in sales. Galeries Lafayette announced that it would be closing the Trump Tower location in August 1994, less than three years after it opened, due to an inability to pay off the $8 million annual rent and taxes. However, critics cited other factors, including the decision to not include merchandise from top French designers as the company's French locations had done.|$|E
