5|$|A {{supply of}} 929 M249 SAWs was issued to {{personnel}} from the U.S. Army and Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War. Although exposure to combat was scarce, M249 gunners <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover fire for friendly maneuvering troops from fixed positions, rather than maneuvering with them. There were many {{complaints about the}} weapons clogging up with sand after prolonged use in the desert environment.|$|E
5|$|After {{conducting}} a criminal investigation, verifying that Germany would honor its military alliance, and persuading the skeptical Hungarian Count Tisza, Austria-Hungary issued a formal {{letter to the}} government of Serbia. The letter reminded Serbia of its commitment to respect the Great Powers' decision regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. The letter contained specific demands aimed at preventing the publication of propaganda advocating the violent destruction of Austria-Hungary, removing the people behind this propaganda from the Serbian Military, arresting the people on Serbian soil <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> in the assassination plot and preventing the clandestine shipment of arms and explosives from Serbia to Austria-Hungary.|$|E

5|$|Fender was {{the elder}} son of Percy Robert Fender, the {{director}} of a firm of stationers, and Lily, née Herbert. Born in Balham, Surrey, in 1892, he was encouraged to play cricket by his mother's family <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> in Brighton club cricket, and from the age of eight he attended cricket matches to watch Sussex when visiting them. First educated at St George's College, Weybridge, then at St Paul's School, London, Fender did not excel academically, but was proficient in many sports.|$|E
5|$|The Daruvar Agreement, {{mediated}} {{by the head of}} the United Nations (UN) Civil Affairs in Sector West Gerard Fischer, was negotiated in secrecy. When the central RSK authorities in Knin learned of the arrangement, the signatories on behalf of the RSK were sacked from their official posts and arrested. The agreement itself was labeled as treasonous by the central RSK authorities. Fischer and other UN officials, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> in mediation of the agreement, were criticised by the UN for being excessively assertive in the matter. Fischer soon left the area.|$|E
5|$|The National Gallery {{has also}} been criticised for misattributing paintings. Kenneth Clark's {{decision}} in 1939 to relabel a group of paintings by anonymous artists of the Venetian school as works by Giorgione (a crowd-pulling artist due to the rarity of his paintings) made him unpopular with his staff. More recently, the attribution of a 17th-century painting of Samson and Delilah (bought in 1980) to Rubens has been contested {{by a group of}} art historians, who believe that the National Gallery has not admitted the mistake to avoid embarrassing those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> in the purchase, many of whom still work for the Gallery.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the barn has {{provided}} inspiration {{to a number of}} architects in the 19th and 20th centuries <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> with the Gothic Revival movement. Sir George Gilbert Scott visited the barn in 1850 and sketched it, using its design as the basis for proposals for the new ChristChurch Cathedral in Christchurch, New Zealand. The library of Mansfield College, Oxford designed by Basil Champneys in the late 1880s also owes its inspiration to the barn. Bedales School's library, completed in 1922 and designed by Ernest Gimson, may also have had its origins in the barn's design.|$|E
5|$|After Lenin's death, Stalin's {{administration}} {{established an}} ideology known as Marxism-Leninism, {{a movement that}} came to be interpreted differently by various contending factions in the Communist movement. After being forced into exile by Stalin's administration, Trotsky argued that Stalinism was a debasement of Leninism, which was dominated by bureaucratism and Stalin's own personal dictatorship. Marxism-Leninism was adapted to many of the 20th century's most prominent revolutionary movements, forming into variants such as Stalinism, Maoism, Juche, Ho Chi Minh Thought, and Castroism. Conversely, many later Western communists such as Manuel Azcárate and Jean Ellenstein <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> in the Eurocommunist movement expressed the view that Lenin and his ideas were irrelevant to their own objectives, thereby embracing a Marxist but not Marxist-Leninist perspective.|$|E
5|$|General Lucius Fairchild, the United States consul at Liverpool, {{wrote to}} his {{government}} recommending that the gallantry of the Englishmen <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> in the rescue effort be recognised. The Secretary of State supported his recommendation and the United States Congress moved to award the newly instituted Lifesaving Medal to the lifeboat men. However, a delay of 17 months followed during which a change in legislation had to be enacted to allow the medals to be issued to non-US nationals. Finally in 1877, the United States government awarded first-class Gold Lifesaving Medals to the twenty-seven men of the Mersey Docks and New Brighton RNLI lifeboat station who survived the incident, while {{the families of the}} three deceased lifeboat men were awarded a sum of $200.00 in gold in lieu of a medal. The medals were conferred in a public ceremony in Liverpool Town Hall on 27 February 1877.|$|E

5|$|Louisville's Courier-Journal {{carried an}} {{announcement}} of Blackburn's candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Kentucky on February 11, 1878. It {{is not clear}} why, with only meager prior political experience, he decided to seek the office. He may {{have been influenced by}} the members of his family <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> in politics. His brother Joseph was, at the time, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and another brother, James, had served in the Kentucky Senate. Two of his wife's brothers also held political office; Samuel Churchill was Secretary of State under Governors John L. Helm, John W. Stevenson, and Preston Leslie, and Thomas Churchill served as treasurer and later {{governor of the state of}} Arkansas. Whatever the reason, even his friends did not believe his announcement was wise due to his political inexperience. He opened his campaign with a speech in Owen County on March 29, 1878.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{motorcyclist}} fires {{shots at}} the moving car of Lewis and Falsone; the two narrowly avoid injury and the motorcyclist escapes. Almost immediately afterward, Lewis and Falsone are called to investigate {{the shooting death of}} a woman on a nearby street. At the scene they find Stivers (Toni Lewis), who was speaking to the woman when she was shot; police later conclude Stivers was the real target. While Munch and Kellerman are leaving the hotel, somebody opens fire on them and shoots Kellerman in the arm. Falsone suggests the shooter is targeting the detectives <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> in the previous fatal shooting of drug dealer Luther Mahoney. Kellerman becomes angry when Falsone questions the report of Mahoney's death, which indicates Kellerman shot Mahoney to save Lewis; Falsone said autopsy reports indicate Mahoney was beaten badly.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime of mere negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> in the Nanking Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.|$|E

Several of those executed during the conspiracy are today honoured in India. Kartar Singh is honoured with a memorial at his birthplace of the Village of Sarabha. The Ayurvedic Medicine College in Ludhiana is also named in his honour. The Indian government has produced stamps honouring several {{of those involved in}} the conspiracy, including Har Dayal, Bhai Paramanand, and Rash Behari Bose. Several other revolutionaries are also honoured through India and the Indian American population.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} {{effort of}} the estimated population of 100 to 150 thousand residents of the Gniezno region <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> in building or modernizing Gniezno and several other main Piast gords was made {{in response to a}} perceived deadly threat, not just to help them pursue regional conquests. After 935, when the Gniezno people were probably already led by Mieszko's father Siemomysł, the Czechs conquered Silesia and soon moved also against Germany. The fear of desecration of their tribal cult center by the advancing Czechs could have mobilized the community. A Polabian Slav uprising was suppressed around 940 by Germany under Otto I, and the eastbound moving Saxons must have added to the sense of danger at that time (unless the Piast state was already allied with Otto, helping restrain the Polabians). When the situation stabilized, the Piast state consolidated and the huge gords turned out to be handy for facilitating the Piast's own expansion, led at this stage by Siemomysł.|$|E
5|$|The {{group has}} a very long {{occupational}} history, with one house having been dated {{as far back as}} the Early Preclassic. By the Middle Preclassic, large platforms were being built from cobbles and several rich burials were made. By AD800, the complex consisted of about 50 buildings arranged around 7 major courtyards. At this time, the most important building was the House of the Bakabs, the palace of a powerful nobleman from the time of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. The building has a high-quality sculpted exterior and a carved hieroglyphic bench inside. A portion of the group was a subdistrict occupied by non-Maya inhabitants from Central Honduras <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> in the trade network that brought in goods from that region.|$|E
