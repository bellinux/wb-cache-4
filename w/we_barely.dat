500|$|Although the {{characters}} {{go on to}} begin a relationship, the show's one-hundredth episode [...] "What a Difference a Day Makes" [...] sees them experience difficulties {{as a result of}} Torres' father rejecting her for her sexuality. Rhimes commented on their ultimate reconciliation: [...] "I love [...] with Arizona. [...] I like that they make me feel hopeful about love." [...] Rhimes has said of their relationship in the sixth season: [...] "I would like to see Callie happily in a long-term relationship.

She described the sixth season as being about: [...] "cementing a very mature and grounded relationship and taking it forward. This is a drama, of course; there will be conflict, but for the time being, they're enjoying being in a relationship that seems stable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review, [...] "The moral of tonight’s Once Upon A Time might be, “Don’t play with fire.” Or perhaps it’s, “Don’t trust {{the man behind the}} curtain.” In any case, Excalibur lives! And unfortunately, so does Dark One Emma — now even more powerful and ruthless than before. For {{the first time since the}} beginning of the season, <b>we</b> <b>barely</b> spent any time in present-day Storybrooke, save for the first and last few moments of the episode. With two halves of the sword now in her possession, Emma can only see power. But Dark One Rumple claims it represents more than that — like any fairytale, it represents history. And it’s time for Excalibur’s promise, given years ago, to be fulfilled." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fremen {{are some}} of the best hand-to-hand combatants in the universe, the {{dangerous}} conditions of Arrakis ensuring that only the strongest survive. In Dune, Paul trains his Fremen forces in the use of what they call the [...] "weirding way", the specialized martial arts of the Bene Gesserit that he learned from his mother. The Mentat assassin Thufir Hawat is later shocked to learn that Fremen have not only overcome some of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV's fierce and previously unstoppable Sardaukar soldiers, but have done the impossible and captured some as well. Herbert also writes that [...] "Paul recalled the stories of the Fremen — that their children fought as ferociously as the adults." [...] In the novel Shaddam notes, [...] "I only sent in five troop carriers with a light attack force to pick up prisoners for questioning. <b>We</b> <b>barely</b> got away with three prisoners and one carrier. Mind you, Baron, my Sardaukar were almost overwhelmed by a force composed mostly of women, children, and old men." ...|$|E

60|$|Ten {{days later}} we started from the Holy Mount, a caravan {{of about a}} hundred camels, of which fifty were laden with the ivory and the rest ridden by our escort {{under the command of}} Harût and our three selves. But there was an evil fate upon this ivory, as on {{everything}} else {{that had to do with}} Jana. Some weeks later in the desert a great sandstorm overtook us in which <b>we</b> <b>barely</b> escaped with our lives. At the height of the storm the ivory-laden camels broke loose, flying before it. Probably they fell and were buried beneath the sand; at any rate of the fifty we only recovered ten.|$|E
60|$|Next morning early {{she went}} through the French Pass--a narrow gateway of rock, between bold headlands--so narrow, in fact, that it seemed no wider than a street. The current tore through there like a mill-race, and the boat darted through like a telegram. The passage was made in half a minute; then {{we were in a}} wide place where noble vast eddies swept grandly round and round in shoal water, and I {{wondered}} what they would do with the little boat. They did as they pleased with her. They picked her up and flung her around like nothing and landed her gently on the solid, smooth bottom of sand--so gently, indeed, that <b>we</b> <b>barely</b> felt her touch it, barely felt her quiver when she came to a standstill. The water was as clear as glass, the sand on the bottom was vividly distinct, and the fishes seemed to be swimming about in nothing. Fishing lines were brought out, but before we could bait the hooks the boat was off and away again.|$|E
6000|$|Changes of {{wind from}} {{south-east}} to north-west are very common on the American coast. They {{are almost always}} sudden; sometimes so much so, as to take ships aback; and {{the force of the}} breeze usually comes so early, as to have produced the saying that a [...] "nor'-wester comes butt-end foremost." [...] Such proved to be the fact in our case. In less than half an hour after it began to blow, the wind would have brought the most gallant ship that floated to double-reefed topsails, steering by, and to reasonably short-canvass, running large. We may have pulled a mile in this half hour, though it was by means of a quick stroke and great labour. The Cape May men were vigorous and experienced, and they did wonders; nor were Rupert and I idle; but, as soon as the sea got up, it was as much as all four of us could do to keep steerage-way on the boat. There were ten minutes, during which I really think the boat was kept head to sea by means of the wash of the waves that drove past, as <b>we</b> <b>barely</b> held her stationary.|$|E

"There {{is no more}} tacking or box-hauling to be done tonight. <b>We</b> have <b>barely</b> room to {{pass out}} of the shoals on this course; {{and if we can}} weather the 'Devil's Grip,' we clear their {{outermost}} point--but if not, as I said before, there is but an alternative." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{never knew}} {{precisely}} the {{point on the}} coast of Ireland where we anchored. It was somewhere between Strangford and Dundrum Bay; though the name of the head-land which gave us a sort of protection, I did not learn. In this part of the island, the coast trends north and south, generally; though at the place where we anchored, its direction was nearly from north-north-east to south-south-west,--which, {{in the early part of}} the gale, was as close as might be the course in which the wind blew. At the moment we brought up, the wind had hauled a little further to the northward, giving us a better lee; but, to my great regret, Michael had scarcely left us, when it shifted to due north-east, making a fair rake of the channel. This left us very little of a lee--the point ahead of us being no great matter, and <b>we</b> <b>barely</b> within it. I consulted such maps as I had, and came to the conclusion that we were off the county Down, a part of the kingdom that was at least civilized, and where we should be apt to receive good treatment, in the event of being wrecked. Our fishermen told us that they belonged to a Bally-something; but what the something was I have forgotten, if I ever understood them. [...] "Told us," [...] I say out of complaisance, but [...] "tould" [...] would be the better word, as all they uttered savoured so much of the brogue, that it was not always easy to get at their meaning.|$|E

"Well, {{when he came}} here, {{of course}} he had no use for sitch tomfooleries, but once or twice, when he wanted to astonish the natives, he got hold o' some 'pothicary's stuff an' wi' {{gunpowder}} an' charcoal concocted some things that well-nigh drove the red men out o' their senses, an' got daddy to be regarded as a great medicine-man. Of course he kep' it secret how he produced the surprisin' fires--an', to say truth, I think from my own experience that if he had tried to explain it to 'em they could have made neither head nor tail o't. For a long time arter that he did nothin' more in that way, till one time when the Blackfeet came an' catched daddy an' me nappin' in this very hut and <b>we</b> <b>barely</b> got off wi' the scalps on our heads by scrambling down the precipice where the reptiles didn't like to follow. When they left the place they took all our odds an' ends wi' them, an' set fire to the hut. Arter they was gone we set to work an' built a noo hut. Then daddy-- who's got an amazin' turn for inventin' things--set to work to concoct suthin' for the reptiles if they should pay us another visit. It was at that time he thought of turnin' this cave to account as a place o' refuge when hard pressed, an' hit on the plan for liftin' the big stone easy, which no doubt you've obsarved." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed a}} strange speech, in the circumstances, but <b>we</b> <b>barely</b> noticed that, {{we were so}} shocked and grieved at the wanton murder he had committed--for murder it was, that was its true name, and it was without palliation or excuse, for the men had not wronged him in any way. It made us miserable, for we loved him, and had thought him so noble and so {{beautiful}} and gracious, and had honestly believed he was an angel; and to have him do this cruel thing--ah, it lowered him so, and we had had such pride in him. He went right on talking, just {{as if nothing had}} happened, telling about his travels, and the interesting things he had seen in the big worlds of our solar systems and of other solar systems far away in the remotenesses of space, and about the customs of the immortals that inhabit them, somehow fascinating us, enchanting us, charming us in spite of the pitiful scene that was now under our eyes, for the wives of the little dead men had found the crushed and shapeless bodies and were crying over them, and sobbing and lamenting, and a priest was kneeling there with his hands crossed upon his breast, praying; and crowds and crowds of pitying friends were massed about them, reverently uncovered, with their bare heads bowed, and many with the tears running down--a scene which Satan paid no attention to until the small noise of the weeping and praying began to annoy him, then he reached out and took the heavy board seat out of our swing and brought it down and mashed all those people into the earth just {{as if they had been}} flies, and went on talking just the same. An angel, and kill a priest! An angel who did not know how to do wrong, and yet destroys in cold blood hundreds of helpless poor men and women who had never done him any harm! It made us sick to see that awful deed, and to think that none of those poor creatures was prepared except the priest, for none of them had ever heard a mass or seen a church. And we were witnesses; we had seen these murders done and it was our duty to tell, and let the law take its course.|$|E
