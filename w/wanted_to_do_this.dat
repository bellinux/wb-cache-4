500|$|During the {{pregnancy}} storyline, Martha was also {{diagnosed with breast}} cancer. The storyline was introduced {{just over a year}} after Gordon's partner, Chris Burkhardt, died from acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 23. Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given". Gordon said [...] "The producer asked me if I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based on what I had been through, I definitely think this one tops all of them". Gordon added that anyone going through Martha's ordeal would find it hard, but [...] "you just look to your friends and family and do your best in that situation and then move on".|$|E
500|$|However, Burton {{dropped out}} of Mary Reilly over Columbia's {{decision}} to fast track the film and their interest with Julia Roberts {{in the title role}} instead of Ryder. This prompted Burton to becoming interested in directing Ed Wood himself, on the understanding it could be done quickly. Lehmann said, [...] "Tim <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> movie immediately and direct, but I was already committed to Airheads." [...] Lehmann was given executive producer credit. Alexander and Karaszewski delivered a 147-page screenplay in six weeks. Burton read the first draft and immediately agreed to direct the film as it stood, without any changes or rewrites. Ed Wood gave Burton the opportunity to make a film that was more character-driven as opposed to style-driven. He said in an interview, [...] "On a picture like this I find you don't need to storyboard. You're working mainly with actors, and there's no effects going on, so it's best to be more spontaneous." ...|$|E

500|$|Brent Spiner {{returned}} to the Star Trek franchise, having previously played the character of Data in [...] In Enterprise he {{played the role of}} Dr. Arik Soong, an ancestor of Data's creator. Coto compared the character to Hannibal Lecter and talked about the fear that he inspired in the human authorities during the time of Enterprise due to Soong's actions involving illegal genetics. The storyline involved several references to The Original Series, such as the genetic supermen in the vein of Khan Noonien Singh as first seen in the episode [...] "Space Seed" [...] and later in the 1982 film, [...] The first episode of this Enterprise story arc also saw the re-appearance of the Orion slave girls as seen in the first pilot of Star Trek, [...] "". Coto credited this to his idea for the fourth season saying, [...] "What I really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> season is make the episodes that I as a Star Trek fan would have to see. You know, as a fan of the original series, if I heard that they were doing the Orion slavers and the Eugenics Wars, I would have to be in front of that TV." ...|$|E
500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} and second unit director David Leitch {{compared it to}} a [...] "Jackie Chan hybrid of comedy and action." [...] Prior to the filming, Leitch organized a month-long boot camp in order to prepare Renner and Arterton (who said she was also glad that at least she could use her prior training that she received while studying at RADA) with extensive weapons, fight and stunt training. Janssen said she enjoyed [...] "flying", something that she always wanted to do, adding that despite her reputation as an action star {{it was the first}} film where she really had to do something physical (including suffering a minor accident on the set), because she could not use a double in the close-up scenes where she had the makeup on. During one of the scenes, where Gretel is thrown through a wall and falls down several meters, a stunt double for Arterton was dangerously injured when a nail got lodged in her skull close to the brain; Arterton said she initially <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> stunt herself but Wirkola would not let her. Arterton herself suffered an injury when she sprained her ankle while running through the forest. Stunts for the more aggressive witches were done by New Zealander stuntwoman and actress Zoë Bell. Renner did practically all of his stunt scenes himself.|$|E

500|$|As the dialogue-integrated [...] "tutorial" [...] in {{the first}} Ace Attorney was well received, the {{inclusion}} of one in Justice for All was considered a [...] "major point". While the first game's tutorial involved Phoenix being helped through his first trial by his mentor Mia and the judge, this {{could not be used}} twice, which led to the idea of giving Phoenix a temporary amnesia from a blow to the head. Takumi included a circus and magic in the game's third episode; he really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> as performing magic is a hobby of his. The episode includes two themes that he wanted to explore: the difficulties in forming a cohesive team with different people, and a person who against the odds tries to make something whole. The former was reflected in how the circus members come together at the end, while the latter was reflected in the character Moe. Several different versions of the fourth episode were created, partially because of them running out of memory on the game's cartridge, but also because of the popularity of the character of Miles Edgeworth: Takumi had originally planned to let Edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes, but when they were in full production the development team learned that the character had become popular, which led to Takumi feeling that he had to use the character more carefully and sparingly. Because of this, he created the character Franziska von Karma, to save Edgeworth for the game's last case, and avoid a situation where he – a supposed prodigy – loses every case. The character Pearl Fey was originally intended to be a rival character around the same age as Maya, only appearing in the game's second episode; one of the game's designers suggested that it would be more dramatic if she were much younger, so Takumi wrote her as an eight-year-old. As he ended up liking her, he included her in other episodes as well.|$|E

[...] Shinoda also said that he wrote the song for his wife, Anna. When consulting executive producer and rapper Jay-Z and Linkin Park guitarist and Machine Shop A Brad Delson on which songs should be included in The Rising Tied, [...] "Where'd You Go" [...] is one of two songs that he requested not to remove from the album, since the song drives his wife to tears every time she listens to it.|$|E
