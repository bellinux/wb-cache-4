5|$|While {{working in}} Ring of Honor for a year, James also debuted as Alexis Laree in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on the company's second ever weekly pay-per-view, as a {{participant}} in a lingerie battle royal. She was not prominently featured until March 26, 2003, when she teamed with Amazing Red {{as part of his}} feud against the X Division Champion Kid Kash and Trinity. Laree competed in her first singles match with the promotion on April 2, 2003 in a losing effort against Trinity. Weeks later, she became the first member of The Gathering, a stable led by Raven in his feud against NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett. On April 16, Laree became the first (and thus far, only) woman to compete in a Clockwork Orange House of Fun match, after the Gathering challenged and defeated Jarrett. She continued to <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> the stable while they feuded with The Disciples of the New Church, taking part in an angle with Father James Mitchell burning her with a fireball and wrestling in another Clockwork Orange House of Fun match before leaving the company.|$|E
25|$|Later {{cases that}} rely on Mt. Healthy have largely {{concerned}} the eponymous test derived from the case. The Supreme Court expanded its application to other ares of the law, for now leaving it to the appeals courts to <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> the specifics.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{past the}} controversy, The Last Temptation of Christ gained {{critical}} acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> the spirituality underpinning his films {{up until that}} point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to Barry Levinson for Rain Man).|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} his time at Wheaton that Graham decided to accept the Bible as the infallible word of God. Henrietta Mears of the First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood (Hollywood, California) was {{instrumental}} in helping Graham <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> the issue. He settled it at Forest Home Christian Camp (now called Forest Home Ministries) southeast of the Big Bear area in Southern California. A memorial there marks the site of Graham's decision.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Japanese occupation, the Government of Hong Kong held a {{monopoly}} on the purchase and distribution of food and raw materials including rice and cotton yarn. Price controls by the Government were not eliminated until 1953. The period can best be summarised by low resources and an endless increase in population. Many mainlanders would cross the border to Hong Kong and establish illegal huts on rooftops and edge of mountains. The integration of different groups from China and original tenants of Hong Kong would also create a society in which everyone had to <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> the overwhelming number of language dialects.|$|E
25|$|The Labor Party {{replaced}} Rudd with Julia Gillard in 2010 {{owing to}} Rudd's unpopularity both among his frontbench and the public, so then Julia Gillard {{became the first}} woman prime minister in Australian history. Following the 2010 Election, Labor secured office in the first hung parliament since the 1940 election. The Gillard Government struggled on multiple policy fronts, trying to <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> a hung parliament. A scandal rocked the parliament: Speaker of the House Peter Slipper, who was a former Liberal Party member turned Labor ally, had sent sexually suggestive messages to a colleague. This resulted in his removal. Opposition to Gillard's government following her misogyny speech intensified. Leadership rivalry continued and Kevin Rudd was reinstated as prime minister in a Labor leadership spill on 27 June 2013. At the 2013 Election, the Second Rudd Government lost office and the Liberal-National Abbott Government formed.|$|E

50|$|Both Martin Luther and John Calvin {{believed}} that Jacob had <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> God, although Calvin believed {{the event was}} only a vision. Joseph Barker (1854) believed the Bible clearly showed that Jacob <b>wrestled</b> <b>with</b> God. Peter L. Berger also believed Jacob wrestled God.|$|R
25|$|The books also <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> {{the idea}} of individualism. Hari Seldon's plan is often treated as an {{inevitable}} mechanism of society, a vast mindless mob mentality of quadrillions of humans across the galaxy. Many in the series struggle against it, only to fail. However, the plan itself is reliant upon the cunning of individuals such as Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow to make wise decisions that capitalize on the trends. On the other hand, the Mule, a single individual with mental powers, topples the Foundation and nearly destroys the Seldon plan with his special, unforeseen abilities. To repair the damage the Mule inflicts, the Second Foundation deploys a plan which turns upon individual reactions. Psychohistory is based on group trends and cannot predict with sufficient accuracy the effects of extraordinary, unforeseeable individuals, and as originally presented, the Second Foundation's purpose was to counter this flaw. Later novels would, however, identify the Plan's uncertainties that remained at Seldon's death as {{the primary reason for}} the existence of the Second Foundation, which (unlike the First) had retained the capacity to research and further develop psychohistory.|$|E
25|$|Rats, {{like most}} mammals, also form family groups {{of a mother}} and her young. This applies to both groups of males and females. However, rats are {{territorial}} animals, meaning that they usually act aggressively or scared of strange rats. Rats will fluff up their hair, hiss, squeal, and move their tails around when defending their territory. Rats will chase each other, groom each other, sleep in group nests, <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> each other, have dominance squabbles, communicate, and play in various other ways with each other. Huddling is an additional important part of rat socialization. Huddling is often supposed to have a heat-conserving function. Nestling rats especially depend on heat from their mother, since they cannot regulate their own temperature. Huddling is an extreme form of herding. Other forms of interaction include: crawling under, which is literally the act of crawling underneath one another; walking over, also explained in the name; allo-grooming, so-called to distinguish it from self-grooming; and nosing, where a rat gently pushes with its nose at another rat near the neck.|$|E
25|$|Sadamasa Arikawa (who {{worked with}} Eiji Tsuburaya) {{said that the}} sculptors {{had a hard time}} coming up with a King Kong suit that appeased Tsuburaya. The first suit was {{rejected}} for being too fat with long legs giving Kong an almost cute look. A few other designs were done before Tsuburaya would approve the final look that was ultimately used in the film. The suit was given two separate masks and two separate pairs of arms. Long arm extensions which contained poles inside the arms for Hirose to grab onto and with static immovable hands was used for long shots of Kong, while short human length arms were added to the suit for scenes that required Kong to grab items and <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> Godzilla. Besides the suit with the two separate arm attachments, a meter high model and a puppet of Kong (used for closeups) were also built. As well, a huge prop of Kong's hand was built for the scene where he grabs Mie Hama (Fumiko) and carries her off.|$|E

25|$|On the June 17 {{episode of}} Impact!, Hogan's {{alliance}} with Abyss {{came to an}} abrupt end when Abyss became a villain. Abyss later claimed that he was controlled by some entity, that was coming to TNA. The next month, Hogan worked with Bischoff, Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe against Sting and Kevin Nash, who claimed that they knew that Hogan and Bischoff were up to something. During this time, Abyss went on a rampage, attacking Rob Van Dam to the point that he was forced to vacate the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and eventually put his hands on TNA president Dixie Carter, which led to her signing the paperwork, presented by Bischoff, that would have Abyss fired from TNA following his match with Van Dam at Bound for Glory. Hogan was set to <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> Jarrett and Joe against Sting, Nash and D'Angelo Dinero at Bound for Glory, but was forced to miss the event due to a back surgery. However, he would make an appearance {{at the end of the}} event, turning villain for the first time since 2002, helping Jeff Hardy win the vacant TNA World Heavyweight Championship and aligning himself with Hardy, Bischoff, Abyss and Jarrett. On the following episode of Impact!, it was revealed that Bischoff had tricked Carter and the paperwork she had signed a week earlier, were not to release Abyss, but to turn the company over to him and Hogan. Meanwhile, Bischoff's and Hogan's new stable, now known as Immortal, formed an alliance with Ric Flair's Fortune. Dixie Carter returned on the November 25 episode of Reaction, informing Hogan and Bischoff that a judge had filed an injunction against the two on her behalf over not having signatory authority, indefinitely suspending Hogan from TNA. During his absence, Hogan underwent a potentially career–ending spinal fusion surgery on December 21, 2010.|$|E
500|$|At {{a status}} hearing on July 14 (which Hastert again did not attend), the parties updated the court on {{preparations}} for trial. At the hearing, Green again condemned leaks, stating in court: [...] "The indictment has effectively been amended by leaks from the government. It {{is now an}} 800-pound gorilla in this case. It has been injected in this case I think impermissibly. (The question is) whether I <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> that gorilla or I don't <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> that gorilla." [...] Green {{also said that the}} defense would file a motion to dismiss the indictment, possibly under seal. Judge Durkin [...] "cautioned that even if he allows part or all of the motion to be hidden from the public, his ruling would be public and likely would disclose sealed portions of the motion." [...] At the same hearing, the prosecution said that they expected a trial to last about two weeks.|$|E

On March 15, 2009, Konnan lost a Hair vs. Hair match against Vampiro Canadiense. He continued to <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> La Legión until February 2010.|$|E

500|$|Belt {{begins to}} act irrationally then collapses {{screaming}} as he hears {{mention of the}} ghostlike entity from the astronauts. Paramedics are called to attend to him, and find him cowering under his desk whimpering and begging for help. Before Belt is taken away, he tells the agents that the shuttle will not survive reentry due to sabotage by 'the face', which had lived inside his body and possessed him since his time in orbit. At his urging, they alert the shuttle to change its trajectory and are just able to land it successfully. In the hospital, Belt continues to <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> the presence, telling Mulder he wasn't responsible but also couldn't stop it, as [...] "it came to me, it lives in me". Eventually, in a last <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> the re-possessing entity, he shouts [...] "no more" [...] as he leaps from the window to his death - experiencing a lengthy flashback to his last space mission as he falls. Mulder theorizes that, while Belt was compelled to sabotage the launches by the entity possessing him, {{he was also the}} one who sent Generoo the evidence of what was taking place. He lauds Belt's final sacrifice, stating that in the end he gave his life for the mission, as befits a true astronaut.|$|E

Even before publication, Steven Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the television series ER. Spielberg considered that what really fascinated him was that Jurassic Park was [...] "a really credible look at how dinosaurs might someday be brought back alongside modern mankind", going beyond a simple monster movie.|$|E

500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent {{particularly}} praised Smith, {{stating that}} he [...] "excels in his acting, managing to be reassuring and threatening, hilarious and sinister all {{within the same}} few scenes". However, though she praised the cliffhanger, she thought it [...] "eclipsed" [...] the episode. Radio Times writer Patrick Mulkern thought that there were [...] "points of logic" [...] which might be questioned, but they were [...] "minor points to <b>wrestle</b> <b>with</b> in a largely polished production".

500|$|Elephant trunks have {{multiple}} functions, including breathing, olfaction, touching, grasping, and sound production.

500|$|... "All Mixed Up" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

He asserted: [...] "Cougar Town hasn't taken as big of a step up from season one to season two as it did from the first part of season one to the last part of season one. But the step from 'average' to 'good' was the easy part. Season two is the season where viewers are going {{to find out if the}} show has what it takes to make the small steps needed to get from 'good' to 'great'.

[...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall opined that the show averted from its original premise; [...] "It's become one of my favorite comedies, and whether you care about Aniston or not, tonight is a good time to sample it if you dismissed it last year because of the title, the original premise or some of those early episodes." ...|$|E
