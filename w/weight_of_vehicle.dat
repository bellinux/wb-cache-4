50|$|Market share {{was almost}} 90% for the Diesel engine {{and a little}} more than 10% for the petrol engine. While the petrol engine was mainly used for ambulances, firetrucks, special vans for cold areas, {{commercial}} buyers preferred the Diesel engine for its lower fuel consumption and best reliability. In the UK, originally only diesel engines were on offer, but as the British market was 80 percent petrol at the time sales were less than scintillating. For 1982 petrol models were added, and sales immediately increased by 80 percent. The body styles were panel van, different versions of window vans, pickup and pickup with double cab.Already the power outputs for the 4-cylinder engines were very good, so the 307D was one of the fastest 3,5 ton (GVWR) Diesel-Vans in Europe of the late 1970s. Low gearing also meant that the vans were capable pullers, able to make best use of the power available whilst returning surprisingly good fuel economy for the large size and <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lastly, {{a vehicle}} can become {{airborne}} upon striking a guardrail with a buried end treatment if the slope {{to which the}} end anchor is buried is relatively flat (3:1 or flatter), which may negate {{the purpose of the}} guardrail, if the vehicle continues beyond the guardrail and strikes the object the guardrail was protecting. Additionally, an airborne vehicle is likely to collide in a manner that the vehicle was not designed for, increasing the risk of failure in the vehicle's collision safety systems. Guardrail will have some give and deflection upon impact. The amount of deflection depends on many factors of which speed and <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle,</b> type of guardrail installed, height of rail, length of posts, soil conditions {{and a number of other}} factors can all play a role. Guardrail must be installed so that it is not so rigid that the rail will fail upon impact or the posts will snap off at the point where they are embedded within the ground.|$|E

50|$|Hand trucks (including {{carts and}} dollies), the {{simplest}} type of industrial truck, cannot transport or stack pallets, is non-powered, and requires the operator to walk. A pallet jack, which cannot stack a pallet, uses front wheels mounted inside {{the end of}} forks that extend to the floor as the pallet is only lifted enough to clear the floor for subsequent travel. A counterbalanced lift truck (sometimes {{referred to as a}} forklift truck, but other attachments besides forks can be used) can transport and stack pallets and allows the operator to ride on the truck. The weight of the vehicle (and operator) behind the front wheels of truck counterbalances weight of the load (and <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> beyond front wheels); the front wheels act as a fulcrum or pivot point. Narrow-aisle trucks usually require that the operator stand-up while riding {{in order to reduce the}} truck’s turning radius. Reach mechanisms and outrigger arms that straddle and support a load can be used in addition to the just the counterbalance of the truck. On a turret truck, the forks rotate during stacking, eliminating the need for the truck itself to turn in narrow aisles. An order picker allows the operator to be lifted with the load to allow for less-than-pallet-load picking. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are industrial trucks that can transport loads without requiring a human operator.|$|E
