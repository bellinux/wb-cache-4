5|$|There are two {{contrasting}} views {{regarding the}} marital status of Tulsidas. According to the Mula Gosain Charita {{and some other}} works, Tulsidas was married to Ratnavali on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the Jyeshta month (May–June) in Vikram 1583 (1526 CE). Ratnavali {{was the daughter of}} Dinbandhu Pathak, a Brahmin of the Bharadwaja Gotra, who belonged to Mahewa village of Kaushambi district. They had a son named Tarak who died as a toddler. Once when Tulsidas had gone to a Hanuman temple, Ratnavali went to her father's home with her brother. When Tulsidas came to know this, he swam across the Yamuna river in the night to meet his wife. Ratnavali chided Tulsidas for this, and remarked that if Tulsidas was even half as devoted to God as he <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> body of flesh and blood, he would have been redeemed. Tulsidas left her instantly and left for the holy city of Prayag. Here, he renounced the Grihastha (householder's life) stage and became a Sadhu (Hindu ascetic).|$|E

Selfridge lavished Jenny with expensive gifts and funded both sisters' gambling habit. The Dolly Sisters reportedly gambled approximately $4 million of Selfridge's money away. While she was still involved with Selfridge, Jenny Dolly began seeing French pilot Max Constant. In 1933, Selfridge offered Jenny $10 million to marry him.|$|E

The award was presented to Prime Suspect, but following the ceremony four of the other seven members of the jury signed a public statement declaring that they had voted for G.B.H. to win. Shubik, who as chairman did not cast a vote, refused to publicly comment on the affair, but BAFTA Chairman Richard Price stated that the ballot papers passed on to him by Shubik had shown four votes for Prime Suspect and three for G.B.H.. Price claimed that the ballot papers could not be recounted as they had subsequently been destroyed. No blame was ever attached to Shubik by the four judges, and it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that they had initially turned to raise the apparent discrepancy with BAFTA.|$|E

In July and August, Algonquin was operating between Bizerte and Naples. On 15 August, she was one of twelve hospital ships supporting Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France. In mid-September Algonquin returned to Charleston, then departed for Oran on 22 September. She then spent some time operating between Livorno, Italy, Marseilles, France, Naples and Oran, returning to Charleston on 22 February 1945. Between May and September, Algonquin made four return trips between the United States and Europe. Her return voyage in September <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> new port of registry, New York. Two more return trips to Marseilles and Naples were made and then Algonquin was drydocked in December for conversion to trooping duties again. On completion of the work in January 1946, she was employed to repatriate American troops and Italian war brides from Europe.|$|E
25|$|To the Pennimans {{were born}} four children; Hortensia, who married Judge Brayton of Swanton; Udney, who {{inherited}} the homestead in Colchester; Julietta, who married Dr. Nathan Ryno Smith, a physician of Baltimore; and Adelia, {{who became the}} wife of Dr. Moody, {{one of the early}} physicians of Burlington. Two daughters of Adelia were well known in Burlington, Mrs. Mary M. Howe, and Mrs. Ella M. Goodrich, wife of Prof. E. Goodrich. Penniman’s descendants had in their possession some interesting Allen relics, but two beautiful old Copley portraits of Penniman and her mother, Mrs. Crean Brush, passed into the possession of Mr. Pell, the owner of Ft. Ticonderoga. They were painted in New York in 1771, when Frances was eleven years of age. She is quaintly arrayed in a long bodice and long full skirt with her hair pompadoured and powdered like her mother’s. But her face is strikingly bright and expressive. She holds in one slender hand a basket of flowers, a prophetic hint of that taste that brought her so much satisfaction when she became middle-aged.

[...] However, Pareles commended its musicality and vocals, stating [...] "he tone of the music is airless, sealing out imprecision and reveling in crisp, machine-generated rhythms; Ms. Jackson's piping voice, layered upon itself in punchy unisons or lavish harmonies, never cracks or falters."

The first accusations of sexual relationships between Seung Sahn and students came about in 1988. Sonia Alexander, former director of Cambridge Zen Center, has claimed that Seung Sahn had carried out long-term sexual relationships {{with a number of}} his female followers. Journalist Rick Fields confirms this, writing “the supposedly celibate Korean Zen master Seung Sahn (Seon-sa-nim) revealed long-term relationships with two students.” According to Sonia Alexander, when questioned about the nature of these relationships Seung Sahn stated that [...] "it wasn't [...] love, it wasn't lust." [...] These alleged relationships caused Alexander to end her involvement with the Kwan Um School, believing in retrospect that she had been used over the years only to help build more Zen Centers for the lineage. In addition to Alexander, author Sandy Boucher spoke with several other women who lived at the Cambridge Zen Center at the time, one of whom said that in her opinion Sonia was very much in the minority in feeling used and that Soen Sa Nim's affairs had not been hurtful to the women involved. [...] Notwithstanding her reservations, Alexander still has reverence for Seung Sahn, feels her time spent in the school <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> benefit, and subsequently rejoined the Kwan Um School as a Senior Dharma Teacher in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Constantinople {{could now}} be easily resupplied by sea and the city's {{fishermen}} went back to sea, as the Arab fleet did not sail again. Still suffering from hunger and pestilence, the Arabs lost a major battle against the Bulgars, who killed, according to Theophanes, 22,000. It is unclear, however, whether the Bulgars attacked the Arab encampment because of their treaty with Leo or whether the Arabs strayed into Bulgar territory seeking provisions, {{as reported by the}} Syriac Chronicle of 846. Michael the Syrian mentions that the Bulgars participated in the siege from the beginning, with attacks against the Arabs as they marched through Thrace and subsequently on their encampment, but this is not corroborated elsewhere. The siege had clearly failed, and Caliph Umar sent orders to Maslama to retreat. After thirteen months of siege, on 15 August 718, the Arabs departed. The date coincided with the feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos (Assumption of Mary), and it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that the Byzantines ascribed their victory. The retreating Arabs were not hindered or attacked on their return, but their fleet lost more ships in a storm in the Marmara Sea while other ships were set afire by ashes from the volcano of Santorini, and some of the survivors were captured by the Byzantines, so that Theophanes claims that only five vessels made it back to Syria. Arab sources claim that altogether 150,000 Muslims perished during the campaign, a figure which, according to the Byzantinist John Haldon, [...] "while certainly inflated, is nevertheless indicative of the enormity of the disaster in medieval eyes".|$|E
