5|$|Farmers exploit {{flocking}} {{behavior to}} keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, {{and to move}} them more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans <b>with</b> <b>regular</b> feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food. Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Frederick {{thought the}} sounds of the battle were either an outpost {{skirmish}} or the Croats, who apparently started their days <b>with</b> <b>regular</b> firing of their weapons. His staff had trouble rousing him from bed, but he was soon alerted when Prussian cannons, captured by the Austrians, started to fire on his own camp.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to tessellate in non-Euclidean geometries such as hyperbolic geometry. A uniform tiling in the hyperbolic plane (which may be regular, quasiregular or semiregular) is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane, <b>with</b> <b>regular</b> polygons as faces; these are vertex-transitive (transitive on its vertices), and isogonal (there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we define}} the spaces <b>with</b> a <b>regular</b> base at non-isolated points and discuss some metrization theorems. We firstly {{show that a}} space X is a metrizable space, {{if and only if}} X is a <b>regular</b> space <b>with</b> a σ-locally finite base at non-isolated points, if and only if X is a perfect space <b>with</b> a <b>regular</b> base at non-isolated points, if and only if X is a β-space <b>with</b> a <b>regular</b> base at non-isolated points. In addition, we also discuss the {{relations}} between the spaces <b>with</b> a <b>regular</b> base at non-isolated points and some generalized metrizable spaces. Finally, we give an affirmative answer for a question posed by F. C. Lin and S. Lin in LL, which also shows that a space <b>with</b> a <b>regular</b> base at non-isolated points has a point-countable base. Comment: 12 page...|$|R

5|$|The fairy shrimp {{is found}} in {{temporary}} pools of water, from seasonal ponds to muddy ruts, preferring sites <b>with</b> <b>regular</b> disturbance, such as passing tractors or livestock. It has {{a broad range of}} ecological tolerances, in terms of temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH, but cannot coexist with predatory fish. C. diaphanus swims with its ventral side upwards, and is a filter feeder, collecting zooplankton and detritus with its phyllopodia.|$|E

Quarrel gives Bond training in scuba diving in the local waters. Bond swims through shark- and barracuda-infested waters to Mr Big's island and manages to plant a limpet mine on the hull of his yacht before being captured once again by Mr Big. Bond is reunited with Solitaire; the following morning Mr Big ties the couple to a line behind his yacht and plans to drag them over the shallow coral reef and into deeper water so that the sharks and barracuda that he attracts in to the area <b>with</b> <b>regular</b> feedings will eat them.|$|E

5|$|Daley {{received}} criticism when family, personal friends, {{and political}} allies seemed to disproportionately benefit from city contracting. He {{took office in}} a city <b>with</b> <b>regular</b> annual budget surpluses and left the city with massive structural deficits. His budgets ran up the largest deficits in Chicago history. Prior to serving as mayor, Daley served in the Illinois Senate and then as the Cook County State's Attorney. Police use of force was an issue in Daley's tenures as state's attorney and mayor.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} season, Bart {{convinced}} Krusty {{to run for}} Congress so that Krusty could introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons' house. Krusty agreed and ran on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign started off badly, Lisa suggested that he try connecting <b>with</b> <b>regular</b> families, which Krusty did, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term started off badly, as he was completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With {{the help of the}} Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeded in passing his bill.|$|E

5|$|In-game, Terrans tend {{to favor}} {{traditional}} modes of warfare, often utilizing combined arms tactics with tanks, aircraft or other combat vehicles in combination <b>with</b> <b>regular</b> infantry. Using light ballistics, large calibre weapons and even tactical nuclear warheads, many Terran units are reminiscent of present-day designs. Terrans are the only race without a melee combat unit. Terrans are more adaptive {{than the other two}} races and are able to produce units at an average expense. Primary base structures can even lift off and fly to other locations, allowing players to move buildings for quicker troop deployments, access to new resource locations or to save the structures from destruction by the enemy. Terran buildings and mechanized units can be repaired if damaged, and combat medics can heal wounded organic units.|$|E
5|$|Mineral ores can be mined {{just like}} normal stone and the raw ore can be smelted to produce their {{corresponding}} metal bars. Different ores or metal bars can be alloyed together for higher quality materials. For steel production, flux stones {{are used to}} make pig iron bars and smelt it <b>with</b> <b>regular</b> iron and coal (or charcoal). Specific metal items can be melted back to their respective bars. Without steel, the alloy bronze or regular iron are the next best suitable metals to use. Bronze requires two ores or bars of tin and copper. The metal adamantine, found deep below, is extremely light but very strong, making it excellent for sharp weapons and armor. Raw adamantine can be extracted into strands and can further be either woven in cloth or smelted into wafers.|$|E

5|$|Sixty-year-old Crawford {{had been}} {{reluctant}} to volunteer, but he did so {{at the request of}} General Irvine. Williamson, although popular with the militia, was in disfavor <b>with</b> <b>regular</b> army officers such as Irvine because he had allowed the Gnadenhütten massacre. Hoping to avoid a repetition, Irvine made it known that he favored Crawford's election as commander. The election, which was acrimonious, ended in a close vote: Crawford received 235 votes to Williamson's 230. Colonel Crawford took command, and Williamson became second-in-command with the rank of major. The other majors included John B. McClelland, Thomas Gaddis, and either James Brenton or Joseph Brinton.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish coastal fortifications in Veracruz, Callao and Chiloé {{were the}} footholds that {{resisted}} until 1825 and 1826 respectively. In the following decade, royalist guerrillas continued {{to operate in}} several countries and Spain launched a few attempts to retake parts of the Spanish American mainland. In 1827 Colonel José Arizabalo started an irregular war with Venezuelan guerrillas, and Brigadier Isidro Barradas led the last attempt <b>with</b> <b>regular</b> troops to reconquer Mexico in 1829. The Pincheira brothers moved to Patagonia and remained there as royalist outlaws until defeated in 1832. But efforts like these did not reverse the new political situation.|$|E
5|$|The {{archipelago}} also {{is known}} as 'The Seven Hunters'. During the Middle Ages they also may have been called the 'Seven Haley (Holy) Isles'. Martin Martin (1703) lists a number of unusual customs associated <b>with</b> <b>regular</b> pilgrimages to Eilean Mòr, such as removing one's hat and making a sunwise turn when reaching the plateau. It {{is possible that the}} saint or his acolytes lived on Eilean Mòr and perhaps, on Eilean Taighe as well. It is unlikely, however, that there were permanent residents on the islands once the Celtic Church fell into decline in the Hebrides (as a result of ninth century Viking invasions), until the construction of the lighthouse and its occupation very shortly before the dawn of the twentieth century.|$|E
