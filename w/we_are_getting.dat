500|$|The soundtrack was {{released}} in the United States on November 12, 1996, almost {{two weeks before the}} release of the film. It was already in huge demand prior to its release, according to Tim Devin, manager of Tower Records. [...] "People are seriously clamouring for it. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> more inquiries about this record than anything else right now," [...] Devin explained to Billboards Larry Flick. Warner Bros. depended on pre-release press reviews, consumer curiosity and the singles from the soundtrack to keep the interest afloat, until the album {{was released}}. Jeff Gold, VP/GM of Warner Bros. declared the release as a [...] "worldwide event that has ignited public interest throughout each stage of its evolution".|$|E
500|$|At 10:37, CNN {{correspondent}} Aaron Brown, {{covering the}} collapse of the World Trade Center, announced, [...] "We are getting reports and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> lots of reports and we want to be careful to tell you when we have confirmed them and not, but we have a report that a 747 is down in Pennsylvania, and that remains unconfirmed at this point." [...] He followed that up at 10:49 by reporting that, [...] "We have a report now that a large plane crashed this morning, north of the Somerset County Airport, which is in western Pennsylvania, not too terribly far from Pittsburgh, about 80 miles or so, a Boeing 767 jet. Don't know whose airline it was, whose airplane it was, and we don't have any details beyond that which I have just given you." [...] In the confusion, he also erroneously reported a second hijacked plane heading for the Pentagon after the crash of the first.|$|E

5000|$|Suketu Patel, {{chairman}} of the Seychelles Football Federation (SFF) conceded [...] "We thought <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> the real Andy Morrison".|$|R

2500|$|In April 2016, Boeing {{announced}} that it would closely integrate its 767 and 747 programs. Bruce Dickinson, Vice President and General Manager for these programs said [...] "The 767 production line is quite full, so the pressure we see for that is growing. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> {{to the point where we}} will see by next year the line alternating as tanker-freighter-tanker-freighter." [...] More aircraft will be assembled on the 767 line in 2016 than delivered. About 22 KC-46 aircraft are to be built and an estimated 13 delivered during the year.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the fictional}} {{show and the}} network have {{competitive}} and financial difficulties. The network, according to Continental Corp's CFO, has an annual deficit up to $120 million. Although Sports Night does better than CNN/SI, Dana Whitaker says that Sports Night is [...] "in third place. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> our asses kicked by ESPN and Fox". Natalie Hurley replies, [...] "Every show on this network is in third place. It's a third-place network." [...] When Sports Night is asked to interview Michael Jordan about his new perfume, the retired basketball star's publicity team demands final cut privilege—something it would not ask Fox or ESPN—because it believes that Sports Night is more desperate for ratings.|$|E
2500|$|While {{emphasizing}} unity {{within the}} Muslim community, Warith Deen Mohammed called upon the American Muslim community {{to establish a}} new school of fiqh, a code of conduct for the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. He told ISLAMICA magazine in 2008 that he felt that the madhhab—the schools of thought within fiqh—were geographically influenced and should be regionally developed, suggesting that [...] "I think we are gradually getting a sense of madhabs in America, especially those like me. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> a sense of madhabs. And with the coming generation I think that we will be getting a much stronger sense of it. It is coming more and more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> {{too old to}} go to Putnam Hall--that <b>we</b> {{ought to}} <b>be</b> {{thinking}} of going to college, or of getting into business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{just been}} {{figuring}} {{up the last}} month's expenditures and receipts," [...] said he. [...] "The first month didn't count, for <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> started." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'While <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> it {{back again}} the parrot, {{which was in}} its cage, let out a squawk. Honest, I jumped a foot in my chair.|$|R

60|$|Practically <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> no good of our Demon;--and will dismiss him, after a taste or two more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold hard," [...] {{said the}} captain, {{in a low}} voice, for now that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> near our prey, we made as little noise as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... “No. I suppose it’s not likely. It {{would have}} been more {{comfortable}} to know. [...] . Here <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> <b>Get</b> out first, and walk straight in. Move smartly.” ...|$|R
6000|$|The foreman {{who came}} {{in a few minutes}} later to see that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> fed politely inquired, [...] "Is there {{anything}} else I can get you, miss?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> foreignized {{rapidly and}} with facility. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> {{reconciled}} to halls and bedchambers with unhomelike stone floors and no carpets--floors that ring to the tread of one's heels with a sharpness that is death to sentimental musing. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> used to tidy, noiseless waiters, who glide hither and thither, and hover about {{your back and}} your elbows like butterflies, quick to comprehend orders, quick to fill them; thankful for a gratuity {{without regard to the}} amount; and always polite--never otherwise than polite. That is the strangest curiosity yet--a really polite hotel waiter who isn't an idiot. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> used to driving right into the central court of the hotel, {{in the midst of a}} fragrant circle of vines and flowers, and in the midst also of parties of gentlemen sitting quietly reading the paper and smoking. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> used to ice frozen by artificial process in ordinary bottles --the only kind of ice they have here. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> used to all these things, but we are not getting used to carrying our own soap. We are sufficiently civilized to carry our own combs and toothbrushes, but this thing of having to ring for soap every time we wash is new to us and not pleasant at all. We think of it just after we get our heads and faces thoroughly wet or just when we think we have been in the bathtub long enough, and then, of course, an annoying delay follows. These Marseillaises make Marseillaise hymns and Marseilles vests and Marseilles soap for all the world, but they never sing their hymns or wear their vests or wash with their soap themselves.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why?' said he. 'Surely I {{have waited}} long! Life is short; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> older every day, and I am {{the last of}} the three.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Talk about excitement!" [...] {{cried the}} shipowner's son. [...] "I rather think <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> it! Rattlesnakes, deer, and a panther, {{all in one}} day and night!" ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{a really}} hippie town, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> really politicized, but also really into this DIY thing, so we kinda started creating. 'Let's make our own fanzine!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Hyannis is {{mentioned}} in the song [...] "Rock and Roll Band" [...] by Boston: [...] "Dancin' {{in the streets of}} Hyannis, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> pretty good at the game..." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hi! you let up!" [...] cried Dick, {{his face}} reddening. [...] "It wasn't that at all. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> pretty old for Putnam Hall, {{and you know}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurrah! <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> it!" [...] cried Andrew Dilks. [...] "Be {{sure and}} guide it right, Matt. Can you see, {{or is the}} smoke too thick for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't you {{remember}} our resolution against mere pleasure-hunting? That adventure at Interlachen {{seemed to be}} meant to bring us up short just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> into that line.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but that's dangerous!" [...] cried {{one of the}} {{students}} who had just been initiated. [...] "Why, the slide might come down just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> the lanterns!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Barrington's eyes twinkled but {{she shook}} her head. [...] "That," [...] she said, [...] "would be {{distinctly}} wrong of him, but I fancy it <b>is</b> time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{see what}} we can do on Thursday night," [...] she reflected. [...] "Good-by! I shall tell mother <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> along famously. Don't forget Thursday at eight o'clock." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick {{returned}} the other's smile. [...] "I fancy," [...] he said, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> short on both. It must {{be close to}} supper time now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Featherstone gloomily made {{a sign of}} agreement. [...] "I wish Lawrence {{would write}} to us. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> anxious about him and a letter would put our minds at rest." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{experience}} {{proved that}} it could work -- because it did in our case! I learned so much from it. I still wouldn’t consider the group world-class, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> there! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's a {{very unfortunate}} thing,' said the prim man. 'Just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> so {{comfortable}} too!' The prim man {{was just beginning}} to have a dawning recollection of the story he had forgotten.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after we}} {{returned}} in the afternoon, and while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> things {{in order for}} supper, we had a call from two of our neighbors, Captain Atkinson and wife. The captain greeted us hilariously.|$|R
