5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the {{subsequent}} development of the Trafford Park industrial estate {{in the north of}} the town– the first planned industrial estate in the world– had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.|$|E

5|$|The {{source of}} most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis, part of a {{geological}} formation known as the Blue Lias. This consists of alternating layers of limestone and shale, laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210–195million years ago). It {{is one of the}} richest fossil locations in Britain. The cliffs could be dangerously unstable, however, especially in winter when rain caused landslides. It was precisely during the winter months that collectors <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils.|$|E
5|$|As Northern Ireland's most {{dominant}} club side, Linfield have been regular campaigners in European football. The club first participated in European competition in 1959 against Göteborg in the 1959–60 European Cup. In {{the first round}} of the 1961–62 European Cup, Linfield <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> face an East German team, Vorwärts. The away leg was played, which Linfield lost 3–0. However, Vorwärts were denied visas for entry into the UK to play the second leg, and (similarly to Glenavon the previous season) travelling to play the game in a neutral country was not financially viable for Linfield. They were therefore forced to withdraw from the competition.|$|E
5|$|Glimmer and Taxable {{were very}} similar operations. They were {{executed}} {{in the early hours}} of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. Taxable simulated an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were able to create the illusion of a large fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the chaff, small boats towed radar reflector balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected of a large fleet. Once German forces <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain them in this region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.|$|E

5|$|Hieroglyphic texts at Seibal {{indicate}} that the city's newly refound vigour was sponsored by a new alliance formed by the cities of Caracol and Ucanal in the east, two sites that had so far survived the spreading Classic Maya collapse. It is likely that they were attempting to reopen the old Pasión-Usumacinta trade route and <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> Seibal by its defensible location overlooking the Pasión River. Seibal's refounding took place in AD 830 with the installation of Wat'ul Chatel as a vassal of Chan Ek' Hopet of Ucanal. The new king dedicated a new building and stelae in 849, overseen by Jewel K'awil of Tikal, and Chan Pet, king of Calakmul. Wat'ul Chatel built an innovative new temple-stelae arrangement {{to the south of}} the Central Plaza of GroupA. StructureA-3 consists of a low radial pyramid with an inventive arrangement of sculpted monuments.|$|E
5|$|However, many of Quwatli's {{generation}} were unimpressed with Faisal's leadership skills, and <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> a republican, {{rather than}} monarchist, view of governance. Furthermore, they were suspicious of Faisal, {{and his brother}} Abdullah's ties with the British. On 15 April 1919 they founded a loose coalition {{under the name of}} al-Istiqlal Party ("Independence Party"). The party had a pan-Arab, secular, anti-British and anti-Hashemite outlook and attracted mostly youth activists from the elite classes. Well-known members, other than Quwatli, included Adil Arslan, Nabih al-Azmeh, Riad al-Sulh, Saadallah al-Jabiri, Ahmad Qadri, Izzat Darwaza and Awni Abd al-Hadi. Although ostensibly working for the government, Quwatli devoted his efforts to nationalist activities outside the government's auspices. In addition to al-Istiqlal, he was {{also a member of the}} Palestinian-led Arab Club's Damascus branch.|$|E
5|$|In the 1979–80 European Cup, Linfield <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> face Dundalk {{from the}} Republic of Ireland. In the first leg, which was played in Dundalk {{and ended in}} a 1–1 draw, crowd {{disturbance}} prompted UEFA to switch the second leg to the Haarlem Stadion, Netherlands. Linfield were held almost entirely accountable for the events, and were forced to pay Dundalk's costs {{to travel to the}} Netherlands as well as an additional £5,000 for damage sustained to Oriel Park. Dundalk were fined £870 for providing insufficient security at the match. Dundalk eventually won the match 2–0 to progress 3–1 on aggregate. In the 1987–88 campaign, Linfield's home game against Lillestrøm was marred by missile throwing, resulting in UEFA sanctions which meant that the club had to play their next two home games in European competitions at Welsh club Wrexham in 1988–89 and 1989–90.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{superstring}} revolution in 1984, many physicists turned to string theory {{as a unified}} theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of string theory that many physicists <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian. In string theory, the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals Dunfermline faced Airdrie United, a {{competitor}} in the Second Division, {{away from home}} at the Excelsior Stadium. The score was goalless at half time but Burchill's two goals {{in the second half}} after 54 and 81 minutes respectively sealed a 2–0 win to progress to the semi-finals. With four teams left in the tournament Dunfermline <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> play Ayr United, also of the Second Division, at home at East End Park. Similar to the previous round, the scoreline was 0–0 for most of the game before Glass scored a late winner for Dunfermline in the 83rd minute to win 1–0 and send Dunfermline into their first Challenge Cup final.|$|E

5|$|The Football League Cup is a cup {{competition}} open to {{clubs in}} the Premier League and Football League. Like the FA Cup it is played on a knockout basis, {{with the exception of}} the second round and semi-finals, which are contested over a two-legged tie. Together with the other clubs playing in European competitions, Arsenal entered the Football League Cup in the third round. The team <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> face Manchester City, on the week of 25 October 2004. Wenger fielded a relatively young team for the tie, which took the lead in the second half when Van Persie scored. Daniel Karbassiyoon extended the visitor's lead in the 90th minute, just before Manchester City striker Robbie Fowler scored from a free-kick.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{has grown}} in Dorset since the late 18th century {{and is now the}} {{predominant}} industry. It is estimated that 37,500 people work in Dorset's tourism sector. Some 3.2million British and 326,000 foreign tourists visited the county in 2008, staying a total of 15.1 million nights. In addition there were 14.6million day visitors. The combined spending of both groups was £1,458million. Towns received 56% of Dorset's day trippers, 27% went to the coast and 17% to the countryside. A survey carried out in 1997 concluded that the primary reason tourists <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> Dorset was the attractiveness of the county's coast and countryside. Numbers of domestic and foreign tourists have fluctuated in recent years due to various factors including security and economic downturn, a trend reflected throughout the UK.|$|E
5|$|Wrexham <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> play West Ham United in {{the fourth}} round, where they secured a 2–2 draw at the Boleyn Ground thanks to goals from Wayne Phillips and Lee Jones. The replay was played on 4 February with a solitary West Ham goal coming from defender Colin Foster, {{securing}} a 1–0 win in front of 17,995 fans at the Racecourse Ground. Arsenal's league form in the meantime stuttered as they recorded no wins in January. The team ended the campaign strongly, putting together a sequence of 16 games unbeaten to finish fourth. In the cup competitions the following season Arsenal performed better; Graham guided his team to success in the Football League and FA Cup finals.|$|E

5|$|After {{handing over}} the {{earrings}} and taking leave of his guru, Uttanka went to Hastinapur, {{the kingdom of}} King Janamejaya. He resolved to teach a lesson to Takshaka who had caused him trouble. He informed Janamejaya that it was Takshaka who had killed his father Parikshit and advised Janamejaya to perform a snake sacrifice to exterminate the serpents. Uttanka {{was one of the}} rishis who participated in the Sarpa Satra yagna initiated by the king. Sarpa Satra was meant to draw all serpents to the sacrificial fire to certain death by the chanting of mantras. After the serpents started falling into the sacrificial fire, Takshaka was not to be found anywhere. Uttanka then recited the mantras with great vigour to draw Takshaka to the fire. In mortal fear, Taskshaka took shelter with Indra and got himself tied to the throne of Indra for protection. Uttanka, who realised that Takshaka had taken refuge with Indra, intensified his mantras to ensure that not only Takshaka but also Indra along with his throne <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the fire. Indra freed the snake from the throne and escaped. However, when Takshaka was about to drop to death into the sacrificial fire, Astika, a young boy well versed in scriptures, son of the sage Jaratkaru intervened with Janamejaya. Astika ensured that the Sarpa Satra was stopped and the life of Takshaka was saved.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic mammals {{are also}} present in the bay. Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the Bay Area to harvest prodigious {{quantities}} of beaver, river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals and sea otter. This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was {{more than any other}} single factor, responsible for opening up the West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. Since then, the California golden beaver has re-established a presence in the Alhambra Creek. The North American river otter which was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, has since been spotted in the North Bay's Corte Madera Creek, the South Bay's Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina. Other mammals include the internationally famous sea lions who began inhabiting San Francisco's Pier 39 after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the locally famous Humphrey the Whale, a humpback whale who entered San Francisco Bay twice on errant migrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises have recently returned to the bay, having been absent for many decades. Historically, this was the northern extent of their warm-water species range.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> face Leeds United away in {{the third}} round; the match was played on the first weekend of January. Wenger made six changes to the team which started at Southampton in the league, {{including}} Cole replacing Clichy at left-back after serving his three-match suspension. After eight minutes, Leeds went ahead when Lehmann's goal clearance hit striker Mark Viduka and rebounded into the net. Arsenal equalised through Henry, who converted Ljungberg's cross from the right on a volley. Additional goals from Edu, Pirès and Touré inflicted a third consecutive 4–1 defeat for Leeds against Arsenal at Elland Road. At home to Middlesbrough in the fourth round, Bergkamp opened the scoring for Arsenal, following good play from Parlour. Joseph-Désiré Job equalised for the away team four minutes after, but Ljungberg restored Arsenal's lead with a shot outside the penalty box and scored a second, direct from a corner. George Boateng was sent off for the visitors in the 86th minute for two bookable offences and substitute David Bentley added a fourth goal for Arsenal, chipping the ball over goalkeeper Schwarzer in the last minute of normal time.|$|E
