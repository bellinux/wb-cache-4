40|$|Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid)</b> has severe {{economic}} impacts on wheat and barley {{production in the}} United States. The interaction between the Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> and its cereal hosts is poorly understood. However, the recent appearance of new biotypes in the United States showed that specific interactions exist between wheat resistance loci and Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> biotypes. At present, Dn 7 is the only known gene in hexaploid wheat that confers resistance against all U. S. Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> biotypes. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the molecular mechanism of Dn 7 -mediated resistance against two U. S. Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> biotypes (Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> 1 and Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> 2). Using GeneChip Wheat Genome Arrays, we compared transcript profiles of resistant and susceptible lines infested with either Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> 1 or Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> 2 using two time intervals (5 and 48 h after infestation). Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> feeding on hexaploid wheat led to the induction of groups of genes functioning in oxidative and general stress, photosynthesis, cell respiration and energy production, signal transduction, calcium- dependent signaling, pathogenesis related (PR) responses, and defense compound synthesis. The number of differentially expressed genes was higher in plants infested with Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> 1 compared with those infested with Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> 2. Although most genes involved in basic cellular functions were shared, unique genes were also obtained. This finding may indicate subtle differences in genes induced in response to different virulence proteins...|$|R

A split plot field trial was undertaken firstly to compare the yield of susceptible wheat to that of a near-isogenic resistant wheat cultivar in combination with insecticide treatments and secondly to determine whether the inclusion of Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> resistance influences the bread-making quality of the cultivar. Resistant wheat yielded higher indicating that the resistance is effective under field conditions. Seed treatment with Imidacloprid increased yield of wheat in both years.

40|$|Effect of {{different}} landscape patterns on insect distribution and diversity {{was determined by}} studying wheat fields in complex and simple agricultural landscapes. We studied the influence of simple and complex agricultural landscapes on <b>wheat</b> <b>aphids</b> and their natural enemies {{in terms of the}} time of migration, abundance, population growth rate of the aphids and parasitoid abundance. The results indicate that the diversity of natural enemies is greater in the complex agricultural landscape and the effect of natural enemies on the abundance of <b>wheat</b> <b>aphids</b> was greater in the complex non-crop habitat. <b>Wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> hyperparasitoid populations differed in different agricultural landscapes with a greater number of parasites in complex agricultural landscapes.

40|$|Plants {{possess a}} complex and poorly {{understood}} network of defence mechanisms {{that enable them to}} counteract the effects of abiotic and biotic stress. Aphid phloem feeding is source of biotic stress in plants. Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid feeding cause significant losses in the annual wheat crop, and control by conventional methods such as pesticide application, has proved to be ineffective. Infestation by the Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> has a particularly devastating effect in South Africa. Aphid-resistant wheat cultivars have been identified but an incomplete understanding of the mechanism of the plant’s resistance thwarts the development of improved cultivars. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis method was developed, partially optimised and validated {{in order to determine the}} effect of Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid phloem feeding on the Betta and Betta DN wheat proteome. Differentially expressed proteins that were up or down regulated more than two fold were identified using PDQuest™ Basic software and matched to known wheat proteins stored in the SwissProt protein database on the basis of their molecular mass and isolectric point. Initial analysis of the differential protein expression of Betta and Betta DN wheat in response to Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> and Bird Cherry-Oat aphid phloem feeding at different growth stages revealed that younger plants display higher levels of resistance than older plants. Feeding by the Bird-Cherry Oat aphid does not result in the upregulation of proteins implicated in a defence response, which indicates that the damage incurred by the plant due to feeding by this aphid is not enough to trigger a classic defence response. Feeding by the more damaging Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> resulted in a stress response in susceptible wheat cultivar Betta, and a defence response in resistant wheat cultivar Betta DN. The infestation of Betta DN resulted in the upregulation of putative thaumatins and amylase trypsin inhibitors, indicating that the Betta DN resistance response could be due to the combined effect of protease inhibitors that discourage aphid phloem feeding and the activation of the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid plant defence pathways...|$|R

40|$|As cereal aphids {{are only}} present during 2 - 3 {{months per year}} in cereal crops, their parasitoids rely on {{alternative}} hosts to complete their life cycle. These parasitoids often have the same aphid hosts, which leads to apparent competition. Development on alternative host may increase parasitoid abundance and consequently increase their pressure on cereal aphids. Intensive agriculture frequently reduces the availability of non-crop habitats where alternative aphids may be present. The apparent competition hypothesis was examined in two traditional wheat plots compared to two other plots, with strips of alternative host aphids on leguminosae (red clover and alfalfa) and graminae (ryegrass and meadow fescue). In June/July, parasitism on <b>wheat</b> <b>aphids</b> (Metopolophium dirhodum, Sitobion avenae, and Rhopalosiphum padi) was higher in 1998 than in 1997, in all the plots studied. During summer 1998, significantly more parasitised <b>wheat</b> <b>aphids</b> were found in strip-designed plots than in the controls, and this higher parasitism rate was positively correlated to a higher parasitoid activity during May, due {{to the presence of}} alternative hosts. The interaction between <b>wheat</b> <b>aphids</b> in summer and aphids in the strips in spring is an example of apparent competition, mediated by shared parasitoids. Alternative hosts allow parasitoids to increase their numbers and consequently to apply a higher pressure on <b>aphids</b> in <b>wheat</b> crops. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} showed the {{virulence}} of EPF (B. bassiana and M. anisopliae) and botanicals extracts (neem and eucalyptus) against the <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> species (S. avenae). B. bassiana was significantly effective when applied singly {{or in combination}} with eucalyptus leaf extract. EPF, B. bassiana caused higher mortality rates among the treated <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> due to mycosis, secreting specific hydrolytic enzyme such as proteinase, chitinase, and lipase. Hydrolytic enzyme acts as a cuticle degrading enzyme (Fang et al. 2005). Metarhizium had less efficacy compared to B. bassiana. However, it caused more than (60 %) mortality at a single or a binary mixture treatment. Previously, B. bassiana and M. anisopliae showed deleterious effects to different aphid species (Kim et al. 2013 and Saleh et al. 2016). Neem and eucalyptus extracts also caused higher mortality rates in the <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid,</b> followed by B. bassiana. Fatalities caused by neem and eucalyptus are well documented showing that neem-based products and certain botanicals like eucalyptus had a good potential to minimize the populations of different aphid species by reducing their survival and fecundity with their physical and biological actions (Pavela et al. 2004; Patil and Chavan 2009; Nia et al. 2015 and Sharma et al. 2016). The richness of terpenoids, alkenes, alkanes, alkyl halides, and like compounds in these plant extracts might give deleterious fate to the treated aphids (Nia et al. 2015; and Sharma et al. 2016).|$|R

40|$|Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid)</b> is an {{economically}} significant pest in wheat-growing areas, {{particularly in the}} U. S. and South Africa. The interaction between wheat and the Russian <b>wheat</b> <b>aphid</b> is poorly understood. When new biotypes appeared in the U. S. between 2003 and 2006, it became evident that specific interactions exist between resistance loci and aphid biotypes. Dn 7 provides {{a high level of}} resistance to eight currently existing biotypes. This study was conducted to gain a greater understanding of Dn 7 -mediated resistance to two different biotypes (RWA 1 and RWA 2). Using wheat Genechip ® arrays, we compared the transcript profiles of resistant and susceptible lines (94 M 370 and Gamtoos) infested with either RWA 1 or RWA 2. The number of differentially expressed genes was higher in both resistant and susceptible plants fed upon by RWA 1 compared to those fed upon by RWA 2. Common sets of genes in response to both biotypes were involved in basic functions such as carbohydrate metabolism and energy generation. Common genes also included cell wall synthesis enzyme genes, and defense-response or stress-related genes. Many genes that were unique to RWA 1 or RWA 2 response were transcription factors. The results suggest that while common pathways are involved in Dn 7 -mediated resistance to RWA 1 or RWA 2 attack, divergent pathways appear to be involved as well.

40|$|The <b>wheat</b> <b>aphids,</b> Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus) and Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), are key pests on wheat crops worldwide. Management {{practices}} rely {{primarily on}} insecticides. The pirimicarb (carbamate) is used extensively {{as an effective}} insecticide to control these two aphids. In addition to the mortality caused by pirimicarb, various sublethal effects may occur in aphids when exposed to low lethal or sublethal doses. Understanding the general effect of pirimicarb on aphids could help increasing rational use of this insecticide. Under laboratory conditions, we assessed the sublethal effects of a low lethal concentration of pirimicarb (LC 25) on biological traits and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of R. padi and S. avenae. Both direct and transgenerational effects, i. e. on parent and the F 1 generations were assessed, respectively. We found that R. padi and S. avenae responded differentially to the LC 25 of pirimicarb. The parent generation of R. padi showed a 39 % decrease in fecundity and multiple transgenerational effects were observed in the F 1 generation; overall juvenile development, reproductive period, adult longevity and lifespan were longer {{than those of the}} control group. By contrast, LC 25 of pirimicarb showed almost no effects on S. avenae biological traits in both the parent and F 1 generations; only the pre-reproductive duration was reduced in F 1 generations. Demographic parameter estimates (e. g. rm) showed similar trend, i. e. significant negative effect on R. padi population growth and no effect on S. avenae. However, AChE activity decreased in both R. padi and S. avenae treated by the LC 25 of pirimicarb.

After 5 [*]days of applications, the combined mixture of B. bassiana and eucalyptus extract caused the maximum mortality rate (87 %). While the combination of B. bassiana with neem extract showed the least rate (54 %). Fecundity was negatively affected by the single and combined treatments of EPF and botanicals extracts. The lowest fecundity (7 nymphs per female) was recorded when the aphid was treated by the binary mixture of B. bassiana and eucalyptus extract. Correspondent maximum fecundity (29 nymphs per female) in 5 [*]days was recorded in control treatment, while 23 nymphs were produced by a single female when treated with the binary mixture of B. bassiana and neem extract.
