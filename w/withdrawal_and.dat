5|$|After an {{incident}} involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began {{between the two}} countries. Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government ordered its troops to make only token resistance, and evacuated between ten thousand and fifteen thousand people from the border region, trusting the League to settle the dispute. The League condemned the Greek invasion, and called for both Greek <b>withdrawal</b> <b>and</b> compensation to Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|Aronofsky {{originally}} planned to direct The Fountain on a $70 million budget with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett {{in the lead}} roles, but Pitt's <b>withdrawal</b> <b>and</b> cost overruns led Warner Bros. to shut down his production. The director rewrote the script to be sparser, {{and was able to}} resurrect the film with a $35 million budget with Jackman and Weisz in the lead roles. Production mainly took place on a sound stage in Montreal, Quebec, and the director used macro photography to create key visual effects for The Fountain at a low cost.|$|E
5|$|At 09:00 Sefik {{and his two}} battalions were {{approaching}} Kavak Tepe, and made contact with his 2nd Battalion that had conducted a fighting <b>withdrawal,</b> <b>and</b> {{an hour and a}} half later the regiment was deployed to stop the ANZACs advancing any further. Around 10:00 Kemal arrived at Scrubby Knoll and steadied some retreating troops, pushing them back into a defensive position. As they arrived, the 57th Infantry Regiment were given their orders and prepared to counter-attack. Scrubby Knoll, known to the Turks as Kemalyeri (Kemal's Place), now became the site of the Turkish headquarters for the remainder of the campaign.|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of July 25 North Korean forces had {{infiltrated}} {{the positions of the}} 1st Cavalry Division so thoroughly that they were disrupting its lines of supply, and Gay ordered the division to <b>withdrawal</b> <b>and</b> re-form its lines further south. Northwest of Yongdong, 1st Battalion executed an orderly withdrawal, covered by the fire of the Heavy Mortar Company and the two batteries of the 77th Field Artillery Battalion. The mortar operators fought as infantry in the withdrawal. During these retreats North Korean troops disguised themselves as refugees and would form roadblocks in the UN troops' rear areas, or used hidden communications equipment to inform higher commands of UN concentrations so those concentrations could be attacked when they were most vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|By then, Farnese, unwilling {{of having}} {{for a longer}} time his troops close to Antwerp's cannons, made drums and {{trumpets}} to call for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>and</b> gathered his men at Borgerhout. Meanwhile, people from Antwerp sallied to carry the wounded French, British and Walloon officers and soldiers into the city to receive treatment. The Spanish soldiery, once the fire of Borgerhout was finished, looted the basements of the burned buildings and had a meal before praying to thank God. After that, the Spanish Army marched across the roads of Lier and Herentals to Turnhout, where Farnese wanted to arrive the next day.

5|$|CANBAT 1 was {{expected}} to deploy one mechanised company each to the JORDBAT and the NEPBAT AORs to position themselves defensively. The forces would attempt to deter the HV from advancing, demonstrate its resolve to defend Sector West, engage the HV with antitank weapons and mortars, protect the Jordanian and Nepalese <b>withdrawal</b> <b>and</b> withdraw {{under the protection of}} CANBAT 1. The two companies required eight hours notice of the HV advance to reach their designated positions in time. Presumably, the ARSK would retrieve its heavy weapons from the UNPROFOR storage by force and resist the HV.|$|E

5|$|Hindered by total Allied {{air superiority}} and a {{large-scale}} uprising by the French Resistance, the weak German forces were swiftly defeated. The Germans decided to withdraw towards the north through the Rhône valley, {{to establish a}} stable defense line at Dijon. Allied mobile units were able to overtake the Germans and partially block their route at the town of Montélimar. The ensuing battle led to a stalemate, with neither side able to achieve a decisive breakthrough, until the Germans were finally able to complete their <b>withdrawal</b> <b>and</b> retreat from the town. While the Germans were retreating, the French managed to capture the important ports of Marseille and Toulon, putting them into operation soon after.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, Buckner was a {{candidate}} for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Other prominent candidates included Congressman Thomas Laurens Jones, former congressman J.

The delegation from Owsley County switched their support to Knott, starting a wave of defections that resulted in Jones' <b>withdrawal</b> <b>and</b> Knott's unanimous nomination. Knott {{went on to win the}} general election and appointed Buckner to the board of trustees for the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the University of Kentucky) in 1884.

5|$|In July 1989 Ali Alatas joined French foreign {{minister}} Roland Dumas in opening the Paris Peace Conference, where discussions took place regarding plans for Vietnamese troop <b>withdrawal</b> <b>and</b> power-sharing arrangements in a hypothetical future Cambodian government.

The creation of the SNC was subsequently ratified with United Nations Security Council Resolution 668.

40|$|We {{test for}} the {{presence}} of market discipline in the banking sector in early-twentieth-century Mexico. Using financial data from note-issuing banks between 1900 and 1910, we examine whether bank fundamentals influenced the patterns of <b>withdrawals</b> <b>and</b> of note issue. We show that fundamentals were a strong determinant of bank <b>withdrawals</b> <b>and</b> note issue, indicating that market discipline was an important feature of the banking system in this period. This result crucially depends on correcting for selection bias generated by the exit of several banks in the 1907 crisis. ...|$|R
5|$|It {{is known}} from Byzantine sources that the Rus' caught Constantinople unprepared, while the empire was preoccupied by the ongoing Arab–Byzantine wars {{and unable to}} deal with the Rus' threat.
