5|$|Upon arrival, the {{children}} were exhausted and virtually naked. Their appearance was skeletal, especially those transported from Stara Gradiška. Many had swollen bellies due to malnourishment, thin pale faces, and teeth falling out. Almost all <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> from severe diarrhea, and most had multiple diseases. Some children died after the effort of simply getting up.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Genesis <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> from press {{attention}} being exclusively {{directed towards}} frontman Gabriel {{at the expense}} of the rest of the band, a notable factor that ultimately led to Gabriel leaving the group in 1975. They took an extended break in 1974 following the Selling England by the Pound tour; Collins joined a side project, Brand X, while Rutherford worked with former Genesis guitarist Anthony Phillips.|$|E

"The Noble Truth of <b>Suffering</b> (dukkha), monks, <b>is</b> this: birth (jati) <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> aging <b>is</b> <b>suffering...,</b> death <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> {{association}} with the unpleasant <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> dissociation from the pleasant <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> not to receive what one desires is suffering—in brief the five aggregates subject to grasping are suffering." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the Buddha's first discourse, Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (SN 56.11), the Buddha is {{recorded}} as defining [...] "suffering" [...] (dukkha) {{in a manner}} that incorporates the first four remembrances: [...] "Birth <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> aging <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> sickness <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> death <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> association with the unpleasant <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> dissociation from the pleasant <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> not to receive what one desires is suffering...." [...] This formula is reiterated throughout the Pali Canon.|$|R
5000|$|Now this, bhikkhus, is {{the noble}} truth of <b>suffering</b> dukkha: birth <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> aging <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> illness (byādhi) <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> death <b>is</b> suffering; union {{with what is}} displeasing is suffering; {{separation}} from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging <b>are</b> <b>suffering.</b>|$|R
5|$|From {{the death}} of Queen Mary in 1953 Elizabeth was viewed as the matriarch of the British royal family. In her later years, she was a {{consistently}} popular member of the family, even when other members <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> from low levels of public approval. She continued an active public life until {{just a few months}} before her death at the age of 101, seven weeks after {{the death of}} her younger daughter, Princess Margaret.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients {{looked like they were}} close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, in 1902, Scott, {{a native}} commissioner, brought to Clarke's {{attention}} that many work-seekers <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> great privation yet {{were unable to}} find work while some businesses were short of labour. Clarke took up the cause: 'This indicates the necessity of the organisation of an Association for bringing those wanting labour and those seeking employment into contact and prevent, what I have myself seen, gangs of destitute natives wandering about the country.' In 1903, a Rhodesian Native Labour Bureau was proposed.|$|E

5|$|Shoup {{argued that}} among the Vietnamese forces {{involved}} {{in the civil war}} there were nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention. He opposed many of the strategies associated with troop escalation, notably the air campaign over North Vietnam, which he saw as an aggressive measure causing civilian casualties that could draw the People's Republic of China or the Soviet Union into the conflict. He also feared that other American interests, including the economy, <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> through U.S. involvement in the war, and that the U.S. was losing prestige internationally.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans, in the meantime, <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> serious {{logistics}} {{problems which}} {{prevented them from}} supplying their troops effectively with ammunition, food, and medical care. At the same time, elements of the division, including thousands of people forcibly conscripted from South Korea, were becoming increasingly hard to keep in place. The division was having difficulty strengthening its position at Haman.|$|E
5|$|The parlous {{state of}} the children's health is {{apparent}} when at one point, 400 <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> from dysentery, 300 had measles, 200 had typhoid, 200 had diphtheria and another 100 had mumps. Many children were also suffering from scurvy due to the poor diet. Monthly mortality figures were: July– 153; August– 216; September– 67; and October– 8. To these can be added five children who died in hospital in Zagreb, {{for a total of}} 449.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, a 19-month-old infant from Qatar <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> from {{a mysterious}} illness.

5000|$|In late January 1917, Rouse's doctor {{discovered}} {{he had made}} a degree of progress in his recuperation from his leg injury and believed this injury could, by Rouse's own endeavour, be overcome. A year later, Rouse informed his doctor he <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> from bouts of dizziness, although the doctor noted how talkative Rouse was; even [...] "laughing immoderately at times". In September 1918, Rouse again complained that he <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> from a defective memory. Moreover, Rouse complained on this occasion to <b>be</b> <b>suffering</b> from insomnia.|$|R
5|$|Two of Benning's Confederate regiments, the 2nd and 17th Georgia, {{moved down}} Plum Run Valley around Ward's flank. They {{received}} murderous {{fire from the}} 99th Pennsylvania and Hazlett's battery on Little Round Top, but they kept pushing forward. Capt. Smith's New York battery was under severe pressure from three sides, but its supporting infantry regiments <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> severe casualties and could not protect it. Three 10-pound Parrott rifles were lost to the 1st Texas, and they were used against Union troops the next day.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed, but by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> badly from the Wigner effect, so six Little Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base. The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built another 25 Little Boy assemblies in 1947 {{for use by the}} Lockheed P2V Neptune nuclear strike aircraft (which could be launched from, but not land on, the Midway-class aircraft carriers). All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951.|$|E
5|$|Birks took {{classes at}} the Australian 1st Division school in France, and was {{commissioned}} as a second lieutenant in the 6th Battalion on 4 May 1917. He had served with the battalion earlier while a stretcher bearer, and began serving as an infantryman at Passchendaele. Passchendaele was characterised by the mud of the battlefield, and has been widely used {{as an example of}} attrition warfare—both the Commonwealth and German forces <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> heavy casualties. When the Fifth Army was failing to make any appreciable headway, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig put General Herbert Plumer in command of the offensive.|$|E

5|$|Central to the UN {{defensive}} {{plan was}} to hold the port of Pusan, where vital ground supplies and reinforcements were arriving from Japan and the US. Pusan possessed airfields where US combat and cargo aircraft were streaming into Korea with more supplies. A system similar to the Red Ball Express in World War II was employed to get supplies from Pusan to the front lines. Hundreds of ships arrived in Pusan each month, starting with 230 in July and increasing steadily thereafter. On July 24, the UN established its highest command under General of the Army Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo, Japan. North Korean forces in the meantime <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> from overextended supply lines which severely reduced their fighting capacity.|$|E
5|$|Dmitri Shostakovich had {{intended}} the piece to be premièred by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra, {{but because of}} the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself. The world première of the symphony was held on 5 March in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert.|$|E
5|$|Expectations {{were high}} for the 2008 season, but Cleveland {{finished}} last in the AFC North with a 4–12 record. Anderson shared starts with Ken Dorsey, who the Browns had acquired by trading away Trent Dilfer, and Brady Quinn, a young quarterback the team drafted in 2007. The Browns never contended during 2008 and failed to score a touchdown in the final six games. Near {{the end of the}} season, two scandals shook the team. It was revealed that several Browns players, including Winslow, <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> from staph infections, which raised questions about sanitation in the Browns' Berea practice facilities. In November, Savage found himself {{in the center of a}} media storm after an angry e-mail exchange with a fan was published on Deadspin, a sports blog. Shortly after the final game, a 31–0 loss to the Steelers, Lerner fired Savage and, a day later, Crennel.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the French government's anger against Morocco was increasing. A {{series of}} {{incidents}} in October 1849 damaged relations between both countries; {{a series of}} assassinations directed at the French frontier had occurred, and the French Consul had requested the dismissal of Pacha Ouchda, who was believed to have caused these issues. From 1845 to 1851, Morocco had a serious agricultural crisis caused by a drought, resulting in crop failure. The people of Morocco <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> {{as the price of}} wheat and barley reached unprecedented heights. In Salé, many people were starving, and the agricultural crisis and anger towards France ultimately led to the bombardment of Salé.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{many white}} Zimbabweans {{complained that they}} <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> from racial discrimination. Many whites {{remained}} uneasy about living under the government of a black Marxist and they also feared that their children {{would be unable to}} secure jobs. There was a growing exodus to South Africa, and in 1980, 1700 whites—approximately a tenth of the white Zimbabwean population—emigrated. Mugabe's government had pledged support for the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid forces within South Africa, although did not allow them to use Zimbabwe as a base for their military operations. To protest apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, Mugabe's government banned Zimbabwe from engaging South Africa in any sporting competitions. In turn, South Africa tried to destabilise Zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into the country and supporting anti-Mugabist militants among the country's white minority.|$|E
5|$|Shein {{constructed}} {{lines of}} circumvallation around the fortress. Using tunnels and mines, his forces damaged a long {{section of the}} city wall and one of its towers. Russian heavy artillery, mostly of Western manufacture, reached Smolensk in December 1632 with even heavier guns arriving the following March. After a preliminary artillery bombardment, Shein ordered an assault, which was repulsed by the Polish defenders. Nonetheless the siege was progressing; Smolensk's fortifications were being eroded, and the defenders <b>were</b> <b>suffering</b> heavy casualties and running out of supplies. By June 1633, some soldiers started to desert, and others talked of surrender.|$|E
