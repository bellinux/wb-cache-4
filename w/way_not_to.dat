25|$|I do feel strongly, {{after my}} {{subcommittee}} has carefully and objectively reviewed this case from both sides, that injustice rather than justice has been served. The Moon case sends a strong signal that if one's views are unpopular enough, {{this country will}} find a <b>way</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> tolerate, but to convict. I don't believe that you or I or anyone else, no matter how innocent, could realistically prevail against the combined forces of our Justice Department and judicial branch in a case such as Reverend Moon's.|$|E
25|$|Peter Singer, in Democracy and Disobedience, {{argues that}} {{compulsory}} voting could negate {{the obligation of}} a voter to support {{the outcome of the}} election, since voluntary participation in elections is deemed {{to be one of the}} sources of the obligation to obey the law in a democracy. In 1996 Albert Langer was jailed for three weeks on contempt charges in relation to a constitutional challenge on a legal <b>way</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> vote for either of the major parties. Chong, Davidson and Fry, writing in the journal of the right wing think tank the CIS, argue that Australian compulsory voting is disreputable, paternalistic, disadvantages smaller political parties, and allows major parties to target marginal seats and make some savings in pork-barrelling because of this targeting. Chong et al. also argue that denial is a significant aspect of the debate about compulsory voting.|$|E

Despite other students' attempts to thwart their dreams, Troy and Gabriella resist peer pressure and rivalry, inspiring others along the <b>way</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> [...] "stick to the status quo".
