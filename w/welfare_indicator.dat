40|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to carry out an assessment of welfare in an entirely objective manner. The choice of <b>welfare</b> <b>indicators,</b> as well as the assignment of relative weightings to these indicators, both involve a certain degree of subjectivity. The aim {{of this study was to}} create a possible method of dealing with this subjectivity, using the opinions of groups of experts to increase the consensus for a protocol for the on-farm assessment of laying-hen welfare. The selection of the 17 separate <b>welfare</b> <b>indicators</b> was based both on a questionnaire submitted to 18 international poultry welfare experts and on the practical feasibility of collecting the respective data during a one-day farm visit. Subsequently, a second group of 13 experts was asked to assign relative weightings to the <b>welfare</b> <b>indicators</b> in this protocol. This assessment was carried out twice, once with and once without provision of detailed information on the <b>welfare</b> <b>indicators.</b> When detailed information was provided, the weightings assigned to the <b>welfare</b> <b>indicators</b> were generally lower than when no detailed information was provided. In conclusion, subjectivity regarding the choice of <b>welfare</b> <b>indicators</b> and the assignment of their relative weightings, can be dealt with and made transparent by seeking consensus among experts. Although the choice of experts, the methodology for extracting consensus data, and the nature and amount of information on the <b>welfare</b> <b>indicators</b> that should be provided, are likely to benefit from further refinement, the data presented in this study should be valuable for the development and application of formalised protocols for an integrated assessment of the welfare of laying hens, on-farm...|$|R

In the corresponding carcasses, the following traits were measured: wattle width, eye length, and first secondary feather length.

40|$|Employing total {{consumption}} as a household-level <b>welfare</b> <b>indicator</b> {{with which to}} measure poverty has often been criticised because it is felt that such an indicator {{does not account for}} differing access to, and cost of, publicly provided services. This paper discusses when and how adjustments can be made to expenditures derived from household surveys so as to reflect the consumption of basic services. Markets which are subsidised, rationed and subject to increasing marginal tariff pricing are examined and simple adjustment methods are discussed. Using Ecuador to illustrate the methods, the paper shows that incorporating adjustments in markets for water, electricity and cooking gas can significantly alter poverty estimates. Including such adjustments into a comprehensive measure of welfare can therefore be important and can also contribute to the wider acceptance and use of consumption as a <b>welfare</b> <b>indicator</b> guiding public policy development. 1...|$|E

This study analyzed multidimensional poverty in Nigeria by using the 2006 Core <b>Welfare</b> <b>Indicator</b> Survey (CWIQ) data. Fuzzy set approach was used to assess the poverty profile of the rural households in Nigeria. The study decomposed multidimensional poverty across the zones, states, and the socio-economic groups of rural households.

The result shows that the multidimensional poverty for the rural Nigeria is 0. 3796.

40|$|In recent years, a {{large body}} of {{empirical}} work has focused on measuring and explaining socioeconomic inequalities in health outcomes and health service use. In any effort to address these questions, analysts must confront the issue of how to measure socioeconomic status. In developing countries, socioeconomic status has typically been measured by per capita consumption or an asset index. Currently, there is only limited information on how the choice of welfare indicators affect the analysis of health inequalities and the incidence of public spending. The paper focuses on five key health service outcomes in Mozambique. It uses the concentration index approach to measures both socioeconomic inequality in the utilization of health services and the sensitivity of measured inequality to the choice of <b>welfare</b> <b>indicator.</b> The results illustrate that, at least in some contexts, the choice of <b>welfare</b> <b>indicator</b> can have a large and significant impact on socioeconomic inequalities in service use and on the “perceived ” incidence of public spending.
