40|$|MDM 2 {{is a major}} {{regulator}} of p 53 {{by acting}} as a ubiquitin E 3 ligase. The central acidic domain and C-terminal RING domain of MDM 2 are both indispensable for ubiquitination of p 53. Our previous study suggested that ATM phosphorylation of MDM 2 near the C terminus <b>inhibits</b> <b>RING</b> domain oligomerization, resulting in p 53 stabilization after DNA damage. We present here evidence that these modifications allosterically regulate the functions of both acidic domain and RING domain of MDM 2. Using chemical cross-linking, we show that the MDM 2 RING domain forms oligomers including dimer and higher-order complexes in vivo. RING domain dimerization efficiency is negatively regulated by upstream sequence. ATM-mediated phosphorylation of the upstream sequence further <b>inhibits</b> <b>RING</b> dimerization. Forced oligomerization of MDM 2 partially overcomes the inhibitory effect of phosphorylation and stimulates p 53 ubiquitination. Furthermore, the ability of MDM 2 acidic domain to bind p 53 core domain and induce p 53 misfolding are also suppressed by the same C-terminal ATM sites after DNA damage. These {{results suggest that the}} acidic domain and RING domain of MDM 2 are both allosterically coupled to the intervening ATM sites, which enables the same modification to regulate multiple MDM 2 functions critical for p 53 ubiquitination...|$|R

By analytically integrating the equation of motion for particles in the equatorial plane of a rotating cloud which collapses in a gravitational potential well defined by a (1 - r-squared) mass density distribution the mechanism which initiates {{the growth of the}} toroidal structure is demonstrated. An analysis of the ring formation process indicates that the ring should develop in rotating, self-gravitating gas clouds which collapse {{from a wide range of}} axisymmetric intial conditions; the degree of central condensation and the initial distribution of angular momentum in a cloud should affect only the position and size of the developing ring.

40|$|Rapid {{activation}} of p 53 by ionizing irradiation {{is a classic}} DNA damage response mediated by the ATM kinase. However, the major signalling target and mechanism that lead to p 53 stabilization are unknown. We show in this report that ATM induces p 53 accumulation by phosphorylating the ubiquitin E 3 ligase MDM 2. Multiple ATM target sites near the MDM 2 RING domain function in a redundant manner to provide robust DNA damage signalling. In the absence of DNA damage, the MDM 2 RING domain forms oligomers that mediate p 53 poly ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Phosphorylation by ATM <b>inhibits</b> <b>RING</b> domain oligomerization, specifically suppressing p 53 poly ubiquitination. Blocking MDM 2 phosphorylation by alanine substitution of all six phosphorylation sites results in constitutive degradation of p 53 after DNA damage. These observations show that ATM controls p 53 stability by regulating MDM 2 RING domain oligomerization and E 3 ligase processivity. Promoting or disrupting E 3 oligomerization may be a general mechanism by which signalling kinases regulate ubiquitination reactions, and a potential target for therapeutic intervention...|$|R

An assortment of tetrahydro-pyrimidin- 2 -ones, tetrahydro-pyrimidin- 2 -imines, and [1, 3]thiazinan- 2 -imines have been acquired in reactions with isocyanates, diarylcarbodiimides, and arylisothiocyanates.

Using a calcium depletion model in T 84 epithelial cells, we previously found that disassembly of the AJC results in endocytosis of AJ/TJ proteins. In the present study, we investigated {{the role of the}} actin cytoskeleton in disassembly and internalization of the AJC. Calcium depletion induced reorganization of apical F-actin into contractile rings. Internalized AJ/TJ proteins colocalized with these rings. Both depolymerization and stabilization of F-actin <b>inhibited</b> <b>ring</b> formation and disassembly of the AJC, suggesting a role for actin filament turnover. Actin reorganization was accompanied by activation (dephosphorylation) of cofilin- 1 and its translocation to the F-actin rings. In addition, Arp 3 and cortactin colocalized with these rings. F-actin reorganization and disassembly of the AJC were blocked by blebbistatin, an inhibitor of nonmuscle myosin II. Myosin IIA was expressed in T 84 cells and colocalized with F-actin rings. We conclude that disassembly of the AJC in calcium-depleted cells is driven by reorganization of apical F-actin. Mechanisms of such reorganization involve cofilin- 1 -dependent depolymerization and Arp 2 / 3 -assisted repolymerization of actin filaments as well as myosin IIA-mediated contraction...|$|R

Significant correlations between the variables were obtained: the two dimensions of participation are positively correlated with sense of community and negatively correlated with fatalism. Regression analysis showed that sense of community and fatalism are predictors for participatory behaviour. Thus, the feeling of belonging to a community fuels participation in it, either through community behaviour or through behaviour that seeks a social change.

40|$|Drosophila Btk 29 A is the {{ortholog}} of mammalian Btk, a Tec family nonreceptor {{tyrosine kinase}} whose deficit causes X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans. The Btk 29 AficP mutation induces multiple abnormalities in oogenesis, including the growth arrest of ring canals, large intercellular bridges {{that allow the}} flow of cytoplasm carrying maternal products essential for embryonic development from the nurse cells to the oocyte during oogenesis. In this study, inactivation of Parcas, a negative regulator of Btk 29 A, was found to promote Btk 29 A accumulation on ring canals with a concomitant increase in the ring canal diameter, counteracting the Btk 29 AficP mutation. This mutation markedly reduced the accumulation of phosphotyrosine on ring canals and in the regions of cell-cell contact, where adhesion-supporting proteins such as DE-cadherin and β-catenin ortholog Armadillo (Arm) are located. Our previous in vitro and in vivo analyses revealed that Btk 29 A directly phosphorylates Arm, leading to its release from DE-cadherin. In the present experiments, immunohistological analysis revealed that phosphorylation at tyrosine 150 (Y 150) and Y 667 of Arm was diminished in Btk 29 AficP mutant ring canals. Overexpression of an Arm mutant with unphosphorylatable Y 150 <b>inhibited</b> <b>ring</b> canal growth.

Ring-shaped structures have been obtained by deposition of CHCl 3 solutions on glass, and a strong dependence of ring shape and size on the initial PtP concentration has been observed. Addition of methanol (MeOH) to the solution <b>inhibited</b> <b>ring</b> formation if the content of MeOH was higher than 10 % in volume.

The size of the porphyrin wheels varied from 10 nm to several mu m in diameter and between 10 and 200 nm in height. NSOM experiments on the nanoscale optical properties of the samples indicated that the assemblies are organized on the nanometer scale due to small molecular aggregates.

Intercellular bridges {{are essential to the}} proper formation of germ cells in many organisms; therefore, learning more about how they are formed and regulated during the formation of sperm and eggs could provide insight into how defects in their structure can impact fertility. Intercellular bridges are actin-rich structures that connect developing germ cells to each other and allow the transfer of materials. I used the development of the fruit fly egg as a model system to study formation and regulation of intercellular bridges. Specifically, I investigated the role of an actin nucleating protein complex located at the ring canals, Arp 2 / 3, in the formation and expansion of these structures. The objective of this work is to characterize the effect of depletion, mutation, or inhibition of the Arp 2 / 3 complex on the structure and growth of these intercellular bridges, called ring canals. Because ring canals are rich in actin and actin-binding proteins, I predicted that if Arp 2 / 3 levels are altered, then ring canal formation and/or growth will be affected. When levels of Arp 2 / 3 complex proteins were reduced or if the complex was chemically <b>inhibited,</b> <b>ring</b> canals are significantly smaller than in controls; this difference was more pronounced in later stages of oogenesis (stages 7 - 10 b), suggesting Arp 2 / 3 plays a role in ring canal structure and stability in later stages of oogenesis.

As in bacteria, the positioning of the chloroplast FtsZ ring is regulated by the proteins MinD and MinE [3 – 5]. However, chloroplast division also involves mechanisms invented by the eukaryotic host cell [6 – 9]. Here we show that a plant-specific protein MULTIPLE CHLOROPLAST DIVISION SITE 1 (MCD 1) regulates FtsZ ring positioning in Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts. Our analyses show that both MCD 1 and MinD are required for chloroplast division, localizing at the division sites and punctate structures dispersed on the inner envelope. MinD overexpression <b>inhibited</b> FtsZ <b>ring</b> formation whereas MCD 1 overexpression did not. Localization studies suggest that MCD 1 is required for MinD localization to regulate FtsZ ring formation. Furthermore, the interaction between MCD 1 and MinD in yeast two-hybrid assays suggests that MCD 1 recruits MinD by direct interaction. These results point out differences in the MinD localization mechanism between chloroplasts and bacterial model systems and suggest that the plant cell evolved a component to modulate the cyanobacteria-derived Min system so as to regulate chloroplast FtsZ ring positioning...|$|R
5000|$|To {{allow for}} {{a high degree of}} {{compatibility}} with existing SCSI host adapters, Floptical drives were designed to work as a standard floppy disk drive, and not as a removable hard disk. To ensure this, a [...] "write lockout" [...] feature was added in the firmware. This effectively <b>inhibits</b> <b>writing</b> (including any kind of formatting) of the media. It is possible to unlock the drive by issuing a SCSI Mode Sense Command, 1A 00 20 02 A0. It is unclear how much of a problem this is, and Insite also issued EPROMs where this [...] "feature" [...] was not present.|$|R
40|$|Hydro-conversion {{reactions}} {{were carried out}} at 360 ℃ under 5 MPa of H_ 2 pressure to study ring opening reactions of 1 -methyl naphthalene using NiMoS supported on γ-alumina and alumina-coated/mixed USY zeolites. The catalysts were characterized using N_ 2 BET, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), pyridine FT-IR, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) to study the influence of morphological and acidic properties on hydrogenation (HYD) and hydrocracking (HC) reactions. NMACZ- 2 (NiMoS supported on the minimum amount of alumina-coated USY zeolite) showed enhanced reactivity for HC and produced (alkyl) benzenes with the highest yield, of ca. 80 %. By-products were tetralin, decalin and cyclo-paraffin species. The tetralin species produced using NMACZ- 2 moved into the alumina-coated USY zeolite support before undergoing HYD to produce decalin species, which were rapidly and selectively hydro-cracked into (alkyl) benzenes. A large amount of decalin was produced through the HYD of tetralin without significant cracking, possibly due to the weak acid character of γ-alumina. Bulk phase Mo oxide species on NMAZ (physical mixture of alumina and USY zeolite), as well as deactivation of the catalysts due to coke formation over the naked zeolite surface, <b>inhibited</b> the <b>ring</b> opening of tetralin, decreasing the yield of (alkyl) benzene. Various morphologies, such as the MoS_ 2 structure and acidic characteristics of the catalysts, were crucial factors affecting the HC reactivity of 1 -methyl naphthalene...|$|R
