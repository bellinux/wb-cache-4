When {{he says that he}} still loves her and {{would like to have a}} relationship with her again, Pearl declines. The next night, she goes to a nightclub with Olivia and Jennifer. They have fun joking about the fortunes, and Pearl admits she is a little sad hers did not come true. Pearl goes to a coffee house and cries when the fortune's deadline passes without anyone talking to her. Friday morning, Pearl is leaving for work when she meets a man who is about to knock on her door. He says he works at the coffee house she visited, and that she left her wallet behind. After a conversation, Pearl and the man arrange a date.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2011, {{after the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, {{widespread}} protests {{took place in}} Kuantan over the Lynas refinery and radioactive waste from it. The ore to be processed has very low levels of thorium, and Lynas founder and chief executive Nicholas Curtis said [...] "There is absolutely no risk to public health." [...] T. Jayabalan, a doctor <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been monitoring and treating patients affected by the Mitsubishi plant, [...] "is wary of Lynas's assurances. The argument that low levels of thorium in the ore make it safer doesn't make sense, he says, because radiation exposure is cumulative." [...] Construction of the facility has been halted until an independent United Nations IAEA panel investigation is completed, which is expected {{by the end of}} June 2011. New restrictions were announced by the Malaysian government in late June.|$|E
2500|$|Cristal {{arranges}} for Nomi {{to audition}} for the chorus line of Goddess. Tony Moss, the show's director, humiliates Nomi by asking her to put ice on her nipples to make them hard. Furious, Nomi leaves the audition and again runs into James, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> written a dance number for her and contends that Nomi is too talented to be a stripper or showgirl. Despite her outburst at the audition, Nomi gets the job and quits Cheetah's. Cristal further humiliates Nomi by suggesting she make a [...] "goodwill appearance" [...] at a boat trade show {{which turns out to}} be a thinly disguised form of prostitution. Undeterred, Nomi sets out to get revenge against Cristal and claim her mantle. She seduces Zack, who secures an audition for her to be Cristal's understudy. Nomi wins the role, but when Cristal threatens legal action against the Stardust, the offer is rescinded. After Cristal gloats and taunts Nomi at a performance, Nomi pushes her down a flight of stairs, and Cristal breaks her hip. Unable to perform, Cristal is replaced by Nomi as the show's lead.|$|E

[...] Another CNN report by Douglas Rushkoff, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,"Anyone <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for {{most of the rest of}} us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns...They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture".|$|E

Since there is no statute of limitations on murder, Taggart can still be prosecuted and face prison time. Taggart records their conversation, as the Mayor admits to his own corrupt dealings.|$|R

At a pretrial hearing on April 15, 2016, a judge ruled that Constand is entitled to any documents shared between Castor and Cosby's attorneys.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cause of}} this crash is unclear. The Canadian crewed Wellington BK387 was on a night {{training}} exercise when the aircraft descended through cloud and crashed into farmland.

6000|$|Let us {{calmly and}} dispassionately {{consider}} Dr. Wace's appreciation of agnosticism.

I cannot think this description happy, either in form or substance, but for the present it may pass. Dr. Wace continues, that is not [...] "his difference from Christians." [...] Are there then any Christians who say that they know nothing about the unseen world and the future? I was ignorant of the fact, but I am ready to accept it on the authority of a professional theologian, and I proceed to Dr. Wace's next proposition.|$|E

For aught he can prove to the contrary, such events may appear in the order of nature to-morrow. But common sense and common honesty alike oblige him to demand from those who would have him believe in the actual occurrence of such events, evidence of a cogency proportionate to their departure from probability; evidence at least as strong as that, which the man <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> seen a centaur is bound to produce, unless he is content to be thought either more than credulous or less than honest.|$|E
