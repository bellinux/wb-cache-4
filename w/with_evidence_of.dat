On their way to the airport, they learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys was not the source of the epidemic; the group's major act of protest is releasing animals from a zoo and placing Goines' father in an animal cage.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Classic {{there was}} greater {{public access to}} the acropolis; as the threat of warfare grew during the Terminal Classic (AD 800-900), access became much more restricted. The end of formal {{occupation}} {{of the city in}} the Terminal Classic appears to have been violent, <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a battle recovered during excavations of the acropolis. Refugees appear to have occupied the city centre immediately after the collapse of formal settlement at La Blanca, but they abandoned the city for good in the 11th century, after which it was never reoccupied.|$|E

All the Command's aircraft returned.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{is known}} for a {{politically}} active citizenry, and populism has been a longstanding force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout (due in part to its liberal voter registration laws) with virtually no evidence of unlawful voting. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2 percent of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus {{the national average of}} 61.2 percent. Previously unregistered voters can register on election day at their polls <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> residency.|$|E
5|$|More recently, the {{discovery}} of Zhenyuanlong established {{the presence of a}} full feathered coat in relatively large dromaeosaurs. Additionally, the animal displays proportionally large, aerodynamic wing feathers, as well as a tail-spanning fan, both of which are unexpected traits that may offer an understanding of the integument of large dromaeosaurs. Dakotaraptor is an even larger dromaeosaur species <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> feathers, albeit indirect in the form of quill knobs.|$|E

5|$|Police {{departments}} throughout Oregon {{decline to}} press charges, or {{charges have been}} dropped for possessing and growing marijuana, even for convicted drug dealers. Salem police estimated they received 30 or 40 calls for marijuana activity in 2007 which were not pursued because the grow operations were legal, even one next to a high school. One grower, a previously convicted felon, was found <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> making hash oil, which is not protected, though a grand jury did not indict him.|$|E
5|$|The Priory Church of St George is {{predominantly}} 15th century <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> 12th- and 13th century work. It {{has been designated}} as a Grade I listed building. The church was started by William de Moyon during the 11th century. The tower was built by Jon Marys of Stogursey who received a contract from the parish in 1442. He was paid 13s 4d (approx. 67p) for each foot in height and £1 for the pinnacles. The work was completed in three years. Aisles were added in 1504.|$|E
5|$|The Trafford {{area has}} a long heritage, <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Roman activity. Amongst the relics of the past are two castles– {{one of them a}} Scheduled Ancient Monument– and over 200 listed buildings. The area {{underwent}} change in the late 19th century and the population rapidly expanded {{with the arrival of the}} railway. Trafford is the home of Manchester United F.C. and Lancashire County Cricket Club and since 2002 the Imperial War Museum North.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability to}} fly or glide has been {{suggested}} {{for at least five}} dromaeosaurid species. The first, Rahonavis ostromi (originally classified as avian bird, but found to be a dromaeosaurid in later studies) may have been capable of powered flight, as indicated by its long forelimbs <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> quill knob attachments for long sturdy flight feathers. The forelimbs of Rahonavis were more powerfully built than Archaeopteryx, and show evidence that they bore strong ligament attachments necessary for flapping flight. Luis Chiappe concluded that, given these adaptations, Rahonavis could probably fly but would have been more clumsy in the air than modern birds.|$|E
5|$|The priory {{was seized}} in 1414 by King Henry V of England {{along with a}} number of alien priories. In the first three centuries, there were several Priors appointed, {{sometimes}} with short tenures, but in 1500 Ralph Leonard was installed as Prior for life. However, within decades the Priory was abandoned, <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> Thomas de Baugy being the final Prior around 1560. There is also evidence that the priory was allocated to John After in 1566, who had also been appointed as the Dean of Guernsey.|$|E
5|$|There are exits at {{both ends}} to the full length {{mezzanine}} along <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> removed center exits; since this station was built, the area now known as Cadman Plaza was completely rebuilt. Cadman Plaza East, the short one-block street outside the Red Cross Place exit, was previously called Washington Street; the Washington Street moniker still applies to the road north of Prospect Street. High Street is not directly accessible from the station, as the short one-block street is interrupted by a parking lot. However, Red Cross Place, which was once a part of High Street, is directly accessible.|$|E

5|$|When {{presented}} <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> Benedict Arnold's activities, it {{is reported}} that Washington remained calm. He did, however, investigate its extent, and suggested {{that he was willing}} to exchange André for Arnold during negotiations with General Clinton over the fate of Major André. Clinton refused this suggestion; after a military tribunal, André was hanged at Tappan, New York on October 2. Washington also infiltrated men into New York in an attempt to capture Arnold. This plan very nearly succeeded, but failed when Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December.|$|E
5|$|Windy Nook {{has a long}} {{industrial}} history, <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> milling {{and pottery}} in the area. The principal industry, however, was stone quarrying, and the initial settlement grew as this industry flourished. By {{the turn of the}} 20th century, several quarries operated in Windy Nook and the largest, Kell's Quarry, provided the sandstone and grindstone used to build St Alban's Church, a Grade II listed building and principal landmark in the village, which was consecrated on 25 August 1842.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September10, <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a low-level circulation and convective banding. It moved west-northwestward, located south of a subtropical ridge. Based on satellite imagery, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Nine by 1200UTC on September11 to the south of the Cape Verde islands. Upon its formation, the center was poorly defined, with restricted easterly outflow due to easterly wind shear. After about 24hours of remaining somewhat disorganized, the convection became more concentrated on September12 as banding features and outflow improved. Consequently, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gert, the seventh named storm of the season.|$|E

5|$|Archæological {{evidence}} from the Birrigai rock shelter in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve indicates habitation dating back at least 21,000 years. It {{is possible that the}} area was inhabited for considerably longer, <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> an Aboriginal presence in south-western New South Wales dating back around 40,000–62,000 years. Another site of significance in the reserve is the Bogong Rocks shelter, which contains the oldest evidence of Aboriginal occupation at a bogong moth resting site. These insects were an important source of food for the Aboriginal peoples of the Southern Alps and would accumulate by the thousands in caves and rock crevices, where they were collected and later roasted in sand or ashes, and then eaten whole.|$|E

Salander hacks into Wennerström's computer and presents Blomkvist <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> Wennerström's crimes. Blomkvist publishes an article that ruins Wennerström, who flees the country. Salander hacks into Wennerström's bank accounts and, travelling to Switzerland in disguise, transfers two billion euros to various accounts. Wennerström is found murdered. Salander reveals to her former guardian Holger Palmgren that she {{is in love with}} Blomkvist. On her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present, Salander sees him with his longtime lover and business partner Erika Berger (Robin Wright). She discards the gift and rides away.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the grand Roman villa was being {{excavated}} at Durley Hill Cemetery, a second smaller villa was discovered during the construction of Fry's Somerdale Chocolate Factory. Two fine stone coffins were found, interred with the remains of a man and a woman. The villa and coffins were removed to a place near the gates of the factory grounds, and construction on the factory went ahead. Fry's built in the grounds of the factory a museum which for many years housed the Durley Hill mosaics, the coffins, and numerous other artefacts. In 2012, Taylor Wimpey, about to develop the factory site, made a detailed geophysical assessment of the area, and discovered an additional 15 Roman buildings centered around a Roman road beneath Keynsham Hams, <b>with</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> additional Roman buildings that had been disturbed by quarrying.|$|E
