The plot follows Josh Kovaks (Ben Stiller), Charlie Gibbs (Casey Affleck) and Enrique Dev'reaux (Michael Peña), employees of an exclusive apartment building <b>who</b> <b>lose</b> their pensions in the Ponzi scheme of Wall Street businessman Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda). The group enlist the aid of criminal Slide (Eddie Murphy), bankrupt businessman Mr. Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) and another employee of the apartment building, Odessa (Gabourey Sidibe), to break into Shaw's apartment and steal back their money while avoiding the FBI {{agent in charge of}} his case, Claire Denham (Téa Leoni).|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those <b>who</b> <b>lose</b> weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
5|$|The film {{shows how}} the demand for cotton in India {{has led to the}} {{planting}} of genetically modified (GM) cotton, and how the monopoly inherent in its use by seed companies causes an increase in the price of cotton, leading to suicides among farmers <b>who</b> <b>lose</b> their land to these companies because they cannot pay the higher seed prices. GM crops need more pesticides, causing environmental damage, birth defects leading to mental and physical disabilities among the Punjab people, and an increased rate of cancer. The film claims that sometimes the companies that produce the pesticides are the same ones that produce the needed medications. A similar scenario occurs in contaminated cotton fields in Texas, where pesticides are causing brain tumors. The garment industry is the second-most-polluting industry the world, according to the film, which is illustrated by leather tanneries pouring chromium into the Ganges River in Kanpur, India.|$|E

25|$|Although baldness is not {{as common}} in women as in men, the {{psychological}} effects of hair loss tend to be much greater. Typically, the frontal hairline is preserved, but the density of hair is decreased on {{all areas of the}} scalp. Previously, it was believed to be caused by testosterone just as in male baldness, but most women <b>who</b> <b>lose</b> hair have normal testosterone levels.|$|E
25|$|But {{people who}} go to {{pictures}} for the sake of seeing pictures will see a great one. For The Grapes of Wrath is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book...Camera craft purged the picture of the editorial rash that blotched the Steinbeck book. Cleared of excrescences, the residue is a great human story which made thousands of people, who damned the novel's phony conclusions, read it. It is the saga of an authentic U.S. farming family <b>who</b> <b>lose</b> their land. They wander, they suffer, but they endure. They are never quite defeated, and their survival is itself a triumph.|$|E

25|$|In March 2004, Boxer {{offered an}} {{amendment}} to the Federal budget to create a $24 billion jobs reserve fund. The amendment would set aside funds for a variety of investments to improve the economy and create jobs by establishing a manufacturing jobs tax credit for companies that create jobs in the United States, expanding investment in science research and development, providing a tax credit to small businesses to pay for health insurance for their employees, and expanding trade adjustment assistance to help those <b>who</b> <b>lose</b> their jobs because of foreign trade. The Boxer amendment would also end the tax break that companies receive after moving plants overseas.|$|E

25|$|The Works Constitution Act of 1972 {{required}} {{in cases of}} collective dismissal at an establishment normally employing more than twenty employees that management and the works council must negotiate a social plan that stipulates compensation for workers <b>who</b> <b>lose</b> their jobs. In cases where the two parties could not agree on a social plan, the law provided for binding arbitration. In 1972, the rights of works councils to information from management were not only strengthened, but works councils were also provided with full codetermination rights {{on issues such as}} working time arrangements in the plant, the setting of piece rates, plant wage systems, the establishment of vacation times, work breaks, overtime, and short-time work. Legislation was passed which acknowledged {{for the first time the}} presence of trade unions in the workplace, expanded the means of action of the works councils, and improved their work basics as well as those of the youth councils.|$|E

25|$|The Preface to {{the poem}} {{suggests}} that the poem {{was not supposed to}} be printed, that it was a fragmentary work that he was unable to complete, and that the work itself was provided to him through involuntary inspiration. When the Preface is dropped, the poem seems to compare the act of poetry with the might of Kubla Khan instead of the loss of inspiration causing the work to have a more complex depiction of the poetic power. Taken together, the Preface could connect with {{the first half of the}} poem to suggest that the poem is from the view of a dreaming narrator, or it could connect with the second half of the poem to show how a reader is to interpret the lines by connecting himself with the persona in a negative manner. The Preface and the poem are different in their locations, as the Preface discusses Coleridge's England while the poem discusses ancient China, but both discuss the role of the poem and his abilities. The poet of the Preface is a dreamer who must write and the poet of the poem is a vocal individual, but both are poets <b>who</b> <b>lose</b> inspiration. Only the poet of the poem feels that he can recover the vision, and the Preface, like a Coleridge poem that is quoted in it, The Picture, states that visions are unrecoverable.|$|E
500|$|To {{mitigate}} the dangers posed by a fire inside the tunnel, trucks hauling hazardous materials are also prohibited {{from using the}} tunnel. Prohibited trucks, bicycles, pedestrians and {{those who wish to}} stop and view the scenery must take the longer and steeper climb and descent of the older U.S. Highway 6 across Loveland Pass, [...] higher at [...] above sea level. [...] Other than the above exceptions, the tunnel has replaced the pass for general vehicular traffic. [...] While less formidable than the older route, the approach to the tunnel on both sides is steep, and runaway truck ramps are available for truckers <b>who</b> <b>lose</b> control.|$|E

The IOC tried up until the last minute, midday Friday August 8, 2008, the day of the official opening, to have them register, but to no avail."

500|$|Carl's {{relationship}} with Russell reflects how [...] "he's not really {{ready for the}} whirlwind that a kid is, as few of us are". Docter added he saw Up as a [...] "coming of age" [...] tale and an [...] "unfinished love story", with Carl still dealing {{with the loss of}} his wife. He cited inspiration from Casablanca and A Christmas Carol, which are both [...] "resurrection" [...] stories about men <b>who</b> <b>lose</b> something, and regain purpose during their journey. Docter and Rivera cited inspirations from the Muppets, Hayao Miyazaki, Dumbo, and Peter Pan. They also saw parallels to The Wizard of Oz and tried to make Up not feel too similar. There is a scene where Carl and Russell haul the floating house through the jungle. A Pixar employee compared the scene to Fitzcarraldo, and Docter watched that film and The Mission for further inspiration. The character Charles Muntz comes from Howard Hughes and Errol Flynn.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Sarsgaard starred {{alongside}} Jon Foster and Sienna Miller in {{the drama}} The Mysteries of Pittsburgh. It is an adaptation of Michael Chabon's novel of the same name.

His next film appearance was in the thriller Orphan, where he and Vera Farmiga play a married couple <b>who</b> <b>lose</b> a baby and adopt a nine-year-old girl, who is not as innocent as she claims to be. Furthermore, in the same year, Sarsgaard starred as David in Lone Scherfig's coming of age film An Education. The role required Sarsgaard to speak in a British accent. An Education drew favorable reviews from critics. According to Variety, [...] "Sarsgaard... marvelously expresses the savoir faire that has such an impact on Jenny [...]" [...] Sarsgaard played a federal agent in the action comedy film Knight and Day, released in June 2010, in which he appeared alongside Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz.
