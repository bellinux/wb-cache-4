2500|$|Sting was {{regarded}} by colleagues in WCW {{as a professional}} and well-respected locker room leader. Prominent adversary Big Van Vader felt that Sting had unsurpassed athletic prowess within the business, and [...] "ranks right up at the top" [...] as an in-ring performer. Ric Flair called Sting his greatest opponent. Former rival Diamond Dallas Page, commenting on Sting's entry into WWE in 2014, said: [...] "Everyone there grew up watching him... No one did it better than Sting, nobody". John Cena mimicked Sting's hairstyle in his youth and recalled, [...] "he was my guy";John Cena: [...] "To see Sting win that match , obviously, as a kid I was going nuts: he was my guy."Jeff Hardy: <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> WCW in Fayetteville. There was this one moment, man, a changing moment in my life, when I reached out and I touched Sting... I was like, 'Wow, I wanna be that guy'." [...] Cody Rhodes and Shelton Benjamin have also named him as their favorite childhood wrestler. Tyson Kidd professed to being a [...] "huge Sting fan" [...] as a child, and Seth Rollins would dress up as Sting in his youth. He was also a prominent influence on industry veterans Kurt Angle, Bill Goldberg,Bill Goldberg: [...] "I looked up to [...]"Tyson Kidd: [...] "I was a huge Sting fan as a kid." [...] Jeff Hardy, Kane, A.J. Styles and Goldust. Bray Wyatt has stressed that he [...] "really {{would like to take}} on" [...] Sting, adding: [...] "I have to have [...] before I die; I don't care if it happens outside a Waffle House, somewhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flying Hawk {{was born}} about full moon of March 1854, {{a few miles}} south of Rapid Creek, Lakota Territory. His father was Oglala Lakota Chief Black Fox, also known as Chief Black Fox I, Cut Forehead and Great Kicking Bear. Chief Black Fox (c. 1800-c. 1880) had two wives who were sisters who bore him {{thirteen}} children. Iron Cedar Woman, the youngest sister, was Flying Hawk's mother and had five children. The other wife had eight children. [...] "In a fight with the Crows, Chief Black Fox was shot below the right eye with an arrow. [...] It was so deep {{that it could not}} be pulled out, but had to be pushed through the ear." [...] Chief Black Fox died when he was eighty years old. [...] "When my father was dead a long time <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how he was on the scaffold where we put him. [...] His bones were all that was left. [...] The arrow-point was sticking {{in the back of his}} skull. [...] It was rusted. [...] We took it home with us." [...] Kicking Bear (c. 1846-c. 1880) was Flying Hawk's full and older brother. Kicking Bear was a noted warrior and leader of the Ghost Dance. [...] Black Fox II ("Young Black Fox") was Flying Hawk's half-brother and named for his father. Crazy Horse was the first cousin of Flying Hawk. [...] "Though nine years the senior of Flying Hawk, Crazy Horse and Flying Hawk were constant close friends and associates, and they were cousins." [...] Rattling Blanket Woman, the mother of Crazy Horse, was the sister of Iron Cedar Woman, the mother of Flying Hawk and Kicking Bear. [...] They would have addressed Crazy Horse as ciye, or 'elder brother'. Sitting Bull was Flying Hawk's uncle, Chief Flying Hawk’s mother Iron Cedar Woman and Sitting Bull’s wife being sisters. [...] At the age of 26, Flying Hawk married two sisters, [...] Goes Out Looking and White Day. Goes Out Looking bore him one son, Felix Flying Hawk. White Day had no child.|$|E

6000|$|... "We'll {{keep the}} secret a while longer. I'd rather {{get out of}} the scrape before folks know what we've found, an' then settle old scores. Now, Fred, s'pose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Sam?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll be out er sight, Seth; that's {{all there}} is to it!" [...] Then, realizing how his brother news-venders might be surprised, he added, [...] "Come on quick, an' let's tell as many fellers as we can before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Bill Dean ship Sam Barney to Philadelphy!" ...|$|R
60|$|This was a {{difficult}} point to decide. If <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them, {{we might as well}} break up our camp, for we could not tell when {{we should be able to}} come back to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's time <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if tea's ready," [...] said Priscilla. She hoisted {{herself up}} from the sofa and went swishing off across the room, striding beneath the {{trailing}} silk. Denis followed her, faintly humming to himself: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{what did}} they call us, when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> 'em, then, eh, {{neighbor}} Pullet? They thought us sweet enough then," [...] said Mr. Glegg, winking pleasantly; while Mr. Pullet, {{at the suggestion of}} sweetness, took a little more sugar.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lucy; [...] "you know {{my father}} once saved Prince Rupert's {{life in the}} {{skirmish}} where his horse was killed, so for his sake the Prince made Edmund his page, and has had him with him in all his voyages and wanderings. But go on about our father, Rose. Did <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{extradition}} of {{a criminal}} is a long and troublesome business," [...] he observed.

6000|$|... "Why, {{he was not}} so very small," [...] said Rollo. [...] "He {{was bigger}} than I am, and I am growing to be pretty large. Besides, they have {{excellent}} schools here where they learn to draw and to paint. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> one of them." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> John Knox's house, and {{although}} Mr. Knox was pretty hard on vanities and frivolities, he didn't mind {{having a good}} house over his head, with woodwork {{on the walls and}} ceilings that wasn't any more necessary than the back buttons on his coat.|$|E
6000|$|... "While the hostler was {{harnessing}} {{the horse}} <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the waterfall. There was a path leading to {{it through the}} bushes. There was a small foot bridge over the stream, just below the waterfall, where we could stand and see the water tumbling down over the rocks.|$|E
60|$|All of {{this was}} very good of the captain, {{and we were very}} glad <b>we</b> had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the horses?' {{suggested}} Mr. Macrae, {{and they}} did go and stare, as is usual on Sunday in the country, at the hind-quarters of these noble animals. Merton strove {{to be as much}} interested as possible in Mr. Macrae's stories of his fleet American trotters. But his heart was otherwhere. 'They will soon be an extinct species,' said Mr. Macrae. 'The motor has come to stay.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He did, but <b>we</b> didn't <b>go</b> there <b>to</b> steal; <b>we</b> <b>went</b> there <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if {{everything}} was all right. He went {{there for the}} same purpose." ...|$|R
60|$|She did {{not come}} one morning, but sent her brother, who only laughed, and said Marie had hurt her foot, when we inquired for her. Anxious {{to know if she}} was really ill, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her in the afternoon, and heard a pretty little story of {{practical}} Christianity.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Catholic church afterwards. There was {{a monstrous}} old gallery all {{on one side}} of the church, and none on the other. Then there was an organ away up in a loft, and all sorts of old images and statues. I never saw such an old looking place.|$|E
60|$|So {{the next}} day <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> I Spettri, expecting some good, crude melodrama. The theatre is an old church. Since that triumph of the deaf and dumb, the cinematograph, has come {{to give us the}} nervous {{excitement}} of speed--grimace agitation, and speed, as of flying atoms, chaos--many an old church in Italy has taken a new lease of life.|$|E
5000|$|Among his leading ladies, The Times listed Edna May, Gertie Millar, Lily Elsie, Constance Collier, Gertrude Lawrence and Binnie Hale. One critic {{wrote of}} him that, like other stars of musical comedy {{including}} Millar, [...] "It {{is no good}} their pretending to be any one else. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> themselves, and all we ask is that the authors and others shall give them every chance of being themselves in the most pronounced and personal fashion".|$|R
6000|$|... “I’ve {{known it}} of course duskier and dingier. But <b>we</b> only <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a few people,” Mrs. Westgate added—“old friends or persons we {{particularly}} like.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am willing}} to make trial of that matter," [...] I {{answered}} confidently, [...] "and any way <b>we</b> must <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> these things for ourselves." ...|$|R
60|$|Once in {{the yard}} again, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{some of the older}} parts of the building. The oldest of these, Caesar's Tower, which is said {{to go back to the}} time of the Romans, is not now shown to visitors. Beneath it is a dark, damp dungeon, where prisoners used to be confined, the walls of which are traced all over with {{inscriptions}} and rude drawings.|$|E
60|$|By and by <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{one of the}} supremely great ones. He was {{a mighty}} celebrity; his fame had {{penetrated}} all Christendom; the noble and the renowned journeyed from the remotest lands on the globe to pay him reverence. His stand was {{in the center of}} the widest part of the valley; and it took all that space to hold his crowds.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The ingenious Mr. Addison {{was quite}} right then,' Edie answered, smiling; 'for he couldn't {{have chosen a}} lovelier place on earth to stroll in. How {{exquisite}} it looks just now, with the mellow light falling down upon the path through this beautiful autumnal foliage! It's just a natural cathedral aisle, {{with a lot of}} pale straw-coloured glass in the painted windows, like that splendid one <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the other day at Merton Chapel.' ...|$|E
60|$|My Edward and I, then, are happy: and {{the more}} so, because those we most love are happy likewise. Diana and Mary Rivers are both married: alternately, once every year, they come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> us, and <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them. Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man. Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection. Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.|$|R
60|$|Miss Clarissa and my aunt roam {{all over}} London, {{to find out}} {{articles}} of furniture for Dora and me to look at. It {{would be better for}} them to buy the goods at once, without this ceremony of inspection; for, when <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a kitchen fender and meat-screen, Dora sees a Chinese house for Jip, with little bells on the top, and prefers that. And {{it takes a long time}} to accustom Jip to his new residence, after we have bought it; whenever he goes in or out, he makes all the little bells ring, and is horribly frightened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know!" [...] {{she went}} on drearily. [...] "You see, I think the men who take out girls {{who are in the}} chorus, {{generally}} expect to be allowed to make love to them. At any rate, they behaved like that. Such a horrid man tried to say nice things to me and I didn't like it a bit. So they left me alone afterwards. The girl I lived with and her mother are quite nice, and they have a few friends <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> sometimes on Sunday or holidays. It's dull, though, very dull, especially now they're away." ...|$|R
60|$|Not long since, {{a company}} of horse-riders {{paid a visit to}} our watering-place. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them, and I bethought me that young Walter Juvenis, who was in the place, might like also to witness the performance. A {{pantomime}} is not always amusing to persons who have attained a certain age; but a boy at a pantomime is always amused and amusing, and to see his pleasure is good for most hypochondriacs.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Mahinee, the old chief; Captain Bob going along, and stoutly insisting upon {{having the}} {{chattels}} delivered up. At last this was done; and in solemn procession the chests were {{borne by the}} natives to the Calabooza. Here, we disposed them about quite tastefully; and made such a figure that, {{in the eyes of}} old Bob and his friends, the Calabooza Beretanee was by far the most sumptuously furnished saloon in Tahiti.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a {{collection}} of pictures owned by Mr. Van Lankeren. It is a very fine gallery, but there are few paintings by very great artists. A Van der Heyden (an old New York name, by the way), surpassed anything I know, in its atmosphere. Poussin, and our own artist Cole, excel in this high merit, but this picture of Van der Heyden has a cold, gray transparency that seems actually to have transferred a Dutch atmosphere to the canvass.|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> downstairs <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{how they}} were getting on. MacShaughnassy thought they seemed queer, and was of opinion that they were {{breaking}} up. Speaking for myself, I {{can only say that}} a healthier-looking lot of beetles I never wish <b>to</b> <b>see.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{is a large}} Trappist monastery {{two hours}} from Durban, over the country roads, and in company with Mr. Milligan and Mr. Hunter, {{general manager of the}} Natal {{government}} railways, who knew the heads of it, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it.|$|R
