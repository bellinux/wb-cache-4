5|$|A {{fibreglass}} {{replica of}} a Mk XVI spitfire sits on a pylon next to Memorial Avenue at Christchurch Airport, New Zealand. It was moved to its current location in 2015 from the previous position {{at the entrance to}} the airport where it had been for 50 years. The replica <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> used as a static display in Reach for the Sky.|$|E
5|$|Barbera's {{first foray}} into {{television}} was a 1957 collaboration with Robert D. Buchanan, Colonel Bleep. The series, the first ever cartoon produced specifically for color television, would feature some of the futuristic designs and limited animation Barbera would later carry over to his other television productions. Barbera's involvement in Colonel Bleep (and with Buchanan) <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> short-lived; his only known credited involvement was a creator credit.|$|E
5|$|Bowers {{does not}} cite any trade {{publication}} reviews for this film, making {{it unlikely that}} the film was given attention in The New York Dramatic Mirror, The Moving Picture World or The Moving Picture News publications. The film <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> a success at the Province Theater when it was shown in Vancouver. It is possible that non-advertisement reviews of the film may exist in other publications.|$|E

5|$|History {{may never}} know {{the true story of}} Lee's {{intentions}} at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found.|$|E
5|$|In early drafts, the {{elephant}}'s name {{changed from}} Osmer to Bosco to Humphrey. The final choice, Horton, <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> after Horton Conrad, one of Geisel's classmates at Dartmouth College. The bird's name changed from Bessie to Saidie and finally Mayzie. In the first draft, the elephant character volunteered {{to sit on}} the eggs for the bird, who was very reluctant.|$|E
5|$|Locally, the Gurdon Bill Store {{was rumored}} {{to have been a}} tavern or an inn, {{although}} no evidence or record indicates such a use, and it <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> a waystation for stagecoaches. A historical marker in the immediate vicinity ties the Gurdon Bill store to the birthplace of Samuel Seabury, America's first Episcopal bishop. No conclusive evidence for this claim exists.|$|E

5|$|Maureen Hindley married David Smith on 15 August 1964. The {{marriage}} was hastily arranged and performed at a register office. None of Hindley's relatives attended; Myra {{did not approve}} of the marriage, and her mother was too embarrassed—Maureen was seven months pregnant. The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house. The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to Windermere. This {{was the first time}} Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> impressed by Smith's demeanour. The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank. The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine. The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings. Hindley <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October 1797 Brock {{purchased}} {{the rank of}} lieutenant-colonel, and became acting commanding officer of the regiment, assuming substantive command on 22 March 1798 with the retirement of Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Keppel. The rank <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> bought cheaply; his predecessor from whom he {{purchased the}} rank was advised to sell up and leave the army rather than face a court martial and probable dismissal.|$|E
5|$|Richard III was {{followed}} by another adaptation, the comedy, Love Makes a Man, which was constructed by splicing together two plays by John Fletcher: The Elder Brother and The Custom of the Country. Cibber's confidence <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> restored {{by the success of}} the two plays, and he returned to more original writing.|$|E

5|$|The Ilyushin Il-30 was a Soviet turbojet-powered {{tactical}} bomber {{designed as}} a higher-performance, swept wing version of the Ilyushin Il-28, in the late 1940s. Its thin wing and engine nacelles necessitated the use of tandem landing gear, the first Soviet aircraft to do so. It <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> canceled before the prototype made its first flight, although sources disagree with this.|$|E
5|$|The {{anonymous}} {{author of the}} Encomium Emmae (written in the early 1040s) <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> acquainted with the Life, {{though it is not}} known how he knew of it. The author was a monk of St Bertin's in Flanders, but may have learned of the work in England.|$|E
5|$|The {{pyramid of}} Userkaf <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> {{the object of}} {{restoration}} work in antiquity under the impulse of Khaemweset (1280–1225 BC), fourth son of Ramses II. This is attested by inscriptions on stone cladding showing Khaemweset with offering bearers.|$|E

5|$|After the show, WWE {{was criticized}} for a {{malfunction}} in the pyrotechnics during The Undertaker's victory celebration. During the celebration, a hot cable for pyrotechnics was sent flying into audience members in the upper seating bowl of the stadium, leaving 45 injured, with some hospitalized. The accident <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> due to a cable which fireworks were traveling across snapping, thus resulting in the fireworks exploding into the top rows of the upper bowl of the stadium. WWE's corporate website released a statement afterward stating that they would investigate the incident, but {{the results of the}} investigation were never released.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} Chetnik commanders, Baćović carried out {{numerous}} massacres of Bosnian Muslim and Catholic civilians and those {{sympathetic to the}} Partisan movement. In April 1945, he was captured near Banja Luka by elements of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (HOS) along with Chetnik leaders Pavle Đurišić and Zaharije Ostojić, and Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić in what <b>was</b> <b>apparently</b> a trap. According to some sources, Baćović {{and the others were}} taken to the area of the Jasenovac concentration camp, where they were killed.|$|E
