500|$|Thatcher defined her own {{political}} philosophy {{in a major}} and controversial break with the one-nation conservatism of Edward Heath and her Conservative predecessors in an interview published in Woman's Own magazine, three months after her victory in the 1987 general election:I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> through a period when too many children and people {{have been given to}} understand [...] "I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!" [...] or [...] "I have a problem, I will go and get a grant to cope with it!" [...] "I am homeless, the Government must house me!" [...] and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations.|$|E
500|$|Producer Wayne Young {{said his}} passion for the {{environment}} was his motivation for making the film, saying the film was [...] "blatantly environmental, although <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{to a lot of}} trouble to avoid preaching. We also want it to be viewed as entertainment." [...] The inspiration for FernGully came from stories written by his former wife, Diana Young. Diana first wrote the story of FernGully 15 years before the film's release. Wayne said the couple planned a film adaptation for five years, then spent [...] "seven years of dreaming and hustling, followed by another three years of production". Wayne stated their dream was not possible until the success of Walt Disney Feature Animation's 1989 film The Little Mermaid, which brought popularity back to animation. Hand drawn scenes in the film were complimented by computer animation, which was used to create elements such as flocks of birds that would have taken much longer to animate traditionally. Kroyer states 40,000 frames of computer animation were used in the film, and that the use of such animation halved the production time. Most of the film's $24 million budget was spent on the animation and the soundtrack.|$|E

We have that much control with the Israelis... <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> for collective punishment against all of Lebanon and Palestine." [...] Press Secretary Tony Snow responded, [...] "Thank you for the Hezbollah view." [...] Other {{members of the press}} weighed in.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with reporters, Senators' General Manager Bryan Murray stated that he was [...] "shocked and disappointed" [...] at the request. In addition, Murray stated that Clouston was hurt by Heatley's remarks. [...] "The frustrating part for us is <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> through several coaches here that we couldn't win enough games with," [...] Murray stated. [...] "We brought in a guy the results we were very happy with. The team started {{to look like a}} real team again. And then to be kind of blindsided, in his way of thinking anyway, by one of your players – not wanting to fit in. That's hard for a coach to accept." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, he {{introduced}} a third hypothesis. [...] "I hold it entirely possible", he said, [...] "that a technology exists, which encompasses both {{the physical and}} the psychic, the material and the mental. There are stars that are millions of years older than the sun. There may be a civilization that is millions of years more advanced than man's. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> from Kitty Hawk to the moon in some seventy years, but it's possible that a million-year-old civilization may know something that we don't ... I hypothesize an 'M' technology encompassing the mental and material realms. The psychic realms, so mysterious to us today, may be an ordinary part of an advanced technology." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Timothy {{takes us}} to the Westminster City Council Rubbish Dump, {{situated}} in Hyde Park, where Hercules Grytpype-Thynne and Count Jim Moriarty, more ragged than ever, are starving. [...] The Council has just dumped {{a huge amount of}} lagging, because [...] "it was in feet and inches, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> metric". [...] Secombe, now in character as Neddie Seagoon, arrives [...] "driving an unlicensed Goon Show with CD plates on". [...] Gritpype's comment is [...] "Yes, it does look a bit seedy, doesn't it." [...] The two villains then attempt their usual swindle of Neddie, in this case convincing him that his legs must be lagged to keep them warm for the coming winter, the payment being his [...] "war gratuity" [...] of one hundred pounds.|$|E

60|$|I {{would get}} the book and find that if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> up to London by the four o'clock train the evening before, and then on by the night mail to York, and had slept {{there for a few}} hours, <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on by the ten o'clock train to which the {{accident}} happened.|$|R

2500|$|The Restoration in the Sacrament of the Eucharist. Window in the Ante-Chapel South. 1902.

[...] Now Adam and Eve are clothed and kneel as though in contrition and look across at an angel who holds out a chalice in her left hand whilst {{in her right hand}} she holds a wheatsheaf. [...] "Man has been restored through the sacrifice of Christ and the Sacrament of the Gospel" [...] is the message and in the centre of his composition Whall depicts wheat stalks and vine leaves (the bread and wine of the Eucharist).|$|E
2500|$|The KSČ's number-two leader, General Secretary Rudolf Slánský, {{represented}} the KSČ at the meeting. [...] He returned to Prague {{with a plan}} for the final seizure of power. Slánský remarked, [...] "as in the international field, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on the offensive on the domestic front as well." [...] The KSČ pursued a two-pronged strategy. The party knew it had to maintain the façade of working within the electoral political system and was aware that a revolutionary coup would be unacceptable. It desired to gain an absolute majority at elections scheduled for 1948, but the fracturing of the left-wing coalition made this unrealistic. This pushed the party into extra-parliamentary action. The organization of [...] "spontaneous" [...] demonstrations to [...] "express the will of the people" [...] and continuous visits to parliament by workers' delegations were meant to ensure [...] "mobilization of the masses".|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2014, in a Reddit AMA, Del Toro said, [...] "Well, you know, we don't {{have that}} movie on the horizon, {{but the idea}} for {{it was to have}} Hellboy finally {{come to terms with the}} fact that his destiny, his {{inevitable}} destiny, is to become the beast of the Apocalypse, and having him and Liz face the sort of, that part of his nature, and he has to do it, in order to be able to ironically vanquish the foe that he has to face in the 3rd film. He has to become the beast of the Apocalypse to be able to defend humanity, but at the same time he becomes a much darker being. It's a very interesting ending to the series, but I don't think it will happen. ... <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> through basically every studio and asked for financing, and they are not interested. I think that the first movie made its budget back, and a little bit of profit, but then it was very very big on video and DVD. The story repeated itself with the second already, it made its money back at the box office, but a small margin of profit in the release of the theatrical print, but was very very big on DVD and video. Sadly now from a business point of view all the studios know is that you don't have that safety net of the DVD and video, so they view the project as dangerous." ...|$|E
