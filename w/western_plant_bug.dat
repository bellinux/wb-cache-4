40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>western</b> {{tarnished}} <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> Lygus hesperus is {{an economically}} important pest {{that belongs to}} a complex of morphologically similar species that makes identification problematic. The present study provides evidence {{for the use of}} DNA barcodes from populations of L. hesperus from the western United States of America for accurate identification. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study reports DNA barcodes for 134 individuals of the <b>western</b> tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> from alfalfa and strawberry agricultural fields in the western United States of America. Sequence divergence estimates of < 3 % reveal that morphologically variable individuals presumed to be L. hesperus were accurately identified. Paired estimates of F(st) and subsequent estimates of gene flow show that geographically distinct populations of L. hesperus are genetically similar. Therefore, our results support and reinforce the relatively recent (< 100 years) migration of the <b>western</b> tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> into agricultural habitats across the western United States. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals that despite wide host plant usage and phenotypically plastic morphological traits, the commonly recognized <b>western</b> tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> belongs to a single species, Lygus hesperus. In addition, no significant genetic structure was found for the geographically diverse populations of <b>western</b> tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> used in this study...|$|R

40|$|The <b>western</b> {{tarnished}} <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> Lygus hesperus Knight (Heteroptera: Miridae), a major pest {{of cotton}} {{and other key}} economic crops, was tested for its sensitivity to population density during nymph and adult stages. Nymphs reared to adulthood under increasing densities in laboratory conditions exhibited incremental delays in maturation, heightened mortality rates, and reductions in body mass and various size parameters. In contrast, gonadal activity in {{both males and females}} rose with initial density increases. Supplemental nutrients provided to the nymphs failed to offset the negative effects of high density, suggesting that contact frequency, rather than resource partitioning, may be the primary stress. Unlike nymphs, newly eclosed adults exposed to increasing population densities did not suffer negative physiological effects; body mass, mortality rates and patterns of ovipositional activity were unchanged. Collectively, these results indicate that population density can dramatically influence Lygus development, but the specific effects are stage-dependent...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The <b>western</b> {{tarnished}} <b>plant</b> <b>bug,</b> Lygus hesperus Knight, feeds {{and develops}} {{on a variety}} of weeds in the spring, with later generations moving to alfalfa and cotton where severe damage to reproductive structures can occur. A synthetic attractant for monitoring or mass-trapping L. hesperus, or the identification of potential attractants for natural enemies, would be useful tools for integrated pest management programs. Studies investigated the response of naive and experienced fifth-instar and adult L. hesperus to odors associated with conspecifics and alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. Fifth-instar L. hesperus responded to all plant/insect combinations, whereas female L. hesperus only responded preferentially to vegetative and flowering alfalfa where conspecifics had fed for 24 – 72 hr, and to vegetative alfalfa where conspecifics were added approximately 30 min before the test began. Males were not attracted to headspace volatiles from any of the alfalfa treatments. Analysis of headspace volatiles showed that (E) - 2 -hexanal, (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, α-pinene, (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate, (E) - 2 -hexenyl acetate, limonene, (Z) -ocimene, (E) -β-ocimene, linalool, (3 E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl...|$|R
40|$|The Gα {{subunits}} of heterotrimeric G proteins play critical {{roles in}} the activation of diverse signal transduction cascades. However, the role of these genes in chemosensation remains to be fully elucidated. To initiate a comprehensive survey of signal transduction genes, we used homology-based cloning methods and transcriptome data mining to identity Gα subunits in the <b>western</b> tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> (Lygus hesperus Knight). Among the nine sequences identified were single variants of the Gαi, Gαo, Gαs, and Gα 12 subfamilies and five alternative splice variants of the Gαq subfamily. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses of the putative L. hesperus Gα subunits support initial classifications and are consistent with established evolutionary relationships. End-point PCR-based profiling of the transcripts indicated head specific expression for LhGαq 4, and largely ubiquitous expression, albeit at varying levels, for the other LhGα transcripts. All subfamilies were amplified from L. hesperus chemosensory tissues, suggesting potential roles in olfaction and/or gustation. Immunohistochemical staining of cultured insect cells transiently expressing recombinant His-tagged LhGαi, LhGαs, and LhGαq 1 revealed plasma membrane targeting, suggesting the respective sequences encode functional G protein subunits...|$|R
40|$|Lygus hesperus (<b>western</b> {{tarnished}} <b>plant</b> <b>bug)</b> is an agronomically important pest {{species of}} numerous cropping systems. Similar to other insects, {{a critical component}} underlying behaviors is the perception and discrimination of olfactory cues. Consequently, the molecular basis of olfaction in this species is of interest. To begin to address this issue, we utilized homology-based PCR as a commonly accepted abbreviation but if necessary it is polymerase chain reaction methods to identify the L. hesperus olfactory receptor co-receptor (Orco) ortholog, a receptor that {{has been shown to}} be essential for olfaction. The L. hesperus Orco (LhOrco) shares significant sequence homology with known Orco proteins in other insects. Parallel experiments using the sympatric sister species, Lygus lineolaris (tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug),</b> revealed that the Lygus Orco gene was completely conserved. Surprisingly, a majority of the membrane topology prediction algorithms used in the study predicted LhOrco to have both the N and C terminus intracellular. In vitro immunofluorescent microscopy experiments designed to probe the membrane topology of transiently expressed LhOrco, however, refuted those predictions and confirmed that the protein adopts the inverted topology (intracellular N terminus and an extracellular C terminus) characteristic of Orco proteins. RT-PCR analyses indicated that LhOrco transcripts are predominantly expressed in adult antennae and to a lesser degree in traditionally nonolfactory chemosensory tissues of the proboscis and legs. Expression is not developmentally regulated because transcripts were detected in all nymphal stages as well as eggs. Taken together, the results suggest that LhOrco likely plays a critical role in mediating L. hesperus odorant perception and discrimination...|$|R
40|$|The <b>western</b> {{tarnished}} <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> {{and other}} lygus species are key pests of cotton in western arid cotton production regions. The lygus complex {{has also become}} increasingly important in other US cotton production regions. Populations of lygus bugs are difficult to monitor because adults are active fliers and frequent various crops in the landscape, and nymphs inhabit cryptic habitats and move rapidly when disturbed. Management decisions are complicated by these sampling difficulties. Because the principal management tactic for lygus is chemical pesticides, inaccurate treatment decisions may result in unnecessary crop loss or unneeded pesticide applications. Unnecessary pesticide applications are costly, and may contaminate the environment and induce secondary pest problems. Several current research efforts in the western and southeastern US seek to evaluate and improve sampling methods for lygus in cotton. However, most of these efforts are focused only on the numbers of lygus collected, or on the apparent statistical precision of population estimates, without considering whether the population estimates accurately reflect population changes in the field. We recently developed mark-release-recapture methods of establishing known population levels of lygus adults in cotton. This method involves marking adult lygus with a small droplet of fingernail polish that glues the wings together to preven...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} adult {{diapause}} in the <b>western</b> tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug,</b> Lygus hesperus Knight (Heteroptera: Miridae), have highlighted {{the need to}} identify a reliable external marker for the internal changes that differentiate a normal animal from one that is overwintering. To test the efficacy of a color based discrimination system, L. hesperus of both genders were reared from eggs through day 10 of adulthood under a 10 hour photophase at a constant temperature. They were separated into three color groups (yellow, pale green, dark green), then dissected for diapause categorization based on internal development. Most yellow individuals were in diapause, dark green individuals were not, and pale green ones were mixed. A group of 25 assessors, naïve with regard to L. hesperus development, {{were then asked to}} use a simplified color criteria (yellow = diapause, green = non-diapause) to estimate the status of a mixture of diapausing and non-diapausing adults of both genders aged two to seven days post-eclosion. After dissection to verify diapause status, assessor accuracy was found to be ineffective for assessing adults of both sexes younger than four days because color differences, which increased with age, were subtle or non-existent at this stage. For four to seven-day-old bugs, 84 % o...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mirid <b>plant</b> <b>bugs</b> (Hemiptera: Miridae) are {{economically}} important {{insect pests}} of many crops worldwide. The <b>western</b> tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> Lygus hesperus Knight is a pest of cotton, alfalfa, {{fruit and vegetable}} crops, and potentially of several emerging biofuel and natural product feedstocks in the western US. However, {{little is known about}} the underlying molecular genetics, biochemistry, or physiology of L. hesperus, including their ability to survive extreme environmental conditions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used 454 pyrosequencing of a normalized adult cDNA library and de novo assembly to obtain an adult L. hesperus transcriptome consisting of 1, 429, 818 transcriptomic reads representing 36, 131 transcript isoforms (isotigs) that correspond to 19, 742 genes. A search of the transcriptome against deposited L. hesperus protein sequences revealed that 86 out of 87 were represented. Comparison with the non-redundant database indicated that 54 % of the transcriptome exhibited similarity (e-value ≤ 1 (- 5)) with known proteins. In addition, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations, and potential Pfam domains were assigned to each transcript isoform. To gain insight into the molecular basis of the L. hesperus thermal stress response we used transcriptomic sequences to identify 52 potential heat shock protein (Hsp) homologs. A subset of these transcripts was sequence verified and their expression response to thermal stress monitored by semi-quantitative PCR. Potential homologs of Hsp 70, Hsp 40, and 2 small Hsps were found to be upregulated in the heat-challenged adults, suggesting a role in thermotolerance. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The L. hesperus transcriptome advances the underlying molecular understanding of this arthropod pest by significantly increasing the number of known genes, and provides the basis for further exploration and understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of abiotic stress responses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Induction {{of plant}} {{volatiles}} by leaf-chewing caterpillars is well doc-umented. However, {{there is much}} less information about volatile induction by insects with different feeding habits. We studied the induction of plant volatiles by a piercing–sucking insect, the <b>western</b> tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> Lygus hesperus Knight. Adults of both genders and nymphs of Lygus induced the local emis-sion of a blend of volatiles from both cotton and maize. Feeding by Lygus also induced the systemic emission of volatiles that was similar but less complex than the blend emitted {{at the site of}} feeding. Infestation by mated, mature adult females (> 4 days old), but not by nymphs or mature males, caused detectable emission of fi-pinene, myrcene, and (E) -fl-caryophyllene, compounds that are stored in the glands of cotton tissue. This indicated that damage to glands in the petiole and leaf by the female ovipositor, rather than feeding, contributed significantly to the emission of these volatiles. Girdling the plant stem to disrupt phloem transport markedly decreased the movement of 14 C-labeled photosyn-thetic products to the apex of the plant, and this treatment also markedly reduced the amount of systemically induced volatiles caused by Lygus feeding. Lygus salivary gland extracts were capable of inducing emission of the same volatile blend as measured for plants infested by feeding insects or treated with volic-itin, an elicitor isolated from caterpillar regurgitant. The results indicate that ⁄ To whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|R
40|$|The NI {{artificial}} diet is {{the only}} known successful diet for mass rearing the <b>western</b> tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug,</b> Lygus hesperus Knight (Hemiptera: Miridae). This diet {{has been used for}} more than a decade. However, because it contains cooked chicken egg, and thus requires laborious preparation (Cohen 2000), this diet is difficult to use. Three modifications (D 1, D 2, D 3) of the NI diet were investigated in hopes of developing a more easily prepared diet that avoids the cooked egg and improves mass fitness parameters of L. hesperus. The modified D 3 diet, containing autoclaved chicken egg yolk based component, had the highest egg/cage/day production (13120 ± 812 SE). This was significantly greater than diets D 1, containing autoclaved dry chicken egg yolk based component (9027 ± 811 SE), D 2, containing autoclaved chicken egg white based component (8311 ± 628 SE), and NI, which contained autoclaved chicken egg yolk + cooked egg diet (7890 ± 761 SE). Significant differences were observed in the weights of all developmental stages except for eggs and first instar nymphs. Higher rates of fertility, hatchability, and low mortality in nymphs during the first instar were also obtained in the modified D 3 diet. The results clearly indicated that the D 3 diet provided an opportunity to significantly reduce rearing cost by avoiding time-consuming issues with preparation of a cooked egg diet. This should result in an increase in production capacity and a reduction in production costs...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{polyphagous}} pests sequentially use {{crops and}} uncultivated habitats in landscapes dominated by annual crops. As these habitats may contribute in increasing or decreasing pest density in fields {{of a specific}} crop, understanding the scale and temporal variability of source and sink effects is critical for managing landscapes to enhance pest control. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated how local and landscape characteristics affect population density of the <b>western</b> tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug,</b> Lygus hesperus (Knight), in cotton fields of the San Joaquin Valley in California. During two periods covering the main window of cotton vulnerability to Lygus attack over three years, we examined the associations between abundance of six common Lygus crops, uncultivated habitats and Lygus population density in these cotton fields. We also investigated impacts of insecticide applications in cotton fields and cotton flowering date. Consistent associations observed across periods and years involved abundances of cotton and uncultivated habitats that were negatively associated with Lygus density, and abundance of seed alfalfa and cotton flowering date that were positively associated with Lygus density. Safflower and forage alfalfa had variable effects, possibly reflecting among-year variation in crop management practices, and tomato, sugar beet and insecticide applications were rarely associated with Lygus density. Using data from the first two years, a multiple regression model including the four consistent factors successfully predicted Lygus density across cotton fields {{in the last year}} of the study. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that the approach developed here is appropriate to characterize and test the source and sink effects of various habitats on pest dynamics and improve the design of landscape-level pest management strategies...|$|R

The transcriptional profile of 13 LhABCs representative of the ABCA, ABCB, ABCC, ABCG, and ABCH subfamilies was examined across L. hesperus development and within sex-specific adult tissues. All of the transcripts were amplified from both reproductively immature and mature adults and all but LhABCA 8 were expressed to some degree in eggs. Expression of LhABCA 8 was spatially localized to the testis and temporally timed with male reproductive development, suggesting a potential role in sexual maturation and/or spermatozoa protection. Elevated expression of LhABCC 5 in Malpighian tubules suggests a possible role in xenobiotic clearance. Our results provide the first transcriptome-wide analysis of ABC transporters in an agriculturally important hemipteran pest and, because ABC transporters {{are known to be}} important mediators of insecticidal resistance, will provide the basis for future biochemical and toxicological studies on the role of this protein family in insecticide resistance in Lygus species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Both sexes {{of adult}} <b>western</b> {{tarnished}} <b>plant</b> <b>bug,</b> Lygus hesperus Knight (Heteroptera: Miridae), released three volatile chemicals in relatively large amounts when attacked by ants (Pogonomyrmex rugosus and Solenopsis xyloni) or when grabbed by forceps, {{as determined by}} solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography– mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The relative amounts of the volatile compounds, hexyl butyrate, (E) - 4 -oxo- 2 -hexenal, and (E) - 2 -hexenyl butyrate, absorbed by SPME {{as a percentage of}} the largest were 100 %, 44 %, and 4 %, respectively, from females, and 83 %, 37 %, and 3 % from males. Both ant species were repelled by the defensive discharges (confirmed by SPME) when the ants attacked L. hesperus adults. Sexually mature L. hesperus were individually extracted in pentane to quantify the mean amounts of hexyl butyrate (14. 9 μg/female; 10. 3 μg/male), (E) - 4 -oxo- 2 -hexenal (2. 7 μg/female; 3. 1 μg/ male), and (E) - 2 -hexenyl butyrate (1. 2 μg/female; 0. 6 μg/male). (E) - 4 -Oxo- 2 -hexenal was unstable in solvent when in contact with a macerated adult, but relatively stable when the solution was decanted within minutes. The production of the three major volatile components began soon after the emergence of the adult and amounts increased for about 5 – 10 d with little or no increase thereafter. Minor additional constituents were crosscorrelated in many cases with the three major ones. A cost of defensive secretion is suggested for females but not for males, because heavier females produced more volatile compounds than lighter females. The initial discharge percentage, defined as the proportion of volatile compounds initially present that is discharged to defend against predation wa...|$|R
