40|$|This paper {{examines}} how regulators behave in markets {{when there is}} a tension between retail competition and cross subsidy. Using retail and wholesale prices from regional Bell operating company territories and price-cost margins as a proxy for political influence, we find that private interests influence the structure of retail prices, especially favoring rural residential customers. Political influence also extends to <b>wholesale</b> <b>access</b> <b>prices,</b> although the magnitude of its effect is small. Federal high-cost universal service payments to a state do not reduce prices in that state's rural areas but instead lower urban business prices. (c) 2008 by The University of Chicago.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the effects of {{different}} forms of wholesale and retail regulation on retail competition in fixed network telephony markets. We explicitly model two asymmetries between the incumbent operator {{and a group of}} homogenous entrants: (i) while the incumbent has zero marginal costs, the entrant has the <b>wholesale</b> <b>access</b> charge as (positive) marginal costs; (ii) while the incumbent sets a two-part tariff at the retail level (fixed fee and calls price), the entrant can only set a linear price for calls. We model the product of the incumbent as horizontally differentiated from the products of the entrants, who are homogenous and do not have any market power. Competition from other infrastructures such as mobile telephony or cable is modelled as an outside opportunity for consumers. We find that entrants without market power might be subject to a margin squeeze if the <b>wholesale</b> <b>access</b> <b>price</b> is set at average costs and competitive pressure from other infrastructures increases. We argue that wholesale price regulation at average costs is not optimal in such a situation and discuss other forms of cost-based regulation, retail-minus and deregulation as potential alternatives. ...|$|R

In {{the first study}} {{we focus on the}} deployment of green field next generationaccess network infrastructures when the national regulatory authority has thepower to define geographical markets at sub-national level for which it can applydifferentiated regulatory remedies - Geographically Segmented Regulation(GSR). Using a game theory model that we developed, we confirm the asymmetricbusiness case for the geographic development of these new infrastructures:highly populated areas are likely to develop into competitive telecommunicationmarkets while regions with low household density will only see limited investmentand little or no competition. We show that supply side interdependenciesamong markets make the implementation of GSR non-trivial, namely, we showthat changes in the <b>wholesale</b> <b>access</b> <b>price</b> in one market can have undesirableconsequences in the competitive conditions of interrelated regions wherewholesale prices are unchanged.

40|$|In {{important}} component of the National Competition Policy is the regulation of <b>access</b> <b>prices</b> for major infrastructure facilities. The primary goal of regulation is to protect rival firms from anti-competitive measures of the owners of such facilities. It is commonly held that the regulation of <b>access</b> <b>price</b> does not necessarily benefit the non-integrated downstream rivals, since the <b>access</b> <b>price</b> may act as a collusive device to restrict output in the downstream market that will enhance profits accruing to all competitors. We contest this important finding: we develop a sequential game to examine an industry characterised by naturally monopolistic and potentially competitive activities that are vertically related. We establish that in the perfect Nash equilibrium of the proposed game the intergraded firm has an incentive and an ability to use the <b>access</b> <b>price</b> in the upstream market to the detriment of its rivals. It is hence essential to regulate <b>access</b> <b>prices</b> in such markets to protect non-integrated rivals and to promote competition. Firm, Firms, Infrastructure, Policy, Regulation...|$|R

The approach is informationally efficient {{in the sense that}} the regulator is required to know only the marginal cost structure, i. e. the marginal cost of making and terminating a call. The approach is general in that <b>access</b> <b>prices</b> can depend not only on the marginal costs but also on the retail prices, which can be observed by consumers and therefore by the regulator as well. In particular, I consider the set of linear <b>access</b> <b>pricing</b> rules which includes any fixed <b>access</b> <b>price,</b> the Efficient Component Pricing Rule (ECPR) and the Modified ECPR as special cases.

Moreover, under complete information, if networks are poor substitutes, the optimal <b>access</b> <b>price</b> is lower than the marginal cost of access. Under asymmetric information, two effects work in opposite directions. On the one hand, <b>access</b> <b>price</b> is reduced with respect to marginal cost to induce a reduction in final price.

40|$|We are {{grateful}} to Kåre P. Hagen and Kurt Jørnsten for valuable discussions. Furthermore, we acknowledge the Institute for Research in Economics and Business Administration for funding. Essential network infrastructure in telecommunications typically exhibit natural monopoly characteristics resulting in significant market power for the operator. Ex ante regulation is used to ensure rival downstream service providers access to the network in competition with the vertically integrated network operator. Cost orientation is frequently used for regulating the <b>access</b> <b>price.</b> To recover fixed cost, existing rules inevitably tend to result in an <b>access</b> <b>price</b> based on average cost. We compare the effects on market equilibrium in a duopoly where the firms perceive that <b>access</b> <b>price</b> is based on average cost as opposed to when they consider it exogenous. When <b>access</b> <b>price</b> is considered exogenous, the output and contribution of the vertically integrated network operator exceeds that of its rival. On the other hand, when both firms perceive fixed cost to be allocated according to traffic volumes, output and profits are the same for both vertically integrated incumbent and the rival resulting in non-discrimination. If the vertically integrated operator has decentralized decision making, then there are multiple equlibriums when <b>access</b> <b>price</b> is considered exogenous. Welfare will regardless be reduced relative to centralized decision making. Finally, if the firms consider <b>access</b> <b>price</b> as endogenous, then the structure of decision making makes no difference...|$|R
