5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 7. It tracked across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development due to strong wind shear. The wave then split into two, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> portion dissipating over Cuba on August 15 and the southern portion continuing westward. The wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 16. Deep convection increased over the wave upon entering the Pacific, and early on August 19 it started to become better organized. After the development of a low-level circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on August 20 while located about 275miles (445km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E

On April 6, the next portion of the freeway opened. However, there were concerns about what to call the freeway, citing confusion <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> portion of SR75. The entire cost {{of the project was}} $6.3million. SR117 was extended east to SR125, replacing the southerly segment of SR75, by the Legislature in 1976; this took effect at the beginning of 1977. Estimates for completing the freeway ran from $13.8million to $28.5million.|$|E

5|$|Eaton's pintail has two subspecies, A. e. eatoni (the Kerguelen pintail) of Kerguelen Islands, and A. e. drygalskyi (the Crozet pintail) of Crozet Islands, and was {{formerly}} considered conspecific <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> hemisphere's northern pintail.

Unusually for a species with such a large range, northern pintail has no geographical subspecies if Eaton's pintail is treated as a separate species.

5|$|In 1939, M-35 from Negaunee to Big Bay to L'Anse {{was officially}} {{canceled}} {{as a state}} trunkline highway.

The southern segment of M-35 ran from Menominee to Negaunee, and the northern segment ran from Baraga to Ontonagon along the modern M-38. The two segments were rejoined in 1953, closing the gap left by the cancelled Huron Mountain route.
