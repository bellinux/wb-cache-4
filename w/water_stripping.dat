40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a case study}} on the SR- 70 section with microsurface for understanding its performance; a development of a methodology for evaluating the asphalt pavement subsurface condition for applying pavement preservation treatments; and a development of a tool for identifying and quantifying the subsurface distresses. From the case study, {{it was found that}} the main distresses on SR- 70 were longitudinal cracks, fatigue cracks, and potholes. The longitudinal cracking was the most widely distributed distress with 22 % of lane length in the 2 -mile test section among the three distress types. Based on the <b>water</b> <b>stripping</b> test results and the core visual observations, it was confirmed that the test section on SR- 70 had the <b>water</b> <b>stripping</b> problem. In order to have a representative condition indicator for the test section, the conditions were converted into the scores scaled from 0 to 100. Layers with closer to a score of 100 have the better subsurface condition. Therefore, the 28 % of the test section length with the surface distress was detected as the fair subsurface condition with a score of 56. The rest 72 % of the length was estimated as the good subsurface condition with a score of 78. Similarly, 20. 5 % of the test section length with the problem locations determined by GPR had the fair subsurface condition with a score of 56 and the rest 79. 5 % of the length had the good subsurface condition with a score of 76. The lab test results showed poor correlations among the <b>water</b> <b>stripping</b> severities, air voids, and tensile strengths. Thus, the air voids or tensile strength cannot properly estimate the <b>water</b> <b>stripping</b> severity or vice versa. When the laboratory test results with the surface distresses or in the GPR-based problem locations were compared to that without the surface distresses or in the GPR-based non-problem locations, in general, average air voids and <b>water</b> <b>stripping</b> severities decrease and average tensile strengths increase. The observation confirms that the evaluation processes are applicable for evaluating the subsurface condition. Furthermore, the probability that a location determined to be problematic by GPR to be on one of poor conditions based on lab tests was 1. 0. The same probability was obtained for a GPS-based problem location. Accordingly, it was concluded that the laboratory tests with the surface distresses survey or the GPR measurement were reliable method to evaluate the subsurface condition. The FWD results had a weak correlation with the laboratory test results possibly due to fairly long testing interval (i. e., 328 ft). The current FWD test protocol should be improved for evaluating the subsurface condition in pavement preservation application. Guidelines of subsurface condition evaluation for pavement preservation treatment application was developed utilizing the findings from the case study. A concept of hierarchy was used in the guideline by taking project importance and available resources into consideration. A tool including guidelines, computer software (e. g., iSub and iMoisture), and its manual was also developed based on the methodology as a research product. Based on the guideline, it was concluded that the subsurface condition of the case study section on SR- 70 was inadequate for the application of the pavement preservation treatments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe composition, size distribution, and {{abundance}} of floating plastic debris in surface {{waters of the}} Mediterranean Sea were analyzed in relation to distance to land. We combined data from previously published reports with an intensive sampling in inshore waters of the Northwestern Mediterranean. The highest plastic concentrations were found in regions distant from from land {{as well as in}} the first kilometer adjacent to the coastline. In this nearshore <b>water</b> <b>strip,</b> plastic concentrations were significantly correlated with the nearness to a coastal human population, with local areas close to large human settlements showing hundreds of thousands of plastic pieces per km 2. The ratio of plastic to plankton abundance reached particularly high values for the coastal surface waters. Polyethylene, polypropylene and polyamides were the predominant plastic polymers at all distances from coast (86 to 97 % of total items), although the diversity of polymers was higher in the 1 -km coastal <b>water</b> <b>strip</b> due to a higher frequency of polystyrene or polyacrylic fibers. The plastic size distributions showed a gradual increase in abundance toward small sizes indicating an efficient removal of small plastics from the surface. Nevertheless, the relative abundance of small fragments (< 2 mm) was higher within the 1 -km coastal <b>water</b> <b>strip,</b> suggesting a rapid fragmentation down along the shoreline, likely related with the washing ashore on the beaches.

40|$|Pacific Northwest National Laboratory was {{contracted}} by CHPRC {{to evaluate}} the release of 99 Tc from spent resin used to treat water from well 299 -W 15 - 765 and stored for several years. The key questions to be answered are: 1) does 99 Tc readily release from the spent ion exchange resin after being in storage for several years; 2) if hot <b>water</b> <b>stripping</b> is used to remove the co-contaminant carbon tetrachloride, will 99 Tc that has been sequestered by the resin be released; and 3) can spent resin be encapsulated into a cementitious waste form; if so, how much 99 Tc would be released from the weathering of the monolith waste form? The results from the long term stability leach test results confirm that the resin is not releasing {{a significant amount of}} the sequestered 99 Tc, evident by the less than 0. 02 % of the total 99 Tc loaded being identified in the solution. Furthermore, {{it is possible that the}} measured 99 Tc concentration is the result of 99 Tc contained in the pore spaces of the resin. In addition to these results, analyses conducted to examine the impact of hot water on the release of 99 Tc suggest that only a small percentage of the total is being released. This suggest that hot <b>water</b> <b>stripping</b> to remove carbon tetrachloride will not have a significant affect on the resin’s ability to hold-on to sequestered 99 Tc. Finally, encapsulation of spent resin in a cementitious material may be a viable disposal option, but additional tests are needed to examine the extent of physical degradation caused by moisture loss and the effect this degradation process can have on the release of 99 Tc...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWater {{plays an}} {{important}} role in enzyme structure and function in aqueous media. That role becomes even more important when one focuses on enzymes in low water media. Here we present results from molecular dynamics simulations of surfactant-solubilized subtilisin BPN′ in three organic solvents (octane, tetrahydrofuran, and acetonitrile) and in pure water. Trajectories from simulations are analyzed with a focus on enzyme structure, flexibility, and the details of enzyme hydration. The overall enzyme and backbone structures, as well as individual residue flexibility, do not show significant differences between water and the three organic solvents over a timescale of several nanoseconds currently accessible to large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. The key factor that distinguishes molecular-level details in different media is the partitioning of hydration water between the enzyme and the bulk solvent. The enzyme surface and the active site region are well hydrated in aqueous medium, whereas with increasing polarity of the organic solvent (octane → tetrahydrofuran → acetonitrile) the hydration water is stripped from the enzyme surface. <b>Water</b> <b>stripping</b> is accompanied by the penetration of tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile molecules into crevices on the enzyme surface and especially into the active site. More polar organic solvents (tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile) replace mobile and weakly bound water molecules in the active site and leave primarily the tightly bound water in that region. In contrast, the lack of <b>water</b> <b>stripping</b> in octane allows efficient hydration of the active site uniformly by mobile and weakly bound water and some structural water similar to that in aqueous solution. These differences in the active site hydration are consistent with the inverse dependence of enzymatic activity on organic solvent polarity and indicate that the behavior of hydration water on the enzyme surface and in the active site is an important determinant of biological function especially in low water media...|$|E

40|$|The use of multi-orifice rotary nozzles greatly {{increases}} {{the speed and}} stripping effectiveness of high pressure water blasting systems, but also greatly {{increases the}} complexity of selecting and optimizing the operating parameters. The rotational speed of the nozzle must be coupled with its transverse velocity as it passes {{across the surface of}} the substrate being stripped. The radial and angular positions of each orifice must be included in the analysis of the nozzle configuration. Orifices at the outer edge of the nozzle head move at a faster rate than the orifices located near the center. The energy transmitted to the surface from the impact force of the water stream from an outer orifice is therefore spread over a larger area than energy from an inner orifice. Utilizing a larger diameter orifice in the outer radial positions increases the total energy transmitted from the outer orifice to compensate for the wider distribution of energy. The total flow rate from the combination of all orifices must be monitored and should be kept below the pump capacity while choosing orifice to insert in each position. The energy distribution from the orifice pattern is further complicated since the rotary path of all the orifices in the nozzle head pass through the center section. All orifices contribute to the stripping in the center of the path while only the outer most orifice contributes to the stripping at the edge of the nozzle. Additional orifices contribute to the stripping from the outer edge toward the center section. With all these parameters to configure and each parameter change affecting the others, a computer model was developed to track and coordinate these parameters. The computer simulation graphically indicates the cumulative affect from each parameter selected. The result from the proper choices in parameters is a well designed, highly efficient stripping system. A poorly chosen set of parameters will cause the nozzle to strip aggressively in some areas while leaving the coating untouched in adjacent sections. The high pressure <b>water</b> <b>stripping</b> system can be set to extremely aggressive conditions allowing stripping of hard to remove adhesives, paint systems, and even cladding and chromate conversion coatings. The energy force can also be reduced to strip coatings from thin aluminum substrates without causing any damage or deterioration to the substrate's surface.
