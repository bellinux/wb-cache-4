For this purpose, a prismatic 4 m-long and 0. 05 m-wide trapezoidal-shape channel was constructed, namely the homogeneous channel and the composite channel. The homogeneous channel had the same surface lining, whereas the composite channel had two different surface linings. Four different lining materials were considered: plaster, small, medium, and large-sized aggregates. The homogeneous channel showed a reliable Manning coefficient prediction, provided that a uniform flow was achieved. The roughness of the composite channel can be predicted accurately by the nine expressions; the average was 0. 96, with standard deviation of 11. 13 %.

Several series of experiments were conducted for measuring velocity and boundary shear stress. It is found that, Darcy-Weisbach, f, is more sensitive than other resistance coefficients such as Manning, n. Local boundary shear stress around <b>wet</b> <b>perimeter,</b> τb, and depth-averaged velocity, Ud, data are used to evaluate fb. The results illustrate that, the friction factor is shown to be a function of flow depth as well as being dependent upon the Froude number, Fr. Therefore, the local friction factor does not remain constant across the channel. Meanwhile, the common technique of assuming a constant friction factor over the entire section of the channel has been found to have theoretical justification. The results indicate that the global friction factor decreases as flow discharge increases and channel bed getting steeper in the experiments including subcritical and supercritical flow conditions.

With the help of these samples the already known parameters of the population were been valuated. The principal results of the research showed that an inappropriate sampling is the systematic sampling for the calculation of the rains height average due to the difference of the average in relation to the population accounted to 63, 5 % although the simple random sampling underestimated the average when the difference reached - 6, 05 %.

We use these experimentally determined data to simulate the dependence of induction time on particle size, Using these simulated results, we verify the bubble-particle attachment probability prediction developed {{on the basis of}} sliding time and induction time (the Sutherland approach). We have calculated the induction times of fine quartz particles of different diameters less than 80 mu m and different hydrophobicity, collected by single bubbles with diameters of 0. 75 mm, 1. 2 mm and 2. 0 mm. The simulation reported in this present paper shows that the calculated induction times increase with decreasing particle size, except for particles of strong hydrophobicity (advancing water contact angle of 65 degrees and 88 degrees) collected by the small bubbles with a diameter of 0. 75 mm. These results for induction time indicate that extant attachment probability models, based on sliding time and induction rime, cannot adequately describe the elementary steps in the bubble-particle attachment microprocess in flotation, A detailed analysis of induction time, as originally defined and measured by Sven-Nilsson and others was performed. The necessity of the elementary step 2 ̆ 7 rupture of liquid film and formation of three-phase contact of a critical radius (TPC nuclei) 2 ̆ 7 in bubble-particle attachment has been demonstrated. It is suggested that attachment probability can be adequately described by the product of the probabilities of three elementary steps: (1) thinning of intervening liquid film to a critical film thickness; (2) rupture of intervening liquid film and formation of TPC nuclei; (3) expansion of three-phase contact line from the critical radius to form a stable <b>wetting</b> <b>perimeter.</b> The attachment probability model developed according to the Sutherland approach describes only the first elementary step.

This paper is devoted to propose and present an approach to the numerical simulation of SRM internal ballistics, during the entire combustion time, by means of different own made models. The core of this procedure is represented by the SPINBALL model and numerical code. SPINBALL considers a Q 1 D unsteady modeling of the SRM internal ballistics, with many different sub-models able to represents all the driving phenomena that characterize the bore chamber flowfield conditions during the SRM timelife, from the motor start-up to burn-out. In particular, the grain burning surface evolution is accomplished by means of a 3 D numerical grain regression model, named GREG. This model is based on a full matrix level set approach, on rectangular or cylindrical structured grids. GREG gives to the SPINBALL gasdynamical model the evolution in time of the port area, <b>wet</b> <b>perimeter</b> and burn perimeter along the motor axis and, in case, within the submergence zone. The final objective is, hence, to develop an analysis/simulation capability of SRM internal ballistics, for the entire combustion time, with simplified physical models, {{in order to reduce the}} computational cost required, but ensuring, in the meanwhile, an accuracy of the simulation greater than the one usually given by 0 D quasi steady models, during quasi steady state and tail off.

In this paper, we will present a new numerical model, named SPINBALL (Solid Propellant rocket motor INternal BALListic), that comes out from the updating and development of numerical, mathematical and physical models of the SPIT code (Solid Propellant rocket motor Ignition Transient). This new numerical tool is able to extend the numerical simulation of SRM internal ballistic, from ignition transient to quasi steady state and tail-off phase, allowing to use a unique numerical model, with an unsteady quasi- 1 D approach, to predict the whole SRM working lifetime. In particular, to achieve this target, it has been needed to consider that, differently from ignition transient, the subsequent operative phases are characterized by the following main driving phenomena: the grain burning surface evolution in time, the throat area ablation- erosion and the liner and thermal protection mass addition into the chamber flowfield and possible vortex shedding phenomena, with the effect of excitement of the motor longitudinal mode. In order to account all these phenomena, a new approach of the non reactive one phase gas mixture gasdynamics eulerian model is considered to describe the variations of the thermophysical properties of gases added into the bore, due to grain combustion processes and liner and thermal protections, as a consequence of ablative and erosion phenomena. Moreover, a grain geometrical processor module, based on the use of off-line pre-evaluated grain geometrical parameters (port area, <b>wet</b> <b>perimeter</b> and burn perimeter) versus web, has been considered in order to evaluate the geometrical configuration variations of the grain propellant into the chamber and, above all, the burning surface variation with time and grain mass addition into the bore. At last, even if more accurate modelings are going to be analyzed, validated and integrated in SPINBALL, simple models of ablation phenomena of the liner and case thermal protections and ablative materials and ablation-erosion phenomena of the nozzle thermal protections have been considered, to evaluate the qualitative effects of these events on the internal ballistic.

Most river reaches are ungauged and a methodology is needed to estimate the stages, or rates of flow, at specific locations in streams where no measurements are available. Flood routing techniques are utilised to estimate the stages, or rates of flow, in order to predict flood wave propagation along river reaches. Models can be developed for gauged catchments and their parameters related to physical characteristics such as slope, reach width, reach length so that the approach {{can be applied to}} ungauged catchments in the region. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess Muskingum-based methods for flow routing ill ungauged river reaches, both with and without lateral inflows. Using observed data, the model parameters were calibrated to assess performance of the Muskingum flood routing procedures and the Muskingum-Cunge method was then assessed using catchment derived parameters for use in ungauged river reaches. The Muskingum parameters were derived from empirically estimated variables and variables estimated from assumed river cross-sections within the selected river reaches used. Three sub-catchments in the Thukela catchment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa were selected for analyses, with river lengths of 4, 21 and 54 km. The slopes of the river reaches and reach lengths were derived from a digital elevation model. Manning roughness coefficients were estimated from field observations. Flow variables such as velocity, hydraulic radius, <b>wetted</b> <b>perimeters,</b> flow depth and top flow width were determined from empirical equations and cross-sections of the selected rivers. Lateral inflows to long river reaches were estimated from the Saint-Venant equation. Observed events were extracted for each sub-catchment to assess the Muskingum-Cunge parameter estimation method and Three-parameter Muskingum method. The extracted events were further analysed using empirically estimated flow variables. The performances of the methods were evaluated by comparing both graphically and statistically the simulated and observed hydrographs. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken using three selected events and a 50 % variation in selected input variables was used to identify sensitive variablesThe performance of the calibrated Muskingum-Cunge flood routing method using observed hydrographs displayed acceptable results. Therefore, the Muskingum-Cunge flood routing method was applied in ungauged catchments, with variables estimated empirically. The results obtained shows that the computed outflow hydrographs generated using the Muskingum-Cunge method, with the empirically estimated variables and variables estimated from cross-sections of the selected rivers resulted in reasonably accurate computed outflow hydrographs with respect to peak discharge, timing of peak flow and volume. From this study, it is concluded that the Muskingum-Cunge method can be applied to route floods in ungauged catchments in the Thukela catchment and it is postulated that the method can be used to route floods in other ungauged rivers in South Africa...|$|R

This work is devoted to present an approach to the numerical simulation of SRM internal ballistic during the entire combustion time (ignition transient, quasi steady state and tail-off) by means of a Q 1 D unsteady numerical simulation model, named SPINBALL (Solid Propellant rocket motor INternal BALListic). SPINBALL comes out from the updating and further development of the numerical, mathematical and physical models of the SPIT model (Solid Propellant rocket motor Ignition Transient), that allows to extend the numerical simulation of the SRM internal ballistic, from the ignition transient, to quasi steady state and tail-off. SPINBALL core model is a quasi- 1 D unsteady gasdynamics model of the internal ballistic, with source terms that take into account the contribution to the bore flowfield conditions due to the igniter, the grain propellant and thermal protections. The flow is assumed as a non-reacting mixture of perfect gases with space and time varying thermophysical properties (standard thermodynamics approach). The governing equations are discretized by a Godunov-type scheme, first or second order in space and time. The use of a such approach allows to consider the addition into the chamber due to both ablation phenomena from thermal protections and combustion reactions from the grain propellant, but even {{to take into account the}} equilibrium point of the grain propellant exothermic reactions, as function of the local pressure and the variation from that nominal condition, through the combustion efficiency. This main model is completed by several sub-models, in order to describe all the driving phenomena that lead the internal ballistic for the entire combustion time: an igniter model, an heat transfer model for convection and radiation, propellant ignition criterion, a cavity model to account submergence and slot regions, a grain combustion model with the pressure term (APN model) and the erosive term (Lenoir-Robillard model with the modifications due to Lawrence and Beddini). Some of them coming from the SPIT model. Focusing on the driving phenomena that characterize the internal ballistic over the ignition transient, it is known that, during quasi steady state and tail-off, the motor bore flowfield conditions are led mainly by the grain burning surface evolution in time and the possible nozzle throat area ablation phenomena. The grain burning surface evolution model is a 3 D numerical grain regression model (named GREG) based on a full matrix level set approach, on both rectangular and cylindrical structured grids, that gives to the gasdynamical model the evolution in time of port area, <b>wet</b> <b>perimeter</b> and burn perimeter along the motor axis and in the submergence zone. The numerical scheme for the numerical integration of the Level Set equation is built from the strong link between Hamilton-Jacobi equations and conservation laws and it is a first or second order (minmod flux limiter and Heun's method) in time and space time marching scheme based of an exact Riemann solver. The use of a 3 D model is mandatory to carry out the grain burnback analysis in the case of general and complex 3 D grain shapes, as finocyl grains, whatever bore flowfield dimensional model (0 D or Q 1 D) is adopted. GREG module can handle 3 D complex geometries directly from CAD tools, building up its initial condition as a narrow signed distance function from STL (stereolithography) files of the grain propellant and the thermal protections and insulation shapes by a completely automatic procedure. The grain burning rate can be variable, both in space and time. The use of grain propellant shape symmetries is exploited with the setting up of mirroring, or periodic boundary conditions, reducing the computational costs. The evaluation of the grain geometrical parameter, as areas, volumes and perimeters, is made with a robust second order regularization of the Dirac Delta and Heaviside functions to avoid the typical problems related with the use of the standard regularization techniques. While potentially GREG module can be completely coupled with the Q 1 D unsteady flowfield model, in this work, we will consider a decoupling between the grain burnback model and the flowfield model, in order to reduce the computational cost required. GREG model is, hence, used as a pre-processor that generates tables of pre-evaluated grain geometrical properties for a constant burning rate in time and space. During the numerical simulation, these tables of port area, <b>wet</b> <b>perimeter</b> and burning perimeter are then interpolated using the local increment of the web variable, defined by the local grain burning rate, coming from APN and LR models. The final objective is, hence, to develop an analysis/simulation capability of SRM internal ballistic for the entire combustion time, with simplified physical models, in order to reduce the computational cost required, but ensuring, in the meanwhile, an accuracy of the simulation greater than the one usually given by 0 D quasi steady models. In this framework, the comparison between the results obtained with a 0 D quasi steady chamber model and SPINBALL will be made and the effects of the increased detail level of the internal ballistic simulation on the overall prediction capability will be discussed for three SRM: Z 23 second stage of the new European launcher VEGA and two military motors, NAWC n. 6 and 13, on which there are different work in literature, and all motor data are available. Comparisons with the experimental data and with other codes results will be also made...|$|R
