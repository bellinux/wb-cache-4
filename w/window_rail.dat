40|$|Psychoacoustic methodologies were {{investigated}} {{and applied to}} a case study within a cooperation project of the University of Pisa and Magna Closures S. p. A. mainly focused on the acoustics of power windows. The project included tests on closing-opening event sequences of the power <b>window</b> <b>rail,</b> to evaluate the component noise. Different trials were performed varying the test conditions. Time-frequency analyses, psychoacoustic metrics and models were applied to the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) time functions of the raw microphone signals and compared with threshold values from the literature. Scalar parameters quantifying the electric motor steadiness were also computed to characterize the noise excitation source while accelerometer signals were analysed in the frequency domain to extract modal parameters. The SPL time function appeared highly related to supply voltage, motor type and silent block insertion whereas psychoacoustic parameters were able to highlight further peculiarities of sound timbre...|$|E

5000|$|After {{the initial}} {{development}} of infrastructure and some homes, project stalled after {{the outbreak of}} the Mexican Revolution in 1910. After the war was over, Roma, along with sister colonias of Colonia Juárez, Colonia Condesa, Colonia San Rafael, Colonia Santa María la Ribera and others, experienced a building boom in the 1920s and 1930s. The architecture in all of these areas at this time rejected Mexico’s traditional Baroque architecture of red tezontle stone and wrought iron balconies and <b>window</b> <b>rails</b> for a more modern look, heavily influenced by European trends, especially French, and eventually Art Deco. The colonia was at its most exclusive, considered aristocratic and [...] "European," [...] from its beginning {{to the end of the}} 1930s, with its historically and architecturally significant buildings constructed between 1906 and 1939. It not only attracted wealthy Mexican families, but also a number of foreign residents the initial British and American developers to a number of French and Spanish. By the 1930s, the colonia has a number of clubs or meeting houses such as La Bandida, where many politicians in Manuel Ávila Camacho’s government would meet, and erotic bathhouses such as La Torre. Although two significant churches were built between 1900 and 1940, the Cristero War in the 1930s and its related religious persecutions, resulted in their closing, with services held clandestinely in private homes.|$|R

50|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Manhattanville became more {{urbanized}} from country estates in the previous century. The congregation, largely Irish outgrew the old church. The cornerstone for a new church was laid at West 131st St and Convent Avenue in September 1906. The church was completed and dedicated on December 15, 1907 by Archbishop John Farley. The church building seats 700. The stained glass <b>windows,</b> brass altar <b>rail</b> and baptismal font were taken from the old church.|$|R

50|$|The organ is {{currently}} {{situated in a}} corner of the west transept. It and a gallery surround the entry door. They did occupy the sanctuary before the 1972 renovations. From the cathedral's original fitting-out a great number of pine and cedar polished pews and book rails remain to line two sides of the nave and the transepts. A series of steps and a marble altar rail divides the Crossing from the sanctuary, and a marble pulpit stands in the south-west corner of the crossing. Both of these were donated and installed in during the donations made in the 1930s. The five windows over the apse were donated at this time by Downlands College and depict Sacred Heart lancets. Small chapels with marble altars and rails flank the chancel (the Sacred Heart and Lady Chapels).

The capacity man-agement {{is one of the most}} important tasks of railway Infrastructure Managers. The proposed simulation-based approach re-lies on the use of an optimizer and a simulator. The study has been developed for the rail line Verona–Brennero, located in the Italian part of the European Corridor Hamburg–Napoli. Computational results allowed to estimate the commercial capaci-ty differences between the whole line and three important line sections within it. Other computational experiments showed the relevant estimated increase in commercial capacity that a reduction in time spacing between trains could imply. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Falls from {{balconies}} {{and windows}} {{are an important}} cause of childhood injury. This study investigated the circumstances around such falls and attempted to identify possible measures for their prevention. Population: Children, 15 years living in Dallas County, Texas. Methods: Each child treated because of a fall from a building in 1997 – 99 had information about the injury collected, and a parent was contacted to obtain further information. For apartment related falls, {{an attempt was made}} to visit the apartment to measure <b>windows</b> and balcony <b>rails.</b> Results: Ninety eight children were injured in falls from buildings during the three year period; 39 (40 %) were admitted to hospital. Seventy five of the falls (77 %) involved apartments, and most occurred around noon or evening meal times. Among apartment falls, 39 (52 %) fell from windows, 34 (45 %) from balconies, and two (3 %) from unknown sites. For more than two thirds of balcony related falls, the child fell from between the balcony rails, all of which were spaced more than 4 inches (10 cm) apart. On-site measurement showed the rails were an average of 7. 5 inches (19 cm) apart; all of these apartments were built before 1984. For more than two thirds of window related falls, the window was situated within 2 feet (61 cm) of the floor...|$|R

40|$|For {{just over}} a decade the International Space Station (ISS), the most heavily {{protected}} vehicle in Earth orbit, has weathered the space debris environment well. Numerous hypervelocity impact features {{on the surface of}} ISS caused by small orbital debris and meteoroids have been observed. In addition to typical impacts seen on the large solar arrays, craters have been discovered on <b>windows,</b> hand <b>rails,</b> thermal blankets, radiators, and even a visiting logistics module. None of these impacts have resulted in any degradation of the operation or mission of the ISS. Validating the rate of small particle impacts on the ISS as predicted by space debris environment models is extremely complex. First, the ISS has been an evolving structure, from its original 20 metric tons to nearly 300 metric tons (excluding logistics vehicles) ten years later. Hence, the anticipated space debris impact rate has grown with the increasing size of ISS. Secondly, a comprehensive visual or photographic examination of the complete exterior of ISS has never been accomplished. In fact, most impact features have been discovered serendipitously. Further complications include the estimation of the size of an impacting particle without knowing its mass, velocity, and angle of impact and the effect of shadowing by some ISS components. Inadvertently and deliberately, the ISS has also been the source of space debris. The U. S. Space Surveillance Network officially cataloged 65 debris from ISS from November 1998 to November 2008 : from lost cameras, sockets, and tool bags to intentionally discarded equipment and an old space suit. Fortunately, the majority of these objects fall back to Earth quickly with an average orbital lifetime of less than two months and a maximum orbital lifetime of a little more than 15 months. The cumulative total number of debris object-years is almost exactly 10, the equivalent of one piece of debris remaining in orbit for 10 years. An unknown number of debris too small to be tracked and cataloged have also been generated, but normally with even shorter orbital lifetimes. Finally, eight collision avoidance maneuvers have been performed to avoid potential collisions between ISS and large, tracked space debris. The most recent such maneuver was accomplished by ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle, the Jules Verne, just three months before the 10 th anniversary of the launch of ISS's first element...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} Puritan iconoclasm in England {{during the period}} of the civil wars and Interregnum, this thesis looks at the reasons for the {{resurgence}} of large-scale iconoclasm a hundred years after the break with Rome. Initially a reaction to the emphasis on ceremony and the 'beauty of holiness' under Archbishop Laud, the attack on recent 'innovations' introduced into the church (such as images, stained glass <b>windows</b> and communion <b>rails)</b> developed into a drive for further reformation led by the Long Parliament. Increasingly radical legislation targeted not just 'new popery', but pre-reformation survivals and a wide range of objects including some which had been acceptable to the Elizabethan and Jacobean church (for instance organs and vestments). Parallel to this official movement was an unofficial one, undertaken by Parliamentary soldiers during the war, whose iconoclastic violence, particularly against cathedral churches, became notorious. The significance of this spontaneous action and the importance of the anti-Catholic and anti-Episcopal feelings that it represented is examined. So too is the promotion of such feeling and of the cause of the reformation of images through printed literature (both popular and learned). A detailed survey is made of parliament's legislation against images, and the work of its Committee for the Demolition of Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry, headed by Sir Robert Harley. The question of how and how far this legislation was enforced generally is considered, with specific case studies looking at the impact of the iconoclastic reformation in London, the cathedral churches and at the universities...|$|R

5000|$|At the 1950 Earls Court Show Burlingham had two {{new coach}} designs on Royal Tiger and AEC Regal IV chassis, both shown with a luxury 37-seat seating plan in their central-entrance bodies, when 39 or 41 {{would have been}} the more likely choice of all but the most-upmarket customers. The designs were related, having similar {{detailing}} and windscreens, and an identical cast chromium-plated frontal motif, but the AEC had traditional teardrop-shape wheel-arch mouldings and a straight waist <b>rail</b> with vertical <b>window</b> pillars, whilst the Leyland [...] had a curved waist <b>rail,</b> <b>window</b> pillars angled back from the vertical and an ellipsoid moulding sweeping from the front {{to the rear of the}} coach; this feature was known internally as the 'tank panel' because of its resemblance in shape to a World War One tank. This second coach was finished in the livery of its customer Woods of Blackpool, who traded as Seagull Coaches. Show visitors asked Burlingham for the style with the seagull on the side, and this (despite some chagrin at Woods) soon evolved into the marque name for the style. The previous body was still available for vertical-engined heavyweights but also to the new 30 ft length, and only in full-front form, with the tank-panel and front chrome motif as options. 1951 would be last season of a style with its origins in the late 1930s. For the Seagull, though, it was the start of a prosperous decade. In 1994 it came second in the Classic Bus reader poll to find the most attractive coach body style of all time. It was by far the most successful type of coach body for the early underfloor-engined chassis, selling well on Royal Tiger, Regal IV and Daimler Freeline chassis, Daimler choosing the Seagull style for LKV218, its coach demonstrator. Two were also fitted to Foden rear-engined coaches. From 1952 variants were introduced for vertical-engined chassis, starting with a style for the initial Bedford SB, a 35-seat version with a lengthened rear overhang. Shortly afterwards Scottish Omnibuses (as SMT had become) requested a version to fit Bedford OB chassis converted to forward control; these were known as 'baby Seagulls' and went to SOL and its Highland Omnibuses subsidiary. SOL also took Seagulls to rebody formerly half-cab AEC Regal IIIs. Others who ordered very large numbers of the style were Ribble and many other BET group members and independent coach operators, the largest customer from that sector being Wallace Arnold.|$|R
