5|$|In {{response}} to the Reno Gang and other criminals, several white cap groups began operating in the state, primarily in the southern counties. They began carrying out lynchings against suspected criminals, leading the state to attempt {{to crack down on}} their practices. By the turn of the 20th century, they had become so notorious that anti-lynching laws were passed and in one incident the governor called out the militia to protect a prisoner. When the <b>white</b> <b>caps</b> showed up to lynch him, the militia opened fire, killing one and wounding eleven. Vigilante activity decreased following the incident, and remained low until the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius sasicola is {{a species}} of Marasmiaceae fungus known from Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. First {{collected}} in 2000, it was described in 2002 by Haruki Takahashi. The species produces small mushrooms with <b>white</b> <b>caps</b> and very short, very thin black stems. Unlike in other, similar species, the stems enter the plant matter on which the mushroom grows. The six to eight white gills are spread out around the cap, {{and all of them}} reach the stem. The flesh has no taste or odour. Found in June, the species grows on dead Sasa leaves, from which it takes its specific epithet.|$|E
5|$|The Texas League, a {{baseball}} league, {{was founded in}} the 1800s, temporarily discontinued, and then restarted in the early 1900s evolving into a minor league. During the 1930s investors in Galveston, particularly Shearn Moody, established the Galveston Buccaneers baseball team, a successor to the former Galveston Pirates. The Buccaneers won the league championship in 1934 but the team was sold in 1937 after Moody's death. After the war, the new Gulf Coast League was established and the Galveston <b>White</b> <b>Caps</b> team was created. Galveston won the championship in 1953 but the team then faded and was disbanded in 1955 {{as the rest of}} Galveston's economy was collapsing.|$|E

50|$|In Shi'a Islam, a black head {{wrap around}} a small <b>white</b> <b>cap</b> is worn by {{descendants}} of Muhammad called Sayyids, and white turbans by other well-educated persons and scholars.

5|$|Tropical Storm Karen {{produced}} {{light to}} moderate winds across Atlantic Canada, peaking at 47mph (76km/h) with {{a gust of}} 64mph (103km/h) in Cape George in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, along with a 26mph (42km/h) report in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Rainbands in the storm dropped light rainfall of up to 1.8inches (46mm) in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and 1.4inches (35mm) in Saint John, New Brunswick, most of which fell in {{a short amount of}} time. Skewed to {{the left side of the}} transitioning storm, the rainfall was beneficial for the drought-stricken areas of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Due to the fast-moving nature of the storm, though, most areas reported only around half an inch of rain. A buoy in Halifax Harbour reported wave heights of up to 16.7feet (5.1m), causing breaking waves at docks <b>white</b> <b>caps</b> along the ocean. Damage in Canada was minor due to the storm, limited to an uprooted tree in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia and several other trees with damaged branches. There were no injuries or fatalities in Canada.|$|E

25|$|Today's {{commercial}} {{variety of}} the common mushroom originally was a light brown color.

Similar to the commercial development history of the navel orange and Red Delicious apple, cultures were grown from the mutant individuals, and most of the cream-colored store mushrooms marketed today are products of this 1926 chance natural mutation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, the Argentine capital Buenos Aires had a large {{expatriate}} British community of some 10,000 people. As in many other parts of the world, football was introduced to Argentina by the British. The first recorded football match played in Argentina was organized by the Buenos Aires Cricket Club in Palermo, Buenos Aires, on 20 June 1867, and played between two teams of British railway workers, the <b>White</b> <b>Caps</b> and the Red Caps (it was common in the early days of football for teams to be distinguished by caps rather than jerseys).|$|E

Despite all the fighting, Robertson was not seated. Gray dropped his attempt to be elected to the Senate, and the situation fueled the public's support of an amendment to make senators elected by popular vote. Gray only achieved three of his campaign goals while governor. He was able to have funds appropriated to begin construction of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. He also successfully advocated the switch from a short ballot to a long ballot following several years of high voter fraud. He also successfully had the <b>White</b> <b>Caps,</b> a group involved in vigilantism {{in the southern part of}} the state, investigated and broken up.|$|E

Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic <b>white</b> <b>caps</b> have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. Incidents such as these which make Tibetans look bad on the international stage are covered up by the Tibetan exile community. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims. In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking Kache minority of Muslims).|$|E

Its fruit bodies (mushrooms) have <b>white</b> <b>caps</b> with an orange-red to orange-brown center that measure up to [...] wide.

500|$|M.rotula is {{distinguished}} from M.bulliardii by its larger size, and {{greater number of}} gills. M.limosus is found in marshes, where it fruits on the dead stems of reeds and rushes. Tetrapyrgos nigripes (formerly treated in Marasmius) has <b>white</b> <b>caps</b> that are [...] in diameter, attached gills that are sometimes slightly decurrent, a dark stem covered with tiny white hairs that give it a powdered appearance, and triangular to star-shaped spores. M.neorotula, described from Brazil, was considered by its discoverer Rolf Singer to be closely related to M.rotula. In addition to its tropical distribution, it can distinguished from M.rotula by its smaller size and more widely spaced gills. M.rotuloides, known only from montane forests of Trinidad, can only be reliably distinguished from M.rotula by microscopic characteristics: it has smaller, ovoid spores measuring 5 by 2.5µm.|$|E
500|$|Amanita daucipes is {{a species}} of fungus in the Amanitaceae family of the Agaricales order of mushrooms. Found {{exclusively}} in North America, the mushroom may be recognized in the field by the medium to large <b>white</b> <b>caps</b> with pale orange tints, and the dense covering of pale orange or reddish-brown powdery conical warts on the cap surface. The mushroom also has a characteristic large bulb {{at the base of}} its stem with a blunt short rooting base, whose shape is suggestive of the common names carrot-footed Lepidella, carrot-foot Amanita, or turnip-foot Amanita. The mushroom has a strong odor that has been described variously as [...] "sweet and nauseous", or compared to an old ham bone, or soap. Edibility is unknown for the species, but consumption is generally not recommended due its position in the Amanita subgroup Lepidella, which contains some poisonous members.|$|E
500|$|Wanderers {{are known}} to have played in orange, purple, and black for at least part of their existence, {{although}} as no photographs of the team exist, the exact design is not known. [...] A replica shirt sold in the modern era has the three colours in horizontal stripes, a likely arrangement given that horizontally-striped shirts were very common during the Victorian era. The programme for the club's 1875 away match with Queen's Park, however, lists Wanderers as playing in white shirts. [...] In the absence of shirt numbering, which would not be introduced for another sixty years, the programme identifies the individual players by the colours of their stockings (socks) or caps, with Alcock and Kinnaird both listed as wearing blue and <b>white</b> <b>caps</b> and Jarvis Kenrick identified by his cerise and French grey cap, the colours of his former club Clapham Rovers. The modern club's crest is derived from the Harrow School crest, which may have adorned the shirts of the original team.|$|E
