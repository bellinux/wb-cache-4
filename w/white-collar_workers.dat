5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E

From 1926, the saving bank outlets were used to pay wages to blue- and <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers.</b> The savings banks were used to distribute state lottery tickets and for the placement of state bonds with the population. The savings banks introduced wider services such as money transfers.|$|E

25|$|Aside from steel, Pittsburgh has led in {{manufacturing}} of aluminum, glass, shipbuilding, petroleum, foods, sports, transportation, computing, autos, and electronics. For {{part of the}} 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita. America's 1980s deindustrialization laid off area blue-collar workers and thousands of downtown <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> when the longtime Pittsburgh-based world headquarters moved out. This heritage left the area with renowned museums, medical centers, parks, research centers, libraries, a diverse cultural district and the most bars per capita in the U.S.|$|E

25|$|Sanbetsu {{was founded}} in August 1946. During its early phase it counted with around 1.5 million members. Sanbetsu was {{organized}} on initiative of the Japanese Communist Party, and the key leaders of the organization were communists. The organization was able to mobilize a large section of <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> in government and civil service sectors. Salaries in the public sectors were about a half of salaries in the private sector, a fact that enabled the public sector to become a centre of radical trade unionism. Sanbetsu also established {{a foothold in the}} transportation sector. Kokurō ('National Railway Workers Union') was an important Sanbetsu union.|$|E
25|$|The first {{decades of}} the 20th century saw marked {{economic}} and social change in Brazil. With manufacturing on the rise, the central government—dominated by the coffee oligarchs and the old order of café com leite and coronelismo—came under threat from the political aspirations of new urban groups: professionals, government and <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers,</b> merchants, bankers, and industrialists. In parallel, growing prosperity encouraged a rapid rise in the population of new working class Southern and Eastern European immigrants, who contributed to the growth of trade unionism, anarchism, and socialism. In the post-World War I period, Brazil saw its first wave of general strikes and the establishment of the Communist Party in 1922.|$|E
25|$|Allende’s {{first step}} in early 1971 was to raise minimum wages (in real terms) for blue-collar workers by 37%–41% and 8%–10% for <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers.</b> Educational, food, and housing {{assistance}} was significantly expanded, with public-housing starts going up twelvefold and eligibility for free milk extended from age 6 to age 15. A year later, blue-collar wages were raised by 27% in real terms and white-collar wages became fully indexed. Price controls were also set up, while the Allende Government introduced a system of distribution networks through various agencies (including local committees on supply and prices) {{to ensure that the}} new rules were adhered to by shopkeepers.|$|E

25|$|Opportunities for leisure {{activities}} increased dramatically as real wages {{continued to grow}} and hours of work continued to decline. In urban areas, the nine-hour workday became increasingly the norm; the 1874 Factory Act limited the workweek to 56.5 hours, encouraging the movement toward an eventual eight-hour workday. Helped by the Bank Holiday Act of 1871, which created a number of fixed holidays, a system of routine annual vacations came into play, starting with <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> and moving into the working-class. Some 200 seaside resorts emerged thanks to cheap hotels and inexpensive railway fares, widespread banking holidays and the fading of many religious prohibitions against secular activities on Sundays. Middle-class Victorians used the train services to visit the seaside, Large numbers travelling to quiet fishing villages such as Worthing, Brighton, Morecambe and Scarborough began turning them into major tourist centres, and people like Thomas Cook saw tourism and even overseas travel as viable businesses.|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{inflation}} fell from 36.1% in 1970 to 22.1% in 1971, while average real wages rose by 22.3% during 1971. Minimum real wages for blue-collar workers were increased by 56% {{during the first quarter}} of 1971, while in the same period real minimum wages for <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers</b> were increased by 23%, a development that decreased the differential ratio between blue- and white-collar workers’ minimum wage from 49% (1970) to 35% (1971). Central government expenditures went up by 36% in real terms, raising the share of fiscal spending in GDP from 21% (1970) to 27% (1971), and as part of this expansion, the public sector engaged in a huge housing program, starting to build 76,000 houses in 1971, compared to 24,000 for 1970. During a 1971 emergency program, over 89,000 houses were built, and during Allende’s three years as president an average of 52,000 houses were constructed annually. Although the acceleration {{of inflation}} in 1972 and 1973 eroded part of the initial increase in wages, they still rose (on average) in real terms during the 1971–73 period.|$|E

500|$|The social {{historian}} James Hammerton defines [...] "Pooterism" [...] as [...] "the dependent {{weakness and}} inflated social pretension of <b>white-collar</b> <b>workers,</b> {{constructed in the}} workplace but expressed just as powerfully at home".

Charles Pooter, says Hammerton, was a metaphor for lower middle-class pretension, pomposity and self-importance, set up for mockery by the [...] "elites". [...] However, by the mid-20th century changes in the perception of masculine roles in lower middle-class society had stifled the mockery, as men increasingly embraced domesticity. [...] Hammerton remarks that the Grossmiths [...] "would surely appreciate the irony in seeing features of the lower middle-class existence they mocked so mercilessly becoming the more universal model for 20th century family life". Bailey remarks on how the poet John Betjeman presented the Pooters [...] "not as objects of ridicule but of envy, snug and secure in their suburban retreat".|$|E
