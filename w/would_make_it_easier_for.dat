5|$|About {{half the}} {{potential}} prey that hit orb webs escape. A web has to perform three functions: intercepting the prey (intersection), absorbing its momentum without breaking (stopping), and trapping the prey by entangling it or sticking to it (retention). No single design {{is best for}} all prey. For example: wider spacing of lines will increase the web's area and hence its ability to intercept prey, but reduce its stopping power and retention; closer spacing, larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention, but <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> potential prey to see and avoid the web, at least during the day. However, there are no consistent differences between orb webs built for use {{during the day and}} those built for use at night. In fact, there is no simple relationship between orb web design features and the prey they capture, as each orb-weaving species takes a wide range of prey.|$|E
5|$|Although {{beyond their}} jurisdiction, the Navigation commissioners {{attempted}} {{to extend their}} powers, to improve the river below the junction with Aike Beck. They particularly wanted to replace the stone Hull Bridge, near Beverley, with a swing bridge, which <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> keels to reach Frodingham bridge. The Corporation of Beverley objected, because the bridge was the main route of communication between Beverley and Holderness, and the commissioners instead dredged parts of the river to improve access. Plans to improve Hull Bridge were again resisted by Beverley Corporation in 1799, but an agreement was finally reached in 1801, and an Act of Parliament was obtained in July of that year. William Chapman acted as engineer, as the act authorised the construction of towpaths, a new cut between Bethels Bridge and the lock at Struncheon Hill, to avoid a long loop in the river, and rebuilding of the bridge. The bridge cost £500, half of which was met by Richard Bethell, {{the owner of the}} Leven Canal, on condition that the tolls for passing through it were reduced significantly.|$|E

Under Mir's direction, Gilani went to Philadelphia and legally changed his name to David Coleman Headley, taking his mother's surname. Even though Pennsylvania law requires a background check for name changes, state officials apparently did not uncover Headley's previous drug convictions. The name change <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> Headley to hide his Pakistani ancestry and pass as a Westerner, leading anyone he encountered to assume he was a tourist.|$|E

He has become a prominent supporter of laws requiring companies to give their workers parental leave, sick leave, and vacation time, noting that such laws have been adopted by nearly all other developed countries. He also supports legislation that <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> workers to join or form a trade union.|$|E
25|$|Larger {{trees are}} more likely to support more Orthalicus reses reses snails than smaller trees, {{probably}} because they provide the snails with an increased surface area for foraging. It is not known if Orthalicus reses reses prefer certain tree types or species; however, Voss (1976) suggested tree snails generally prefer trees with smooth bark rather than trees with rough bark, because it would require less energy to crawl over smooth bark. Voss also believed Orthalicus reses reses would prefer smooth bark because it <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> them to form a secure mucous seal when they were aestivating, resulting in lower mortalities from dehydration or accidental dislodgement.|$|E

25|$|Circular {{migration}} {{also plays}} an important role in international development, and policy initiatives have the potential to aid in this development. Many policy makers from both national and international institutions are advocating for policies that make the movement of migrant workers between their home and host countries easier. Ideally, established circular migration systems facilitated and protected by the law would allow for the “triple-win” scenario that benefits countries of origin, countries of destination and the migrants themselves. The International Organization for Migration advocates that destination countries should provide mechanisms that promote repeat and regular circular migration, while also providing incentives to return to their same job. There are several possible measures that would increase the ease and impact of circular migration. The provision of legal residential status and flexible work visas would likely allow for increased circular migration between countries. Giving returning migrants priority for residency permits for additional temporary employment over first-time migrants <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> circular migrants to obtain official legal status, which has shown to be beneficial for migration. In addition, long-term multi-entry visas provided to return migrants would encourage multiple and repeated trips. Furthermore, one of the most simple policy recommendations is that governments should promote the free movement of individuals within the borders of their own countries. Lastly, in an effort to combat brain drain, the World Bank has called for developed countries to pay a tax to developing countries in order to make up for the loss of human capital.|$|E

In the campaign, Tillman was {{a strong supporter of}} free silver or bimetallism, making silver legal tender at the historic ratio to gold of 16:1. Such a policy would inflate the currency, and Tillman felt that <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the farmer to repay debts.

500|$|A month {{prior to}} the premiere of Star Trek, Desilu held a {{screening}} for NBC executives to help decide which episode to broadcast first, and several stories were considered.

Justman felt that [...] "The Naked Time" [...] <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> viewers to understand the characters, but later agreed with NBC's decision to show [...] "The Man Trap" [...] first.

500|$|In 1986 the IOC {{decided to}} stagger the Summer and Winter Games.

It was decided that 1992 {{would be the last}} year to have both a Winter and Summer Olympic Games. [...] There were two underlying reasons for this change: first was the television lobby's desire to maximise advertising revenue as it was difficult to sell advertising time for two Games in the same year; [...] second was the IOC's desire to gain more control over the revenue generated by the Games. It was decided that staggering the Games <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> corporations to sponsor individual Olympic Games, which would maximise revenue potential.

500|$|The Single Eurasian Sky programme, {{administered}} by the Eurasian Economic Commission, outlines {{the creation of a}} single market for air services and a single air traffic zone.

The terms and conditions of operation in the common aviation market have not yet been agreed on. However, the project is likely to be modelled on the European Union's Single European Sky.

500|$|Between 9 and 14 April, {{groups of}} {{soldiers}} from the disbanded 108th Regiment roamed the Bjelovar countryside {{looking for a way}} home. Serb officers that had refused to surrender raided Croat homes, hoping to find food, money and civilian clothing that <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> them to pass through German and Ustaše checkpoints. In some villages, Croat peasants disarmed defeated VKJ units and plundered their warehouses. Some of these peasants, especially those in Gudovac, entered local units known as [...] "readiness battalions". On 10 April, the Germans reached Bjelovar and set up a series of command posts but left the Ustaše in de facto control of the city. The Ustaše were wary of the danger posed by the Serb peasantry. Many had been in the VKJ {{at the time of the}} invasion, and had simply discarded their military fatigues and taken their rifles home. Mišo Sabolek, a local Ustaše commander, reported: [...] "Bjelovar and its surroundings are besieged by Serbs, who are... killing and looting homes in the villages of Nart, Gudovac and the Česma forest." [...] In mid-April, Sabolek reported that he had sent 35 gunmen to [...] "quell violence" [...] around Bjelovar. His superiors in Zagreb ordered him to [...] "take any measures necessary to restore order" [...] in the district. The Ustaše searched dozens of Serb homes, hoping to find illegal weapons. This was followed by the arresting of [...] "undesired elements", mostly members of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (Komunistička partija Jugoslavije, KPJ).
