40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of synthetic jets heat transfer and flow field behaviour. Synthetic <b>jets</b> are <b>devices</b> used mainly for flow control and heat transfer. Such devices are able to "synthetize" a jet from the ambient {{in which they are}} embedded through a simple membrane oscillation inside a cavity with an orifice. Such features make them high reliable, silent and easy to be miniaturized. For these reasons, they are widely investigated also as electronic cooling devices. State of art literature shows that the heat transfer performance of these devices are promising. Under these considerations, the present research is focused on the design and analysis of a different type of synthetic <b>jet</b> <b>device</b> with respect to its classical configuration. Such a device is experimentally characterized through the study of its free and impinging flow field. Furthermore the heat transfer rate has been evaluated.

On the basis of experimental researches results of vortex chamber superchargers the diagram comparison of achievable injector factors direct-flow <b>jet</b> <b>devices</b> and vortex chamber superchargers is plotted. Findings. It is received that the injector factor on a solid of vortex chamber supercharger surpasses four times achievable (theoretical) injector factor on a solid of the direct-flow <b>jet</b> <b>device.</b> Consequently, necessary pressure of an active flow considerably decreases, and the necessary (consumed) power brought to the device for supply of the set injector factor on a solid decreases.

The heat transfer performances have been enhanced through the design of innovative synthetic <b>jet</b> <b>devices,</b> as the twin synthetic <b>jets</b> <b>device.</b> Obviously the heat transfer performances of the classic and innovative synthetic <b>jet</b> <b>devices</b> are strictly related to their impinging flow field. Therefore the behavior of impinging single and twin circular synthetic jets in phase opposition is experimentally investigated by using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) at Reynolds and Strouhal numbers equal to 5100 and 0. 024, respectively. Several nozzle-to-plate distances (H), ranging between 2 and 10 nozzle diameters (D), have been investigated. The time-averaged behavior of the velocity components has been reported and discussed. Their distributions, near the impinging plate, have been described. For the single jet, at short nozzle-to-plate distances (H/D 6), the axial velocity profile is bell-shaped. This is ascribed to the adverse pressure gradient strength and the potential core-like region extension. External oscillations are observed in all the flow field quantities near the impinging plate at 2 diameters from the stagnation point due to a secondary counter rotating vortex ring generation. The presence of such a counter rotating vortex ring decreases as the nozzle-to-plate distance increases. Comparing the two synthetic jet configurations, higher axial velocity and turbulence level but lower axial phase-correlated organized contribution to velocity have been found for the twin case because of the jets interaction. The evolution of the flow field for both configurations has been explained through phase-averaged measurements. High turbulence is observed along the shear layer emanated by the nozzle edge and in the vortex ring core. During the suction phase the saddle point shows a different behavior in the two configurations. In the single case, the saddle point reaches the impinging plate causing injection of air from the plate into the device. Differently the twin configuration generates two saddle points which do not reach the impinging plate {{because of the presence}} of the other impinging synthetic jet...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{air distribution}} {{systems that are}} based on confluent jets; this system can be of interest for the establishment of indoor environments, to fulfill the goals of indoor climate and energy-efficient usage. The main objective {{of this study is to}} provide deeper understanding of the flow field development of a supply device that is designed based on wall confluent jets and to investigate the ventilation performance by experimental and numerical methods. In this study, the supply device can be described as an array of round jets on a flat surface attached to a side wall. Multiple round jets that issue from supply device apertures are combined at a certain distance downstream from the device and behave as a united jet or so-called confluent jets. Multiple round jets that are generated from the supply device move downward and are attached to the wall at the primary region, due to the Coanda effect, and then they become wall confluent jets until the floor wall is reached. A wall jet in a secondary region is formed along the floor after the stagnation region. The characteristics of the flow field and the ventilation performance of conventional wall confluent jets and modified wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>devices</b> are investigated experimentally in an office test room. The study of the modified wall confluent jets is intended to improve the efficiency of the conventional one while maintaining acceptable thermal comfort in an office environment. The results show that the modified wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>device</b> can provide acceptable thermal comfort for the occupant with lower airflow rate compared to the conventional wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>device.</b> Numerical predictions using three turbulence models (renormalization group (RNG k– ε), realizable (Re k– ε), and shear stress transport (SST k– ω) are evaluated by measurement results. The computational box and nozzle plate models are used to model the inlet boundary conditions of the nozzle device. In the isothermal study, the wall confluent jets in the primary region and the wall jet in the secondary region, when predicted by the three turbulence models, are in good agreement with the measurements. The non-isothermal validation studies show that the SST k– ω model is slightly better at predicting the wall confluent jets than the other two models. The SST k– ω model is used to investigate the effects of the nozzle diameter, number of nozzles, nozzle array configuration, and inlet discharge height on the ventilation performance of the proposed wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>device.</b> The nozzle diameter and number of nozzles play important roles in determining the airflow pattern, temperature field, and draught distribution. Increased temperature stratification and less draught distribution are achieved by increasing the nozzle diameter and number of nozzles. The supply device with smaller nozzle diameters and fewer nozzles yields rather uniform temperature distribution due to the dominant effect of mixing. The flow behavior is nearly independent of the inlet discharge height for the studied range. The proposed wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>device</b> is compared with a mixing supply device, impinging supply device and displacement supply device. The results show that the proposed wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>device</b> has the combined behavior of both mixing and stratification principles. The proposed wall confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>device</b> provides better overall ventilation performance than the mixing and displacement supply devices used in this study. This study covers also another application of confluent jets that is based on impinging technology. The supply device under consideration has an array of round jets on a curve.

The flow behavior and ventilation performance of the impinging confluent <b>jets</b> supply <b>device</b> is studied experimentally in an industrial premise.

40|$|Helicopter {{performance}} is {{greatly influenced by}} its drag. Pylons, fuselage, landing gear, and especially the rotor hub of a helicopter experience large separated flow regions, even under steady level flight conditions the vehicle has been designed for, contributing to the helicopter drag. Several passive and active flow control concepts have been studied for reducing helicopter drag. While passive flow control methods reduce drag, they do so at one optimized design condition. Therefore, passive drag reduction methods may not work for helicopters that operate under widely varying flight conditions. Active flow control (AFC) methods overcome this disadvantage and consequently are widely being pursued. The present investigator has studied some of these AFC methods using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques and has found synthetic (or pulsed) jets {{as one of the}} more effective drag reduction devices. Two bluff bodies, representative of helicopter components, have been studied and the mechanism behind drag reduction has been analyzed. It was found that the increase in momentum due to the jet, and a resultant reduction in the separated flow region, is the main reason for drag reduction in these configurations. In comparison with steady jets, synthetic jets were found to use less power for a greater drag reduction. The flow inside these synthetic <b>jet</b> <b>devices</b> is incompressible. It is computationally inefficient to use compressible flow solvers in incompressible regions. In such regions, using Lattice Boltzmann equations (LBE) is more suitable compared to solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The length scales close to the synthetic <b>jet</b> <b>devices</b> are very small. LBE may be used to better resolve these small length scale regions. However, using LBE throughout the whole domain would be computationally expensive since the grid spacing in the LBE solver has to be of the order of the mean free path. To address this need, a coupled Lattice Boltzmann-Navier-Stokes (LB-NS) methodology has been developed. The LBE solver has been successfully validated in a standalone manner for several benchmark cases. The solver has also been shown to be of second order accuracy. This LBE solver has been subsequently coupled with an existing Navier-Stokes (NS) solver. Validation of the coupled methodology has been done for analytical problems with known closed form solution. This LB-NS methodology is further used to simulate the flow past a cylinder where synthetic <b>jet</b> <b>devices</b> have been used to reduce drag. The LBE solver is used in the cavity of the synthetic jet nozzle while the NS solver is employed {{in the rest of the}} domain. The cylinder configuration was chosen to demonstrate drag reduction on helicopter hub shape geometries. Significant drag reduction is observed when synthetic jets are used, compared to the baseline no flow control case. Ph. D.
