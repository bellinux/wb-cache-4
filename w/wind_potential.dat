5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 11.5 GW of onshore <b>wind</b> <b>potential</b> exists, enough to provide 45 TWh of energy. More than double this amount exists on offshore sites where mean wind speeds are greater than on land. The total offshore potential {{is estimated}} at 25 GW, which although more expensive to install, could be enough to provide almost half the total energy used in Scotland. Plans to harness up to 4.8 GW of the potential in the inner Moray Firth and Firth of Forth were announced in January 2010. Moray Offshore Renewables and SeaGreen Wind Energy were awarded development contracts by the Crown Estate {{as part of a}} UK-wide initiative. Also in 2010, discussions were held between the Scottish Government and Statoil of Norway with a view to developing a 5-turbine floating windfarm, possibly to be located off Fraserburgh. In July 2016, RSPB challenged development in the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{from the}} National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (SENAMHI) have {{estimated}} a total windpower potential of 19 GWh/year for Peru, or about 70% of current electricity consumption. The Departments of Talara, Laguna Grande, Marcona and Pta.

40|$|AbstractWind {{resource}} {{assessment is}} the key step in windfarm deployment at pre-investment stage. In a wind farm, it {{is often the case}} that wind climate data is measured at one place and it is required to estimate <b>wind</b> resource <b>potential</b> at any other point in the vicinity. Also, the <b>wind</b> resource <b>potential</b> depends on the effect of terrain at the wind farm site. In this paper, using computer simulation software, the effect of terrain is considered in assessing <b>wind</b> resource <b>potential</b> at a site. A case study of actual wind farm consisting of 33 wind turbines installed at Tamilnadu, India is simulated using Meteodyn software to assess the <b>wind</b> power <b>potential</b> in-terms of capacity factor...|$|R
30|$|The Weibull {{distribution}} {{is important for}} the assessment of the <b>wind</b> energy <b>potential</b> and <b>wind</b> characteristics; therefore, it is necessary to determine its parameters properly.

Each anemometer collects wind speed data in 10-minute intervals. The data aid wind farm developers in determining whether an area is suitable for developing a large-scale installation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 11.5 GW of onshore <b>wind</b> <b>potential</b> exists, enough to provide about 45 TWh of energy in a year, allowing for wind variability.

40|$|In this paper, {{we use the}} {{correlation}} between the average wind speed and ambient temperature to develop models for predicting <b>wind</b> <b>potentials</b> for two Nigerian locations. Assuming that the troposphere is a typical heterogeneous mixture of ideal gases, we find that for the studied locations, wind speed clearly correlates with ambient temperature in a simple polynomial of 3 rd degree. The coefficient of determination and root-mean-square error of the models are 0. 81; 0. 0024 and 0. 56; 0. 0041, respectively, for Enugu (6. 40 N; 7. 50 E) and Owerri (5. 50 N; 7. 00 E).

25|$|A 2012 {{report from}} the National Renewable Energy Laboratory {{described}} technically available renewable energy resources for each state and estimated that urban utility scale photovoltaics could supply 2,232 TWh/year, rural utility scale PV 280,613 TWh/year, rooftop PV 818 TWh/year, and CSP 116,146 TWh/year, {{for a total of}} almost 400,000 TWh/year, 100 times current consumption of 3,856 TWh in 2011. Onshore <b>wind</b> <b>potential</b> is estimated at 32,784 TWh/year, and offshore wind at 16,976 TWh/year. The total available from all renewable resources is estimated at 481,963 TWh/year.|$|E
25|$|Ontario, {{especially}} the southern part, has abundant <b>wind</b> <b>potential</b> {{that can be}} harnessed to generate renewable electricity. It is estimated that Ontario has an area of about 300,000km² within {{the reach of the}} transmission system {{that can be used for}} generating electricity from wind energy. This area approximates the size of Germany, which is the leading country for producing electricity from wind energy. If Ontario could intensively use wind energy like Germany, wind-based electricity would contribute up to 13% of the province's demand. Generating electricity from wind energy is considered cost-effective in southern Ontario because of closeness to transmission lines and load centres.|$|E
2500|$|The Argentine Patagonia {{region has}} a very large <b>wind</b> <b>potential.</b> The Chubut Wind Power Regional Center (CREE) {{estimated}} the theoretical potential for the region at 500 GW of electricity generation. However, this large potential is still largely unexploited. One {{of the reasons for}} this underdevelopment is that existing tariffs and incentives do not make wind power development attractive enough yet. However, the main deterrent to wind power development in the region has been the lack of transmission lines that connect the Patagonia region with the National Interconnected System. [...] The completion of the Choele-Choel-Puerto Madryn high voltage line, the first section of Línea Patagónica under the framework of the Plan Federal de Transporte de Energía Eléctrica, eliminated this bottleneck in March 2006.|$|E
