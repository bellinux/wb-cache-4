25|$|Their home ground {{until then}} was the Municipal Stadion an der Grünwalder Strasse, colloquially {{referred}} to as the Grünwalder, or Sechz'ger ("Sixtier"), as it was owned before the war by 1860 München. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> run down place with a maximum capacity of around 40,000, mostly standing places. Indeed, it was so downmarket that Munich, the country's third-largest city, had not hosted a single national team match since 1940.|$|E
25|$|The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railroad <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> weak reed for Seattle {{to cling}} to.

But it was the only hope that Seattle-New York Alki held out for a connection with a transcontinental system. On the other hand, the side benefits of the SLS enabled boosters to hit the jackpot with the Great Northern.|$|E
25|$|With Keith Duckworth's DFV engine {{being the}} root of the grip problem, it was perhaps to be {{expected}} that Cosworth were the first to attempt a 4WD solution. Ford's Walter Hayes, who had backed the DFV, gave the project his blessing and former McLaren designer Robin Herd joined Duckworth in designing the car, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> radical departure from the normal late-60s cars. The Cosworth featured a very angular shape, with sponsons between the wheels either side of the aluminium monocoque to house the fuel tanks and improve the car's aerodynamics, and the cockpit was quite visibly off-set to the driver's left. Unlike all the other 4WD F1 cars, instead of using the Ferguson transmission Cosworth built their own version from scratch, and even went as far as producing a new gearbox and a bespoke magnesium-cast DFV, perhaps anticipating a future market for their technology.|$|E

[...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "overall, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> drab episode" [...] and added that [...] "it had some moments, such as the videogame boxing matches between Homer and Bart, but Lisa lacked the strength at this point to carry an entire show." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. James Poniewozik of Time Magazine wrote, [...] "While it may {{not have}} been the high point that the emotional [...] "Peter" [...] from earlier this year was, [...] "Entrada" [...] <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> excellent action-focused episode, in which the dimensional swap between Fauxlivia and Realivia came to a head. In the process, it demonstrated that Fringes writers have made a compelling world out of Over There in a relative few episodes—and it was another example of what a strong series Fringe has become since its committed fully to its clash-of-the-universes storyline...All in all, a satisfying hour and a good demonstration of how Fringe—one of the most improved shows of the past season or so—has grown into one of TV's most entertaining dramas".|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners called [...] "Grotesque" [...] his {{favorite}} third-season episode and praised David Duchovny's performance on this episode, saying [...] "Duchovny drove himself, {{and he was}} brilliant in that show." [...] Manners also said of the episode: [...] "I think 'Grotesque' is a frightening show. I {{think it is a}} disturbing show, and I think that's why—for me—it's such a good show. We pulled it off making the viewer feel uneasy. I even found it a difficult show to watch. Yeah, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> dark hour of television and I would like to do more of those." [...] In order to get a proper feel for the episode, Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder until his wife [...] "finally asked, 'Do we have to listen to that (bleeping) CD again?'" [...] Manners also theorized that the episode may have been the template for the show Millennium, which premiered on Fox the following television season.|$|E
500|$|Dismayed {{at being}} typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones {{relocated}} to Los Angeles. She remarked, [...] "There {{was all this}} fuss about who I was and wasn't dating. I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> face and a big bust and nothing else. People in the business believed what they read about me. So I decided to move away and start again." [...] She believed that the anonymity she faced in America helped her get roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the hench-woman to the villainous Drax (Treat Williams) in the superhero film The Phantom (1996), starring Billy Zane in the titular role. A reviewer for Variety considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout in her part, but the film received a negative critical reception and earned little at the box office. The CBS television miniseries Titanic (1996), however, was better received. Starring opposite Peter Gallagher and George C. Scott, she portrayed the lead role of Isabella Paradine, a young mother engaged in an extramarital affair on the [...]|$|E

Short instrumental versions of songs by The Cure, Pantera and Slayer were also played by Tomo Miličević, Shannon Leto and Tim Kelleher. The Vitamin String Quartet musicians {{who took part}} in the recording included two violinists, a violist, a cellist and a conductor. The performance of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] featured The Late Show's Gospel Choir, consisting of five men and five women dressed in red. After filming, Jared Leto described the band's excitement about being asked to record for MTV Unplugged stating, [...] "I think our generation, it was kind of a rite of passage, and if you were invited to do MTV Unplugged, it certainly <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> big deal. So many of our favorite bands did 'Unplugged' and still do it, so we were really thrilled to be asked." ...|$|E
500|$|Those reviewers who {{singled out}} the show's final segment, set after {{the return to}} Ohio, did so with compliments. Poniewozik wrote that the episode [...] "did a really fine job {{handling}} its epilogue, in which New Directions had their hopes crushed, went back to Lima—and found that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> awesome experience regardless. Brittany connected with Santana, a brief scene that reminded me how far both characters have come this season. Kurt didn't get a championship, but he has Blaine, {{and he has a}} taste of what life can be like for him after graduation." [...] Canning said it was a [...] "nice denouement, putting everyone at peace for having failed to reach the top ten at Nationals and getting their hopes high for next year." [...] Hankinson credited Brittany with some of the funniest lines in the episode as well as the most important scene—in the epilogue with Santana—and he was impressed with her lead vocals throughout. He concluded, [...] "She's the M.V.P. of the night and possibly the season." ...|$|E
500|$|James {{signed with}} the National Football League's (NFL) Detroit Lions in 1947. He was still {{eligible}} to play in college at the time, but wartime rules allowed him to skip to the professional ranks and play for the Lions, who had selected him in the 1947 NFL Draft. James broke his arm {{in the second game}} of the season, and he sat on the sidelines {{for the rest of the}} year. Detroit did not renew his contract, and the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown, picked him up. He started at right defensive halfback in 1948 opposite Tommy Colella and intercepted four passes as the Browns went 15–0 and won the All-America Football Conference championship. Brown was pleasantly surprised by his abilities on defense. [...] "Tommy always <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good man on defense at Massillon and Ohio State", he said in 1948. [...] "But his play this year has even surprised those of us who knew him in high school and college. I think we're definitely improved at defensive right half over last year." ...|$|E
