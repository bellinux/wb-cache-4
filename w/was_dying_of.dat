5|$|The book is an {{extensive}} work of investigative journalism, {{written in the}} form of an encompassing time line; the events that shaped the epidemic are presented as sequential matter-of-fact summaries. Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay, medical, and political communities. Shilts begins his discussion in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS, that of Grethe Rask, a Danish doctor working in Africa. He ends with the announcement by actor Rock Hudson in 1985 that he <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> AIDS, when international attention on the disease exploded.|$|E

5|$|The {{damage to}} Formby's lungs from the {{accident}} was exacerbated by tuberculosis, {{and he began to}} miss an increasing number of his appearances. In 1917 the Southport Palladium took court action against him for failing to fulfil a theatrical engagement as contracted, whereupon his lawyer said that Formby <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> the lung disease and was working for the short time he had left for the benefit of his large family. Formby lost the case: his plea of ill-health was compromised by his accepting an engagement elsewhere at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Bache {{was born}} in Birmingham, the second-oldest son of {{well-known}} Unitarian minister Samuel Bache, who ran a private school in conjunction with his wife, Emily Higginson. His older brother, Francis Edward Bache, was a composer and organist, while his sister, Constance Bache, was a composer, pianist and teacher who would write a joint biography of both brothers under the title Brother Musicians. He received some rudimentary musical education at his father's school, but remained a carefree, undistinguished and funloving child until he followed in Edward's footsteps. Like Edward, he studied with Birmingham City Organist James Stimpson and in August 1858, aged 16, he travelled to Germany to attend the Leipzig Conservatory. His father was supposed to accompany him to the university, but was detained at the bedside of Edward, who <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> consumption. Undeterred, he made the journey on his own, an early indication of his independence.|$|E
5|$|Brad and Tracy Stevens are {{involved}} with the American Cancer Society's Coaches Vs. Cancer. Brad says that the cause really hit home for them after Tracy's mother died of the disease in June 2004. The day before Butler's 2010 Final Four appearance, they hosted a fundraiser for the organization. Brad Stevens has also volunteered his time to the Jukes Foundation for Kids, a charity benefiting Ugandan children run by former Butler player Avery Jukes. Stevens remains in close touch with the Butler basketball family; he notably took a one-game leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith, a player on both of Butler's Final Four teams who <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> cancer; Smith died {{less than a week}} later. At the request of Andrew's widow, Sam, Brad delivered the eulogy at the memorial service on January 17, 2016.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop and test the {{validity}} of an algorithm allowing the classification of the decedents as <b>were</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of,</b> <b>died</b> <b>of</b> and <b>died</b> with BC, using administrative data, for the study of service delivery to the terminally ill. Validation was carried out through a chart review of a sample of BC decedents extracted from a tumor registry. The algorithm was then applied to the decedents of a cohort of women with BC. The three groups were compared for their distributions of age and place of death. The validation showed an excellent crude agreement (0. 96). Of the 3334 deaths, 2293 were classified as <b>were</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of,</b> 142 as <b>died</b> <b>of,</b> and 949 as died with. The comparison of age showed that women who <b>died</b> with <b>were</b> older than women who <b>were</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of.</b> These two groups differed in their distributions of place of death...|$|R

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1884, Grant complained of a sore throat but put off seeing a doctor until late October when he learned it was cancer, {{possibly}} caused by his frequent cigar smoking. Grant chose not to reveal the seriousness of his condition to his wife, who soon found out from Grant's doctor. Before being diagnosed, Grant was invited to a Methodist service for Civil War veterans in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, on August 4, 1884, receiving a standing ovation from more than ten thousand veterans and others; {{it would be his}} last public appearance. In March of the following year, the New York Times announced that Grant <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> cancer and a nationwide public concern for the former president began. Knowing of Grant and Julia's financial difficulties, Congress sought to honor him and restored him to the rank of General of the Army with full retirement pay (Grant's assumption of the Presidency in 1869 had required that he resign his commission and forfeit his pension).|$|E

25|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Drue Tartière, Dolores and Tudor Wilkinson were both heavily {{involved}} in the resistance. Tartière had also been in Vittel, and had managed to obtain a release on the false grounds that she <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> cancer. She went on to help smuggle at least 42 Allied airmen out of occupied territory. She wrote that a short wave radio had been concealed at 18 Quai d'Orléans so that the Resistance could communicate with London, and machine guns were hidden behind the fireplace {{and elsewhere in the}} apartment. Tudor Wilkinson's secretary, who had been a professor at the Sorbonne, was active in organising sabotage by railway workers.|$|E
25|$|Pamela Barnes Ewing was {{severely}} {{injured in a}} car accident in the tenth season finale in 1987, and left Bobby and Christopher due to her apparent inability to let them see her in such a physically disfigured fashion. Nevertheless, while Victoria Principal never returned again to the series, Margaret Michaels, a Principal look-alike, played the character in a season 12 episode. Having undergone plastic surgery which explained the difference in her appearance, it was revealed that Pam <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> a disease, though only she and her doctor knew. After this, Pam is never seen in Dallas again. Unable to reach a salary agreement, it was Principal's own decision to not renew her Dallas contract.|$|E

25|$|Bogarde {{suffered}} a minor stroke in November 1987, {{at a time}} when his partner, Anthony Forwood, <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> liver cancer and Parkinson's disease. In September 1996, he underwent angioplasty to unblock arteries leading to his heart and {{suffered a}} massive stroke following the operation. Bogarde was paralysed on one side of his body, which affected his speech and left him in a wheelchair. He managed, however, to complete a final volume of his autobiography, which covered the stroke and its effects as well as an edition of his collected journalism, mainly for The Daily Telegraph. He spent some time with his friend Lauren Bacall the day before he died. Bogarde died at his home in London from a heart attack on May 8, 1999, age 78. His ashes were scattered at his former estate in Grasse, Southern France.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, the Bellwood Chapel welcomed a new pastor, Renze De Groot, who split {{his time}} between Bellwood and another mission in Wheaton. He {{supported}} the continued growth of the congregation and in 1949, it was formally organized as the First Christian Reformed Church of Bellwood. By September 1949, when the congregation was formally organized with 50 members, Katherine Tessman <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> <b>of</b> cancer {{and she did not}} join the church. Within the year, the congregation began building a larger new church building on their property. In 1953, the congregation called its first full-time pastor, Bernard Byma. He would serve the church until 1960 when he left for a congregation in Lynden, Washington. It was during Byma's tenure that the Bellwood church would purchase land in Elmhurst, Illinois, preparing for a move out of Cook County along with many other Dutch churches.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to captain on 2 May 1848, Ryder became {{commanding}} officer of the frigate HMS Dauntless in the Channel Squadron, in December 1853.
