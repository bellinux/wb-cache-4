5|$|Madeleine {{was born}} in Leicester and lived with her family in Rothley, also in Leicestershire. At the request of her parents, she was made a <b>ward</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court {{statutory}} powers to act on her behalf. Police described Madeleine as blonde haired, with blue-green eyes, a small brown spot on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye. In 2009 the McCanns released age-progressed images of how she may have looked at age six, and in 2012 Scotland Yard commissioned one of her at age nine.|$|E
25|$|Morton {{was born}} in Clifton, Nottingham, the third child of Pamela Freebury, a factory worker, and Peter Morton. She has six half-siblings from her parents' relationships, {{subsequent}} to their 1979 divorce. She lived with her father until she was eight when she was made a <b>ward</b> <b>of</b> <b>court,</b> because neither of her parents could care {{for her and her}} siblings. Her father was an abusive alcoholic and her mother was involved in a violent relationship with her second husband, and as a result, she never lived with her parents again. The next nine years were spent in and out of foster care and children's homes. During that time, she attended West Bridgford Comprehensive School and joined the Central Junior Television Workshop when she was 13, soon being offered small-screen roles in Soldier Soldier and Boon.|$|E

In 1924 the special {{functions of the}} Lord Chancellor were vested in the Chief Justice of Ireland; in 1936 responsibility for minors and <b>wards</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> {{was transferred to the}} President <b>of</b> the High <b>Court</b> [...] and in 1960 discipline of solicitors was transferred to the President <b>of</b> the High <b>Court.</b>|$|R

500|$|The Marquess, who {{had been}} jailed for jewel theft in his youth, was harsh towards his eldest son, {{according}} to friends of the latter. He did not show John any clear love or affection, and was emotionally distant {{to the extent that}} John was required to wear long white gloves during dinner. [...] "He treated his son and heir with indifference and contempt," [...] said Anthony Haden-Guest. [...] Jamie Spencer-Churchill, a schoolfriend, summed up the relationship: [...] "Victor created the monster that John became." [...] John was a <b>ward</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> for some time after his mother left Ickworth.|$|E
500|$|At age 10 Johannes was {{declared}} a <b>ward</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> {{and sent to}} the school institution Toftes gave on the island Helgøya in the lake Mjøsa. While at the strict institution Johannes received parcels from home, with yellow cheese. The cheese was needed because of the meagre rations given the boys at Toftes gave. The parcels with yellow cheese led to Johannes being given the nickname [...] "Gulosten" [...] (...) by the other boys at the institution, a name that stuck with him {{for the rest of his}} life. After four years on Helgøya he was transferred to Bastøy school home for maladjusted boys, an equally harsh institution. When 29boys rebelled at Bastøy in 1915, police officers and the Norwegian Armed Forces were employed to crush the riot, and the leaders taken away in handcuffs. Physical punishment was common at Bastøy, including being locked away in a dark cellar, a punishment Johannes had to endure. When Johannes was 15 his mother died, and he was not informed until several days after her funeral. This led to him making suicide threats and going amok at the warden's office, for which he was punished with a stay in the dark cell.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was born}} in Cheltenham, where his father James Agg-Gardner, Senior (1804–58) had {{purchased}} the lordship of the manor in 1843. After his father's death, James Junior was brought up as a <b>ward</b> <b>of</b> <b>court,</b> and educated at Harrow School and then privately. He matriculated to Trinity College, Cambridge, but instead of starting his studies he contested the 1868 general election in Cheltenham, but failed to win the seat. He then studied law, and in 1873 he was called to {{the bar at the}} Middle Temple. [...] However, he never practised law, concentrating instead on his business interests and his political career. [...] He was a magistrate from 1875.|$|E

After a scuffle with Mercer, the Chancellor's {{faithful}} clerk, he is granted an interview with the great man. Horace says that he was a foundling who was made <b>ward</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Court.</b> As an orphan, he expects the Chancellor to behave as the father of all orphans who are <b>wards</b> <b>of</b> <b>court.</b> He has a duty to find Horace a job and also to find him a suitable wife, someone old enough to mother him.

The couple's three {{surviving}} children, aged between six and eleven, became <b>wards</b> <b>of</b> <b>court,</b> {{and lived}} with Lord Crewe at Crewe Hall. Hungerford Crewe was eccentric as a child, and {{is said to have}} seen little of his father. A family history written by Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe, states that John Crewe regarded his only son with [...] "nothing but contempt".|$|R
2500|$|Summoned by the Fairy Queen ("Iolanthe! From thy dark exile {{thou art}} summoned"), Iolanthe {{rises from the}} frog-infested stream that has been her home in exile. The Queen, unable to bear {{punishing}} her any longer, pardons Iolanthe, who is warmly greeted by the other fairies. Iolanthe tells her sisters {{that she has a}} son, Strephon, noting that he's a fairy down to the waist, but his legs are mortal. The fairies laugh that Iolanthe appears too young to have a grown son, as {{one of the advantages of}} a fairy's immortality is that they never grow old. Strephon, a handsome Arcadian shepherd, arrives and meets his aunts ("Good-morrow, good mother"). He tells Iolanthe of his love for the Lord Chancellor's <b>ward</b> <b>of</b> <b>court,</b> the beautiful Phyllis, who does not know of Strephon's mixed origin. Strephon is despondent, however, as the Lord Chancellor has forbidden them to marry, partly because he feels that a shepherd is unsuitable for Phyllis, but partly because the Lord Chancellor wishes to marry Phyllis himself. In fact, so do half the members of Britain's House of Lords. The Fairy Queen promises her assistance ("Fare thee well, attractive stranger"). Soon Phyllis arrives, and she and Strephon share a moment of tenderness as they plan their future and possible elopement ("Good-morrow, good lover"; [...] "None shall part us from each other").|$|E

50|$|In common law, the father, {{rather than}} the mother, was {{entitled}} to the custody of a legitimate child up {{to the age of}} 16, and could only forfeit such right by misconduct. But the Court of Chancery, wherever there was trust property and the infant could be made a <b>ward</b> <b>of</b> <b>court,</b> took a less rigid view of the paternal rights and looked more to the interest of the child, and consequently in some cases to the extension of the mother's rights in common law.|$|E

Mr. McKenna had been transferred from St. Michael's House to the nursing home despite the objections of his family - he was a <b>ward</b> <b>of</b> <b>court.</b> He needed round-the-clock nursing care but that was difficult to manage in the nursing home.
