As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and created fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, [...] "The craziness was this: {{they were not the}} regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount... maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner...when you're doing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> them—that makes a world of difference". During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he [...] "rocketed one of them bottles off my foot and that motherfucker shot straight up and out like a guided Patriot missile, right towards the disco ball high above the crowd...The bottle nailed the disco ball, and... came falling down... on top of some English kid's head.... We must've knocked fifteen or twenty people flat-out cold on that tour...Shaggy and I both had black eyes and several injuries and bruises ourselves from them things hittin' us".|$|E

500|$|A reunion {{episode was}} speculated after the fifth series ended; in the 2003 {{documentary}} Cold Feet: The Final Call, executive producer Andy Harries stated, [...] "By killing a character, you are truly saying 'this series is over' … until, of course, in 10 years time when money {{is running a}} bit short for all of us, we bring it back. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Rachel, I don't know yet—but I have got a few theories." [...] In an interview published in October 2003, Harries told The Daily Telegraph that ITV would [...] "probably" [...] bring back Cold Feet ten years after it ended, and said, [...] "There's a tacit understanding with the actors that we will re-visit it again at the appropriate time." [...] In 2007, a tabloid newspaper quoted an ITV [...] "insider" [...] as saying that a reunion episode would be broadcast to mark ten years since the pilot aired. The report {{turned out to be}} a fabrication. At the 2010 Edinburgh International Television Festival, Harries stated that discussions about the series' return were [...] "ongoing", but highlighted a number of factors that would prevent a reunion in the near future. The following day, Harries told Kate Silverton that he had held discussions with Mike Bullen about the series returning, but that it would not be back on television screens in 2011 or 2012.|$|E
