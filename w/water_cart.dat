50|$|Another {{suggested}} {{explanation is}} that the rumbling of an approaching <b>water</b> <b>cart</b> sounded like the firing of artillery, thus causing a false alarm. It is also used to refer to a foolish mistake, although the etymology of that is uncertain.|$|E
50|$|The <b>water</b> <b>cart</b> was {{a type of}} {{high-capacity}} tender used by the London and South Western Railway in England. Unlike {{the usual}} British six-wheel tender, it was a double-bogie design with inside bearings. This gave it a distinctive appearance because the wheels were very obvious.|$|E
5000|$|John Furphy (17 June 1842 - 23 September 1920) was a blacksmith, {{best known}} for his Furphy <b>Water</b> <b>Carts</b> that were an {{important}} part of Australia's history. The Furphy <b>Water</b> <b>Carts</b> appeared throughout the country and were used by the army in World War I, e.g. at Gallipoli. The Australian slang term [...] "furphy" [...] for an unbelievable story or rumour is believed to derive from the use of the <b>water</b> <b>carts</b> as a gathering place for soldiers to swap gossip.|$|R
50|$|By the 1820s the Tank Stream, Sydney's {{original}} water supply, {{had become}} {{little more than}} an open sewer, and the growing colony had become reliant on wells or <b>water</b> <b>carted</b> from the Lachlan Swamps (now Centennial Park).|$|R

5000|$|The {{first report}} to surface about this {{incident}} {{was in the}} East African Standard. The front-page article reported that ten died at the Hola detention camp. The paper quoted the [...] "official statement" [...] from the colonial authorities: [...] "The men were {{in a group of}} about 100 who were working on digging furrows. The deaths occurred after they had drunk water from a <b>water</b> <b>cart</b> which was used by all members of the working party and the guards." ...|$|E
50|$|Eyewitnesses were interviewed. Their {{testimony}} {{indicated that}} the killer was a local resident, Mikhail Krasnov, who after the restoration of Soviet power had gone to Siberia, where he lived on forged documents {{under the name of}} Žilcov. In 1927 he had been arrested for the murder of Banykin and was imprisoned and then exiled. According to eyewitnesses, Banykin's corpse was abused by a merchant, Shishkin, driving a <b>water</b> <b>cart</b> twice over the body and by having its eyes poked out with a cane.|$|E
5000|$|Sapper number 24 was {{the last}} Aveling and Porter engine {{to be called a}} steam sapper. It was used by the newly formed Balloon Corps in 1885. The {{locomotive}} and another one ordered shortly afterwards were used to haul [...] "balloon trains". Each train consisted of five wagons carrying gas cylinders, a <b>water</b> <b>cart,</b> and a wagon for the balloon, basket and winch. Balloons were normally employed as elevated observation platforms and as such were tethered though observers were trained in how to handle free flight in case the balloon broke away.|$|E

5000|$|Furphy's {{popularity}} {{may have}} influenced the usage of the Australian slang word [...] "furphy", meaning a [...] "tall story". However, scholars consider {{it more likely that}} the word originated with <b>water</b> <b>carts,</b> produced in large numbers by J. Furphy & Sons, a company owned by Furphy's brother John.|$|R
50|$|The town dam {{was built}} in 1885 by Mr Hudson. For some years this dam {{was the source of}} water for the town and <b>water</b> <b>carted</b> into town in casks. Residents paid 2/6 per cask {{although}} double this amount was not uncommon. Later the dam was also used as the town's swimming pool.|$|R
50|$|Mikeli is a Savoyard {{water carrier}} living in Paris. Mikeli's son, Antonio, tells how {{as a child}} his life was saved by an unknown Frenchman. He is {{interrupted}} when Count Armand, {{a member of the}} French parliament, enters with his wife, Constance, begging Mikeli to save him from Cardinal Mazarin's soldiers. Mikeli willingly offers his assistance. He tells Armand that Antonio is due to be married the next day to Angelina, who lives in Gonesse. He plans to smuggle Armand and Constance out of the city, which is ringed by Mazarin's men, by disguising Constance as Antonio's sister, Marcelina, and hiding Armand in his own <b>water</b> <b>cart.</b> Antonio enters and, to his delight, recognises Armand as the Frenchman who saved him as a child.|$|E
50|$|Traction {{engines in}} the Victorian period {{represented}} an expensive capital {{investment in the}} latest agricultural technology of the period. Many were owned by contractors who would move them from farm to farm for hire, as required. Typical work included threshing after harvest time. A rake of engine, threshing machine, a living van and often a <b>water</b> <b>cart</b> would travel from farm to farm as needed, stopping at each for a few days. The first engines, from around 1840, were portable engines: movable steam engines that were horse-drawn to move them, unlit, between farms. From the 1860s the locomotive traction engine appeared, now capable of moving under its own power. The engine's crew would include a driver, a steersman, and often a boy. Other agricultural labourers carrying out the threshing work would already be resident on the farm. Threshing an average-sized farm of 50 acres would take about two weeks, so the capital cost of the investment in an engine and 'drum' encouraged farms to purchase such a rig as a jointly shared investment, or for others to establish themselves as itinerant contractors. Threshing would continue after harvest and into the winter, with the corn stacked in ricks until then. The first locomotive threshing teams were local and did not require living vans, the driver walking or cycling from home up to ten miles. Use of vans did not become widespread for threshing until the 1880s, some years after they were popular for ploughing.|$|E

With original photographs by Richard Barry, the set shows the Japanese army in the Port Arthur (now Lüshun) area, a port occupied by the Russians and beseiged by the Japanese during the war. Views include soldiers transporting a mortar shell; “Osaka Babies” (Japanese guns); a solider getting a haircut; soldiers in their camp; a boiled <b>water</b> <b>cart,</b> which transported sterile drinking water for soldiers; Japanese officers, including General Oshima, Major Yamaguchi, and Major Oda; also, photographer, Richard Barry and war artist Frederic Villiers...|$|E
5000|$|A furphy is Australian {{slang for}} an {{erroneous}} or improbable {{story that is}} claimed to be factual. Furphies are supposedly 'heard' from reputable sources, sometimes secondhand or thirdhand, and widely believed until discounted. The word is said to derive from <b>water</b> <b>carts</b> designed and made by a company established by John Furphy: J. Furphy & Sons of Shepparton, Victoria. The steel and cast iron tanks were first made in the 1880s and were used on farms and by stock agents. Many Furphy <b>water</b> <b>carts</b> were used to take water to Australian Army personnel during World War I in Australia, Europe and the Middle East. The carts, with [...] "J. Furphy & Sons" [...] written on their tanks, became popular as gathering places where soldiers could exchange gossip, rumours and fanciful tales — much like today's water cooler discussion.|$|R

50|$|Construction of the Gladstone Park Reservoir was {{announced}} in 1912 causing public outcry. The water board reassured residents that the park and bandstand would be restored to its former status once the reservoir was complete. Before construction of the reservoir residents obtained their water supply from backyard wells or <b>water</b> <b>carts.</b> Completed in 1917 the reservoir is still intact and the water is now used for reserve supply only.|$|R
40|$|In {{this picture}} {{we see a}} number of Japanese {{soldiers}} {{around one of the}} drinking water carts captured from the Russians. The Russians believed Port Arthur to be impregnable. They did not believe that any power on earth could ever oust them from the peninsula which they had leased from China, and they had spent a vast amount of treasure and labor in creating a first-class modern port at Dalny. When the Japanese drove them behind the forts of Port Arthur, the Russians found it impossible to remove from Dalny all their supplies or all their invaluable implements, so that the Japanese found here a great array of things that they could utilize to good advantage. Among these were the Russian drinking water carts, which were at once taken possession of by the Japanese commissary department.

50|$|The River Cart {{itself is}} very short, being formed from the {{confluence}} of the Black <b>Cart</b> <b>Water</b> (from the west) and the White <b>Cart</b> <b>Water</b> (from the south east) and is only 0.75 mile (1 km) long. The River Cart and its tributary the White <b>Cart</b> <b>Water</b> were navigable as far as the Seedhill Craigs at Paisley; and, as with the River Clyde, various improvements were made to this river navigation.|$|R
50|$|Both the Black <b>Cart</b> <b>Water</b> and the White <b>Cart</b> <b>Water</b> {{provided}} {{power to}} drive mills. The best preserved on the White Cart is Dripps Mill in Waterfoot, which still has two functioning 19th century waterwheels.|$|R
500|$|A typhoid {{outbreak}} {{in the early}} 20th Century was blamed on the water supplied from these tanks. Subsequent to this the pumps were shut down and the town again relied on rainwater tanks, wells and <b>water</b> <b>carted</b> from the river. [...] The Westbury council's [...] "Carrick Water Supply" [...] was not self-funding and was abandoned in 1928. The mill's dam was washed away in the 1929 floods {{and has not been}} rebuilt, losing the town its water storage.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the modern}} Australian Stock Horse {{differs from the}} Waler horse {{in that it is}} not as big. The horses shipped abroad to fight in war and kept at home to be bred on as Walers were the larger animals, as they were {{required}} to carry a rider with the considerable extra weight of weapons and a full pack. Some of the heaviest animals were also required pull <b>water</b> <b>carts</b> and carriages. However, the characteristics of toughness and endurance remain with the Australian Stock Horse of today.|$|R
5000|$|Generally {{consisting}} of low moorland, {{there are a}} number of higher areas in the county such as the Renfrewshire Heights. The land slopes downwards to the side of the River Clyde. The main draining rivers of the area are the River Cart (formed by the White <b>Cart</b> <b>Water</b> and Black <b>Cart</b> <b>Water)</b> and the River Gryffe, all of which eventually flow into the River Clyde. The upper scenery of the county was described in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica as [...] "somewhat wild and bleak" [...] though descending into pastureland around the rivers.|$|R
5000|$|Brisbane's {{water supply}} during the convict era {{came from a}} {{reservoir}} in present-day Tank Street in the Brisbane central business district. There was no pipe network; the water was delivered by <b>water</b> <b>carts</b> to households who stored their water in barrels. The water was described as having [...] "a pea-soup colour and consistency" [...] which required the householders to add wood ashes or alum to their water barrels to precipitate the yellow sediments. On establishment of the Brisbane Municipal Council in 1859, one of their first tasks was to plan a better water supply for the growing town.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally in {{the parish}} of Renfrew (although not within its burgh boundary), Abbotsinch is bordered by the Black <b>Cart</b> <b>Water</b> {{to the north and}} west, and the White <b>Cart</b> <b>Water</b> to the east. Its {{southern}} edge was delineated by the burgh boundary of Paisley, although after the 1975 local government reorganisation in Scotland these demarcations became unofficial.|$|R
50|$|The {{tank was}} a {{reliable}} {{source of water}} for the early settlers, and saw much use in the early days. <b>Water</b> <b>carting</b> was a constant job, and as horses were used to pull water tanks to the site, a galvanised iron water trough was left at the site to water the horses after their long trek up the hill. The use of the tank began to decline in 1930 when piped water from the Todd Reservoir finally reached the southern area of the hundred, and another pipeline was laid from Verran heading southwest in 1964, servicing the eastern and central area of the hundred.|$|R

50|$|Paisley Abbey has {{a medieval}} drain, {{belonging}} to the monastery, which was rediscovered in the 1990s; and excavated by archaeologists. The abbey/monastery drain linked with the White <b>Cart</b> <b>Water</b> both upstream and downstream of the abbey, near to where the Town Hall now stands. The White <b>Cart</b> <b>Water</b> provided both drinking water for the monastery and was used to flush away kitchen waste and the latrines.|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} days of Adelaide, the Torrens was used for bathing, stock watering, rubbish disposal, water supply and as a de facto sewer and {{drainage}} sump. This led to a range of health issues until finally, in 1839, when a dysentery outbreak killed five children in one day, Governor Gawler forbid bathing, clothes washing and the disposal of animal carcases in the Torrens within [...] of town. The quality of the river's water was not helped by water supply methods. Carters used to drive <b>water</b> <b>carts</b> into the Torrens to refill. To prevent this the State Government built a facility with steam powered pumps and water storage in 1852, from which the carters then filled.|$|R
50|$|The Black <b>Cart</b> <b>Water</b> {{originates}} at Castle Semple Loch in Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire. From there, {{it flows}} northeast to Johnstone, through Linwood and then under the M8 motorway at Blackstoun, {{where it is}} joined by the River Gryfe. The river then flows parallel with the main runway of Glasgow International Airport; passing under the A8 at Renfrew {{by means of a}} stone bridge, where it joins the White <b>Cart</b> <b>Water.</b>|$|R
