2500|$|In 1927, {{after his}} time in Alaska, Murie {{was hired by the}} National Elk Commission to {{determine}} the cause of the elk <b>winterkill</b> problem in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. As the chief field biologist, Murie concluded that human development was causing overcrowding in the elk’s winter range. [...] Murie {{was one of the first}} to discover that these elk historically resided in the mountains and not solely in the plains thus contributing to overcrowding. [...] Although a National Elk Refuge existed in this region consisting of 4,500 acres, this refuge had some unexpected consequences. Due to supplemental feeding and a rougher browse, elk were developing bacterial lesions in their throat and mouth called necrotic stomatitis or calf diphtheria. [...] The squirrel-tail grass seeds found on the refuge contributed to the irritation of these lesions and the close proximity of elk allowed for the bacteria to spread easily. [...] Through these observations, Murie determined that protecting the elk’s habitat initially, would have been more beneficial than attempting to mitigate the problem later.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{being very}} shallow, Lake Ocheda is {{well-stocked}} with several varieties of fish. Black Bullheads and Yellow Bullheads are abundant. Black Crappies and White crappies {{are also very}} common, as are orangspotted sunfish and yellow perch. The lake is stocked yearly with northern pike and yellow perch because these species can tolerate low oxygen-levels better than other game species. Ocheda Lake is a very shallow lake and it often experiences low oxygen during the winter. Complete <b>winterkills</b> of northern pike and yellow perch have never been documented. The northern pike population has done quite well {{for the last six}} years. Northern pike numbers have remained near average for lakes similar to Ocheda Lake. Northern pike lengths ranged from 16.5 to 30.0 inches.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Lakeland County is {{experiencing}} increasing developmental pressures {{arising from the}} oil and gas boom at nearby Fort McMurray. There is increased industrial traffic passing through the county, and 600 new residential lots are proposed in 2005, almost double from 5 years ago. Deteriorating surface water quality has been a concern in the area due to an increase in development and agriculture, while excessive fish harvesting and <b>winterkills</b> have impacted commercial and recreational fisheries. Today, walleye and pike populations in the lake remain collapsed and restocking efforts have not been successful. Due to the lack of studies done on the watershed, the county is leading a multidisciplinary research study which includes a baseline water quality study, riparian health assessments, land use mapping and ground-truthing and projects with the local health authority. This research has been summarized in a comprehensive state of the watershed report, which will be used to complete a watershed management plan for the Lac la Biche watershed. Recommendations from the state of the watershed report and watershed management plan will also be incorporated into municipal planning documents and recommend changes to the Municipal Government Act itself...|$|R

40|$|The {{population}} size structure, length at age and condition of 140 largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, were studied for Lake Ashbaugh, Arkansas. Scales and otoliths {{were used for}} age and length at age determination of individual bass. Length at age was determined by back-calculation and relative weight {{was used to measure}} condition. The Lake Ashbaugh population is dominated by young, slow growing bass in poor condition. Ninety-one percent of the largemouth bass in Lake Ashbaugh were less than four years of age, with age 3 + bass serving as the dominant year class. Proportional and relative stock density values were 25 and 3 %, respectively, significantly less than those of other surveyed Arkansas reservoirs. The mean relative weight for this population was 84, significantly less than that projected for healthy populations. Mean back-calculated lengths for largemouth bass ages I through age III were 141 mm, 190 mm, and 257 mm, respectively. Mean lengths at each age were significantly less than those obtained from a 1987 study of Lake Ashbaugh bass and for bass in other Arkansas reservoirs. Several factors {{may have contributed to the}} steady decline in the bass population of Lake Ashbaugh. <b>Winterkills</b> occurred in 1989 - 1991, which seemed to affect mostly mature largemouth bass. A 380 mm length limit imposed in 1987 may have resulted in a stockpiling of bass less than 380 mm, increasing the competition for available prey for those size classes. These hypotheses are supported by consistent yearly declines over the past five years in the available prey/predator ratios and relative weights, particularly for the size classes between 226 mm- 350 mm...|$|R

Shaw Lake was likely named after J. P. Shaw, a commercial fisherman from the area active in the 1930s. The lake has the characteristics of a large slough, with marshy shores and two distinct basins. Shaw Lake appears to have once been commercially fished, although is now subject to frequent <b>winterkill.</b>|$|E
50|$|Late Pleistocene fossils from Ballybetagh bog, near Dublin, Ireland, {{indicate}} that males segregated from females during winters.

40|$|Since {{weather is}} always variable, {{there are times}} when it causes {{significant}} problems in alfalfa production. Alfalfa is an expensive crop to establish and manage, but it is a very important forage crop that provides a good source of protein as well as necessary effective fiber, particularly for dairy cows.

This article discusses the causes of alfalfa <b>winterkill,</b> ways of reducing the risk of alfalfa <b>winterkill</b> and options of potential crops to grow if alfalfa is winterkilled. What Causes <b>Winterkill</b> of Alfalfa? 1 Ice Encasement. One of the most important factors affecting <b>winterkill</b> of alfalfa is ice encasement.

40|$|Food-web {{effects of}} <b>winterkill</b> are {{difficult}} to predict as the enhanced mortality of planktivorous fish may be counterbalanced by an even higher mortality of piscivores. We hypothesised that a <b>winterkill</b> in a clear and a turbid shallow lake would equalise their fish community composition, but seasonal plankton successions would differ between lakes. After a partial <b>winterkill,</b> we observed a reduction of fish biomass by 16 and 43 % in a clear-water and a turbid small temperate lake, respectively. Fish biomass and piscivore shares (5 % of fish biomass) were similar in both lakes after this <b>winterkill,</b> but young-of-the-year (YOY) abundances {{were higher in the}} turbid lake. Top-down control by crustaceans was only partly responsible for low phytoplankton biomass at the end of May following the <b>winterkill</b> in both lakes. Summer phytoplankton biomass remained low in the clear-water lake despite high abundances of YOY fish (mainly roach). In contrast, the crustacean biomass of the turbid lake was reduced in summer by a high YOY abundance (sunbleak and roach), leading to a strong increase in phytoplankton biomass. The YOY abundance of fish in shallow eutrophic lakes may thus be more important for their summer phytoplankton development after <b>winterkill</b> than the relative abundance of piscivores...|$|E

40|$|Winter wheat stand loss due to <b>winterkill</b> can be {{a serious}} problem for Missouri wheat growers. • Environmental {{conditions}} delaying crop establishment in the fall, in conjunction with abnormally cold winter temperatures, standing ice on winter wheat fields, or poor snow cover may increase winter wheat stand loss. • A visual reduction in winter wheat stand in the spring often leads to questions from growers concerning whether to keep the wheat crop or to establish another crop such as corn, soybeans, or grain sorghum. • An elevated commodity price coupled {{with an increase in}} base funding in the current farm bill has encouraged Missouri growers to increase winter wheat acreage in the 2002 to 2003 growing season (Estimated> 1, 000, 000 acres of winter wheat was planted).

40|$|Most <b>winterkill</b> that growers {{experienced}} in 2008 {{was related to}} prolonged ice sheets that limited plant respiration and ultimately lead to plant death. In 2009, Wisconsin wheat growers are again dealing with winterkill; however the culprit this year appears to be death by exposure (lack of snow cover). As you drive around the countryside and survey the wheat crop, distinct patterns begin to emerge. In general the wheat that is nearest the tree lines and held the snow the longest {{appears to be in}} the best shape, whereas those areas that were most exposed to cold, driving winds appear to be in the toughest condition. We also see a dramatic impact of planting date (early wheat looks better than late planted) and variety on <b>winterkill</b> (Image 1). Many growers have been slow to pull the trigger on nitrogen applications due to the slow green-up we have experienced, however the warm weather forecast for this weekend should make <b>winterkill</b> decisions and N recommendations much easier as we progress into next week. As you scout, remember brown, dried leaves evident in some fields do not necessarily indicate winter injury, and green leaves are not a sure sign that the crop has survived either. (Image 2) The only way to properly assess the condition of individual plants is to examine the crown for the development of new white roots. If the crown appears white and healthy, and new roots are developing, the plant is probably in good condition. (cont. page 25) Image 1. Planting date and variety impact on <b>winterkill...</b>|$|E
40|$|Why certain {{species of}} fish become {{invasive}} is poorly understood and a key obstacle to restoring many of the world’s ecosystems. In this study we tested whether variation in biotic resistance exerted by native predators might explain the reproductive success of the common carp, a large and fecund invasive species that typically spawns in outlying and unstable shallow habitat. An initial three-year study of the relative abundance of youngof- year (YOY) carp in interconnected lakes in the Upper Mississippi River Basin discovered that YOY carp are only found in shallow waters that experience winter hypoxia (<b>winterkill)</b> and have low densities of the native egg-predators that otherwise dominate these locales. A follow-up experiment tested if native fish predation on carp eggs could explain this distribution. It found that while carp eggs survived in <b>winterkill</b> lakes, they only survived in non-winterkill lakes when protected by a mesh that excluded fish. Large numbers of carp eggs {{were found in the}} stomachs of native fish inhabiting lakes that did not <b>winterkill.</b> We conclude that common carp, and likely many other highly mobile and fecund invasive fish, have evolved life histories to avoid egg predators and can become invasive when they are absent...|$|E
