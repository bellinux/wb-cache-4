Our data suggest that HSP 70 translocates from cytoplasm to extracellular environment after an increase in radiation dose and HMGB 1 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and subsequently is released into the extracellular space, confirming a role of these proteins as signals released after radiation-induced damage in glioblastoma cells. <b>We</b> also <b>could</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> TMZ had limited effectiveness in activating HMGB 1 and HSP 70 signalling and, instead, an adjuvant effect was observed in some combined treatments, depending on schedule, cell line, and timing.

40|$|Abstract. Current {{practices}} for developing secure systems are still closer to art than to an engineering discipline. Security is still treated too frequently as an add-on {{and is therefore}} not integrated into IT systems development practices and tools. Experienced security artisans {{continue to be the}} key for achieving acceptable levels of security in IT systems. In this situation <b>we</b> <b>could</b> safely <b>state</b> <b>that</b> security engineering is a hype. In fact, the term security engineering has been used to denote partial approaches that cover only small parts of the processes that are required {{in order to create a}} secure system, like modelling, verification, programming, etc. Moreover, one finds in the literature that the main books about security engineering describe threat-based engineering approaches. The main drawbacks of these approaches is that they fail to provide a reasonable level of support for systematic engineering since the identification, characterization and specification of the requirements (frequently based on avoiding threats) as well as the selection of appropriate mechanisms and countermeasures depends on the experience of the engineers. Consequently, these approaches are inherently opposed to what an engineering discipline should be and represent only minor improvements over the security art. This paper discusses this vision and advocates a change of paradigm based on rigour and precision. In particular, the paper presents an approach based on the precise and formal specification of both security requirements and security solutions as the basis for the engineering of secure systems and discusses the role of contracts in security engineering...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to survey and {{evaluate}} if the individual contrast sensitivity and preferences for horizontal and vertical lighting level correspond to the values that standard SS-EN 12464 - 1 recommends for the workplace- and surrounding light levels. This study examines if lighting should be adapted after the individuals’ need or if a general value can be found that will cover every individuals’ need for a workplace and surrounding light level. This study also examines if parameters like sex, age and/or glasses/lenses have an effect on the amount of lighting that the test subjects need. Lastly we compared the values concerning the relationship between workplace- and surrounding light levels with standard SS-EN 12464 - 1 ’s recommendations. The study is carried out with an experimental design that surveys 220 test subjects who were chosen by a selection of convenience. The test subjects did perform a test where they estimated their individual need for lighting in office environments regarding lighting for workplace and its surroundings. Every test subject carried out the test where they repeated the same attempt three times, to establish if the individual lighting need oscillated or if it was constant, whereupon the results were analyzed, compiled and compared to standard SS-EN 12464 - 1. The results show that the minim- and maxim value for the test subjects is between 70 – 4300 lux. The result varies with different parameters such as sex, age and glasses/lenses. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> also <b>state</b> <b>that</b> the relationship between workplace- and surrounding light levels is slightly higher than what standard SS-EN 12464 - 1 recommends, which should be taken into consideration when planning future lighting constructions.

The values that the test subjects indicated differ from the values that standard SS-EN 12464 - 1 recommends. Since there is a huge spread of the experienced need for lighting between individuals and age groups, we draw the conclusion that general values of measure can’t be applied as a standard on neither workplace- nor surrounding light levels. To fulfill the needs that users have, the lighting construction should be adapted for the individual and give a lighting flood that will fill the individual needs for workplace lighting...|$|R

A multidisciplinary approach {{was used to determine}} the extent to which human picornaviruses circulate in the general population, and if and to which extent people are exposed to which human picornaviruses in surface waters, closing their aquatic cycle. This thesis offered new insights in the prevalence of several human picornaviruses in the Dutch environment indicating circulation in the sampled human population by environmental surveillance. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the environmental surveillance was estimated, and the usefulness, of culture and PCR data, with respect to water treatment processes and exposure probabilities, was evaluated. The omniprevalence of the diverse family of human picornaviruses (enteroviruses, parechoviruses, hepatitis A viruses, Aichi viruses, Saffold viruses and cosaviruses) in sewage and surface water was demonstrated, as well as virus evolution dynamics for several of the detected picornaviruses. Exposure to such waters e. g. through water recreation of children may lead to a public health risk although risk factors could not be identified.

40|$|Abstract for the Final Technical Report, DOE Grant DE-FG 02 - 98 ER 54496 An X-pinch plasma is {{produced}} by driving a high current (100 - 500 kiloamperes) through two or more fine wires that cross and touch at a point, forming an X {{in the case of}} two wires. The wires explode because of the high current, and then the resulting plasma is imploded radially inward by the magnetic field from the current. When the imploding material briefly stagnates at very small radius and high density, an intense burst of x-rays {{is produced}} and the plasma disassembles as rapidly as it imploded. When this project began, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> confidently <b>state</b> <b>that</b> at its minimum radius, X pinch plasmas made from such materials as titanium and molybdenum might be as hot as 10, 000, 000 K and had densities almost as high as the solid wire density, but their X-ray pulse durations were below one billionth of a second. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> also say that the X pinch was useful for point-projection imaging of rapidly changing objects, such as exploding wires, with high resolution, indicative of a very small X-ray source spot size. We can now confidently say that X-pinch plasma temperatures at the moment of the X-ray burst are 10 - 25 million K in titanium, molybdenum and several other wire X-pinches based upon the spectrum of emitted X-rays in the radiation burst. By the same means, {{as well as from the}} penetration of X-rays through the dense plasma, we know that ion densities are close to or higher than one-tenth of the density of the original (solid) wire material in molybdenum and a few other X-pinch plasmas. Furthermore, using the diffraction of X-rays radiated by the X-pinch when it reaches minimum radius, we have determined that the x-ray source size is about 1 thousandth of a millimeter for such wire materials as molybdenum and niobium, while it is 2 - 10 times larger for tungsten, titanium and aluminum wires. Finally, using a very high speed X-ray imaging “streak camera,” we have determined that X pinch X-ray pulses can be as short as 30 trillionths of a second. Additional experiments have demonstrated that a spherical shell of plasma expands away from the cross point region after the x-ray burst. It reaches millimeter scale in a few billionths of a second, leaving a small (less than 0. 1 millimeter) gap in the middle that enables energetic electrons to be accelerated to 10 or a few 10 ’s of kilovolts of energy. In addition to gaining an understanding of the physics of the X pinch plasmas, we have had to develop several new X-ray diagnostic devices in order to obtain and verify the above results. On the non-technical side, 4 students have completed Ph. D. s working under the auspices of this project, including one woman, and another woman has begun her Ph. D. research under this project. In addition, several undergraduate students have worked with us on the X-pinch experiments, including one who is now a graduate student in plasma physics at Princeton University...|$|R
