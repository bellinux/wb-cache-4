25|$|In {{a famous}} example of {{hypothesis}} testing, {{known as the}} Lady tasting tea, Dr. Muriel Bristol, a female colleague of Fisher claimed {{to be able to}} tell whether the tea or the milk was added first to a cup. Fisher proposed to give her eight cups, four of each variety, in random order. One could then ask what the probability <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> getting the number she got correct, but just by chance. The null hypothesis was that the Lady had no such ability. The test statistic was a simple count of the number of successes in selecting the 4 cups. The critical region was the single case of 4 successes of 4 possible based on a conventional probability criterion (<nbsp&5%; 1 of 70 ≈nbsp&1.4%). Fisher asserted that no alternative hypothesis was (ever) required. The lady correctly identified every cup, which would be considered a statistically significant result.|$|E

25|$|Lawson was as {{known for}} her off stage romances as she <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> onstage performances. In 1933 her {{engagement}} to Maurice Henry van Raalte, heir to a cigar importing fortune, ended tragically with her fiancé's sudden death. In May 1934 Lawson announced she was to marry a Mr H Glendenning, a cameraman {{on the set of}} Money in the Air, a film that Lawson had a part in and that was eventually distributed as Radio Pirates. But only a few months later in August 1934 Lawson caused a national sensation when it was announced that she was engaged to Fred Perry, the world's premier tennis player and winner of multiple Grand Slam tournaments. The couple first met when Perry visited the London studies of the film Falling in Love, in which Lawson played the role of Ann Brent. Perry later escorted Lawson to an exhibition match at Highbury Fields and proposed marriage before he departed to New York City to defend his US Open title. The couple's engagement became a news sensation, which took a toll on their relationship. When Perry turned down on offer of $50,000 to turn pro, he reportedly said it was because he would face tax issues and jeopardise his relationship with Lawson. In April 1935, while Perry was in the United States, the engagement was called off. Lawson reportedly stated that she broke off the engagement because publicity killed their romance, she had tired of the ridiculous rumours that had circulated in the media and she was opposed to Perry's plans to live permanently in America.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the film}} {{develops}} on these themes of oppression, both {{the narrator and}} Pintilie {{look back on the}} age of Greater Romania with a dose of nostalgia. Simon writes: [...] "What was the most horrible summer {{in the life of a}} young mother, driving her to drink and wasting away, <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> small son the most unforgettably lovely season of his life." [...] Variety argues: [...] "The frantic crescendo of the final sequence has an eerie resonance, as the narrator's final remarks reframe all that has gone before in a different, deeply ironic light." [...] Discussing this aspect, Pintilie stated: [...] "Maybe I'm even a bit perverse to begin the film in a light and playful way: people fall into the trap of thinking it's not a serious film." ...|$|E

500|$|Outhwaite {{had long}} {{been a fan of}} Inside No. 9 and the work of Pemberton and Shearsmith, the former of whom she had worked with in an episode of Hotel Babylon. She was {{particularly}} pleased to appear alongside Hadland, as the pair are old friends, and characterised her duet with Hadland as her favourite scene. Outhwaite, like some of the other performers, expressed her enjoyment of the fancy dress aspect of the episode, and she loved her [...] "selfish, sad and manipulative" [...] character, Connie. The filming process <b>was,</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> extremely enjoyable and memorable. Pemberton said that Hadland and Outhwaite [...] "brought a bubbly energy which injected into the hysteria of that room", naming the episode's production his favourite filming experience from the series. Shearsmith pointed to the scene in which [...] "a hen party invades the karaoke room and they start singing. The music was pumped up and we had a mini party, with mad dancing – that was a memorable scene to film." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} the recurring villain Ricardio, played by George Takei, a character that Tom Kenny later called [...] "the valentine from Hell". Takei later previously {{played the role}} in the season one episode [...] "Ricardio the Heart Guy". Sugar felt that Bubblegum, in the episode, {{was the victim of}} sexual harassment by Ricardio, and that the only way for her to solve the problem <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to turn the situation around and somehow over come Ricardio. In the episode, this was metaphorically depicted by having Bubblegum best him in combat. Sugar reveled in the fact that she got to draw Bubblegum ripping off Ricardio's leg and beating him with; she noted that she had been wanting to featuring such a scene in her art since she was in high school. The climactic scene with Ricardio was also supposed to have featured more body imagery. Ricardio was originally slated to have been seated on a giant hand-throne, and the hole in the Ice King's chest was to have been more graphic.|$|E
500|$|She {{appeared}} with Tim Roth in Michael Haneke's Funny Games (2007), {{a remake of}} Haneke's 1997 film {{of the same name}} that opened at the London Film Festival. The director said that he agreed to make the film on condition that he be allowed to cast Watts, according to UK's The Daily Telegraph. In the picture, she portrayed Ann Farber, who with her husband and son are held hostage by a pair of sociopathic teenagers. Watts also served as a producer, as this charge <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> [...] "one way to spice up the deal and be involved in all the creative decisions". The movie generated mixed reviews and received a limited theatrical release in the United States, grossing $7million, on a $15million budget. Newsweek felt that Watts [...] "hurls herself into her physically demanding role with heroic conviction". David Stratton, from At the Movies concluded that she was [...] "as usual, really fine". However, New York Daily News criticised her part for being half-naked throughout most of her appearance, considering that it was [...] "an awfully strange way to make a righteous point about exploitation".|$|E

500|$|It {{was also}} {{performed}} at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance began with Gaga lying on the floor, on a set that was described as an ornate mansion. Gaga staggered across the stage and pirouetted behind a dancer in a lily-white wheelchair. She {{made her way to}} a white grand piano which she played by placing one foot up on the keyboard. Once again, she staggered across the stage, with theatrical blood dripping from her ribcage. She collapsed on the stage wailing in agony as one of the dancers gently lifted her. Gaga then hung liflessly with one hand rising above her dancers and blood smeared on her face with a golden halo being projected on the screen behind her. The ending climax of the performance pays homage to a similar-sounding ending climax in [...] "A Day In The Life" [...] by The Beatles. She later commented that the performance <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> fans: [...] "I wanted to say something honest and real and not just give a performance where I was jacking off on stage the whole time about my record," [...] It was really for my fans, who I knew would be at home cheering and swooning."

Shelley was pleased when Babe left in May 2015 and said [...] "the last thing anyone wanted <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to come back" [...] when discussing her return in September 2015. Laura Morgan of Digital Spy praised Babe's introduction, writing that her addition [...] "worked beautifully". Sally Brockway, writing for magazine Soaplife, wrote, [...] "She may rustle up a mean trifle, but you'll pay the price if {{you get on the}} wrong side of Aunt Babe Smith." [...] Ellis (Inside Soap) said, [...] "Of all the villains in Walford, we never would have thought that a trifle-making, Reliant-Robin-driving, apron-wearing aunt would turn out to be the most fearsome! She may not have the brute force of Phil Mitchell or the steely determination of Gavin Sullivan, but Babe is not someone we'd ever want to do battle with." [...] A reporter from Soaplife noted that [...] " [...] Babe's own desperation that makes her the monster of the woman she is..." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{passing through}} the Lesser Antilles, reports of squalls with wind speeds of [...] were {{received}} from St. Lucia and Barbados. Rain was also reported, but totals were not large due to the storm's quick passage. One death was attributed to Cora on St. Lucia when a 22year old stepped on a high tension power line that was downed by the winds from the storm in Castries. In addition, an industry on the island reported tree losses of two to four percent from the storm. [...] No reports of damage were received from the other Windward Islands and damage on Grenada, if any, is unknown. Although it remained far to the south, Hurricane Cora affected weather conditions that reached {{as far north as}} Presque Isle, Maine, [...] where balloonists Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson, and Larry Newman were preparing to make the first ever [...] balloon flight on the Double Eagle II.

500|$|Workman, {{herself an}} ardent feminist and a {{supporter}} of women's suffrage, wanted her readers to understand how her contributions and achievements reflected all women's potential. In her writings, Workman described herself as [...] "questioning or violating the norms of Victorian female propriety". She demonstrated that women were strong enough to thrive outside the home by showing how easy it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to endure strenuous physical activities like bicycling long distances in hot, humid places or mountaineering in cold temperatures and high altitudes. Workman challenged a masculine realm; her obituary in the Alpine Journal alluded to the challenges she faced, saying that she [...] "felt that she suffered from 'sex antagonism'". The author of the piece added: [...] "it {{is possible that some}} unconscious feeling let us say of the novelty of a woman's intrusion into the domain of exploration so long reserved to man, may in some quarters have existed... there tended to arise... an atmosphere shall we say of aloofness?" [...] However, in her study of Victorian mountaineering, Ann Colley suggests that gender discrimination was more overt at lower elevations and in regular life than at higher elevations, such as in the Himalaya. Colley states, [...] "Away from such petty opinion emanating from society pressures, up high, above the snow line or in distant regions, women climbers could more fully experience equality and power... If they chose, they could be just as sportsmanlike or competitive as the men." [...] In her entry about Workman in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Tingley sums Workman up as [...] "an aggressive, determined, and uncompromising turn-of-the-century American woman traveler" [...] and [...] "one of the first women to work as a professional mountaineer and surveyor and to write about the expeditions she and her husband took to the most remote reaches of the Himalaya. She was an outspoken advocate of woman's suffrage and made it clear that she considered herself {{to be a role model}} for other women travelers and mountaineers." ...|$|E
