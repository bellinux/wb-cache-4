50|$|It was {{the general}} opinion of aborigines in this area that disease and {{sickness}} was rare before the comning of the <b>whites,</b> with <b>tumours</b> rare or unknown. The Jukambal even claimed rheumatism never struck until the colonials' advent. Knowledge about medicinal plants, often thought to have potent effects, was introduced to young men undergoing initiation at a Bora ceremonial. Some would become fully-fledged medicine men (Noonwaebah) thought to be invested with powers that could endanger others. The Jukambal though anyone who fell sick was exposed in his weak state to the secret enmity of enemies, and as a safeguard often the patient (dthikkae) would summon in several medicine men to examine his physical plight.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. -Sixty {{cases of}} liposarcoma are presented. The {{pathological}} appearances, clinical features {{and methods of}} treatment are described. The overall 5 -year survival was 64 %. The liposarcoma {{is one of the}} most important of the soft tissue sarcomas. This is largely because it {{is one of the most}} common and has proved to be the most common of all at one centre (Enzinger, 1965). Its importance also lies in the fact that, particularly with the better differentiated variants, the chances of cure are reasonably good if treatment is adequate. In the past, six important series of cases have been described and details of these, together with our own, are given in Table I. Pathology Macroscopic findings The naked eye appearances of liposarcomas are variable and tend to reflect their histological patterns. The myxoid ones appear as slimy greyish <b>white</b> <b>tumours</b> bearing some resemblance to a true myxoma. Others resemble benign lipomas and appear as yellow masses which may contain firmer areas of paler colour. The anaplastic variants cannot readily be distinguished from other sarcomas of fibroblastic, myoblastic or synovial origin. Microscopic appearances and histological grading It is universally accepted that there is a relationship between the histology of liposarcomas and their behaviour patterns. The histological classifications used in the past have had some features in common. Stout (1944) accepted four groups and these were used subsequently by Pack and Pierson (1954) and Holtz (1958). Enterline et al. (1960) used a five group system, whilst Enzinger and Winslow (1962) returned to a four group classification. The terminology used by these writers is shown in Table II. Some liposarcomas contain areas with a fibrosarcoma structure and such a finding is said to indicate an aggressive tumour (Holtz, 1958; Enterline et al. 1960). Detailed histological descriptions have been given in the publications listed above and they will not be repeated here. It is, however, important to remember that an adequate amount of tissue must be available to the pathologist if the tumour is to be diagnosed and typed correctly. We have decided to use the classification proposed by Enzinger and Winslow (1962). Cases showing a fibrosarcomatous component have been included in theLIPOSARCOMA 697 on 0 o...|$|R
40|$|Since {{there are}} no {{published}} data on breast cancer in British black women, we sought to determine whether, like African-American women, they present {{at a younger age}} with biologically distinct disease patterns. The method involved a retrospective review of breast cancer to compare age distributions and clinicopathological features between black women and white women in the UK, while controlling for socioeconomic status. All women presented with invasive breast cancer, between 1994 and 2005, to a single East London hospital. Black patients presented significantly younger (median age of 46 years), than white patients (median age of 67 years (P= 0. 001)). No significant differences between black and white population structures were identified. Black women had a higher frequency of grade 3 tumours, lymph node-positive disease, negative oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status and basal-like (triple negative status) tumours. There were no differences in stage at presentation; however, for tumours of ⩽ 2 [*]cm, black patients had poorer survival than white patients (HR= 2. 90, 95 % CI 0. 98 – 8. 60, P= 0. 05). Black women presented, on average, 21 years younger than <b>white</b> women. <b>Tumours</b> in younger women were considerably more aggressive in the black population, more likely to be basal-like, and among women with smaller tumours, black women were {{more than twice as likely}} to die of their disease. There were no disparities in socioeconomic status or treatment received. Our findings could have major implications for the biology of breast cancer and the detection and treatment of the disease in black women...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{paucity of}} {{information}} {{exists on the}} relative proportions, incidences or outcomes of {{diagnosis and treatment of}} feline cancer in South Africa. Standard texts of veterinary oncology quote data from the Northern hemisphere, and geographic differences are apparent. In this retrospective analysis, the electronic medical database of the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital was analysed for feline cancer felines admissions for the period 1998 – 2005 (n = 100 out of N = 12, 893 feline admissions, or 0. 78 % of total feline admissions). The average and median age of feline cancer felines was 7 and 9. 5 years respectively. In contrast to published reports of US, Australian and European data where lymphosarcoma is the most common cancer affecting cats, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) forms the predominant neoplasm (48 % of all <b>tumours).</b> <b>White</b> or part-white cats were overrepresented in this group, which is consistent with greater ultraviolet light exposure. Lymphoma was the second most common diagnosis, followed by various carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. A large proportion (54 %) of felines received some form of treatment...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION. We {{investigated}} {{clinical and}} pathologic features of breast cancers (BC) in an unselected series of patients diagnosed in a tertiary care hospital serving a diverse population. We focused on triple-negative (Tneg) tumours (oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER 2 negative), which {{are associated with}} poor prognosis. METHODS. We identified female patients with invasive BC diagnosed between 1998 and 2006, with data available on tumor grade, stage, ER, PR and HER 2 status, and patient age, body mass index (BMI) and self-identified racial/ethnic group. We determined associations between patient and tumour characteristics using contingency tables and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS. 415 cases were identified. Patients were racially and ethnically diverse (born in 44 countries, 36 % white, 43 % black, 10 % Hispanic and 11 % other). 47 % were obese (BMI > 30 kg/m 2). 72 % of tumours were ER+ and/or PR+, 20 % were Tneg and 13 % were HER 2 +. The odds of having a Tneg tumour were 3 -fold higher (95 % CI 1. 6, 5. 5; p = 0. 0001) in black compared with <b>white</b> women. Tneg <b>tumours</b> were equally common in black women diagnosed before and after age 50 (31 % vs 29 %; p = NS), and who were obese and non-obese (29 % vs 31 %; p = NS). Considering all patients, as BMI increased, the proportion of Tneg tumours decreased (p = 0. 08). CONCLUSIONS. Black women of diverse background have 3 -fold more Tneg tumours than non-black women, regardless of age and BMI. Other factors must determine tumour subtype. The higher prevalence of Tneg tumours in black women in all age and weight categories likely contributes to black women's unfavorable breast cancer prognosis.

40|$|John Hunter was {{undoubtedly}} {{aware of the}} water content of normal brain tissue, and described cerebral oedema. The advent of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shed new light on brain water, and the derivation of spatial information and hence images from NMR signals, has permitted studies of regional brain water in man in vivo. The initial study described here tested whether NMR longitudinal relaxation time (T 1) correlates with brain water content in the cerebral cortex and white matter in man, and significant relationships have been demonstrated in cortex (r = 0. 65, P less than 0. 002) and white matter (r = 0. 94, P less than 0. 0001), the latter having narrow 95 % confidence limits. The residual variance allows the prediction of water content from the T 1 of white matter, measured from {{the image of a}} single patient, with an accuracy of +/- 4 % of total tissue water with 95 % confidence. In the further study described, the effects of dexamethasone and an infusion of 20 % mannitol on brain water content has been assessed in patients with intrinsic cerebral tumours. Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the T 1 of normal brain, oedematous peritumoural <b>white</b> matter, or <b>tumour</b> tissue. It must be concluded that the water content of these tissues is not changed by dexamethasone and that the clinical improvement seen in patients with cerebral tumours immediately after dexamethasone has to be explained by some mechanism other than a reduction in cerebral oedema. Mannitol did reduce the T 1 of oedematous peritumoural white matter, and the T 1 of tumour tissue, but did not change the T 1 of normal brain significantly. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
