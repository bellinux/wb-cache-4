5|$|Before her death, Norman {{met with}} each of her followers; she died on July12, 1993, and was cremated. In her will, she promised to return to Earth, {{accompanied}} by the Space Brothers, in eight years. Students, {{some of whom were}} surprised and confused by her death, were instructed by leaders not to grieve because she was in a celestial state. Some of them privately mourned, and a few left the group. Items of Norman's were distributed to students, some of whom <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> at later events.|$|E
5|$|McCudden was {{determined}} his machine {{would remain in}} first-class fighting order. He spent three days working with his fitters and armourers, stripping down the Vickers gun's synchronising gear, firing at the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets. His armourers joked that his guns would never work in the air if he <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> out on the ground. He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.|$|E
5|$|French women {{welcomed the}} design but the Catholic Church, some media, and a {{majority}} of the public initially thought the design was risqué or even scandalous. Contestants in the first Miss World beauty pageant <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> in 1951, but the bikini was then banned from the competition. Actress Brigitte Bardot drew attention when she was photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the Cannes Film Festival in 1953. Other actresses, including Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner, also gathered press attention when they wore bikinis. During the early 1960s, the design appeared on the cover of Playboy and Sports Illustrated, giving it additional legitimacy. Ursula Andress made a huge impact when she emerged from the surf wearing what is now an iconic bikini in the James Bond movie Dr. No (1962). The deer skin bikini Raquel Welch wore in the film One Million Years B.C. (1966) turned her into an international sex symbol and was described as a definitive look of the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|The first {{standard}} strips {{began to emerge}} in the 1870s, with many clubs opting for colours associated with the schools or other sporting organisations from which the clubs had emerged. Blackburn Rovers, for example, adopted shirts of a halved design based on those of the team for former pupils of Malvern College, one of the schools where the sport had developed. Their original colours of light blue and white were chosen to reflect an association with Cambridge University, where a number of the club's founders had been educated. Colours and designs often changed dramatically between matches, with Bolton Wanderers turning out in both pink shirts and white shirts with red spots within the same year. Rather than the modern shorts, players wore long knickerbockers or full-length trousers, often with a belt or even braces. Lord Kinnaird, an early star of the game, was noted for always being resplendent in long white trousers. There were no numbers printed on shirts to identify individual players, and the programme for an 1875 match between Queen's Park and Wanderers in Glasgow identifies the players by the colours of their caps or stockings. The first shin pads were worn in 1874 by the Nottingham Forest player Sam Weller Widdowson, who cut down a pair of cricket pads and <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> outside his stockings. Initially the concept was ridiculed but it soon caught on with other players. By {{the turn of the century}} pads had become smaller and were being worn inside the stockings.|$|E

25|$|Ottawa Redblacks – As {{part of the}} Signature series, the Redblacks wore red and plaid uniforms {{three times}} during the 2014 season, {{including}} an away game on November 7 against the Toronto Argonauts.

Saskatchewan also wore a modified version of their retro-themed uniforms in two games that year.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} famous for wearing {{many layers of}} tzitzit. At first, he wore about 150 pairs, but later, due to his fragile health, he wore only about 70 pairs.

50|$|Boots {{of speed}} are a {{frequent}} item in role-playing games and roguelikes. In the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, boots of speed are {{a variation of}} the famous magical boots. They enable the person <b>wearing</b> <b>them</b> to run very fast. In most cases, as fast as a galloping horse, or bit slower if the person <b>wearing</b> <b>them</b> is slow to move around. The person <b>wearing</b> <b>them</b> must usually rest for long periods after use. They are sometimes referred to as 7 League Boots.|$|R

5000|$|The great {{difference}} between your correspondent ‘STAYLACE' and myself seems to be, {{that she was}} encased in corsets at an early age, and thus became gradually accustomed to tight-lacing, while I did not <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> till I went to school, at fourteen, and I did not <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> voluntarily.|$|R
25|$|In 1999, Davids began wearing {{protective}} glasses following surgery {{in his right}} eye caused by glaucoma, which developed in 1995 following eye injuries.

25|$|The Flyers {{were the}} first and {{one of only two}} NHL teams (the Hartford Whalers being the other) to wear Cooperalls, hockey pants that extend from the waist to the ankles, in 1981–82. They <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> the {{following}} season as well, but returned to the traditional hockey pants in 1983–84 due to Cooperalls being banned from the NHL for safety reasons.|$|E
5000|$|Our {{advice is}} to wash less often, but clearly, you have to judge for {{yourself}} what's appropriate. Hot day, dirty job? Wash your jeans. Please! Cold day, office job? Maybe you can <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> twice or more before {{they go back to}} the washing machine. Personally, if I wear a pair of jeans to work on Friday—cool climate, office job—I tend to <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> on Saturday. And if Saturday is spent indoors and I'm not spilling food all over myself, I might even <b>wear</b> <b>them</b> on Sunday. Corey Warren ...|$|R
25|$|Patients wearing soft {{contact lenses}} are {{instructed}} to stop <b>wearing</b> <b>them</b> 5 to 21 days before surgery.

25|$|On 19 February 1931, Lindrum gave a billiards {{exhibition}} for the King {{and other}} members of the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace. King George V presented Lindrum with a pair of gold and enamel cuff links bearing the royal monogram.

25|$|Muncie {{was one of}} {{the first}} players to wear glasses or goggles while playing. He began wearing glasses at Arizona Western, when he <b>wore</b> <b>them</b> at {{practice}} one day and realized they improved his nearsightedness. Muncie wore thick black frames throughout his career, switching to sports goggles late in his career. While with the Saints, he was featured in a full-page ad by glassmaker PPG for shatter-resistant glasses. Decades later in the 2010s, National Basketball Association (NBA) players were considered hipsters for wearing thick black glasses.|$|E

25|$|The {{important}} elements of the Vestal costume include the stola and the vittae. It {{is important to note}} that these two items are closely related to the traditional attire of Roman brides and the Roman matron, and therefore are not unique to the Vestals. The vittae that the Vestals wore was a cloth ribbon worn in the Vestals’ hair. It is closely associated with status of Roman matron. Vittae were worn by a wider range of woman at different stages of life and therefore cannot be accepted as unique to just one stage. Unmarried girls, matrons, as well as the Vestal virgins all <b>wore</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{commissioning}} pennant, or masthead, which a warship flies {{from its}} masthead and indicates {{the commission of}} {{the captain of the}} ship (and thus of the ship itself). In the Royal Navy, the commissioning pennant is a small St George's Cross with a long tapering plain white fly. In the United States Navy, it is red above white, with seven white stars in the blue hoist. The commissioning pennant may be displaced by various rank flags, namely the flags or pennants of admirals or commodores, and the personal flags of heads of state and members of royal families. In former centuries, masthead pennants were of a length {{similar to that of the}} ships that <b>wore</b> <b>them,</b> but nowadays very long pennants tend only to be seen when a ship is paying off.|$|E
25|$|The {{suits that}} were worn by Filipinos {{were known as}} “zoot suits”, {{prominent}} {{in cities such as}} Los Angeles and Stockton. Zoot suits were originally worn by Mexican-Americans and African-Americans, but eventually Filipino-Americans <b>wore</b> <b>them.</b> Because Filipinos lived in the same neighborhoods as Mexican-Americans, the likelihood that Filipinos adopted this specific style of dress from Mexican-Americans was high. Zoot suits had a distinct appearance; they had loud and vivid colors, lengthy jackets, and sat slightly above the waist while tapering off down the leg of the respective pant. What became known as the “McIntosh Suit” was a regional term in southern California for a suit that was one’s personal best. The most popular MacIntosh suits featured gray colors with blue pinstripes constructed of gabardine material and wool material for winter suits.|$|E
