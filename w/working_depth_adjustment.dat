40|$|Underwater {{wireless}} sensor networks (UWSNs) {{can provide}} a promising solution to underwater target tracking. Due to the limited computation and bandwidth resources, {{only a small part}} of nodes are selected to track the target at each interval. How to improve tracking accuracy with a small number of nodes is a key problem. In recent years, a node <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> system has been developed and applied to issues of network deployment and routing protocol. As far as we know, all existing tracking schemes keep underwater nodes static or moving with water flow, and node <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> has not been utilized for underwater target tracking yet. This paper studies node <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> method for target tracking in UWSNs. Firstly, since a Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) can quantify the estimation accuracy, its relation to node depth is derived as a metric. Secondly, we formulate the node <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> as an optimization problem to determine moving depth of activated node, under the constraint of moving range, the value of FIM is used as objective function, which is aimed to be minimized over moving distance of nodes. Thirdly, to efficiently solve the optimization problem, an improved Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is proposed, in which the generating probability is modified to improve searching speed and accuracy. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify performance of our scheme...|$|R

40|$|Producing a {{high quality}} {{stereoscopic}} impression on current displays is a challenging task. The content has to be carefully prepared {{in order to maintain}} visual comfort, which typically affects the quality of depth reproduction. In this work, we show that this problem can be significantly alleviated when the eye fixation regions can be roughly estimated. We propose a new method for stereoscopic <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> that utilizes eye tracking or other gaze prediction information. The key idea that distinguishes our approach from the previous work is to apply gradual <b>depth</b> <b>adjustments</b> at the eye fixation stage, so that they remain unnoticeable. To this end, we measure the limits imposed on the speed of disparity changes in various <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> scenarios, and formulate a new model that can guide such seamless stereoscopic content processing. Based on this model, we propose a real-time controller that applies local manipulations to stereoscopic content to find the optimum between depth reproduction and visual comfort. We show that the controller is mostly immune to the limitations of low-cost eye tracking solutions. We also demonstrate benefits of our model in off-line applications, such as stereoscopic movie production, where skillful directors can reliably guide and predict viewers' attention or where attended image regions are identified during eye tracking sessions. We validate both our model and the controller in a series of user experiments. They show significant improvements in depth perception without sacrificing the visual quality when our techniques are applied...|$|R

Limited excursions may be possible without special decompression, but larger excursions may require part of the saturation system to be isolated for additional decompression, or if short, it can be done in the bell.

When the bell reaches <b>working</b> <b>depth</b> the bottom lock is opened and the divers get out and back in through it.

40|$|Designing an {{efficient}} deployment method to guarantee optimal monitoring quality {{is one of}} the key topics in underwater sensor networks. At present, a realistic approach of deployment involves adjusting the depths of nodes in water. One of the typical algorithms used in such process is the self-deployment <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> algorithm (SDDA). This algorithm mainly focuses on maximizing network coverage by constantly adjusting node depths to reduce coverage overlaps between two neighboring nodes, and thus, achieves good performance. However, the connectivity performance of SDDA is irresolute. In this paper, we propose a <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> algorithm based on connected tree (CTDA). In CTDA, the sink node is used as the first root node to start building a connected tree. Finally, the network can be organized as a forest to maintain network connectivity. Coverage overlaps between the parent node and the child node are then reduced within each sub-tree to optimize coverage. The hierarchical strategy is used to adjust the distance between the parent node and the child node to reduce node movement. Furthermore, the silent mode is adopted to reduce communication cost. Simulations show that compared with SDDA, CTDA can achieve high connectivity with various communication ranges and different numbers of nodes. Moreover, it can realize coverage as high as that of SDDA with various sensing ranges and numbers of nodes but with less energy consumption. Simulations under sparse environments show that the connectivity and energy consumption performances of CTDA are considerably better than those of SDDA. Meanwhile, the connectivity and coverage performances of CTDA are close to those <b>depth</b> <b>adjustment</b> algorithms base on connected dominating set (CDA), which is an algorithm similar to CTDA. However, the energy consumption of CTDA is less than that of CDA, particularly in sparse underwater environments...|$|R

However, consumers show a growing interest in organic food or foods produced with fewer agricultural chemicals. Therefore, a need exists to develop alternative weed control methods. A tine mechanism for an autonomous weeding machine was developed, and the interaction of a single tine and a rotating tine mechanism with the soil was investigated. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop a laboratory methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of a tine and rotating tine mechanism in disturbing weed plants simulated by individual wood pieces. Two experiments were performed using the tine and tine mechanism under a controlled environment. Soil in a large rotating bin was processed and sieved to a maximum size of 5 mm. The soil was then conditioned with water to produce the desired moisture content. A single tine was used in the first experiment. The experimental factors for this test were the tine diameter, tine depth and the speed that the tine moved through the soil. For the second experiment, four tines were attached to a disk that rotated about a vertical axis. The rotational tine mechanism was tested at different <b>working</b> <b>depths</b> and disk rotational speeds. All of these tests were conducted in a rotating soil bin with a controlled speed. The orientation of each simulated weed was observed in each trial. The observations were captured in a Mean Likelihood of Control (MLC) parameter which was intended to indicate the mean likelihood of simulated weed being controlled. In the first experiment, significant differences were observed in MLC across tine diameter, tine <b>working</b> <b>depth</b> and travel speed. There was evidence of a significant interaction between tine diameter and tine <b>working</b> <b>depth.</b> As for the second experiment, significant differences were observed in MLC across tine <b>working</b> <b>depth</b> and rotational speed of tine mechanism.
