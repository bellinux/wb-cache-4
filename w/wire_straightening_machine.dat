40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} to determine straightening stroke precisely for automatic <b>straightening</b> <b>machines.</b> The existing calculation method of straightening stroke is based on straightening curvature equation. Because the initial curvature is obtained by curve fitting method, the method is inconvenient to use and its accuracy is not well. In this paper, a method to calculate straightening stroke based on straightening process model is put forward. So the mathematic load-deflection model of straightening process must be established at first. The straightening process model for shafts is developed according to the elastic-plastic mechanics theory. By using the model, the straightening stroke can be calculated directly according to the initial deflection of the bent part. It is advantageous to use and to decrease errors. Comparing with FEM results and experimental results, the calculation results by the model are exact and the errors are small. So the validity and the accuracy of the method are verified.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} to calculate straightening stroke precisely for automatic <b>straightening</b> <b>machines.</b> But, the existing mathematic models for calculating straightening stroke can not solve this problem well. In this paper, the mathematic load-deflection model, which reflects elastic range, elastic-plastic range and elastic spring back of press straightening process, is developed. By using the model, the straightening stroke can be calculated directly according to the initial deflection of the bent part. By simplicity, the rectangular section part is selected for study and {{is assumed to be}} the ideal elastic-plastic material. Based on the elastic-plastic mechanics theory, through deriving relationships among the load, bending moment, deflection and elastic region length, the theoretical model of press straightening process has been established. Finally, two examples are calculated. The results calculated by the model are in good agreement with the results computed by FEM. Experimental data also show that the calculation results by the model is exact and the error is small. So the validity and the accuracy of the model are verified.
