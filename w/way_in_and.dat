After injecting herself with the same drugs Walternate (John Noble) had used on her, she enters the tank and soon finds herself back in her own universe. She encounters a cleaning lady, and as Olivia feels herself being dragged back to the parallel universe, she gives the cleaning lady a message to pass along to Peter (Joshua Jackson). Back in the isolation tank, Walternate has had Olivia extracted from the tank and directs his agents to lock her up and sedate her.|$|E
25|$|Close to the Cliff edge is Julian's Bower, a {{unicursal}} turf maze, 43 feet (13 m) across, of indeterminate age. Although {{referred to}} as a maze, being unicursal (having only one <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> one path through) it is more accurately a labyrinth.|$|E
25|$|The {{station was}} {{provided}} with a crossover between the double track lines, and a signal box to control it. A number of railway sidings also branched from the station in a westerly direction along the main line. In 1979, they served the International Harvester, Heinz, and General Motors Holden factories. The station could not be accessed from public roads, with the only <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out via a gate into the General Motors Holden factory.|$|E

25|$|Caesar {{then set}} out in the {{direction}} of Gergovia, which Vercingetorix was probably able to guess once he had divined his direction. The heights of Gergovia itself stand twelve hundred feet above the plain that they overlook. It is a plateau that is {{a mile and a half}} long by a third of a mile wide. It was an advantageous place to hold, as there was only one <b>way</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> a small body of troops could hold the entrance to the place. It was a reasonably easy guess to make.|$|E
25|$|During the Rwandan Civil War, Kigali {{airport was}} a major {{strategic}} point. Since Rwanda is land-locked, this represented the only easy <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the country. The airport had two runways, but after the Arusha Accords, one runway was closed down after a request from the RPF. Later in April 1994, the President of Rwanda's plane was shot down in the Assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira. It is disputed who shot down the plane, the RPF or the FAR (Rwandan Defence Forces). This event triggered a renewal {{of the civil war}} {{and the beginning of the}} Rwandan Genocide.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the threat}} of more landslides, {{residents}} of the neighbourhood were relocated to neighbors and various hotels around Bergen. A further 128 people in the houses beyond the slide-area found themselves isolated due to the destroyed access road, and had to use a forest trail when evacuated by emergency responders. As this trail would be the only <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the neighbourhood for days, it was paved with gravel. Gaia Trafikk, the city's bus company, set up a short makeshift bus route for the residents to help them get to work. The bus operated between Hamreveien, a minor road {{at the end of the}} trail, to the closest bus stop in Osvegen. Vandalism concerns for the abandoned houses caused the police to use floodlights to patrol the area.|$|E

25|$|The {{planners}} for {{the operation}} were faced with a significant problem. While the Chetequera and Dombondola complexes were only around 35km from the border with South West Africa/Namibia (then under South African control), therefore making conventional assault possible, Cassinga was 260km from the border and deep inside Angola. This meant that any conventional assault force would have to fight its <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out, and would almost certainly have given advance warning to the PLAN (People's Liberation Army of Namibia - SWAPO's armed wing) soldiers in Cassinga, allowing them and leaders like Jerobeum 'Dimo' Amaambo (the PLAN commander-in-chief, then resident in Cassinga) and Greenwell Matongo to escape. Cassinga furthermore was located on a small hill, flanked by a river on its West side, and open fields in other directions, factors that combined to give any defenders the advantage.|$|E
25|$|However, the War Office {{judged the}} Tett turret {{to be too}} cramped and not {{bulletproof}} against heavy fire, its isolated nature did not allow adequate command and control and the open top was vulnerable to a well-thrown grenade. The most striking feature was that the only <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out was through the top – {{there was no way}} to escape without being exposed to enemy fire – it was to be a fight to the death. Burbridge went back to the drawing board and came up with a new version that instead of being positioned over a pipe was placed on a concrete slab over an underground chamber of brick or concrete slabs. This allowed access from a tunnel or slit trench to the rear. The company's brochure shows a wooden seat suspended from the turret by a metal frame.|$|E
25|$|Packer {{was often}} the centre of controversy. One of the {{earliest}} incidents occurred on 7 June 1960, {{when his father was}} trying to take over the Anglican Press, a small publisher run by Francis James. According to author Richard Neville, Frank Packer was angered by James' refusal to sell the Anglican Press, so he sent Kerry and some burly friends to pressure him into selling. They forced their <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> reportedly began vandalising the premises, but James was able to barricade himself in his office and call his friend Rupert Murdoch, Packer's most powerful rival. Murdoch quickly dispatched his own team of 'heavies', who threw Kerry and friends out. Not surprisingly, the Murdoch press had a field day with the news that the son of Australia's biggest media tycoon had been caught brawling in the street.|$|E

After almost giving up {{on the idea of}} having a baby, Sonya takes a standard pregnancy test before donating blood, and Rhys tells her she is pregnant. Troy returns to town and moves next door to Sonya and Toadie. He tries to gain custody of Callum and takes an intervention order out on Toadie, causing Sonya to collapse from the stress. When Troy refuses to let Callum leave his house, Sonya and Jade force their <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> Troy locks them inside. When Sonya and Jade escape, Troy falls and sustains a head injury. After he discharges himself from hospital, Troy goes to Callum's school and is confronted by Sonya and Toadie. Troy leaves, but falls unconscious at the wheel of his truck and dies. Toadie's cousin, Georgia (Saskia Hampele), moves in and bonds with Sonya over the baby. Toadie proposes to Sonya and she accepts. Sonya goes into labour two weeks early and due to complications, she has to be rushed to hospital, where she gives birth to Nell (Scarlett Anderson) via caesarean section. Sonya undergoes surgery for internal bleeding, before she is reunited with her daughter.|$|E
500|$|Former Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was {{in exile}} in Doorn, Netherlands, was horrified by the purge. He said, [...] "What would people have said if I had done such a thing?".

500|$|The {{operation}} {{to liberate the}} island started at 04:45 1 November 1944, when No. 4 Commando left Breskens by LCAs for their objective the town of Flushing. On their <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> 60 minutes before {{they were expected to}} land a heavy artillery bombardment started. By 05:45 the SBS group landed beside the Oranje Molen windmill. They cleared the mines, other obstacles and dealt with the German guards without firing a shot. Then they marked the landing spot {{for the rest of the}} commando, No. 1 and No.2 Troops were the next to land. They extended the beachhead and captured machine gun posts and heavy gun emplacements. Another weapon captured was a [...] anti-aircraft gun which supported the other troops when they moved into the town. The final wave landed at 06:30, but had to contend with heavy and accurate fire. One LCA carrying the heavy weapons troop was sunk containing most of their weapons and equipment. Once on the island No. 3 and No.5 Troop moved into the town held by the large numbers of Germans defending the area. No. 6 Troop captured the post office and 50 prisoners. In the afternoon No. 1 Troop was released to support No. 3 and together they advanced again before nightfall. No. 4 Commando had by then secured most of the old town and their flanks were secure.|$|E

500|$|On {{the same}} evening, the two VNQDĐ insurrectionary {{attempts}} in the Sơn Dương sector also failed. When Nhu {{saw the light}} flashing from Lam Thao, he ordered his mennumbering around 40to enter Hung Hoa {{and head for the}} barracks, to raid the Garde indigène post. Nhu's men traversed the streets and avoided passing the French administrative offices and arrived at the military complex, shouting at the Vietnamese sentries to open the doors and join the revolt. One of the VNQDĐ militants carried a banner saying [...] "Revolutionary Armed Forces: Every Sacrifice for the Liberation of the Fatherland and the Vietnamese People". They had banked on their countrymen joining them, but instead were met with gunfire. The VNQDĐ responded by throwing bombs over the walls and setting fire to a side door. They then forced their <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> focused their attack on the residence of the commanding officer, but he managed to escape. Three of the men penetrated the officer's compounds to mount a search. The colonial forces were vastly stronger and easily repelled the VNQDĐ group, who retreated and headed towards the river. However, their three comrades were in the compound searching for the commanding officer and did not hear the signal to retreat. Nevertheless, they were able to escape after the colonial troops had already dispersed their VNQDĐ colleagues. The French captured three other men and 17 unused bombs.|$|E

2500|$|This delay {{had allowed}} {{the bulk of}} the Norse army to form a shieldwall to face the English attack. Harold's army poured across the bridge, forming a line just short of the Norse army, locked shields and charged. The battle went far beyond the bridge itself, and {{although}} it raged for hours the Norse army's decision to leave their armour behind left them at a distinct disadvantage. Eventually, the Norse army began to fragment and fracture, allowing the English troops to force their <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> break up the Scandinavians' shield wall. Completely outflanked, and with Hardrada [...] killed with an arrow to his windpipe and Tostig slain, the Norwegian army disintegrated and was virtually annihilated.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between time and suffering. This research is based on Nietzsche's phenomenology of the "It was", developed by him in the chapter "On redemption" in "Thus spoke Zarathustra".

[...] MD 90 was extended west to US 113, which at the time followed today's MD 575, in 1975. [...] The state highway was completed when the highway opened between US 50 and US 113 in 1976. [...] MD 90's present interchange with US 113 was constructed in 1976. [...] However, the interchange remained unused until US 113 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway from Berlin north past MD 90 in 2000.

[...] After exchange fire at long range, the cavalry halted to wait for the infantry, which arrived {{at about the same time}} as Captain-Lieutenant Farley's company; the companies of Stoddard and Cooper did not arrive in time to participate. [...] A hot fire then began between the three American companies and the British force which lasted about 15 minutes. [...] The numerically superior British flanked the Americans and successfully occupied the orchard that was behind the house. [...] Roberts was mortally wounded, and the American line broke, with some men fleeing into the house, while others tried to escape into the countryside.
