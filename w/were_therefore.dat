5|$|A large temple also owned sizable {{tracts of}} land and {{employed}} thousands of laymen to supply its needs. Temples <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> key economic as well as religious centers. The priests who managed these powerful institutions wielded considerable influence, and despite their ostensible subordination to the king they may have posed significant challenges to his authority.|$|E
5|$|Although {{adequate}} for the town's residents the new stations were {{a long way}} from the seafront attractions, which were at the foot of a steep hill. The day-trippers on whom Ramsgate's tourist industry depended <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> increasingly attracted to Margate, where the station was next to the beach.|$|E

5|$|Note: The 1998–99 and 2011–12 NBA seasons {{were both}} lockout-shortened seasons at 50 games and 66 games, respectively, {{instead of the}} normal 82. These two seasons <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> {{excluded}} from the lowest season totals list.|$|E
5|$|The Khap panchayat's {{ruling was}} based on the {{assumption}} that Manoj and Babli belonged to the Banwala gotra, a Jat community, and <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> considered to be siblings despite not being directly related and any union between them would be invalid and incestuous. Nevertheless, the couple went ahead with their marriage, following which they were abducted and killed by Babli's relatives.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Nelsons were {{notoriously}} {{difficult for}} inexperienced crews to fire properly, {{due to their}} long firebox, and specific crews who had proven experience in firing the locomotives <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> allocated to them. This {{was due to the}} relatively few locomotives in the class for crews to train on. The LMS Royal Scot Class was loosely based on this design.|$|E
50|$|Granites are {{cooler and}} <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> {{less able to}} melt and {{assimilate}} country rocks.

5|$|The Nazis also {{targeted}} {{religious groups}} {{for political and}} ideological reasons. Thousands of Christian clergy were killed, including some with a Jewish background (Edith Stein, for example). The Nazis considered Jews a racial group; secular people {{and those of other}} religions who had Jewish ancestry <b>were,</b> <b>therefore,</b> Jews (a belief shared by some Jews).|$|E
5|$|After being re-established in December 1940, I./JG 1's primary {{responsibility}} was the air defence of Germany and its Northern occupied territories. In this role, the unit almost exclusively {{worked in the}} Netherlands prior to its transfer to central West Germany. Its main opponents through 1940–41 <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> lone RAF reconnaissance aircraft, the anti-shipping aircraft of RAF Coastal Command and the medium bombers of RAF Bomber Command's 2 Group, although the group would see little action compared to other theaters during 1941. During this time, this sector was considered relatively safe compared to other theaters.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{most of the}} High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow during the peace negotiations. The four Helgoland-class ships were allowed to remain in Germany, however, and <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> spared {{the destruction of the}} fleet in Scapa Flow. Ostfriesland and her sisters were eventually ceded to the victorious Allied powers as war reparations; Ostfriesland was transferred to the United States Navy. She was sunk during air power trials off the Virginia Capes in July 1921.|$|E

5|$|Although Gert's center {{remained}} off {{the coast}} of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1inches (332mm) of rain during the storm. Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers with poor hydraulic conductivity and <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> prone to soil saturation. The initial rainfall raised the levels of many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequence. After hours of prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, Pérez Zeledón, and Osa experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to roads and bridges.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{supporting}} roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E
5|$|As Northern Ireland's most {{dominant}} club side, Linfield have been regular campaigners in European football. The club first participated in European competition in 1959 against Göteborg in the 1959–60 European Cup. In {{the first round}} of the 1961–62 European Cup, Linfield were drawn to face an East German team, Vorwärts. The away leg was played, which Linfield lost 3–0. However, Vorwärts were denied visas for entry into the UK to play the second leg, and (similarly to Glenavon the previous season) travelling to play the game in a neutral country was not financially viable for Linfield. They <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> forced to withdraw from the competition.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue that what {{was at the time}} dry land was once under the sea. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish. However, in both cases, the fossils were complete remains of shellfish species that closely resembled living species, and <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> easy to classify.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals. When {{red clover}} was {{introduced}} as a crop to New Zealand {{in the nineteenth}} century, it {{was found to have}} no local pollinators, and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, red clover was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses. The New Zealand population of buff-tailed bumblebees naturally colonised Tasmania, 1,500 miles away, in 1992.|$|E
5|$|By September 3, 2009, {{attorneys}} representing Mercury Radio Arts, Glenn Beck's media company, {{had requested}} that the domain registrar of Eiland-Hall's website delete the site. Beck's lawyers characterized the site's location as libelous. They demanded that the domain registrar revoke the WhoisGuard privacy-protection service for the website, and turn over contact information for the then-anonymous Eiland-Hall. The registrar, NameCheap, refused. On September 4, 2009, Beck's lawyers sent another letter to the domain registrar, repeating their requests and noting that they had read the website's contents and <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> aware from statements posted to the site that its operator had been notified by the registrar.|$|E

5|$|Edward married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937. She {{became the}} Duchess of Windsor, but, much to Edward's disgust, George VI issued letters patent that denied her {{the style of}} Her Royal Highness. The couple settled in France, and the Duke {{received}} a tax-free allowance from his brother, which Edward supplemented by writing his memoirs and by illegal currency trading. He also profited {{from the sale of}} Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House to George VI. Both estates are private property and not part of the Royal Estate, and <b>were</b> <b>therefore</b> inherited and owned by Edward, regardless of the abdication.|$|E

Westley responded by releasing nine players, whilst a further four were sold on.|$|E
