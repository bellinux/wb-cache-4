This study also examined the prevalence of use of AEDs in facilities that report having one on site. METHODS: <b>Weight</b> <b>rooms</b> and fitness centers containing weight-bearing equipment in the major metropolitan area of Tucson were telephoned to partake in a questionnaire. The researchers asked for a manager to partake in the questionnaire {{at the time the}} call was made. Collected information included the presence of an AED, the use of the AED in the past year, frequency of AED testing to ensure proper function of the device, and the acquisition of gym member health history.

5|$|Hamels {{entered the}} 2007 season having done {{significant}} {{work in the}} <b>weight</b> <b>room</b> in the offseason and at spring training. His tenacity came to fruition when, on April 21, 2007, Hamels pitched his first major league complete game, allowing one run on five hits and two walks while setting a career high with 15 strikeouts. Just three days before, the Phillies moved their opening day starter Brett Myers to the bullpen to be the closer, making Hamels the team's number one starter. On May 16, he carried a perfect game into the seventh inning, but then walked leadoff hitter Rickie Weeks and surrendered a home run to the next batter, J. J. Hardy.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Major League Baseball {{team owners}} met {{to demand that}} minor league owners improve their ballparks {{in order to meet}} their desired standards. Greer had already fallen behind other parks {{when it came to the}} quality of the field and clubhouse, and it also lacked a <b>weight</b> <b>room</b> and batting cages. Following his failed bid to secure an MLB team for Nashville in the 1993 Major League Baseball {{expansion}} process (Nashville was one of ten cities considered, but was eliminated from contention very early in the process; the two new franchises were eventually awarded to Denver and Miami), Schmittou focused on scaling-back his proposed MLB stadium into a new Triple-A facility for the Sounds. At a time when other Triple-A cities were building new, relatively luxurious ballparks, Schmittou was unable to convince mayor Phil Bredesen or the Metro Council to pay for such a new park. He considered moving the team to a surrounding county, and even tried, unsuccessfully, to get the Metro Council to pass a referendum to let taxpayers vote on a temporary tax increase to pay off a proposed $40million stadium in three years. In the end, Schmittou elected to keep the Sounds at Greer but make significant improvements to the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Over $200,000 {{was spent}} on renovations {{in the fall and}} winter before the 1995 season. The home clubhouse and <b>weight</b> <b>room</b> were remodeled, aisles behind the dugouts were resurfaced to reduce {{slippery}} areas, and the entire playing field was re-sodded. This was the first replacement and upgrading of the field since the original sod was laid in 1978. First, all of the old grass was stripped from the field. Then, the grounds crew installed a new drainage system. Four trenches were dug and laid with 2,500feet (760m) of drainage pipe to carry water away from the field and beyond the center field wall. A layer of gravel was laid over the pipe, and a 4-to-6-inch (10to15cm) layer of sand was placed above the gravel. After raising the level of the infield dirt and brick warning track to the same height of the new field, 100,000square feet (9,300m²) of Tifton 419 Bermuda Grass was installed on the field and edged into a baseball diamond configuration.|$|E

During the Spring and Summer semesters (the offseason) of 2013 LeVert and Stauskas trained {{together on the}} court and in the <b>weight</b> <b>room.</b> He followed fellow Columbus native and National Player of the Year Burke as a key contributor to Michigan basketball as a sophomore.

When Michigan played (#10 AP Poll/ #8 Coaches' Poll) Duke in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge on December 3, LeVert again posted 24 points, including a 77 free throw performance. On January 18, Michigan defeated (#3 AP/#3 Coaches) Wisconsin at the Kohl Center {{for the first time since}} the 1998–99 team did so on February 27, 1999. It was the highest ranked team Michigan has ever beaten on the road. LeVert contributed a career-high 4 steals and 20 points. LeVert posted his first double double on January 30 at home against Purdue with a career-high 11 rebounds and 14 points. On February 16, Michigan lost to (#21/21) Wisconsin, despite a career-high 25 points from LeVert. Michigan clinched its first outright (unshared) Big Ten Conference championship since 1985–86. He was a 2014 second team 2013–14 All-Big Ten selection (coaches and media). On March 11 LeVert was named to the all-District V (OH, IN, IL, MI, MN, WI) team by the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). The 2013–14 team was eliminated in the elite eight round of the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament by Kentucky.
