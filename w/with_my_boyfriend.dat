Like I said, {{it was a bit}} weird, but I quite liked it as a storyline." [...] During a fire safety promotion undertaken with co-star Lena Kaur, who plays Leila Roy, Lister referenced the storyline, commenting: [...] "It's much easier to test your smoke alarm once a week and plan your escape from fire than it is to escape from a psycho!".|$|R
5000|$|... "I think lyrically {{a lot of}} my {{fans will}} go back to when I first started {{releasing}} songs even on to Myspace and things like that because I was very explicit and honest <b>with</b> <b>my</b> lyrics and I would literally just sing what I was thinking. I think it’s genuinely gone back to that. I think {{for the past couple of}} years I’ve maybe been filtering out lyrics quite a bit and going for a more typical kind of pop structure, but this song, we had so much fun writing it, it just comes back to that basic thing of having that person just constantly stuck in our heads." ... "I’m sorry to all the people that want it to be about someone — it’s not, it’s like a myth." [...] "I like guys <b>with</b> tattoos, <b>my</b> <b>boyfriend</b> has tattoos…but I don’t mind.

[...] She describes the album as [...] "a record {{of the time that}} it was made, and the time I spent waiting for it to come out, and now that time is over. It's actually quite weird that other people are only just hearing it. Members of my family will bring up a song and I’ll be like, 'that is so 2008.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Skylar Gordon, 17 is from Milpitas, California: [...] "It {{means a lot}} to have a prom—but {{not only}} to have a prom but have one that you know is going to be accepting. I really felt like I belonged at gay prom. I've never really fit in at any sort of school-related dance, and I never was really out about {{anything}} at a school dance. Here, I could be myself. I could be <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>boyfriend,</b> as a pansexual transgender guy, and win cutest couple. That would never happen at a school-related prom, or any dance of any kind." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "At {{the time}} I was having {{arguments}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>boyfriend,</b> {{who was actually}} my co-producer as well - we made records together. And then I go off into some other areas: I remember somebody close to me was going through severe, severe depression. A lot of times in my songs, I get into some phase where I describe some other situation, and there's a whole verse in there about somebody who is very, very depressed. But yeah, {{it was a story}} about a breakup I was going through, and that situation where it's gotten into your head too much..":-Lisa Loeb talking about the inspiration of [...] "Stay (I Missed You)" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, rumors {{began to}} {{circulate}} {{that she was}} dating actor Jack Nicholson after she accompanied him to the premiere of the Oscar-winning film The Departed, an American crime drama film starring Nicholson. De La Huerta has dismissed the dating rumors, stating; [...] "I met Jack at the Roosevelt Hotel when I was 19. I was dating a narcissistic actor at the time who had abandoned me to schmooze for his work. I was very angry, and Jack kept following me around. He said to me: “They don’t make them like you anymore. I haven’t seen a beautiful girl like you since 1965.” I said, “Let’s go make <b>my</b> <b>boyfriend</b> jealous.” So he had me cornered, and he was flirting <b>with</b> me, and <b>my</b> <b>boyfriend</b> got completely jealous. We’ve stayed friends." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It was {{a series}} of things... it was a process. Basically it was a {{combination}} of getting involved in martial arts and having these small successes within martial arts, which empowered me to start taking steps in my personal life, in my relationships, in my professional life, and then, honestly, when it comes to accepting my sexuality.""It video made a really big difference for my generation because (being gay) wasn't something that was disgusting and gross - just something that became cool overnight, thanks to Madonna. That allowed me to feel less ashamed - it became almost cool to explore it - and, unfortunately or fortunately, that exploration was not just an exploration, it wasn't just me experimenting. It turns out that was what was going on with me throughout all my teenage years. I really didn't know. I really thought something was wrong with me. I didn't know that I liked women, but I knew I didn't like men. I knew when I was a kid I didn't want to be physical <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>boyfriends.</b> Didn't wanna make out with them. I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me."Then when I became 18 and I was kissed by a girl, like a Katy Perry song, I was like, [...] "Oh my god, this is what's been going on all these years." [...] The light bulb went off in me and I'm like, [...] "I've been gay this whole time," [...] and I, honest to god, was in such deep denial that I had no idea until that moment.|$|R

[...] "'Brave New World', to me, {{is a sad}} love song, because I wrote {{most of it in}} Bristol {{last year}} after a {{tremendous}} row <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>boyfriend.</b> But I could never do a love song true to myself, because that's being selfish. I prefer what I call open lyrics, so that the kids can fit their own feelings to them... And so 'Brave New World' is a love song, because I think everyone goes through the phase when they think no one in the world knows how hurt they are - experiencing a loneliness that no one knows, but everyone knows it", Toyah said in the Sounds interview, 1982.|$|E

50|$|Welch {{elaborated}} on {{the concept}} of the song:This is about when there's that electricity between you, and a boy, and it's completely unspoken. When they're standing {{in front of you and}} you can't breathe, can't think, can't do anything properly. I'm really geeky - if I like someone, I just become incapable. I remember <b>with</b> <b>my</b> first <b>boyfriend,</b> walking past the window of a pub, seeing he was in there and literally throwing myself on the ground and crawling on the floor because I was so scared! I feel things quite intensely, which is probably why the music is quite intense. If I really like someone, I like someone; I'm sad, I'm sad.I was listening to a lot of hip hop and I wanted to make something that had that kind of beat to it. To me it's the most forward-thinking music around. No one else is moving forward at such pace! Again, it's really Gothic imagery - fairy tales and Edgar Allen Poe stories. I'd read a lot of Gothic horror when I was a kid.|$|R

5000|$|Following the disappointing {{sales of}} Bush's fourth album, The Dreaming, EMI was {{concerned}} about sales {{largely due to the}} long time period it took to produce the album. [...] "I finished my last album, did the promotion, then found myself in a kind of limbo," [...] she later explained. [...] "It took me four or five months to be able even to write again. It's very difficult when you've been working for years, doing one album after another. You need fresh things to stimulate you. That's why I decided to take a bit of the summer out and spend time <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>boyfriend</b> and with my family and friends, just relaxing. Not being Kate Bush the singer; just being myself." [...] In the summer of 1983, Bush built her own 48-track studio in the barn behind her family home which she could use any time she liked.|$|E

Those are your three elements." [...] Kahn ended up creating, according to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, [...] "a semi-futuristic world in which Spears walks into a club, breaks up with her cheating boyfriend and triumphantly walks in the rain, knowing her life is better off without him." [...] Kahn also considered the music video as very sophisticated, saying that it is [...] "definitely a departure from the sort of candy-colored videos she was doing before, so I always thought this was the transition between Britney the teenage pop star and Britney the sort of diva she became."

5000|$|After obtaining {{commercial}} success with first two singles, [...] "Smile" [...] and [...] "LDN", Allen decided {{to promote the}} album by releasing [...] "Littlest Things". The song was composed in New York, where Allen travelled after she had met producer Mark Ronson when at lunch with her then boyfriend, Seb. There, {{she told him she}} was a singer and gave him a copy of her demo CD. He was impressed by her song [...] "Smile" [...] and asked her to work together. Regarding the process of composing the song, Ronson stated: We spent a day together and worked on a couple of things, and went to record shops where I played samples to her. Then I wrote the piano and guitar bit to [...] "Littlest Things", and she sat down and scribbled for about an hour and finished the lyrics.We went into the booth to record the song. She originally wanted to do a Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But I asked her to sing it all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.In regards to composing the song and its lyrical meaning, Allen noted that, Mark's got a very good ear. He's very relaxed in the studio and very thoughtful. There's not really any pressure working there, because he's got his own studio so he doesn't have time constraints.The song was called [...] "Littlest Things" [...] and was about having broken up <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>boyfriend,</b> because Seb and I had split up for a few months. We've since got back together. It must have been quite awkward for Mark because Seb was his friend, but being fresh out of a relationship I wanted to write about what was on my mind.Mark came up with the music first, then I came up with the words and we fitted it all together into a melody. That's the way I normally make songs - I write everything in the studio - and it obviously means that producers are very important to me. It's a complete joint effort.|$|E

I went to Turkey <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>boyfriend</b> David on a trance gathering, a festival called A Total Solar Eclipse Festival. There I did participant observations and interviews. Can Collins theory about interaction ritual be useful to raise the understanding? And is it fruitful to apply the term collective identity? The collective identity is build up by the festival as interaction ritual. It generates solidarity, emotional energy {{and a sense of}} belonging. In this paper I discuss different categories and symbols that the collective identity contains of. Like for example the music or the movement’s experience of the nature. The categories are symbols in that sense that they are norms and values which the participants bring along with them, they gets stronger and reproduces through the festival. The categories that I have found I place under one main category called “liberation of spirituality” where feelings of timeless, present orientation and a break from ordinary life. But also feelings as freedom, beautiful nature, colours, music, and drugs that raise the spirit and scatter boarders. The movement also contains conflicts, some of them they express explicitly and others they don’t mention more than implicit...|$|E
