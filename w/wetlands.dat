40|$|As one {{of three}} {{important}} ecosystems in the world,wetland has complex, various and specific functions. With the change of its component,the <b>wetland</b> ecosystem function is changing. Analyzing the process of <b>wetland</b> landscape change can expose the mechanism and rules of <b>wetland</b> landscape change and provide academic supply for sustainable use of <b>wetland</b> resource. In this paper the landscape pattern change of Dongting Lake <b>wetland</b> was studied. Dongting Lake <b>wetland</b> {{is one of the}} most important <b>wetland</b> ecosystems in China and it has complex and various functions and values. From 1980 to 2000, Dongting Lake <b>wetland</b> changed gradually due to natural factor and human activities. In order to better understand physical and human effect on <b>wetland,</b> protect and use the <b>wetland</b> resources sustainably in Dongting Lake area, it is necessary tor study the change of <b>wetland</b> landscape in Dongting Lake area. Some indices of the landscape pattern, such as landscape diversity index, landscape dominance index, landscape fractal dimension index are adopted. This study was on the basis of Chinese Academy of Sciences resource and environment spatial-temporal database and the two-stage remote sensing data: Landsat MSS data captured in 1980 and Landsat TM/ETM data captured in 2000. The result showed that <b>wetland</b> area increased by 16307 hm 2, of which paddy field and riverwetland decreased largely, but pond <b>wetland</b> area increased obviously. Totally artificial <b>wetland</b> area increased, while natural <b>wetland</b> decreased. Accordingly the landscape pattern indices changed with the changes of area and perimeter of several <b>wetland</b> types in Dongting Lake. These changes are the result of interactions between human activities and natural factor. But the human impact on <b>wetland</b> is the most important causation in the past two decades. The changes of <b>wetland</b> landscape made environmental quality and ecological function decade in Dongting Lake area, especially the flood disaster aggravate. © 2008 SPIE...|$|R

By analyzing the slope soil and <b>wetland</b> sediment, we conjectured that Jangdo <b>wetland</b> depended {{on the influence of}} peripheral slope soil.
