On 4 January 1930, she ran aground off the Algerian coast and could not be freed. She sank five days later.

5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} {{to participate in}} pro-democracy movements; these actions led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours {{that she would be}} arrested for dissent. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> Indonesia, Sarumpaet {{continued to}} write politically charged stageplays. She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of child trafficking in Southeast Asia. The resulting work served as the foundation for her 2009 feature film debut, Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). This film was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film but not nominated.
