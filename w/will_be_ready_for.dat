The Blue Line {{extension}} will branch northward from the Target Field station, adding 11 stations to the line: two more in Minneapolis, two in Golden Valley, one each in Robbinsdale and Crystal, and five in Brooklyn Park. The Green Line extension will branch west from Target Field station and include 15 new stations: five in Minneapolis, three each in Saint Louis Park and Hopkins, one in Minnetonka, and three in Eden Prairie. The Metropolitan Council estimated in 2017 that the Green Line extension {{will be open}} for passenger service in 2021 and the Blue Line extension <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> passenger service the following year.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane {{makes it to the}} terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E

25|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is considered}} to be the central control for reproduction due to its role in hormone regulation. Hence, factors that determine when a seasonal breeder <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> mating affect this tissue. This is achieved specificlly through changes in the production of the hormone GnRH. GnRH in turn transits to the pituitary where it promotes the secretion of the gonadotropins LH and FSH, both pituitary hormones critical for reproductive function and behavior, into the bloodstream. Changes in gonadotropin secretion initiate the end of anestrus in females.|$|E

25|$|The April 2016 Report {{from the}} U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{described}} Boeing’s test {{schedule for the}} KC-46 program as “optimistic” and projects Boeing will need an additional four months beyond the August 2017 target to deliver 18 full-up tankers due to testing and parts qualification issues. The report notes that operational testing will not now begin until May 2017 {{and will not be}} completed until two months after the first tranche of 18 aircraft are delivered, risking late discoveries of problems. The GAO also noted that Boeing has not obtained Federal Aviation Administration's approval for two key aerial refueling systems - the centerline drogue system and the wing aerial refueling pods, which were built without following FAA processes. Boeing now projects these components <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the FAA to certify by July 2017 — over three years late. The 18 aircraft were meant to include the four developmental aircraft, brought up to an operational standard, plus the first 14 low-rate production (LRP) examples. Instead, 16 of the 18 will be production line examples; because the aircraft will be delivered before operational testing is complete, Boeing will be responsible for any late design fixes.|$|E

2500|$|Railguns face {{a host of}} {{technical}} challenges before they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> battlefield deployment. First, the rails guiding the projectile must carry very high power. Each firing of the railgun produces tremendous current flow (almost half a million amperes) through the rails, causing rapid erosion of the rail's surfaces (through ohmic heating, and even vaporization of the rail surface.) [...] Early prototypes were essentially single-use weapons, requiring complete replacement of the rails after each firing. Another challenge with the railgun system is projectile survivability. The projectiles experience acceleration force in excess of 100,000g. In order to be effective, the fired projectile must first survive the mechanical stress of firing and the thermal effects of a trip through the atmosphere at many times {{the speed of sound}} before its subsequent impact with the target. In-flight guidance, if implemented, would require the onboard navigation system to be built to the same level of sturdiness as the main mass of the projectile.|$|E
