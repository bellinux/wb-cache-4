2500|$|However several Buddhist leaders {{including}} Thích Nhất Hạnh, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Shodo Harada and the Dalai Lama {{among others}} [...] condemned the violence against Muslims in Myanmar {{and called for}} peace, supporting {{the practice of the}} fundamental Buddhist principles of non-harming, mutual respect and compassion. The Dalai Lama said [...] "Buddha always teaches us about forgiveness, tolerance, compassion. If from one corner of your mind, some emotion makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit,</b> or want to kill, then please remember Buddha's faith. We are followers of Buddha." [...] He said that [...] "All problems must be solved through dialogue, through talk. The use of violence is outdated, and never solves problems." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{commentators}} {{complained that}} because Pietersen changed {{from being a}} right-handed to a left-handed batsman as the bowler approached his delivery stride, he was gaining an unfair advantage. Gideon Haigh said that [...] "A bowler must advise a batsman when he's changing direction, why should the batsmen not; given that where the bowler's aiming {{will depend on the}} placement of the off stump". Ian Healy seconded this by saying [...] "It just should be outlawed straightaway. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> {{to one side of the}} field, you've got to do it in a cross fashion, and not swap the way you're facing or your grip. Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups." [...] Former fast-bowler Michael Holding argued [...] "if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor should he have to tell the umpire if he is going over or round the wicket." ...|$|E

60|$|The field grew tolerably quiet just then. The Rube did not exert himself. The {{critical}} stage had {{no concern}} for him. He pitched Lane a high curve, over the plate, but in close, a ball {{meant to be}} hit and a ball hard to hit safely.

Again the Rube relentlessly gave him the same ball; and Lane, hitting viciously, spitefully, because he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> that kind of a ball, sent up a fly that Rand easily captured.|$|E

60|$|Pedro paid no {{attention}} to the remark, but, dismounting, slowly raised the rifle to his shoulder. The guide was one of those men who seem to live in advance of their age. He had thought out, and carried out in a rough-and-ready manner, ideas which have since been scientifically reduced to practice. Being well aware that any projectile is drawn downward in its flight by the law of gravitation, and that if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> a distant point you must aim considerably above it, he had, by careful experiment, found out how high above an object at a given distance one must aim in order to hit, and, by constant practice in judging distance, as well as in taking aim above his mark, he had attained to such skill as a long-range marksman that his friends almost believed it impossible for game to get beyond the range of his deadly weapon, and foes never felt easy till they were entirely out of his sight. The comparative slowness, too, of the flint-lock in discharging a rifle, had necessitated in him a degree of steadiness, not only while taking aim, but even after pulling the trigger, which rendered him what we might term statuesque in his action as he levelled his piece.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{get into}} the way of waiting too long before you fire, Tom," [...] Pete Hoskings said. [...] "Better to try to shoot too quick to begin with than to be too long about it. When you have made up your mind {{that you are going}} to shoot, get your bead on your mark and fire at once. You may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> a red-skin's head as he looks out from behind a tree, and to do that you must fire the instant you see him or he will be in again. One of the best shots I ever saw never used to raise his gun to his {{shoulder}} at all. He just dropped his piece into the hollow of his left hand, and would fire as he touched it. He did not seem to take any aim at all, but his bullet was sartin to hit the thing he wanted to, even if it were no bigger than an orange. He could not tell himself how he did it. 'I seen the thing and I fired, Pete,' he would say; 'the gun seems to point right of its own accord, I have not anything to say to it.' You see, shooting is a matter of eye. Some men may shoot all their lives, and they will never be more than just respectable, while others shoot well the first time that a gun is put in their hands. Want of nerve is what spoils half men's shooting; that and taking too long an aim. Well, it is time for us to be mounting and getting back. I have got to see that the dinner is all ready. I never can trust that black scoundrel, Sam, to do things right while I am away." ...|$|E

Mr. James Smith says he is going on a cruise to Sweden, and makes his word good, at the beginning, by {{starting}} northward toward the coast of Scotland. What does he go in? A yacht. Do yachts carry live beasts and a butcher on board? No. Will joints of meat keep fresh all the way from Cumberland to Sweden? No. Do gentlemen like living on salt provisions? No. What follows from these three Noes? That Mr. James Smith must have stopped somewhere on the way to Sweden to supply his sea-larder with fresh provisions. Where, in that case, must he stop? Somewhere in Scotland, supposing he didn't alter his course when he was out of sight of your seaport. Where in Scotland? Northward on the main land, or westward at one of the islands? Most likely on the main land, where the seaside places are largest, and where he is sure of getting all the stores he wants. Next, what is our business? Not to risk losing a link in the chain of evidence by missing any place where he has put his foot on shore. Not to overshoot the mark when we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> it in the bull's-eye. Not to waste money and time by taking a long trip to Sweden till we know that we must absolutely go there. Where is our journey of discovery to take us to first, then? Clearly to the north of Scotland. What do you say to that, Mr. William? Is my catechism all correct, or has your strong ale muddled my head?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess we}} have," [...] said Rachel, [...] "so if you'll wait here we'll {{come to you}} when the cars are fixed." [...] So saying, Rachel {{put her hand on}} her lover's arm and walked off with him along the platform. Rachel O'Mahony had not been badly {{described}} when her father said of her that she looked as though she might be blown away. She was very fair, and small and frail to look at. Her father had also said of her that her health was remarkably good,--"the best confirmed that he had ever known in his life." [...] But though this too, was true, she hardly looked it. No one could have pointed out any sign of malady about her; only one would have said that there was nothing of her. And the colour on her face was so evanescent that he who watched her was inclined to think that she herself was like her colour. And she moved as though she was always on the vanishing point. [...] "I'm very fond of eating," [...] she had been heard to say. [...] "I know it's vulgar; but it's true." [...] No doubt she was fond of eating, but so is a sparrow. There was nothing she would not attempt to do in the way of taking exercise. She would undertake very long walks, and would then fail, and declare that she must be carried home; but she would finally get through the day's work better than another woman who appeared to have double her strength. Her feet and hands were the tiniest little adjuncts to a grown human body that could be seen anywhere. They looked at least to be so. But they were in perfect symmetry with her legs and arms. [...] "I wish I were bigger," [...] she had once been heard to say, [...] "because I could hit a man." [...] The man to whom she alluded was Mr. Mahomet M. Moss. [...] "I sometimes <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> a woman, but that would be such a small triumph." [...] And yet she had a pride in her little female fineries. [...] "Now, Frank," [...] she had once said, [...] "I guess you won't get another woman in all Galway to put her foot into that boot; nor yet in New York either." ...|$|E

According to retired teammate Tomoaki Kanemoto, Nōmi had been doing well during batting practices and was even quoted as <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> a home run at least once. In that same game, he also earned the win by pitching a complete game. Nōmi improved on past seasons to finish at 11-7 and topped the league in complete games.|$|R

Then Hanna arrives and, when she accepts the arm of Camille, Danilo <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> Camille with his gloves and challenge Camille to a duel. Baron Zeta's eyes are finally opened to what is happening between Camille and Valencienne, when Valencienne shields Camille from the angry Danilo.|$|R
