25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E

Up to now, the people in the place which he served for two-and-a-half years remember the tall, kindly priest.|$|E
25|$|The rabbit tick is {{extremely}} host specific {{and in its}} search for a host will climb onto vegetation. The tick <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> vegetation that is {{the height of the}} rabbit, , and is slightly curved. The rabbit tick, in this process, is attempting to orient itself to a range where it can find rabbits, birds, and small mammals. The rabbit tick prefers surfaces with a smaller diameter near the tip of the vegetation, but the diameter of the base of the vegetation has no effect on the vegetation choice. Once it finds a suitable position, the tick will become still and stretch out its tarsi to wait for a stimuli that a host is near. The tick has the ability to sense the carbon dioxide from a potential host as well as body temperature. When the rabbit tick finds the host it will either accept the host and begin to feed or reject the host and fall to the ground, repeating the process until it finds a suitable host. This process is summed up into two parts; physical environmental stimuli and host-emitted stimuli. Also, H. leporispalustris relies heavily on light and humidity for cues of a host. The tick <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> sources that are dry and prefers darker environments.|$|E

25|$|Women {{look for}} certain cues {{on a first}} date: For example, it is {{important}} to a woman {{to find out if the}} man is courteous or not. Women <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> this by observing if the man comes to the door to pick her up or if he opens doors for her, or compliments her on how she looks, for example. If some of her expectations are not met, mainly the most important ones, she will not want to pursue anything more than a friendship. If the expectations are met, a second date might be in the future, but only if the man is feeling the same thing.|$|E
25|$|The Judges {{themselves}} are not exempt from the law; in fact {{they are expected to}} obey it more strictly than any other. A violation that would earn a citizen a few months in an Iso-Cube would get a Judge a twenty-year sentence, served as hard labor on Saturn's moon, Titan, after surgical modification to enable the convict to survive outside there without needing an expensive space suit. (Titan is a moon of Saturn in reality, but was located over Jupiter in an early Dredd strip.) When Judges do make a minor mistake (anything were the citizen is alive or not in an intensive care ward) such as wrongful arrest or search they do have to pay the citizen a compensation fee if there is no crimes to be charged with. On that basis, if they can't find any evidence for the main charge, then they <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> any minor crime or misdemeanours to charge to citizen with to get themselves off the hook.|$|E
25|$|The City of Chicago {{is looking}} into a plan for an express train that would take tourists, locals, and other {{travelers}} from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport in about 20 minutes, which is half {{the time it takes}} on the City's Blue Line. If an express train does get built, one-time tickets would likely cost around $30 to $35. Less expensive monthly passes and family discounts might also become available. The City <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a private company to cover construction costs and operate the system, but it's likely public money would go into building stations at the airport and downtown if the project moves ahead. The city says an engineering firm will spend the next 10 months evaluating potential routes, drafting designs and coming up with a construction timeline and cost estimate, then put it out for bid in 2017. In the early 1990s, the idea of a 20-minute O'Hare express train service has been proposed. Some plans included bypass tracks on the CTA Blue Line that run {{down the middle of the}} Kennedy Expressway as well as use of a Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way near the Kennedy. However no plans were ever materialized.|$|E

25|$|With optimal {{ripeness}} {{and balance}} between acidity and sugars {{being such a}} viticultural priority for Chenin blanc, many growers (such {{as those in the}} Loire Valley) will harvest the grapes in tries or successive pickings through the vineyards. During each series of picking only the ripest clusters or individual grapes are harvested by hand during a period that could last four to six weeks and include three to six passes through the vineyard. For the production of sweet botrytized wines, pickers <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the grapes that have achieved the necessary amount of the noble rot. In hot and dry years where no noble rot occurs, pickers may leave ripened grapes on the vine long enough to shrivel, or passerillé, where it could later be effected by noble rot. In areas that experience a lot of vintage variation, winemakers may decide on a day by day basis what style and dryness of Chenin blanc they could make, with the grapes harvested during each tries going to different styles of wine. For some producers in Vouvray, which may have up to six tries during harvest, the first few tries could go to sparkling and dry wine production while the later tries could go towards sweet wine production.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of the Asian {{financial}} crisis, however, the temple was subject to widespread criticism for its fundraising methods and teachings, Luang Por Dhammajayo was eventually charged with embezzlement and removed from his office as abbot. In 2006, the charges were withdrawn and he was restored as abbot. The temple grew further in the following years and became known for its many projects in education, promotion of ethics, and scholarship in Thai society. The temple's movement developed an international scope, as of 2007, the temple's following was estimated at one million practitioners worldwide and thirty to fifty international centers outside of Thailand. Under the 2014 military junta, the abbot and the temple were put under scrutiny again and Luang Por Dhammajayo was accused of receiving stolen money of a supporter and money-laundering. This incident led to several standoffs between the temple and the junta, eventually leading to 23 day lock down of the temple in 2017 by the junta that made headlines worldwide. In the aftermath of the lock down the junta stated they <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> Luang Por Dhammajayo elsewhere but continued its scrutiny of the temple, giving the vice abbot, Luang Por Dattajivo several charges as well.|$|E
