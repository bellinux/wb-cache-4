500|$|Lead singer Chester Bennington {{arrived late}} in the {{recording}} process of the album, having been chosen to replace Scott Weiland in the band Stone Temple Pilots, and then proceeded to record High Rise and tour with the band for most of 2013. When he eventually joined the band in the studio, {{he was surprised to}} find the band had reverted to their heavier rock-centric sound. Bennington stated in an interview with Kerrang!: [...] "Mike wrote tons while I was touring with Stone Temple Pilots last year. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> there was a lot for me to catch up with, and he was playing me things and I was like, 'Dude, this is fucking awesome!' I was really surprised how heavy it was".|$|E
2500|$|It was me {{who brought}} Poulidor to Mercier where, like Desbats and me, he spent all his career. In a criterium, I saw this unknown who was riding all around us. I {{saw him again}} in the Bol d'Or and I spoke to him. He said he hadn't yet got a team {{but that he was}} in talks. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home,</b> I spoke {{straight}} away to Antonin Magne, who asked me: [...] "You're sure that he rides well?"

[...] "I {{had it in}} my {{rucksack}} for nine months after that before I {{got a chance to}} play it.

2500|$|Nonetheless, {{the early}} years of their {{relationship}} were difficult, as Wrangler and Whiting struggled with Wrangler's homosexuality. When Wrangler shouted at her in a restaurant that he was gay, Whiting responded, [...] "only around the edges, dear." [...] Wrangler explained in an interview : [...] "When I got with Margaret, I knew I had to change course. She would have my bags packed and sitting outside the door <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home</b> at night and things like that. Plus I would go through massive guilt whenever I did go out with a guy and I was with her. So I finally said that's it. I went to her one night and said I'm never going to cheat on you again with anybody. So my sex life became very masturbatory. And I'm good at that-very good at that, in fact.". The couple was married from 1994 until his death.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spiritual leader}} of the tail section. Director Bong first saw Hurt in The Elephant Man while at middle-school, which made him curious about the actor; for the part of Gilliam he wanted an older actor, though one {{with the ability to}} [...] "exude the {{ambience}} of spirituality." [...] On the character of Gilliam, Hurt said, [...] "He is certainly shadowy, but he is shadowy for a reason. Even though I still am not entirely certain what the reason is," [...] adding, [...] " [...] as far as Gilliam is concerned, he believes in the status quo, but he also sees himself as a true humanitarian. I mean he has literally given his limbs to these people." [...] Hurt stated that the role of Gilliam was physically challenging one at that, because, [...] " [...] the fact that I had one leg strapped behind me, trying to stagger around on those not very easy-to-use crutches. [...] and having {{to make it look like}} as though I'd been doing it for years." [...] He too acknowledged Bong's encouragement of collaboration in allowing the cast and crew to [...] "interpret things as we want, as we see fit" [...] as well as adding pointers to the act. Hurt said of Bong, [...] "I just fell in love with him. He was wonderful. I hadn't seen anything. I hadn't seen Mother or anything, which I immediately did <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>home.</b> I went, 'Wow, that's the chap I was talking to.' Thank God instinct has left me completely. I adored him then, I adored him ever since." [...] as well as previously adding, [...] "He is quite different but technically, he is as clever as Hitchcock. That's saying something. [...] He is one of the best directors I've worked with. I absolutely adore working with him." ...|$|E

As {{students}} at Marksville High School, Laborde in 1943 defeated Edwin Edwards for senior class president. In {{his first year in}} the House as an Edwards floor leader in 1972, Laborde balked at Edwards' call for a $1 billion tax increase. [...] "And, oh man, did <b>I</b> catch hell. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home,</b> Edwin had put the word out, and everyone was calling me. Let me tell you, it was mighty uncomfortable.

5000|$|According to Ken Gwertz's article [...] "Landscape Alchemist," [...] George Hargreaves' {{interest}} in Landscape Architecture was partially {{due to a}} summer trip that he went on when he was 18 years old. During {{the trip to the}} Rocky Mountains, George Hargreaves climbed Flat Top Mountain where he experienced a life changing scene. Hargreaves describes the sense, [...] "It wasn't just the mountains or the trees or any of the individual elements. It was something about the sense of space itself. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>home</b> <b>I</b> tried to explain this to my uncle...and he said, 'Have you ever thought about going into landscape architecture?'" [...] In 1973, George Hargreaves attended the School of Environment and Design at the University of Georgia. Four years later, he graduated second in his class, magna cum laude, with a Bachelor of Landscape Architecture. Soon after getting his bachelor's degree, George went to Harvard University Graduate School of Design. He graduated with distinction and received a Masters in Landscape Architecture.|$|R
6000|$|I mused with a {{considerable}} amount of tensity over Cyril that night, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>home</b> and Jeeves had brought me the final whisky. I couldn't help feeling that this visit of his to America was {{going to be one of}} those times that try men's souls and what not. I hauled out Aunt Agatha's letter of introduction and re-read it, and there was no getting away from the fact that she undoubtedly appeared to be somewhat wrapped up in this blighter and to consider it my mission in life to shield him from harm while on the premises. I was deuced thankful that he had taken such a liking for George Caffyn, old George being a steady sort of cove. After <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> him out of his dungeon-cell, he and old George had gone off together, as chummy as brothers, to watch the afternoon rehearsal of [...] "Ask Dad." [...] There was some talk, I gathered, of their dining together. I felt pretty easy in my mind while George had his eye on him.|$|R

5000|$|Jackamo Road: [...] "That song had {{an entire}} {{arrangement}} with the band, but it just wasn't any good. The only time the song sounded remotely good at all was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> played it on acoustic guitar - the way it {{ended up on the}} record. We spent six days in here, 12-13 hours a day, sequencing this record. That was something I'd never done before. We'd always sequenced the other records in an afternoon - Scarecrow, The Lonesome Jubilee and all those other records. There was about that much thought that went into it. When we got {{to the end of the}} record, I thought, 'We need something to happen here that hasn't happened.' So I just ran out and recorded 'Jackamo Road' in two minutes. I tried to sing it as country as I could, just to make it the opposite of the song I knew was going to come after it, 'Life Is Hard,' which is as urban-sounding a song as we've got. I'm still agonizing over 'Jackamo Road' because I wish I'd said another word. I think it says, 'I'd like to buy you a cabin cruiser/we could sail around.' You don't sail a cabin cruiser. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> sang it, it never dawned on me. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it <b>home,</b> <b>I</b> thought, I'm going to have to record it again.

At that time, I’m running around and I notice a big bald spot on my beard that kept getting bigger and bigger. I’m acting like I don’t want to see it, I’m brushing it away and it kept getting it bigger and bigger. So <b>When</b> <b>I</b> finally <b>got</b> <b>home</b> off the road, I was like you know what, ‘I’m gonna go to the doctors.’ I don’t like going to the doctors, so I go, and she’s like it’s a disorder that comes from your nerves and your stress, but she said ‘I’m going to give you medication, and I’ll see you back in 4 months.’ Through that whole process while I’m at the doctor’s office, my phone’s ringing, I’m dealing with marketing people, I’m dealing with lawyers, I’m dealing with Ross, I’m dealing with personal shit, a whole bunch of shit at the same time. It didn’t stop, she’s thinking I’m crazy. So she gave me my medicine and all that, and she found out who I was, and after watching that 45 minute doctor’s session, she grabbed my shoulder and she just goes, ‘Son, you’re suffering from success.’ I looked at her and was like, ‘That might be the realest thing you can tell me, and it opened my mind up like, success comes with stress, and happiness.
