For most songs, MIDI keyboards were played live into a sequencer and left unquantized, while vintage keyboards were recorded to analog tape. Riley said of the process in an interview for Keyboard magazine, [...] "even though <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> sequencer for some stuff, we'd still cut the song live from start to finish.

Rajeswara Rao recalled in a 1993 interview for The Hindu {{that it took}} him over a year to compose the film's music, with {{much of his time}} devoted to the drum-dance scene: [...] "As the dancers performed, we used to rehearse and compose the music. It was done with incredibly few instruments. <b>We</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> piano, ten double-bass violins, and drums from Africa, Egypt, and Persia which we have acquired from an African War troupe." [...] Rao's salary was 1,500. The music was influenced by Carnatic and Hindustani music, Latin American and Portuguese folk music and Strauss waltzes. According to M. K.

The video relies upon the use of greenscreen, and contains strong references to critically acclaimed famous artists, including Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Salt-n-Pepa, M.I.A. and Jean-Michel Basquiat. In an interview with Carson Daly on his radio show, Amp Radio, Rihanna described the video as [...] "completely {{different from any other}} video" [...] she had done before and [...] "pretty freakin' cool". She explained its artistic qualities, and said, [...] "A lot of my videos are really dark and edgy and tough. 'Rude Boy' is more playing along the lines from my roots. <b>We</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> lot of color, but also the costumes were very Jamaican dance-hall-queen type."

When asked the concept behind the video, Webb said: [...] "They provided the sound and I provided the lights. A whole lot of lights. We used the same guy who did the lighting setup for Lenny Kravitz's 'Are You Gonna Go My Way?' and Coldplay's 'Speed of Sound.' But it's also rough around the edges — <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> bunch of different processes when developing the film." [...] He also concluded with, [...] "...it's a big performance video. But it's them performing inside of this wind-tunnel of light. It's a lot of smoke and mirrors, and a lot of camera tricks. There's a big light wall, streaks of light, xenon lighting effects and strobe lights. [...] But it's all wrapped around this very simple performance environment".|$|E

Smith told the press that he called Denzel Washington for advice, who told him that an onscreen same-sex kiss was a bad career move.

Photographer Paul Wakefield met her and the band to discuss the project: [...] "The idea was to shoot disquieting and unnerving images {{underwater}} {{in a swimming pool}} – you can’t scream underwater. I {{wanted to be able to}} completely control the lighting, and so an indoor pool was the only option. I scouted quite a few pools, but when I saw this pool in the YMCA in Central London, which was dark blue tiled with light blue lane stripes instead of the normal reverse colors, I knew it was the ideal location. I wanted to give it an eerie underwater night-time feel, and this setting was perfect. <b>We</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> number of 1000K and 2000K lights around the pool edge.

Buttle told Foot: [...] "I had to take drastic action, and I decided on plenty of liquid marl and cow manure. <b>We</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> watering can to spread it across the wicket.

Each member would bring his own {{individual}} riffs and ideas to the band, jam on them, and then begin piecing the songs together into various configurations before deciding on {{what would become the}} final versions. The album's recording sessions took place between January and April 2001 at Inner Ear Studios and Dischord House in Arlington, VA, located just outside Washington D.C. The band once again worked with producer/engineer Don Zientara. During the recording process a considerable amount of time was spent finalizing each song's production, in particular the album's drum tracks, in an effort to give it a unique feel. Drummer Brendan Canty explained to Modern Drummer that [...] "We recorded them all very differently in terms of the drum sounds. <b>We</b> <b>used</b> <b>a</b> lot of different cymbals, snares, and ways of miking." ...|$|E
