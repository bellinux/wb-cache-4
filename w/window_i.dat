500|$|Murphy {{became a}} {{national}} celebrity following his World War II military service when Life magazine proclaimed him America's [...] "most decorated soldier" [...] in its 16 July 1945 issue cover story. That magazine cover {{brought him to the}} attention of veteran actor James Cagney who invited him to Hollywood. When Murphy arrived in California after his military discharge, Cagney cancelled the hotel reservations he'd made for Murphy and instead took him into his own home, [...] "I got the shock of my life. Audie was very thin. His complexion was bluish-gray." [...] Commenting years later on his first impression, Cagney said, [...] " [...] in such a nervous condition that I was afraid he might jump out of a <b>window.</b> <b>I</b> took him home and gave him my bed." [...] He spent three weeks as a guest of Cagney and then returned to Texas before finally agreeing to an offer from brothers James and William Cagney of $150 a week as a contract player with their production company. The Cagneys gave Murphy personal attention on acting techniques. He also took lessons at the Actors' Lab on Sunset Boulevard. Murphy studied voice techniques, learned judo, and trained with choreographer John Boyle, Cagney's dance coach for Yankee Doodle Dandy. A 1947 disagreement with William Cagney ended his association with the brothers without having been cast in a film production.|$|E
500|$|Edgar Wright's contribution, Don't, was {{produced}} {{in the style of}} a 1970s' Hammer House of Horror film trailer. The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs, Matthew Macfadyen, singer Katie Melua, Lee Ingleby, Georgina Chapman, Emily Booth, Stuart Wilson, Lucy Punch, Rafe Spall, Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a voice-over by Will Arnett. Mark Gatiss, MyAnna Buring, Peter Serafinowicz, Michael Smiley and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie [...] "Mary" [...] in Shaun of the Dead), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances. [...] To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists. According to Wright, [...] "In the '70s, when American International would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead. But in the States, it was called Don't Open the <b>Window.</b> <b>I</b> just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you {{what the hell is going}} on in the film." [...] On the Charlie Rose talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British.|$|E
2500|$|When I {{arrived in}} San Francisco in 1957, I {{remember}} going to The Place at North Beach with Michael McClure. There was this assemblage by Wally Hedrick in the <b>window.</b> <b>I</b> {{think it was}} part of a stovepipe, there was a doll's head in the vent, and it had wheels; it was like a cart (with a cane on it). -- Bruce Conner ...|$|E

2500|$|Describing {{the origins}} of Hawkman, Fox recalled, [...] "I was faced {{with the problem of}} filling a new book that {{publisher}} Max Gaines was starting... As I sat by the <b>window</b> <b>I</b> noticed a bird collecting twigs for a nest. The bird would swoop down, pick up the twig, and fly away. I thought, 'Wouldn't it be great if the bird was a lawman and the twig a crook!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} half of 1959, I took a long-distance bus from Xinyang to Luoshan and Gushi. Out of the <b>window,</b> <b>I</b> saw one corpse after another in the ditches. On the bus, no one dared to mention the dead. In one county, Guangshan, one-third of the people had died. Although there were dead people everywhere, the local leaders enjoyed good meals and fine liquor. ... I had seen people who had told the truth being destroyed. Did I dare to write it? ...|$|E
2500|$|Van Gogh {{worked on}} a group of {{paintings}} [...] "The Wheat Field" [...] that he could see from his cell at Saint-Paul Hospital. [...] From the studio room he could see a field of wheat, enclosed by a wall. [...] Beyond that were the mountains from Arles. [...] During his stay at the asylum he made about twelve paintings of the view of the enclosed wheat field and distant mountains. [...] In May Van Gogh wrote to Theo, [...] "Through the iron-barred <b>window</b> <b>I</b> see a square field of wheat in an enclosure, a perspective like Van Goyen, above which I see the morning sun rising in all its glory." [...] The stone wall, like a picture frame, helped to display the changing colors of the wheat field.|$|E
6000|$|THE GOVERNOR. Yes, {{and what}} then? Caught, brought back, punishment. Five weeks' {{hard work to}} make this, and cells {{at the end of}} it, while they put anew bar to your <b>window.</b> <b>Is</b> it worth it, Moaney? ...|$|R

2500|$|... "One evening, passing my living-room <b>window,</b> <b>I</b> heard Graham's name flung upward {{from the}} street below. I leaned out to see. A very fiery young man was making a speech from a soapbox on the corner. A little knot of men, women, and {{children}} had collected about him. He was pointing up at my window — at me. He was saying things about us. I strained to hear... 'Municipal Ownership is no solution,' he cried, 'so long as the propertied classes own the municipalities. J.G. Phelps Stokes is a rich man — a man of property; he belongs to the capitalist class. The Municipal Ownership League is a rich man's creation. W.R. Hearst belongs in the millionaire class. This is his government. He doesn't {{want to change the}} government. The Socialist Party, the workers' party, and what we want is a government of, for, and by the people who work.' 'Hear, hear!' I called down, leaning far out of the window and clapping my hands.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{a week of}} his wedding, Wedge {{had been}} {{committed}} to the psychiatric ward in the Highland Hospital in Oakland, California for observation after admitting to an alienist {{that he had been}} obsessed with either strangling his new wife or defenestrating her during their honeymoon. Wedge also confessed that [...] "for several months I have been fighting a desire to kill myself. For weeks I would want to slash my throat every time I picked up a razor. Every time I looked out of a high <b>window</b> <b>I</b> wanted to jump out. I am a sick man and for my own protection and for the protection of my loved ones I want to be locked up and be placed where I can harm neither myself or anyone else". Wedge believed his condition was caused by damage caused by a frontal skull fracture sustained in a saloon fight about 1899, and exacerbated by the stress caused by the publicity surrounding his wedding and resignation from the church.|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} a steady decline that she bore resolutely and without complaint. Tuberculosis was the key element of Thérèse's final suffering, but she saw {{that as part of}} her spiritual journey. After observing a {{rigorous}} Lenten fast in 1896, she went to bed on the eve of Good Friday and felt a joyous sensation. She wrote: [...] "Oh! how sweet this memory really is! ... I had scarcely laid my head upon the pillow when I felt something like a bubbling stream mounting to my lips. I didn't know what it was." [...] The next morning her handkerchief was soaked in blood and she understood her fate. Coughing up of blood meant tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meant death. She wrote, [...] "I thought immediately of the joyful thing that I had to learn, so I went over to the <b>window.</b> <b>I</b> was able to see that I was not mistaken. Ah! my soul was filled with a great consolation; I was interiorly persuaded that Jesus, on the anniversary of His own death, wanted to have me hear His first call!" ...|$|E

60|$|Being {{under no}} disgraceful charge, and quite serene and {{harmless}} {{in all his}} ways, they had permitted him freely to wander about the prison, {{and especially in the}} inclosed grass-platted yard thereof.

60|$|Upon the {{opposite}} side of the room was another door, and toward this I led the way. It opened into a third apartment with windows overlooking an inner court.
