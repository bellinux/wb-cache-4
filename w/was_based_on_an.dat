5|$|The Man 1960 {{suspense}} {{episode of}} Startime <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> original Broadway play written by Mel Dinelli. Murphy played a mentally unbalanced stranger who posed {{as a student}} and handyman and terrorized homeowner Thelma Ritter.|$|E
5|$|Alexander H. Smith {{described}} a variety, Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa, in 1965, {{based on a}} collection he made in Kaniksu National Forest (northeastern Washington) in 1964. This variety, known only from the type locality, differs from the nominate variety in its grayish outer peridium and minute scales. Because it <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> invalid genus, it too was invalid; it was later published correctly in 2012 with the full name and authority Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa A.H.Sm. ex J.C.Coetzee & A.E.van Wyk.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent. It also removed the need for a {{declaration}} of neutrality (which would have granted the Nationalists and Republicans control over neutrals in the areas they controlled), and had little legal standing. In Britain, part of the reasoning <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E

5|$|Rain {{prevented}} {{play after}} 3pm {{on the second}} day. No one scored more than 40 as Glamorgan elected to bat and made 197, with the four Australian bowlers, Lindwall, Miller, Johnson and Ring sharing the wickets. The Australians' 215/3 <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> aggressive 84 from Miller, with five sixes and seven fours, and a partnership of 126 with stand-in Hassett, who was 71 not out when the rain came. The attendance on the two days of play totalled 50,000.|$|E
5|$|The M19 {{evolved from}} the 40mm Gun Motor Carriage T65 project, which <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> Armored Force {{requirement}} for a light anti-aircraft vehicle based on the M5 light tank chassis. Although trials were successful and a production of 1,000 T65s had been requested, the project was stopped by the Ordnance Department since the M5A1 light tank chassis was being phased out of production.|$|E
5|$|The concept <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{imaginary}} friend Spielberg created {{after his}} parents' divorce in 1960. In 1980, Spielberg met Mathison {{and developed a}} new story from the stalled sci-fi horror film project Night Skies. It was filmed from September to December 1981 in California on a budget of US$10.5 million. Unlike most films, it was shot in rough chronological order, to facilitate convincing emotional performances from the young cast.|$|E
50|$|The film <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> one-act play {{which in}} turn <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 1933 murder case {{involving}} Dr. Alice Wynekoop.|$|R

5|$|Writer Mike Schur made a cameo {{appearance}} in the episode, appearing in a photograph as Dwight's Amish cousin Mose. The idea for Schur to be Dwight's Amish cousin had been a joke among the writers since the first season. Mose <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> actual participant, with the same name, on the UPN reality show Amish in the City.|$|E
5|$|Written by Barry Letts, the storyline {{for this}} four-part story was {{commissioned}} on 21 January 1975. It <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> audition {{piece for the}} role of Sarah Jane Smith that Letts had written in 1973 and was initially known as Time Lord Story. Scripts were requested, but Hinchcliffe was unhappy with the draft of the first part and ultimately the story was dropped.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{work on the}} Spyro the Dragon series, Insomniac originally intended to launch a game codenamed I5 (Insomniac game #5) for the PlayStation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it, and the idea was dropped after six months. Ratchet & Clank <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final form was decided upon after Insomniac considered a space lizard with a tail and various terrestrial creatures, including dogs and rats; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility. Another early idea {{was to have a}} three small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, Insomniac realized that having the robots was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading them to have only one robot, Clank.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for aerial photography. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and Leslie Martin to work on microwave radar at the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney. Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a cavity magnetron on 23 July 1942. Their magnetron <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia. In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, an outpost of the Radiophysics Laboratory, where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons from prototypes into production models. Eventually, over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the {{decision}} was made, French shipyards were heavily committed to producing vessels for the French Navy. So, despite its intention to develop a French concept, the KSCS engaged Yarrow Shipbuilders in Glasgow, Scotland, to build the ships. Unlike the French, who preferred to install guns of their own manufacture, Yarrow was happy to order the guns from the Czechoslovak firm Škoda. The initial Yarrow design <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> enlarged version of the British Shakespeare class, with five Skoda 14 cm/56 naval guns. Excessive top weight resulted in the deletion {{of one of the}} guns, to be replaced with a seaplane mounting. The final version replaced the seaplane mounting with improved anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
5|$|Before its {{theatrical}} release, {{the producers}} {{tied up with}} several top brands {{to help in the}} marketing the film. An alliance was formed with The Coca-Cola Company by releasing special edition bottles to commemorate the film's release, a first of its kind in Bollywood. Besides this, the music CDs and cassettes were co-branded with the cola company along with the launch of the sale of collectibles from the film. Provogue, a well-known clothing retail chain in India, launched a special limited edition clothing merchandise targeting the youth of India. Besides these, the producers collaborated with LG Group, Berger Paints, Bharti Airtel and Hindustan Petroleum. The producers tied up with several media partners such as MSN India, Channel V and Radio Mirchi to further enhance their marketing efforts. A video game launched by an Indian mobile content company <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> adaptation of the film's plot.|$|E

5|$|Despite the ceasefire {{agreement}} {{signed on}} 22 September between the JNA and Croatia, which {{provided for the}} resumption of supplies to the JNA barracks, the authorities in Bjelovar refused to restore utilities, claiming that the agreement allowed for the supply of JNA officers and soldiers only, {{but there were also}} civilians sheltering in the barracks. On 27 September, the Croatian General Staff directed that the garrison be captured on 28–30 September. Tus, acting as the Chief of the General Staff, ordered the clandestine killing of extremists before they caused mass killing of civilians or great material damage. According to Tus, this order <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> assessment that there were extremist JNA officers present in Bjelovar, intent on carrying out such acts.|$|E
5|$|Digital Devil Saga began {{development}} pre-2002 under the working title New Goddess. The game's concept and original draft {{were written by}} Japanese author Yu Godai, but she withdrew from the project for personal reasons, {{and was replaced by}} Atlus scriptwriter Tadashi Satomi. The gameplay concept of the characters transforming into demons <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> unused idea for Shin Megami Tensei. The second game {{began development}} immediately after the first, with the main development effort going into refining and improving the gameplay. While their commercial performances varied, both games were praised by critics for their story, graphics and gameplay. Since release, the game has inspired a mobile prequel, and Godai wrote a series of novels based on her original premise for the story.|$|E
5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not {{know if it was}} real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E

5|$|In 332BC, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt {{with little}} {{resistance}} from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexander's successors, the Macedonian Ptolemaic Kingdom, <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> Egyptian model and based in the new capital city of Alexandria. The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule, and became a seat of learning and culture, centered at the famous Library of Alexandria. The Lighthouse of Alexandria lit {{the way for the}} many ships that kept trade flowing through the city—as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their top priority.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, NATO {{selected}} {{an international}} consortium led by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) {{to build an}} Integration Test Bed for the Alliance's future Active Layered Theatre Missile Defence (ALTBMD) capability. After two months of negotiations, ALTBMD Programme Manager, General (Ret) Billard, and SAIC contracting Officer, Mr. Robert Larrick, signed the contract {{on the first day}} of NATO's Riga Summit. This decision <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> unpublished report agreed upon earlier by NATO ministers following a study into the feasibility of theatre missile defences.|$|E
5|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Bart exit the Magic Palace's gift shop, only {{to end up in}} another gift shop. The scene <b>was</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{experience}} of the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order to exit the Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, had to pass through a gift shop. The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom scene, but they were stuck {{trying to come up with}} an ending after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided that the trial was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing scene that closed the episode.|$|E
