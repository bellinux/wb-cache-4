5|$|In {{his debut}} fight at the G-Mex Leisure Centre, Manchester, England, Gomez beat {{previously}} undefeated Danny Ruegg on the undercard {{of a bill}} that included Robin Reid and Michael Brodie. Despite this initial win, Gomez's early career <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> with losses to journeyman fighters such as Greg Upton and Chris Williams.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, 31 December, {{fighting}} {{began in}} the thick mango forests near Helashid, 11 miles (18km) to the northwest of Jilib. Ethiopian MiG fighters, tanks, artillery and mortars struck Islamic positions in the assault. Residents reported the road to Jilib <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> with remote-controlled landmines by the ICU. TFG and Ethiopian forces also attacked Bulobaley, with mortars and rockets.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss and Gascon {{infantry}} {{proceeded to}} slaughter the remaining landsknechte—whose tight order precluded a rapid retreat—as {{they attempted to}} withdraw from the battlefield. The road to Ceresole <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> with corpses; the Swiss, in particular, showed no mercy, as they wished to avenge the mistreatment of the Swiss garrison of Mondovì the previous November. Most of the landsknechts' officers were killed; and while contemporary accounts probably exaggerate the numbers of the dead, {{it is clear that the}} German infantry had ceased to exist as a fighting force. Seeing this, Sanseverino decided that the battle was lost and marched away to Asti with the bulk of the Italian infantry and the remnants of Baglioni's Florentine cavalry; the French light cavalry, meanwhile, joined in the pursuit of the landsknechts.|$|E

5|$|Another {{round of}} green flag pit stops {{commenced}} after {{three hours and}} eight minutes with Tréluyer being {{the first of the}} leaders to stop with both Toyota cars following two minutes later. The safety car was deployed when Nakajima's right-front tyre failed on the Wellington straight following contact with a LMGTE car and debris from his Toyota <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> on the track. Nakajima pulled {{over to the side of}} the circuit at Brooklands corner and stopped. Marshals were required to remove the debris from the track. The safety car drove into the pit lane 12 minutes later and racing resumed with Tréluyer remaining in first and Lieb second. Nakajima's car was transported back into his garage for repairs. Dumas turned into Franchitti's Ford and half-spun into the grass at Club corner, losing more than ten seconds to Tréluyer. Dumas was forced wide into the Woodcote corner run-off area by Rao and Rees overtook Franchitti for fifth in LMGTE Pro. After serving an earlier three-minute stop-and-go penalty for changing the car's engine Calado was running in third place in LMGTE Pro while Buemi drove the No. 5 Toyota back onto the circuit after his car was repaired. Tréluyer made a pit stop for fuel and tyres with Fässler taking over the No. 7 car. Fässler was followed by Lieb making a pit stop from the lead and handed driving duties to Jani. Fässler thus retook the lead with a nine-second advantage.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} soon devolved into man-on-man combat; Seydlitz himself fought like a trooper, {{receiving a}} severe wound. He ordered his last 18 squadrons, still {{waiting at the}} Janus, into the fray. The second charge struck the French cavalry at an oblique angle. The mêlée drifted rapidly southward, past the Allied infantry. Part of the Allied reserve, which had become entangled between the main columns, was extricating itself by degrees and endeavoring {{to catch up with}} the rest of the reserve column away to the right, but the sweep of horses and Allied infantry pulled them into the fighting. The Allied reserve artillery proved useless; caught in the middle of the infantry columns, it could not deploy to support any of the endangered Allied troops. The Prussian infantry on the Shartau hill waited in echelon from the left. Those Allied units who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into a hail of musket fire from Prince Henry's infantry. Attempted French counterattacks dissolved into confusion. Most of the Allied cavalry units in front were smashed by the initial charge and many of them trampled over their own men trying to flee. The field <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> with riderless horses and horseless men, wounded, dying and dead. This part of the action took about 30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|With vastly {{superior}} numbers the Chinese {{had attacked}} {{on a broad}} front, and had initially overrun {{a number of the}} forward UN positions. Regardless, the 27th Brigade had ultimately prevailed despite being outnumbered by a factor of five to one. Indeed, despite their numerical advantage the Chinese had been badly outgunned and they could not overcome the well-trained and well-armed Australians and Canadians. The battlefield <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> with the corpses of Chinese soldiers, a testament to the discipline and firepower of the defenders. And yet, despite their ultimate defeat, the battle once again demonstrated that the Chinese were tough and skillful soldiers capable of inflicting heavy casualties on the Australians and forcing their eventual withdrawal, albeit both intact and orderly. As a result of the fighting Australian losses were 32 killed, 59 wounded and three captured, while Canadian casualties included 10 killed and 23 wounded. American casualties included three men killed, 12 wounded and two tanks destroyed, all from A Company, 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion. The New Zealanders lost two killed and five wounded. In contrast, Chinese losses were far heavier, and may have included 1,000 killed and many more wounded. The Canadians were finally relieved on Hill 677 by a battalion of the 5th US Cavalry Regiment on the evening 26 April.|$|E

5|$|At {{first light}} {{the next morning}} Australian {{clearing}} patrols located 89 dead and 11 wounded Viet Cong {{in front of their}} positions. The bulk of the casualties had been inflicted by the Americans, but it was later determined that at least 17 Viet Cong had been killed by 1 RAR. Others had been disintegrated by artillery and tank fire and the battlefield <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> with shattered human remains, including severed limbs and chunks of flesh, while red pulp covered the rubber trees that were still standing. Later, 154 bodies were bulldozed into a B-52 bomb crater nearby, while it was estimated that a further 200 Viet Cong casualties had been removed from the battlefield. Fifteen Viet Cong had also been captured during the battle, as had a large quantity of equipment, including small arms and ammunition, crew-served weapons and grenades. The villagers of Ap Bo were again used by the Viet Cong to carry many of the dead and wounded from the battlefield with ox carts, and they also suffered a number of casualties from artillery and mortar fire landing in the area. In contrast, American casualties were limited, consisting of 11 killed and 72 wounded. Australian casualties were lighter still, with just two men wounded. One American tank had also been destroyed, while two tanks and four armoured personnel carriers were damaged. Overall, the commander of the combined US-Australian force believed that they had won an impressive victory, but his troops were exhausted and with ammunition running low, Glotzbach decided not to pursue the withdrawing force. Instead, the Americans and Australians focused on securing the battlefield and evacuating their own casualties.|$|E

25|$|The {{activity}} {{dates to}} post-World War II Europe when, after the conflict, numerous aircraft wrecks studded the countryside.

Members of the public who found aircraft sites, especially farmers who could dig them up, could profit off the sale of the scrap metal.|$|E

25|$|The city of Plymouth was {{hit hard}} during the Second World War {{due to its}} {{strength}} as a military base: HMNB Devonport was the largest naval base in Western Europe. As the ground {{was so close to}} the city centre and Plymouth Sound, it was unlikely that it would escape unharmed. The Football League was abandoned three games into the 1939–40 season, but Home Park continued to host matches until summer 1940 in the hastily organised South West Regional League. In April 1941 there was a series of Luftwaffe bombing raids on the city, known as the Plymouth Blitz; Home Park did not escape. The Grandstand was all but destroyed after sustaining multiple hits and the pitch <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> with impact craters, which left the club facing a major rebuilding operation when the war ended in 1945.|$|E
25|$|In June 1435, {{family members}} {{gathered}} {{to put a}} curb on Gilles. They appealed to Pope Eugene IV to disavow the Chapel of the Holy Innocents (which he refused to do) and carried their concerns to the king. On 2July 1435, a royal edict was proclaimed in Orléans, Tours, Angers, Pouzauges and Champtocé-sur-Loire denouncing Gilles as a spendthrift and forbidding him from selling any further property. No subject of Charles VII was allowed to enter into any contract with him, and those in command of his castles were forbidden to dispose of them. Gilles' credit fell immediately and his creditors pressed upon him. He borrowed heavily, using his objets d'art, manuscripts, books and clothing as security. When he left Orléans in late August or early September 1435, the town <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> with precious objects {{he was forced to}} leave behind. The edict did not apply to Brittany, and the family was unable to persuade the Duchy of Brittany to enforce it.|$|E
25|$|The {{short history}} of the event, however, <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> with controversies. The 2002 United States Grand Prix was marred by a bizarre ending, in which Michael Schumacher, having already {{clinched}} the championship, seemingly tried to stage a dead heat with teammate Rubens Barrichello. The official timings showed Barrichello ahead by 0.011 seconds at the line, leading fans and media to dub the event a farce. The 2002 race {{was also the first}} ever Formula One race to use SAFER barriers. The 2005 race {{turned out to be one}} of the most controversial races in motorsport history. Michelin realized their tires were ill-equipped for the banking, and at the last second, the Michelin teams pulled into the pits at the end of the formation lap, leaving only the three Bridgestone teams (six cars) to contest the race. Fans and media were highly critical of the poor handling of the situation. Many fans walked out, and costly ticket refunds were issued.|$|E

25|$|By early May, the Bouamlong fortifications had {{deteriorated}} into a military slum. The ADC militia, being home guards, had their families there with them. In total, there were almost 6,000 Hmong crowded onto the valley floor. The area <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> with castoff parachutes {{and other military}} debris. The stink of rotting Vietnamese corpses permeated the atmosphere. An improvised Royal Lao Army (RLA) battalion of 435 soldiers, composed of units plucked from other battalions, was airlifted into this. Four days later, 116 of its troopers quit and were evacuated. On 24 May, Bataillon Commando 205 (BC 205) was choppered in to replace the makeshift battalion; on the return trips, the departing troops were flown out. On 29 May, the newcomers moved out toward Phou Then. Air strikes by Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) T-28s and U.S. Air Force A-1s cleared their way in daylight. At night, AC-47 gunships provided defensive fire. A freshly arrived 105mm howitzer lent additional fire support. By 18 June, the outpost had been retaken, and the drive ended.|$|E
25|$|Feeling qualms of guilt, {{they went}} to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city telling them what they had seen, and the porters told the king's {{household}} within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that he suspected that the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, {{they would be able}} to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and go see, and they took two chariots with horses to go and see. They went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. So the people went out and looted Arameans' camp, so that the price of fine flour and two measures of barley each dropped to a shekel, as God had said it would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said.|$|E
25|$|Game Five old Munster rivals meet in Limerick, The Cork Admirals @ U.L Vikings {{is always}} a game Coach O' Sullivan has pencilled in his diary. Despite a dismal season {{last year for the}} Cork team they had bounced back this season rejuvenated, {{recording}} impressive victories, including a 26-0 win over the Rhino's, second seed in the north. The Vikings went to work on Cork scoring 34 points in the first half, a ten-yard rushing touch down by 2008 and 2009 shamrock bowl M.V.P Adrian Garvey and a spectacular 45 yard touch down pass by the Marc Ashworth / Sean Goldrick unit. The Admirals just could not get the ball moving especially not with the intense pressure coming from the Viking front 4, made up of Alan O' Carroll, Glen Carr, Kieran Coen and this year's d-line addition Ian Cahill who has fitted in comfortably with the three league veterans. Other scores included a 6-yard toss form Ashworth to Curtin and on Craig Switzers first ever offensive play he scored a 75-yard touchdown sweep on his rivals. The second half of the game was a struggle for both teams as it <b>was</b> <b>littered</b> with flags due to the Vikings indiscipline and a defensive stand from the Admirals they were able to control the Vikings and keep them scoreless in the second half, making the second half finish the same as the first 34-0, pushing the Vikings 5-0 record.|$|E
