According to legend, in order to become a god, Empedocles threw himself into a volcano in Mount Etna. As such, Empedocles is often associated <b>with</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E

5|$|Between 1990 and 2011, when Apocalypse {{was known}} as Iron Wolf, there was no theme for the roller coaster. After its {{relocation}} to Six Flags America, to match the new name of the coaster, an {{end of the world}} apocalypse theme was added <b>with</b> <b>fire,</b> crashed planes and zombies located in the queue line and along the layout of the roller coaster. As guests go further in the queue line to the end at the station, it mimics an end of the world apocalypse scenario. The skull from Skull Mountain also serves as a backdrop to the ride.|$|E
5|$|BuroHappold {{has also}} {{completed}} {{the designs of}} a number of cardboard structures, notably the Japan Pavilion for Expo 2000 in Hanover with Shigeru Ban and Frei Otto, consisting of a gridshell of paper tubes (the structure was reinforced with steel in order to comply <b>with</b> <b>fire</b> regulations, though the tubular structure was itself structurally sufficient). The firm has worked with Shigeru Ban on a number of other projects. Another design in cardboard was the Westborough School cardboard classroom in Westcliff.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies have {{appeared}} in art from 3500 years ago in ancient Egypt. In the ancient Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan, the brilliantly coloured image of the butterfly was carved into many temples, buildings, jewellery, and emblazoned on incense burners. The butterfly was sometimes depicted with the maw of a jaguar, and some species {{were considered to be}} the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors. The close association of butterflies <b>with</b> <b>fire</b> and warfare persisted into the Aztec civilisation; evidence of similar jaguar-butterfly images has been found among the Zapotec and Maya civilisations.|$|E

5|$|Maintaining a close line of battle, Hoste forced Dubourdieu {{to attack}} him directly, Dubourdieu {{attempting}} to personally board Hoste's Amphion {{at the head}} of the Italian soldiers carried aboard his flagship. Hoste responded to the attempt <b>with</b> <b>fire</b> at point blank range from a carronade containing over 750 musket balls. The first shot killed Dubourdieu and almost all of his officers, creating confusion in the French squadron that resulted in Favorite being wrecked on Lissa's coastline. Hoste then engaged the following Flore and Bellone, forcing them both to surrender. The head of the British line, led by the HMS Volage engaged the three remaining French and Italian ships, driving off Danaé and Carolina and capturing Corona. Flore too later escaped to the safety of French batteries off Lesina.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February, {{she left}} the port for a short voyage to Guacanayabo Bay, Cuba, and was back in Hampton Roads by 19 March. Michigan began a third cruise to Mexico on 16 April to support the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz. She reached the city on 22 April and landed a battalion of Marines {{as part of the}} occupation force. The ship then patrolled the coast before departing for the United States on 20 June. She reached the Delaware Capes six days later. The normal peacetime routine of cruises off the east coast continued for the next three years. In December 1914, the ship's crew experimented <b>with</b> <b>fire</b> control directors to aid in gunlaying; the experimental directors produced significantly improved results in gunnery tests conducted in early 1915. In 1916, one of her forward 12-inch guns exploded during gunnery training.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 1999, the {{spotlights}} {{surrounding the}} Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure. Several residents called police and sprayed the flames <b>with</b> <b>fire</b> extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit the candle from top to bottom and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
