5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a Mediterranean climate. In the <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather {{very similar to the}} <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> in this regard.|$|E

5|$|During {{a tumultuous}} pioneer period {{characterized}} by its centrality in {{proximity to the}} <b>Western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> transportation in Omaha demanded the construction of massive warehouses where frontier settlers could stock up and communities west of Omaha got food and supplies to build themselves with.

Early Omaha also landed the Union Pacific Railroad headquarters, leading to its important place in national railroad lore.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding {{on the dead}} young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle.

5|$|Mount Bailey {{is part of}} the High Cascades in the <b>western</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> The High Cascades {{have long}} been glaciated, by both Pacific-bred storms and natural, elevation-caused, {{glaciation}}. In fact, glaciation probably formed on them as early as the late Miocene. Over time, as the range built up, newer activity diminished older Tertiary age rock. Creating lava plateaus, Pliocene activity, mostly basaltic and andesitic, was probably responsible for the original cones at Bailey, Thielsen, and Union Peak.|$|E
