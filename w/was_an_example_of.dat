5|$|He criticised the {{hypocrisy}} of chastity for women and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. In his view it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E
5|$|In 1798, {{the revolutionary}} French {{government}} conquered Switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution. This centralised {{the government of}} the country, effectively abolishing the cantons: moreover, Mülhausen joined France and Valtellina valley, the Cisalpine Republic, separating from Switzerland. The new regime, known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. It had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French satellite state. The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the oppressive presence of the French Army and the local population's resistance to the occupation.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} {{of resistance to}} batrachotoxins {{and the use of}} those toxins as chemical defences by several bird families have led to competing theories as to its evolutionary history.

Bormann travelled everywhere with Hitler, including trips to Austria in 1938 after the Anschluss (the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany), and to the Sudetenland after {{the signing of the}} Munich Agreement later that year.

5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that the government may be trying to hide. Maralinga <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E
5|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Hamilton said it {{had been}} a tough race for him because his car did not feel as good as he hoped. He had also hoped the gap would be closer than it was in qualifying. Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was looking forward to the next race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and look forward to the next few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E
5|$|Saturn's usually bland {{atmosphere}} occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals {{and other}} features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the Voyager encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a Great White Spot, a unique but short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, {{around the time of}} the northern hemisphere's summer solstice. Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the most famous. If the periodicity is maintained, another storm will occur in about 2020.|$|E

5|$|Thomas enjoyed Fabian's {{performance}} in the episode, arguing that it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the actor's scene stealer quality that led Thomas to initially cast him after his appearance in an episode of his earlier series Cupid. The scene in which Keith boards the ship on which Hank is located was difficult to film because there were limited daylight filming hours. The crew {{thought it was important}} for the audience to see the waves and the ocean. However, they were unable to finish filming the scene within the course of one day, so the crew made a quick decision to place a makeshift blue screen as part of the background for the interior of the boat. It was intended that the blue screen be edited in post-production in order to represent the ocean, but upon learning that this change would cost millions of dollars, the crew decided to forgo the alteration and instead pass off the blue screen as a tarpaulin.|$|E
