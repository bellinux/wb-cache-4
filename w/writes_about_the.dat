5|$|More recently, Maurice Friedman <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> book in {{the context}} of the various {{attempts}} to find a universal essence - or perennial philosophy - within religion. He finds that Time and Eternity is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by Aldous Huxley or Ananda Coomaraswamy, but no more successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is the notion that there is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.|$|E

5|$|In 1209, the Jain scholar, minister, {{builder of}} temples and army {{commander}} Janna wrote, among other classics, Yashodhara Charite, a {{unique set of}} stories in 310verses dealing with sadomasochism, transmigration of the soul, passion gone awry and cautionary morals for human conduct. The writing, although inspired by Vadiraja's Sanskrit classic of the same name, is noted for its original interpretation, imagery and style. In one story, the poet tells of the infatuation of a man for his friend's wife. Having killed his friend, the man abducts the wife, who dies of grief. Overcome by repentance, he burns himself on the funeral pyre of the woman. The stories of infatuation reach a peak when Janna <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> attraction of Amrutamati, the queen, to the ugly mahout Ashtavakra, who pleases the queen with kicks and whip lashes. This story has piqued the interest of modern researchers. In honour of this work, Janna received the title Kavichakravarthi ("Emperor among poets") from his patron, King Veera BallalaII. His other classic, Anathanatha Purana (1230), is an account {{of the life of the}} 14thtirthankar Ananthanatha.|$|E

25|$|Abid Rogers Bhatti in {{his book}} A Textbook of Soteriology <b>writes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> meaning of metanoia/μετάνοια.
