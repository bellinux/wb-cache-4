40|$|In Shakespeare’s Henry VI, Part II, a pretender to {{the throne}} {{outlines}} the Utopia that will come when his unruly mob helps make him king. The unruliest of them all, Dick the Butcher, leers in an aside to the audience, “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers. ” Wherever and whenever it is staged around the world, Dick always brings the house down. Steven Spielberg uses much the same technique in the movie Jurassic Park, when the venal lawyer is eaten by the T rex while on the toilet. Guffaws all round. Now I’m not here to naysay lawyer jokes. Keep ’em coming, I say. I am just here to alert you to the reflex the former NSW premier Bob Carr is hitting when he calls any attempt to legally protect human rights {{in a piece of}} legislation as leading to a “lawyer’s picnic. ” Bob Carr argues that codifying rights in any way will lead to a frenzy of litigation which will only benefit those bloodsucking parasitic lawyers, and so has opposed attempts to introduce a human rights charter in New South Wales. (Victoria and the ACT now have human rights legislation and Tasmania is set to follow.) Carr repeats this argument regularly now in relation to proposals to protect human rights at the federal level. (Just try Googling “Bob Carr” and “lawyers. ” You can add “Senator Brandis” and “Archbishop Pell” for further highlights and colourful invective on this theme.) I’m betting that when Carr invokes lawyers while talking about human rights he wants you to think of lawyers from big glass offices overlooking the harbour in fancy suits, chowing down on salmon nibbly bits in a marquee. Presumably he is not referring to a human rights lawyer’s picnic, which usually features hummus, a bit of John Butler on the radio and lots of hugging. I promise you these affairs are in no way to be feared. (At least not as much as a hypothetical picnic with Carr, Pell and Brandis.) The other useful tactic is to invoke the ever-present danger of activist judges, as Janet Albrechtsen often does {{in the pages of the}} Australian (“Rights charter is from 2009 BC”, 14 January). Everyone knows judges are a bunch of free-loving social-reforming radicals just itching to get their mitts on some raw unchecked power that rightfully belongs to those saintly pollies. This time Janet manages to make a lively association between activist judges in Canada, the Australian human rights consultation and polygamy. (I am often left wondering which judges Ms Albrechtson is meeting and whether I can go to one of their picnics.) Janet was roused to action because federal attorney-general Robert McClelland has announced a national consultation on the protection of human rights and responsibilities, headed by Father Frank Brennan, to report in June. The fur, in other words, folks, is about to fly. The “lawyer’s picnic” and the “power-mad judge” mantras are about to be invoked. My point is that the opportunity of the consultation is more important than any of the messengers you are going to hear from in the papers. Carr is correct, in a way. Human rights protection is not, and should not be, about lawyers. It is not even about premiers or archbishops. The whole point of the exercise should be making sure that bad stuff does not happen to people in the first place. Human rights at their core are about the conversations citizens could have with their government about the ways power should be used against individuals, and what obligations citizens should have towards others in their communities. In my experience, Australians often think three things when they hear the words “human rights,” based on stereotypes and the odd news story: 1. “Human rights are about what happens to terrorists and boat people or foreigners generally, not about me. ” 2. “Bad human rights stuff only happens overseas, not here. ” 3. “Human rights are about big public issues like the death penalty or stoning or coups. Somewhere overseas (see point 2). To foreigners (see point 1). It doesn’t affect my everyday life and my family. ” Human rights are involved in these big international issues, and touch on many fault lines in society about race, religion and politics. But where countries have enacted human rights legislation, such as in Britain, it is ordinary folk engaged in everyday activities involving government services that have often reaped the benefits. Meet Beryll Driscoll. Beryll and Richard Driscoll, now in their 90 s, married in 1940. Mr Driscoll did war service in Burma, and when he came back they were always together. When Mr Driscoll became ill and went to live in an aged-care facility, Beryll wanted to join him. Gloucestershire social services stopped her. The Driscoll family launched a campaign to reunite their parents. Using the UK Human Rights Act they managed to persuade the council to reverse its decision and offer Mrs Driscoll a subsidised place in the same home as her husband. Human rights can be about the way your government treats you, every day. Do you feel like a person with dignity treated with respect when you go to Centrelink? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> your parents went into an aged care home? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> you go? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> you are a public patient in a NSW hospital? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> your teenage son gets arrested for being at a protest or a nightclub that is raided? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> the bank lends you too much money and then you can’t repay? What about your access to medical treatment for cancer when you live out on a farm, hours from the nearest town? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> the government closes your local school? Or sets up a power plant next door? Or both? Often, human rights protections provide no solutions for any of these things, but they offer counter-arguments and a point of view based on the dignity of the individual. The impact on an individual or family is usually the first thing that gets lost when governments face hard decisions, especially about resources. Think of the movie The Castle. What can one family do when the weight of the state is pressing down on them? Other than make friends with a barrister who miraculously offers to represent you in the High Court for free, that is? Whatever you think about human rights, there is a rare opportunity in the national consultation to have your say. Use ’em or lose ’em. When the government is passing legislation or considering big policy decisions it needs a tool where it is reminded to think of people as individuals about to be affected by that law or decision. Let’s build a system where we don’t need the lawyers. They are always off picnicking anyway. • Susan Harris Rimmer is a researcher at the Australian National University, president of Australian Lawyers for Human Rights and a member of the Australian Human Rights Group.

Applying this formalization to the hints suggested by HLint allows us to certify them formally. In pure functional languages such as Haskell, equational reasoning is a valuable tool for refactoring, to improve both efficiency and aesthetics. For example, an experienced programmer would replace reverse ". txt " `isPrefixOf ` reverse filename with the more readable (and more efficient) ". txt " `isSuffixOf ` filename. In this paper we call such a replacement a rewrite. We only want to apply rewrites that are valid and thus some natural questions arise: Is the original expression equivalent to the replaced expression? With a language like Haskell, this entails the question: <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> infinite or undefined values are involved? To highlight some of the issues, consider another example.

I would like to use this opportunity to raise certain issues about this very new category introduced this year to ifva. First of all, what do we mean by "interactive" media?

A flow chart {{is just one of}} the many ways to visualize an algorithm or code, the purpose of which is to provide better “conceptual understanding” [Chan and Naps, 1999] as opposed to simply viewing the algorithm on paper. This is especially true as the complexity increases; visualization becomes a powerful tool to get a global sense of what’s occurring. This can be seen with the widespread use of such visualization standards such as UML, IDEF 1 X, flow charts, control flow diagrams and dataflow diagrams in all parts of the design process. Things proceed quite intuitively within the world of sequential algorithms and their visualizations. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> the flow of control is not linear, as in parallel algorithms?

40|$|Despite a {{prevailing}} assumption in {{the developmental}} literature {{that changes in}} continuous quantities (i. e., surface area, duration) are easier to detect than changes in number, very little {{research has focused on}} the verity of this assumption. The few studies that have directly examined infants’ discriminations of continuous extent have revealed that infants discriminate the duration of a single event and the area of a single item with similar levels of precision (Brannon et al., 2006; vanMarle and Wynn, 2006). But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> items are presented in arrays? Infants appear to be much worse at representing the cumulative surface area compared to the numerosity of an array (Cordes and Brannon, 2008 a), however {{this may be due to}} a noisy accumulation process and not a general finding pertaining to representations of the extent within an array. The current study investigates how well infants detect changes in the size of individual elements when they are presented within an array. Our results indicate that infants are less sensitive to continuous properties of items when they are presented within a set than when presented in isolation. Specifically we demonstrate that infants required a fourfold change in item size to detect a change when items were presented within a set of homogeneous elements. Rather than providing redundant cues that aided discrimination, presenting a set of identical elements appeared to hamper an infant's ability to detect changes in a single element's size. In addition to providing some of the first evidence to suggest that the presence of multiple items may hinder extent representations, these results provide converging lines of evidence to support the claim that, contrary to popular belief, infants are better at tracking number than continuous properties of a set...|$|E

The practice of making “payments for ecosystem services” (PES) is about the formation of new social relations between land managers and the human beneficiaries of functioning ecological systems. More specifically, it is about establishing economic relations that (theoretically) transfer financial resources from “users” of services to “producers” who institute prescribed land management practices. Interpreted {{as a form of}} “neoliberal conservation”, this approach to environmental governance {{can be seen as a}} driving force in the commodification, marketization, and financialization of nature. Hinging on “clearly defined and enforced” property rights, it can also be seen as a factor in the expansion of individualized private ownership. Troubled by this renewed prospect of privatization, critical scholars have done well to challenge the new enclosures of land and resources. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>when</b> PES operates in areas where private ownership rights are robust and widespread? Are we to believe that the tendency towards privatization poses no threat because those areas are already “lost” to private ownership? This paper considers how the social relationships that constitute property are shifting under the prescribed management practices of PES. I present evidence from Costa Rica’s national PES program to suggest that, even on lands that are ostensibly already privately owned, these new practices are resulting in an expansion of exclusionary management. The objective is to demonstrate some of the reasons why financialized approaches to conservation are a problem in “already neoliberal” economies and to offer some conceptual tools for challenging the uncritical assumption that PES is harmless in areas where private ownership is already well established.
