Although it is possible that rats from different litters can be integrated together, the integration process can be easy or hard. Several measures have to be taken to provide security for both rats.|$|E

5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both putative parents are found, {{is regarded as}} a hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii. Leaves are mostly triangular like those of A.cuneatus, but whereas A.cuneatus leaves are mostly five-lobed, the putative hybrid usually has three lobes, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> leaf being entire like those of A.dobsonii (though A.cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of A.dobsonii. Flower colour is like that of A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E

5|$|Gender roles, {{especially}} {{the figure of}} the ideal woman, are central to La Cousine Bette. The four leading female characters (Bette, Valérie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. Each pair of women revolves around a man, and they compete for his attention: Valérie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; Bette and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac's study of masculinity is limited to the insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> appearance of Victorin as a sturdy patriarch in his father's absence.|$|E
5|$|The plain maskray {{generally}} hunts at {{the surface}} of the bottom substrate, rather than digging for prey. Its diet consists predominantly of caridean shrimp and polychaete worms. Small bony fishes are also eaten, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> penaeid prawn or amphipod. Larger rays consume a greater variety of prey and relatively more polychaete worms when compared to smaller rays. This species is parasitized by the tapeworm Acanthobothrium jonesi.|$|E
5|$|The series follows two half-brothers, Wirt and Greg (voiced by Elijah Wood and Collin Dean respectively), {{who become}} {{lost in a}} strange forest called the Unknown. In order {{to find their way}} home, the two must travel across the {{seemingly}} supernatural forest <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> help of the wandering, mysterious and elderly Woodsman (Christopher Lloyd) and Beatrice (Melanie Lynskey), an irritable bluebird who travels with the boys in order to find a woman called Adelaide, who can supposedly undo the curse on Beatrice and her family and show the half-brothers the way home.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the history}} of Stravinsky's {{compositional}} style, the Epitaphium is important as the first work in which he ordered the harmony serially throughout.

5|$|By contrast, the {{remainder}} of Europe saw stone towers being used in castles, {{but not in a}} way that fulfilled the range of functions seen in the western European keeps. In the Low Countries, it became popular for the local nobility to build stand-alone, square towers, but rarely as part of a wider castle. Similarly, square stone towers became popular in Venice, but these did not fulfil the same role as western keeps. In Germany, rectangular stone castles began to replace motte-and-bailey castles from the 12th century onwards. These designs included stone versions of the traditional Bergfriede, which still remained distinct from the domestic keeps used in more western parts of Europe, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> notable exception, such as the large, residential Bergfried at Eltville Castle.|$|E
5|$|After Stephen's death, Henry II succeeded to {{the throne}} of England. Henry vigorously re-established royal {{authority}} {{in the aftermath of}} the civil war, dismantling castles and increasing revenues, although several of these trends had begun under Stephen. The destruction of castles under Henry was not as dramatic as once thought, and although he restored royal revenues, the economy of England remained broadly unchanged under both rulers. Stephen's remaining son William I of Blois was confirmed as the Earl of Surrey by Henry, and prospered under the new regime, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> point of tension with Henry. Stephen's daughter Marie I of Boulogne also survived her father; she had been placed in a convent by Stephen, but after his death she left and married. Stephen's middle son, Baldwin, and second daughter, Matilda, had died before 1147 and were buried at Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate. Stephen probably had three illegitimate sons, Gervase, Ralph and Americ, by his mistress Damette; Gervase became Abbot of Westminster in 1138, but after his father's death Gervase was removed by Henry in 1157 and died shortly afterwards.|$|E

Little is known of the latter two (both teachers of Latin), but Alexander was a major littérateur, the leading Homeric scholar of his day. Marcus thanks Alexander for his training in literary styling. Alexander's influence—an emphasis on matter over style, on careful wording, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> Homeric quotation—has been detected in Marcus' Meditations.|$|E
