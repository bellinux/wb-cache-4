[...] National Law 1334 of 1992 establishes {{the domain of}} origin (DO) classification for singani and the geographical indication (GI), listing specific zones of production. [...] Supreme Decree 24777 (1997) establishes general controls over the DO and prohibited practices. [...] Supreme Decree 25569 (1999) establishes the “Certificate of Origin” that accompanies singani, determines the 1,600 meter (5,250 feet) elevation above sea level minimum for altitude wine, and refers to the promotion of altitude singani and wines. Supreme Decree 27113 (2003) describes international enforcement of intellectual property, including the DO and the GI for singani.

40|$|Product {{bundling}} is {{a widespread}} marketing strategy (Stremersch & Tellis, 2002; Yadav, 1994; Yadav & Monroe, 1993). Part of the attraction of a bundle is that the price {{is less than the}} sum of the prices for each of the products in the bundle. The strategy has been most recently used by large retailers in Australia, particularly liquor retailers who often bundle wine with other liquor products. However, there exists a paucity of research into consumer behaviour regarding <b>wine</b> <b>product</b> bundles. Hierarchical segmentation analysis via K-Mean cluster analysis was used to examine the nature of consumers’ perceptions of <b>wine</b> <b>product</b> bundles and commonalities among those consumers.

A tourism product club is a product development partnership established and led by the tourism industry stakeholders including small- and/or medium-sized companies. The group pools its resources to develop new marketready products or to increase the value of existing ones. Lodging companies, tour operators, administrators of tourism facilities, tourist associations, government, other companies of the sector and, even, nontourist companies can participate as members of a tourism product club. Following this model, wine tourism can contribute to create a <b>wine</b> tourism <b>product</b> club. In Spain the international promotion of tourist products is carried out through the Turespa&ntilde;a website. The <b>wine</b> tourism <b>product</b> club, The <b>Wine</b> Routes of Spain, is one of the <b>wine</b> tourism <b>product</b> clubs developed by the Spanish government. It is an ambitious project that began in 2001. Nevertheless, other Spanish regions have created more <b>wine</b> tourism <b>product</b> clubs in order to develop their own wine tourism industry such as &ldquo;Divinum vitae &ndash; Where the pleasues are born&rdquo; created in Castilla&ndash;La Mancha in 2006.

The ISWN was allocated by the ISWN Organization {{on the basis of}} a global reference database of wine producers and wines worldwide. The database was improved through wine producers updating their own data with the ISWN Manager module. The ISWN Organization was a Non-profit organization sponsored by the wine industry.|$|R
