On average, 54 % of the households are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for improved water quality. It is therefore apparent that Chobe Ward, Maun residents in general regard water as an economic good as they are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for its provision. Those with a higher income were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for an improved water quality and reliability of supply. This finding corroborates the environmental economic theory which assumes that the demand for an improved environmental quality increases with income. The older the person the more they are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for improved water quality and reliability. Larger families are not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for an improved provision of water services. Also, educated people are lesser <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for improved water quality and reliability...|$|R
