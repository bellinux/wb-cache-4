Coleridge had yet to join the siblings in Germany, and Wordsworth's separation from his friend depressed him. In the three months following their parting, Wordsworth completed the first three of the [...] "Lucy poems": [...] "Strange fits", [...] "She dwelt", and [...] "A slumber". They first appeared in a letter to Coleridge dated December 1798, in which Wordsworth wrote that [...] "She dwelt" [...] and [...] "Strange fits" [...] were [...] "little Rhyme poems <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> will amuse you". Wordsworth characterised the two poems thus to mitigate any disappointment Coleridge might suffer in receiving these two poems instead of the promised three-part philosophical epic The Recluse.|$|E

Guthrie told Frost [...] "e didn't {{want to have to}} assault, because it's a very difficult operation, there are big risks in it but we have done it [...] because our negotiations were getting nowhere.

2500|$|Although Franklin's {{parents had}} {{intended}} {{for him to}} have a career in the Church, Franklin as a young man adopted the Enlightenment religious belief in deism, that God's truths can be found entirely through nature and reason. [...] "I soon became a thorough Deist." [...] As a young man he rejected Christian dogma in a 1725 pamphlet A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain, which he later saw as an embarrassment, while simultaneously asserting that God is [...] "all wise, all good, all powerful." [...] He defended his rejection of religious dogma with these words: [...] "I think opinions should be judged by their influences and effects; and if a man holds none that tend to make him less virtuous or more vicious, it may be concluded that he holds none that are dangerous, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> is the case with me." [...] After the disillusioning experience of seeing the decay in his own moral standards, and those of two friends in London whom he had converted to Deism, Franklin turned back to a belief in the importance of organized religion, on the pragmatic grounds that without God and organized churches, man will not be good. Moreover, because of his proposal that prayers be said in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, many have contended that in his later life Franklin became a pious Christian.|$|E

2500|$|The 1920s {{contained}} {{analysis of}} the poem that emphasised the poem's power. In Road to Xanadu (1927), a book length study of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and [...] "Kubla Khan", John Livingston Lowes claimed that the poems were [...] "two {{of the most remarkable}} poems in English". When turning to the background of the works, he argued, [...] "Coleridge as Coleridge, be it said at once, is a secondary moment to our purpose; it is the significant process, not the man, which constitutes our theme. But the amazing modus operandi of his genius, in the fresh light <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> I have to offer, becomes the very abstract and brief chronicle of the procedure of the creative faculty itself." [...] After breaking down the various aspects of the poem, Lowes stated, [...] "with a picture of unimpaired and thrilling vividness, the fragment ends. And with it ends, for all save Coleridge, the dream. 'The earth hath bubbles as the water has, and this is of them.' For 'Kubla Khan' is as near enchantment, I suppose, as we are like to come in this dull world. And over it is cast the glamour, enhanced beyond all reckoning in the dream, of the remote in time and space – that visionary presence of a vague and gorgeous and mysterious Past which brooded, as Coleridge read, above the inscrutable Nile, and domed pavilions in Cashmere, and the vanished stateliness of Xanadu." [...] He continued by describing the power of the poem: [...] "For none of the things which we have seen – dome, river, chasm, fountain, caves of ice, or floating hair – nor any combination of them holds the secret key to that sense of an incommunicable witchery which pervades the poem. That is something more impalpable by far, into which entered who can tell what tracelesss, shadowy recollections ... The poem is steeped in the wonder of all Coleridge's enchanted voyagings." [...] Lowes then concluded about the two works: [...] "Not even in the magical four and fifty lines of 'Kubla Khan' is sheer visualizing energy so intensely exercised as in 'The Ancient Mariner.' But every crystal-clear picture there, {{is an integral part of}} a preconceived and consciously elaborated whole ... In 'Kubla Khan' the linked and interweaving images irresponsibly and gloriously stream, like the pulsing, fluctuating banners of the North. And their pageant is as aimless as it is magnificent ... There is, then ... one glory of 'Kubla Khan' and another glory of 'The Ancient Mariner,' as one star differeth from another star in glory." [...] George Watson, in 1966, claimed that Lowes's {{analysis of the}} poems [...] "will stand as a permanent monument to historical criticism." [...] Also in 1966, Kenneth Burke, declared, [...] "Count me among those who would view this poem both as a marvel, and as 'in principle' finished" ...|$|E
