Jenner recounts having permission to explore her gender identity on her own travels but not when they were coupled, and that not knowing the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the many issues contributed to the deterioration of the 23-year-long marriage, which ended formally in 2015.|$|E

PBS also decries images of Africa in the media, which they view as one-sided. They state: [...] "We want to show the positivity in the black soul. That's our fight. Africa is not only a land of suffering, misery, war and disease. We're proud to live there and we are not suffering." [...] They view their chosen medium of rap as an accessible <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about issues such as corruption and politics.

2500|$|In {{applications}} to linear algebra, the exterior product provides an abstract algebraic manner for describing the determinant and the minors of a matrix. [...] For instance, {{it is well}} known that the magnitude of the determinant of a square matrix is equal to the volume of the parallelotope whose sides are the columns of the matrix. [...] This suggests that the determinant can be defined in terms of the exterior product of the column vectors. [...] Likewise, the [...] minors of a matrix can be defined by looking at the exterior products of column vectors chosen k at a time. [...] These ideas can be extended not just to matrices but to linear transformations as well: the magnitude of the determinant of a linear transformation is the factor by which it scales the volume of any given reference parallelotope. [...] So the determinant of a linear transformation can be defined in terms of what the transformation does to the top exterior power. [...] The action of a transformation on the lesser exterior powers gives a basis-independent <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the minors of the transformation.|$|E

2500|$|Karen Silkwood {{died in a}} car {{accident}} on November 13, 1974, while on her <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with a Times reporter about the safety violations at the Crescent plant. [...] Alerted to suspicious aspects of the accident, Mazzocchi permitted the use of OCAW funds to hire a former police officer-turned-private investigator to examine the accident scene and Silkwood's car. [...] After the investigator found evidence that Silkwood's car may have been forced off the road and that Silkwood was awake when the crash occurred (rather than asleep at the wheel as Oklahoma state police had concluded), Mazzocchi asked the Attorney General William B. Saxbe on November 19, 1974, to investigate Silkwood's death. [...] Mazzocchi also released a statement to the press, prematurely as it turned out: The private investigator's report had not yet been written, and the press release exposed the investigator to harassment and press mis-reporting which severely muddled OCAW's case that Silkwood may have been murdered. When the AEC concluded that Silkwood had not been contaminated accidentally, Mazzocchi was pleased with the result. He was not pleased when the AEC refused any attempt to try to discover how she had been poisoned. The Attorney General closed the investigation into Silkwood's death on April 30, 1975, saying {{there was no evidence of}} foul play.|$|E

50|$|Poetic naturalism is a {{philosophical}} approach to naturalism which encourages {{a variety of}} <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the world, using language dependent upon the aspect of reality being discussed. The term was coined by Sean M. Carroll in his book The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself to offer richer insight into naturalism, with strategies for agreeing on useful ways of talking about the natural world. It acknowledges that the methods and terms used within one domain may not be coherent with those of another domain, yet both can be considered valid representations of reality.|$|R

25|$|Assuming that {{a problem}} exists, many have offered {{suggestions}} for narrowing the gap and correcting the problems arising from it. In general, those suggestions are along three lines. The first is that the military must {{reach out to the}} civilian world. Given the essentially universal agreement that civilians must control the military, the duty falls upon the military <b>to</b> find <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> civilians, not the other way around. The second is that civilians must articulate a clear vision of what they expect in terms of the military mission. And the final suggestion is that the most practical and effective means of bringing about dialogue and understanding is to be bilateral education, in which both military and civilian elites would jointly attend specialized schools. Such schooling would emphasize military-strategic thinking, American history and political philosophy, military ethics, and the proper relationship between civil and military authority.|$|R
