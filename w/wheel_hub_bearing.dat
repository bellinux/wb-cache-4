40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{computationally}} efficient {{finite element}} analysis model of the rotary forging process for assembling a <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>bearing</b> assembly is presented. The analysis model is composed of a part of material defined by two artificial planes of symmetry, which is to reduce computational time taken in simulating the holistic process. Three cases of 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° analysis models for simulating rotary forging processes are studied to validate the present {{finite element analysis}} model. The predictions at their planes of symmetry and mid-planes are investigated and compared with the experiments, revealing that the predictions at the mid-planes are in good agreement with the experiments for all the cases while those at the planes of symmetry are to the contrary. Thus, the 60 ° analysis model is recommended for both computational efficiency and solution reliability. With the present finite element analysis model, one hour of computational time with PC can be sufficient enough to obtain valuable information about such rotary forging processes as the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>bearing</b> assembly making process...|$|E

40|$|The {{assembly}} of the existing components, which are built of several adjacent components (<b>wheel,</b> <b>hub,</b> <b>bearings,</b> bolts etc.), can change greatly the properties, above all due {{to the influence of}} neighbouring components with differing levels of rigidity, changing pre-tension ratios of the bolt and shrinkage fit connections, different thicknesses of the layers of paint and different temperatures. The complex, coincidental, multi-axial loads negatively affect the durability, which can lead to various failure mechanisms.

40|$|In recent years, the cycling {{industry}} has witnessed huge advancements in bicycle components and materials.

40|$|Decisive {{prerequisites}} for the fatigue life approval and design optimisation of wheels are the {{operational loading conditions}} and their resulting stresses. With help of the biaxial wheel test facility the proof of fatigue strength under service conditions can be established in a reliable and economic way.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} suspension development for a prototype Urban Personal Vehicle (PUNCH). The PUNCH is a crash safe prototype of an Urban Personal Vehicle developed at the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. The urban personal vehicle is designed for the dense urban areas of today. It's a small, car-like vehicle with space for one driver (and {{maybe one or two}} passengers) that is to be driven at city speeds (sub 50 [km/h]). It needs to be nimble and easy to drive. The thesis starts by defining the requirements for this vehicle, limitations of project and the iterative process of suspension design. Thereafter the literature study is presented in the theory chapter. After that, the selection of design and parts is shown, design draft is made and analysed in a whole vehicle simulation computer programme. From the simulation results conclusions are made and recommendations for the physical fabrication and future work are given. The finished concept is a double wishbone suspension font and rear. The suspension has a predictable character without any sudden changes. The suspension characteristics are {{as close as possible to}} the given targets, but for some limitation due to packaging issues presented by the already existing frame. The suspension front and rear share many components, so the final design requires less unique manufacturing (at a later phase/future work). Some components (as brake assembly, <b>wheel</b> <b>hubs</b> & <b>bearings)</b> are taken straight from a common road car (simple, cheap, off the shelf components).

40|$|The 4 "t"h meeting aims to {{exchange}} {{the experience and}} knowledge of engineers during several presentations and discussions about new developments required for a reliable, time and cost reducing validation of the wheel/hub assembly. Tremendous development of the wheel performance, described by {{the ratio of the}} rated load (kg) versus the wheel weight (kg) had taken place during the last 5000 years. Starting from the ratio of 3 for wooden 2 -piece-disc-wheels in Mesopotamia it needed nearly 1000 years to increase the ratio to approx 5 at light-weight spoke wheels for fighting carriages, found in the grave of king Tutenchamon in Egypt. Modern light alloy wheels of commercial vehicles reach values up to 160 kg/kg. Additionally the comlex design of the modern systems for cars and commercial vehicles comprising <b>wheel,</b> brake, <b>hub,</b> <b>bearing,</b> spindle and <b>hub</b> carrier, including different materials and their treatment, fasteners, press-fits, require an appropriate testing procedure. The variable loading conditions, caused by operational wheel forces, brake and torque moments including heating, may result in changing tolerances and press-fits during operation and consequently in different damage mechanisms. This can be simulated in the Biaxial Wheel Test Machine, whereby corresponding load programs are necessary. An overview about all biaxial test machines in usage at the end of 1999 is shown in the introduction. The total number is 17 for cars, 7 for commercial vehicles and 1 for trains. The six presentations of this meeting were consequently concentrated on: (a) recommendations for a standardization of load programs of the German Wheel Committee, (b) the simulation of brake and torque events and (c) the possibility for a numerical stress analyses and fatigue life assessment.

40|$|Load Sensing Bearing (LSB) {{units are}} based on the {{measurement}} of the elastic deformation of the outer ring of the bearing unit usually using strain gauges which are placed along the circumference of the bearing. The master thesis is aimed at estimating the lateral tire force of a vehicle wheel using the vehicle <b>wheel</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>hub</b> unit which is instrumented to become a LSB and is placed in a BMW E 60 lab vehicle. Calibration of the LSB is needed to obtain a strain-force model. In situ calibration is expensive, time consuming and not always possible. Therefore a calibration system, the Bearing Test System (BETSY) has been used. Sensor responses of the LSB are greatly influenced by differences in bearing housing compliance where on one hand the LSB is mounted on the machine {{and on the other hand}} in the vehicle. It will be shown how it is possible to use BETSY as calibration system when the LSB is mounted to machine via the actual knuckle and ball joints found in the vehicle. Next, a Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis (MLRA) is used to obtain a strain-force model to estimate the lateral force. However, the strain gauges are subjected to thermal influences of a low frequent nature and can therefore only be used to estimate the ‘high’- frequent lateral force. Besides that, it is not possible with the specific compact <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> unit of the BMW E 60 lab vehicle to determine, with the strain gauges, whether the vehicle is turning left or right. To overcome these two issues, two Eddy-current sensors measuring the tilting movement of the ABS-ring, which is integrated in the seal of the bearing, are used to determine the direction and to estimate the low frequent content of the lateral force. Calibration and validation experiments are performed to show the accuracy and precision of the lateral force estimation.
