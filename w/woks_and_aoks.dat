40|$|Arabinogalactan protein <b>and</b> wall-associated kinase (<b>WAK)</b> are {{suspected}} to be regulatory players at {{the interface between}} cytoplasm and cell wall. Both <b>WAK(s)</b> <b>and</b> arabinogalactan shown likely to represent arabinogalactan protein(s) have been visualized there with computational optical-sectioning microscopy. The arabinogalactan occurs in a polyhedral array at the external face of the cell membrane. <b>WAK,</b> <b>and</b> other proteins as yet unidentified, appear to fasten the membrane to the wall at vertices of the array. Evidence is presented that the array bears {{an important part of}} the mechanical stress experienced by the membrane, and it is speculated that the architectural organization of arabinogalactan protein, <b>WAK,</b> <b>and</b> other components of the array is critical for coordination of endomembrane activities, growth, and differentiation.

The boys make it safely back to Earth, but a malfunction results in them crashing the Thunder Road into their neighborhood lake. Now they're back to square one...or so they think. A week later, Ben has a dream at school in which he envisions another vast circuit board while flying through more clouds overhead. This time - thanks to <b>Wak</b> <b>and</b> Neek's amulet - Ben is joined in the dream by Wolfgang, Darren, and Lori.

5000|$|After Ben {{receives}} more {{dreams about}} the circuit board, Wolfgang discovers {{a means of}} producing unlimited sustainable oxygen; this means longer flights, whereas previously they were limited to whatever a typical oxygen tank could hold. They finalize their plan to explore the galaxy in search of alien life. The boys complete lift-off, despite interference from the authorities (one of whom silently wishes them well). Shortly after breaking Earth's orbit, something overrides the boys' personal computer-controls. The Thunder Road is tractor-beamed aboard a much-larger spaceship. The boys venture out to meet their [...] "captors": <b>Wak</b> <b>and</b> Neek: two green-skinned aliens whose knowledge of Earth comes almost entirely from junk culture, particularly TV reruns. The young explorers hit it off with their extraterrestrial hosts...who are suddenly intercepted by a larger-still alien vessel. Feigning an attack by space-pirates, Wak urges the boys to leave. They {{are in the process}} of doing so when they're cut off by a gigantic brown extraterrestrial, this one bearing a close resemblance to the other two, who gestures furiously while grinding out barely-comprehensible alien language. As it turns out, <b>Wak</b> <b>and</b> Neek are brother and sister; they've taken their father's ship out for a [...] "joy ride", sending the dreams to the boys in the hopes of meeting humans. Transmissions of old black-and-white movies have kept the extraterrestrial populace at a distance - except for the curious <b>Wak</b> <b>and</b> Neek - due to the humans' depicted violent tendencies toward alien life.|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the portion}} {{is made by}} order. The kerak telor vendor puts {{a small amount of}} ketan (sticky rice) on a small <b>wok</b> pan <b>and</b> heats it on the {{charcoal}} fire. Add an egg (chicken or duck, but duck eggs are considered more delicious), and add some spices and mix it. The dish is fried on a wok without any cooking oil so the omelette will stick on the <b>wok</b> <b>and</b> enable to put it upside down straight against charcoal fire until it is cooked. The spicy serundeng (sweet grated coconut granule) with ebi (dried salted shrimp) and fried shallots are sprinkled upon the omelette.|$|R
5000|$|The wok's most {{distinguishing}} feature is its shape. Classic woks have a rounded bottom. [...] Hand-hammered woks are sometimes flipped inside out after being shaped, giving the wok a gentle flare {{to the edge}} {{that makes it easier}} to push food up onto the sides of the wok. Woks sold in western countries are sometimes found with flat bottoms—this makes them more similar to a deep frying pan. The flat bottom allows the wok to be used on an electric stove, where a rounded wok {{would not be able to}} fully contact the stove's heating element. A round bottom wok enables the traditional round spatula or ladle to pick all the food up at the bottom of the <b>wok</b> <b>and</b> toss it around easily; this is difficult with a flat bottom. With a gas hob, or traditional pit stove, the bottom of a round wok can get hotter than a flat <b>wok</b> <b>and</b> so is better for stir frying.|$|R
50|$|Blendo had {{the first}} {{effective}} implementation of the full-body kinetic energy spinner weapon that became common in Robot Wars. The robot had a shell made from a <b>wok</b> <b>and</b> was spun by a lawnmower engine. Blades attached to the shell caused damage to its opponents, removing bodywork {{and in some instances}} causing them to be thrown over the polycarbonate safety shields into the audience.|$|R
50|$|He taught Jacqueline du Pré {{when she}} briefly {{attended}} his {{classes at the}} Paris Conservatoire, though he was not her main teacher (that was William Pleeth). Other students included Arto Noras, Nathan <b>Waks</b> <b>and</b> Raphaël Sommer. In the 1970s he gave a series of master classes which were recorded and broadcast on TV by the BBC, which demonstrate his very dynamic style of playing.|$|R
5000|$|Any metal surface which {{concentrates}} {{a significant}} {{fraction of the}} reflected microwaves at a focus {{can be used as}} a dish antenna, at a lower gain. This has led to trash can lids, <b>woks,</b> <b>and</b> other items being used as [...] "dishes". Only modern low noise LNBs and the higher transmission power of DTH satellites allows a usable signal to be received from such inefficient DIY antennas.|$|R

Afterwards it is allowed to cool and then rolled into small balls.|$|R
40|$|Time-frequency {{representation}} (TFR) {{based on}} Adaptive Optimal Kernel (AOK) normally performs well only for monocomponent signals and has poor noise robustness. To overcome {{the shortcomings of}} AOK TFR mentioned above, a new TFR algorithm is proposed here by integrating nonlinear mode decomposition (NMD) with AOK TFR. NMD is used to decompose multicomponent signals into a bundle of meaningful oscillations <b>and</b> then <b>AOK</b> is applied to compute the TFR of individual oscillations, finally all these TFRs are summed together to generate one TFR. Through quantitative comparison with other TFR methods to both simulated and real signals, the superiority of proposed TFR based on NMD <b>and</b> <b>AOK</b> on removing noise and many other measurement index of TFR are shown.

5000|$|Another myth is that, in the 1860s, a Chinese {{restaurant}} cook in San Francisco {{was forced}} to serve something to drunken miners after hours, when he had no fresh food. To avoid a beating, the cook threw leftovers in a <b>wok</b> <b>and</b> served the miners who loved it and asked what dish is this—he replied [...] "chopped sui".
