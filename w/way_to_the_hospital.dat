40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was <b>to</b> trace <b>the</b> {{epidemiological}} profile from stab wound victims looked after at an emergency department of a university <b>hospital</b> in <b>the</b> year of 2007, characterizing the pre and intra-hospital care. Exploratory studies, transversal, retrospective and descriptive analysis. The sample consisted of 45 victims. Most of the victims were young, from the male sex, single and presented unique injuries caused by interpersonal conflicts. The Integrated Service Attendance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Trauma at Emergency and the regional transport were the most used ones on <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> <b>The</b> most commonly used procedures at the pre and intra-hospital attendance were respectively: dressing and oxygen therapy; fluid replacement and vesical delay probe. The majority of the victims needed internment, there were little indications of internment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> intensive therapy unit. The injuries did not provoke incapacities, but there were three deaths. Therefore, stab wounds have an epidemiological significance, with the necessity of interventions that will be beyond the health sphere. ...|$|R

25|$|After a {{while the}} {{intersection}} at the station proved to be hazardous, and the level crossing was closed. This caused many visitors to not find their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> Visitors were therefore encouraged to instead use Frøen which, although further away, was easier to find. This led {{to the need for}} a new name for the station. The hospital was built on the grounds of a farm named Steinerud. The name was met with some opposition, as many locals preferred the more conservative form Stenerud. The station was upgraded in the 1970s with a standard concrete shed.|$|E

25|$|As {{he entered}} St. Peter's Square to address an {{audience}} on 13 May 1981, Pope John Paul II {{was shot and}} critically wounded by Mehmet Ali Ağca, an expert Turkish gunman {{who was a member}} of the militant fascist group Grey Wolves. The assassin used a Browning 9mm semi-automatic pistol, shooting the pope in the abdomen and perforating his colon and small intestine multiple times. John Paul II was rushed into the Vatican complex and then to the Gemelli Hospital. On the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> he lost consciousness. Even though the two bullets missed his mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta, he lost nearly three-quarters of his blood. He underwent five hours of surgery to treat his wounds. Surgeons performed a colostomy, temporarily rerouting the upper part of the large intestine to let the damaged lower part heal. When he briefly regained consciousness before being operated on, he instructed the doctors not to remove his Brown Scapular during the operation. One of the few people allowed in to see him at the Gemelli Clinic was one of his closest friends philosopher Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, who arrived on Saturday 16 May and kept him company while he recovered from emergency surgery. The pope later stated that Our Lady of Fátima helped keep him alive throughout his ordeal.|$|E

25|$|In {{the winter}} 2000 {{transfer}} window, South African striker Sibusiso Zuma was signed from South African side Orlando Pirates, and in May 2000, English manager Roy Hodgson became the new manager. From the 2000–01 season, the club started to improve. The club won its second Superliga championship, winning 3–1 {{in the last}} New Firm derby match of the season, at the Parken Stadium. The 2–0 goal was a bicycle kick by Zuma, who received the ball at his chest, bounced {{it in the air}} and in the same motion executed the overhead kick, volleying the ball into the far corner out of Brøndby goalkeeper Mogens Krogh's reach. This was later voted the Danish goal of the year, and was voted the best Superliga goal of the decade in December 2009 and was in 2013 voted as the greatest moment in the history of FCK. Roy Hodgson broke his contract with Copenhagen a few weeks after having won the championship, signing with Italian team Udinese, and he was replaced by Swede Kent Karlsson. The 2001 season is also remembered for a highly dramatic event. During training on 13 March 2001 charismatic midfielder Ståle Solbakken suffered a heart attack. He was rapidly attended to by club doctor Frank Odgaard who found that his heart had stopped beating and started to administer cardiac massage. Upon the ambulance's arrival, Solbakken was pronounced clinically dead at the scene, but on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> in the ambulance he was revived nearly seven minutes later. He survived the episode and had a pacemaker fitted. Shortly after, on medical advice, he announced his playing retirement, but would later return to the club and become its most successful manager.|$|E

His mother married Paul Henderson in Rickey Henley's junior year of high school and the family adopted the Henderson surname. As a child learning to play baseball in Oakland, Henderson developed the ability to bat right-handed although he was a naturally left-handed thrower — a rare combination for baseball players, especially non-pitchers. In the entire history of Major League Baseball through the 2008 season, only 57 position players are known to have batted right and thrown left, and Henderson is easily the most successful player to do so. [...] Henderson later said, [...] "All my friends were right-handed and swung from the right side, so I thought that's the way it was supposed to be done." ...|$|E

40|$|Emergency {{situations}} and mass casualties involve several agencies and public authorities, which need {{to gather data}} from the incident scene and exchange geo-referenced information to provide fast and accurate first aid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people in need. Tracking patients on their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals</b> can prove critical in taking lifesaving decisions. Increased and continuous flow of information combined by vital signs and geographic location of emergency victims can greatly reduce the response time of the medical emergency chain and improve the efficiency of disaster medicine activity. Recent advances in mobile positioning systems and telecommunications are providing the technology needed {{for the development of}} location-aware medical applications. IMPRESS is an advanced ICT platform based on adequate technologies for developing location-aware medical response during emergencies. The system incorporates mobile and fixed components that collect field data from diverse sources, support medical location and situation-based services and share information on the patient’s transport from <b>the</b> field <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospitals.</b> In IMPRESS platform tracking of victims, ambulances and emergency services vehicles is integrated with medical, traffic and crisis management information into a common operational picture. The Incident Management component of the system manages operational resources together with patient tracking data that contain vital sign values and patient’s status evolution. Thus, it can prioritize emergency transport decisions, based on medical and location-aware information. The solution combines positioning and information gathered and owned by various public services involved in MCIs or large-scale disasters.

Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed... us in.
