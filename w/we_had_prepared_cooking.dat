40|$|Summary of Progress The {{specific}} aims of {{this project}} can be summarized as follows: • Aim 1 : Prepare and evaluate radiolabeled ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR), a new nuclear hormone receptor target for tumor imaging and hormone therapy. • Aim 2 : Prepare steroids labeled with a cyclopentadienyl tricarbonyl technetium or rhenium unit. • Aim 3 : Prepare and evaluate other organometallic systems of novel design as ligand mimics and halogenated ligands for nuclear hormone receptor-based tumor imaging. As is described in detail below, we made excellent progress on {{all three of these}} aims; the highlights of our progress are the following: • <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>prepared</b> the first fluorine- 18 labeled analogs of ligands for the PPAR receptor and used these in tissue distribution studies in rats • <b>we</b> <b>have</b> developed three new methods for the synthesis of cyclopentadienyltricarbonyl rhenium and technetium (CpRe(CO) 3 and CpTc(CO) 3) systems and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> adapted these to the synthesis of steroids labeled with these metals, as well as ligands for other receptor systems • <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>prepared</b> a number of fluorine- 18 labeled steroidal and non-steroidal androgens and measured their tissue distribution in rats • <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>prepared</b> iodine and bromine-labeled progestins with high progesterone receptor binding affinity • <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>prepared</b> inorganic metal tricarbonyl complexes and steroid receptor ligands in which the metal tricarbonyl unit is an integral part off the ligand core...|$|R
