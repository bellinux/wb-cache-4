60|$|<b>What</b> <b>else</b> could <b>he</b> do? He locked them in, and was, {{through the}} failure of the man, in a quandary which made clear {{reflection}} necessary—and impossible.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I met your--this young lady'--something {{told him}} {{that was not the}} proper way to put it, but hang it, <b>what</b> <b>else</b> could <b>he</b> say?--'at the casino last night.' ...|$|R

6000|$|The deep dread Godfrey's look {{had created}} in Nancy {{made her feel}} these words a relief. She sat in {{comparative}} calmness to hear <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>he</b> had to tell. He went on: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The little rascal!" [...] I {{thought to}} myself. I {{might have made}} some noise {{in spite of the}} handkerchief, but I thought it better not, for I didn't know <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>he</b> might pile on my mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Por las Entranas de Dios!" [...] swore Don Paulo who, {{like all}} pious Spanish Catholics, favoured the oath anatomical. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>he</b> would have added in his fury is not known, for Sakr-el-Bahr waved him contemptuously away.|$|E
