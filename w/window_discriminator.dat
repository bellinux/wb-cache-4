40|$|Abstract:- A {{new concept}} of an all-analog {{integrating}} single channel analyzer (SCA) for radiation pixel detectors is proposed. The principal idea is to output an analog signal that corresponds to the event counts during exposure time. Output signals from a <b>window</b> <b>discriminator</b> in the pixel control the charging/discharging a storage capacitor by a current source/sink depending on the input pulse height. A very low noise performance is expected since no digital noise is involved. In addition, since no digital counter {{is included in the}} pixel a significant reduction in area and power concumption is obtained. The <b>window</b> <b>discriminator</b> is insensitive to the rise time of the input pulse. Circuit constrains are discussed, and a performance simulation is presented for a design example.

Visual responses were evoked by different directions of either full-field or local moving patterns. Direction tuning of action potentials was {{compared with that of}} EPSPs detected by passing the membrane voltage through an AC amplifier and <b>window</b> <b>discriminator.</b> This rough measure of retinal input indicated that the direction tuning of the full-field excitatory input from the retina matched that of the spike output for the same BON cell. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Neuronal {{activity}} was recorded from 13 sites in right nondominant superior and middle temporal gyms during matching of faces (FM), matching of complex figures (CM), labelling of facial emotional expression (FE) and object naming (N) in 11 patients undergoing craniotomy under local anaesthesia. These extracellular recordings {{were divided into}} 21 neuronal populations of one to a few cells, using amplitude <b>window</b> <b>discriminators.</b> Sixty-two percent of those populations showed statistically significant changes in activity during FM; 52 % during FE; 38 % during N and 38 % during CM. Fifty-one percent of changes were in the first 1. 3 s of each task and 33 % in the next 1. 3 s, when overt speech responses to the tasks occurred. Significant changes lasting throughout the 4 s allotted to each task were not seen. Functional correlates of some populations were derived from patterns of changes during FM and other tasks: four populations were related to 'matching', in that significant changes occurred with FM and CM. One of these populations, and six other populations were related to face perception, with significant change with FM and FE, confirming the presence in man of neuronal activity related to faces, as previously described from primate cortex. Six populations increased activity with overt speech; four of these showed greater increases when overt speech {{was in response to}} a visuospatial task compared with the lexical task...|$|R
40|$|The High Energy X-Ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE), {{currently}} under {{development for the}} X-Ray Timing Explorer (XTE) mission, employs a closed loop gain control system to attain 0. 5 percent stabilization of each of eight-phoswich detector gains. This Automatic Gain Control (AGC) system utilizes a split <b>window</b> <b>discriminator</b> scheme to control the response of each detector pulse height analyzer to gated Am- 241 X-ray events at 60 keV. A prototype AGC system has been implemented and tested within the gain perturbation environment expected to be experienced by the HEXTE instrument in flight. The AGC system and test configuration are described. Response, stability and noise characteristics are measured and compared with theoretical predictions. The system {{is found to be}} generally suitable for the HEXTE application...|$|E
30|$|Signals {{recorded}} from up {{to seven}} independently moving microelectrodes (quartz insulated platinum–tungsten electrodes, impedance: 2 – 5  MO at 1000  Hz) were amplified and band-pass filtered from 300  Hz to 10  kHz. Single unit activity was obtained by performing an online discrimination of spikes on each electrode. Spikes were firstly selected by taking into account their amplitude using an online <b>window</b> <b>discriminator</b> with high-pass and low-pass filters. In cases where spikes were not discriminable due to their amplitude only, the electrode was moved until the signals were sufficiently distinct to be discriminable on this basis. Although off-line spike sorting was available, it was not used in this study. Indeed, beyond the reservations that one may have concerning the variable quality of the output of such software, the use of clean original electrophysiological signals makes safer the more specific study of precise neuronal synchronization. Neuronal data along with behavioral events (occurrences of signals and performance of the animal) were stored on a PC for off-line analysis with a time resolution of 1  kHz.|$|E
40|$|A new hybrid optical imaging {{detector}} is described {{that is being}} developed {{for the next generation}} adaptive optics (AO) wavefront sensors (WFS) for ground-based telescopes. The detector consists of a photocathode and proximity focused microchannel plates (MCPs) read out by the Medipix 2 CMOS pixel ASIC. Each pixel of the Medipix 2 device measures 55 x 55 um 2 and comprises pre-amplifier, a <b>window</b> <b>discriminator</b> and a 14 -bit counter. The 256 x 256 Medipix 2 array can be read out noiselessly in 287 us. The readout can be electronically shuttered down to a temporal window of a few us. The Medipix 2 is buttable on 3 sides to produce 512 x(n* 256) pixel devices. Measurements with ultraviolet light yield a spatial resolution of the detector at the Nyquist limit. Sub-pixel resolution can be achieved using centroiding algorithms. For the AO application, very high continuous frame rates of the order of 1 kHz are required for a matrix of 512 x 512 pixels. The design concepts of a parallel readout board are presented that will allow this fast data throughput. The development status of the optical WFS tube is also explained...|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{variations}} of the performances, and particularly the discrimination efficiency, of a BGO-CsI(Tl) phoswich detector in the temperature range 2. 5 – 40 °C. The scintillation decay time evaluation {{has been carried out}} by means of a double constant fraction discriminator and a time to amplitude converter on 1 μs shaped pulses. Good discrimination between BGO and CsI(Tl) events has been obtained over the whole temperature range, even though small efficiency variations are present because of the relative displacement of the acceptance <b>window</b> of the <b>discriminator</b> due to the decay time dependence on temperature.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{properties}} {{and the performance}} of the ANIPET scanner which has been designed for imaging positronemitting tracers in small laboratory animals. It has two planar BGO-PS-PMT detectors with a useful FOV of 59 x 54 mm. These can be separated by 75 - 200 mm to optimize detection efficiency with different sized laboratory animals. ANIPET has the capacity to scan in 3 D mode for brain images or 2 D mode for whole body scanning. The spatial resolution at the centre of the field of view is 2. 8 mmFWHM for 2 D mode scans and 3. 2 mm in the 3 D mode. The coincidence timing resolution is 10 ns FWHM. The system efficiency varies from 1 % to 0. 1 % as the detector separation increased from 75 to 200 mm and the energy <b>discriminator</b> <b>window</b> is increased from 150 to 450 keV...|$|R
40|$|Barrels are {{discrete}} cytoarchitectonic neurons cluster {{located in}} the layer IV of the somatosensory¦cortex in mice brain. Each barrel is related to a specific whisker located on the mouse snout. The¦whisker-to-barrel pathway {{is a part of}} the somatosensory system that is intensively used to explore¦sensory activation induced plasticity in the cerebral cortex. ¦Different recording methods exist to explore the cortical response induced by whisker deflection in¦the cortex of anesthetized mice. In this work, we used a method called the Single-Unit Analysis by¦which we recorded the extracellular electric signals of a single barrel neuron using a microelectrode. ¦After recording the signal was processed by discriminators to isolate specific neuronal shape (action¦potentials). ¦The objective of this thesis was to familiarize with the barrel cortex recording during whisker¦deflection and its theoretical background and to compare two different ways of discriminating and¦sorting cortical signal, the Waveform <b>Window</b> <b>Discriminator</b> (WWD) or the Spike Shape Discriminator (SSD). ¦WWD is an electric module allowing the selection of specific electric signal shape. A trigger and a¦window potential level are set manually. During measurements, every time the electric signal passes¦through the two levels a dot is generated on time line. It was the method used in previous¦extracellular recording study in the Département de Biologie Cellulaire et de Morphologie (DBCM) in¦Lausanne. ¦SSD is a function provided by the signal analysis software Spike 2 (Cambridge Electronic Design). The¦neuronal signal is discriminated by a complex algorithm allowing the creation of specific templates. ¦Each of these templates is supposed to correspond to a cell response profile. The templates are saved¦as a number of points (62 in this study) and are set for each new cortical location. During¦measurements, every time the cortical recorded signal corresponds to a defined number of templates¦points (60 % in this study) a dot is generated on time line. The advantage of the SSD is that multiple¦templates can be used during a single stimulation, allowing a simultaneous recording of multiple¦signals. ¦It exists different ways to represent data after discrimination and sorting. The most commonly used¦in the Single-Unit Analysis of the barrel cortex are the representation of the time between stimulation¦and the first cell response (the latency), the representation of the Response Magnitude (RM) after¦whisker deflection corrected for spontaneous activity and the representation of the time distribution¦of neuronal spikes on time axis after whisker stimulation (Peri-Stimulus Time Histogram, PSTH). ¦The results show that the RMs and the latencies in layer IV were significantly different between the¦WWD and the SSD discriminated signal. The temporal distribution of the latencies shows that the¦different values were included between 6 and 60 ms with no peak value for SSD while the WWD¦data were all gathered around a peak of 11 ms (corresponding to previous studies). The scattered¦distribution of the latencies recorded with the SSD did not correspond to a cell response. ¦The SSD appears to be a powerful tool for signal sorting but we do not succeed to use it for the¦Single-Unit Analysis extracellular recordings. Further recordings with different SSD templates settings¦and larger sample size may help to show the utility of this tool in Single-Unit Analysis studies...|$|E

The drift time measurement, referred to the time of the trigger signal, gives the Z-position with the known drift velocity. The light is detected by four UV-sensitive photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).
