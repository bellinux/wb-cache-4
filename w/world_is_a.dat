5|$|Empires: Dawn of the Modern <b>World</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 2003 {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} developed by Stainless Steel Studios {{and published by}} Activision. Set in a world-historical period that extends from the Middle Ages to World War II, the game tasks players with guiding one of nine rival great civilizations to victory. Customer surveys from Stainless Steel's previous game, Empire Earth, were used {{as a starting point}} for Empires: these inspired the team to take a more minimalist design approach, and to include civilizations without overlapping styles of play. Empires was positively received by critics, who enjoyed its multiplayer component. However, certain reviewers disliked its single-player mode, and opinion clashed on the game's level of uniqueness compared to competitors such as Rise of Nations. The sales of Empires, when combined with those of Empire Earth, totaled 2.5 million units by 2004.|$|E

A three-dimensional (3D) camera system allows the player to view the action from any perspective, including isometric and first-person angles. A mini-map is included as well.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{stars have}} been {{important}} to civilizations throughout the world. They {{have been part of}} religious practices and used for celestial navigation and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the <b>world,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.|$|E

The book examines {{the origins of the}} Scottish Enlightenment and what impact it had on the modern world. Following the Great Man approach, Herman focuses on individuals and presents their biographies {{in the context of their}} individual fields and also in terms of the theme of Scottish contributions to the world.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{movement}} has drawn many followers from {{the middle class and}} is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that {{the movement}} was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> symptom of the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E

Noire uses licensed music provided by an in-game radio. Over 30 licensed tracks continuously loop on one radio station. The game also features an original score composed {{by a group of}} musicians and inspired by 1940s films.|$|E
5|$|Rain <b>World</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 2017 {{survival}} platformer {{video game}} in which the player controls a part-slug, part-cat creature searching a hostile, derelict world for its family. The Slugcat uses debris as weapons to escape randomized enemies, forage for food, and reach safe hibernation rooms before a deadly torrential rain arrives. The player is given little explicit guidance on how to survive, which was {{the intention of the}} developers, who wanted players to feel like a rat living on subway tracks, in which they learn to survive in an environment without grasping its higher-level function. Rain World was developed by Videocult, a small indie team, over six years and published by Adult Swim Games for PlayStation 4 and Windows in March 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its art design and fluid animations, but disliked its brutal difficulty and imprecise controls.|$|E
5|$|Sam & Max Save the <b>World</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 3D graphic {{adventure}} game {{in which}} the player controls the character of Sam. The player has Sam explore the environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Depending on the type of in-game entity a player selects using the cursor, the player can have Sam walk around an area, look at and comment on objects, pick up certain items or otherwise try to use them. Sam may also engage in conversation with non-player characters; when this occurs, the game presents a dialog tree with several subjects to pick from. Topics of conversation may directly involve the story or provide assistance with the game's puzzles, while others may be entirely unconnected. In some cases, the player may be able to choose dialog for Max to speak as well.|$|E
