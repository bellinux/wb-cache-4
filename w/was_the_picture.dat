2500|$|Examples {{occur in}} Anna Bolena and Maria Padilla, {{both of which}} precede this opera, but Ashbrook {{recognized}} at least two instances which evidence Donizetti’s distinctive musical genius in Maria Stuarda. [...] One is the Leicester-Elizabeth duet (beginning with Leicester's Era d'amor l'immagine / [...] "She <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of love") which appears before Maria's entrance and where Leicester pleads for Maria while Elizabeth's [...] "ironic interjections provide a contrast of rhythmic emphasis and melodic pattern to the tenor's balanced lyric phrases".|$|E
2500|$|Feltrinelli's {{version of}} the image was used in October 1967 in Milan, Italy, when {{spontaneous}} protests occurred {{in response to the}} news of Che's death. Italian photographer Giorgio Mondolfo later stated that [...] "the first time I saw the picture by Alberto Korda, I was not even slightly interested in the author. I was only fifteen, and it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> that had drawn us – many for the first time – to gather in the streets, crying Che lives!" ...|$|E
2500|$|While Thompson's {{identity}} {{was not known}} for over 40 years after the photos were taken, the images became famous. The sixth image, especially, which later became known as Migrant Mother, [...] "has achieved near mythical status, symbolizing, if not defining, an entire era in United States history." [...] Roy Stryker called Migrant Mother the [...] "ultimate" [...] photo of the Depression Era: [...] " [...] never surpassed it. To me, it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> ... The others were marvelous, but that was special ... She is immortal." [...] As a whole, the photographs taken for the Resettlement Administration [...] "have been widely heralded as the epitome of documentary photography." [...] Edward Steichen described them as [...] "the most remarkable human documents ever rendered in pictures." [...] Later, however, Lange was criticized for taking inaccurate notes.|$|E

2500|$|Talbot leaves and, as Leicester {{is about}} to do so, Elizabeth enters. Clearly knowing what has gone on between the two men, she {{questions}} him, asks about a letter from Mary, and then demands to see it. [...] Reluctantly, Leicester hands it over, noting that Mary has asked {{for a meeting with}} her cousin and he pleads with the Queen to agree to do so. [...] Also, upon her questioning, he confesses his love for Mary (Duet of Leicester and Elizabeth: Era d'amor l'immagine / [...] "She <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of love"). [...] Told that Elizabeth can join a hunting party on the estates where Mary is imprisoned, she agrees to the meeting, albeit with revenge on her mind (Cabaletta to the duet: Sul crin la rivale la man mi stendea / [...] "Over my head my rival stretched out her hand").|$|E
2500|$|When, in 1887, Miss Fisher married Mr. James Marquis Tiernan, of Maryland, {{and settled}} in Mexico, where her husband had {{extensive}} mining interests, there began the third period in Christian Reid's career as a novelist. Perhaps the story which, of all that she had ever written, contained more {{of the elements of}} general popularity and was at the same time most adequately written, <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Picture</b> of Las Cruces. It had the distinction of being translated into French and appearing in L 'Illustration. The book was notable for the beauty of its envisagement of a semi-tropical land, the ideality of its poetic atmosphere, and the art displayed in the comparison and juxtaposition of the fragile romance of Mexico with the hardy realism of America. The Lady of Las Cruces, like most sequels was less a natural consequence of the former story, than a hazardous attempt to crown the story with a [...] "happy" [...] (and popular) ending. Other works of this period are: the travel-romance, The Land of the Sun (1894), one of her most interesting tales;, as well as Carmela, Little Maid of Mexico, A Comedy of Elopement, A Woman of Fortune, Weighed in the Balance, and Carmen's Inheritance. In addition, there were two novels which stood as memorials of Christian Reid's travels in Santo Domingo: The Man of the Family and The Chase of an Heiress.|$|E
