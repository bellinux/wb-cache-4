5|$|Common {{problems}} <b>women</b> <b>experience</b> post-SCI are {{pain with}} intercourse and difficulty achieving orgasm. Around half {{of women with}} SCI are able to reach orgasm, usually when their genitals are stimulated. Some women report the sensation of orgasm {{to be the same}} as before the injury, and others say the sensation is reduced.|$|E
5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that <b>women</b> <b>experience,</b> including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to as}} the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. <b>Women</b> <b>experience</b> oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.|$|E
50|$|Dating {{violence}} {{is often a}} precursor to domestic violence. 22% of high school girls and 32% of college <b>women</b> <b>experienced</b> dating violence in a 2000 study. 20.6% of <b>women</b> <b>experienced</b> two or more types of dating violence and 8.3% of <b>women</b> <b>experienced</b> rape, stalking or physical aggression while dating. The levels of dating violence against men has not been investigated to the same extent.|$|R

5|$|Even {{people with}} {{complete}} SCI, in whom {{the spinal cord}} cannot transmit any messages past {{the level of the}} lesion, can achieve orgasm. In 1960, in one of the earliest studies to look at orgasm and SCI, the term phantom orgasm was coined to describe women's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI—but subsequent studies have suggested the experience is not merely psychological. Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied by physical signs normally found at orgasm, such as increased blood pressure. Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the cervix regardless of level or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured <b>women</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether men or women have higher rates of low back pain. A 2012 review {{reported}} a rate of 9.6% among males and 8.7% among females. Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of <b>women</b> <b>experience</b> back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy. Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – {{are more likely to have}} low back pain than former smokers, and former smokers are more likely to have low back pain than those who have never smoked.|$|E
5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>experience</b> many unique {{health issues}} related to {{reproduction}} and sexuality and these are responsible for {{a third of all}} health problems experienced by women during their reproductive years (aged 15–44), of which unsafe sex is a major risk factor, especially in developing countries. Reproductive health includes {{a wide range of issues}} including the health and function of structures and systems involved in reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth and child rearing, including antenatal and perinatal care. Global women's health has a much larger focus on reproductive health than that of developed countries alone, but also infectious diseases such as malaria in pregnancy and non-communicable diseases (NCD). Many of the issues that face women and girls in resource poor regions are relatively unknown in developed countries, such as female genital cutting, and further lack access to the appropriate diagnostic and clinical resources.|$|E

40|$|The {{treatment}} that women get from health care staff {{can influence the}} experience of the abortion and how women manage to coping the experience emotionally. The aim {{of this study was to}} illuminate women’s experiences in connection with an abortion. The findings show that the women’s social situation led them to the decision of abortion. When the women had the pregnancy confirmed many felt unreality. Several <b>women</b> <b>experienced</b> the situation as a crisis. After the abortion most of the <b>women</b> <b>experienced</b> relief, but also guilt towards the abortion. Some knew that they had made the right decision, while others felt regret. Most of the <b>women</b> <b>experienced</b> that the nursing staff treated them well, but some <b>women</b> <b>experienced</b> that the staff was negative, insensitive and ignoring. Most of the women was satisfied with the total support from significant others. To make a satisfying nursing care possible for each woman who seeks abortion, more research is needed about women’s experiences of nursing staff’s treatment...|$|R
25|$|During the orgasm phase, {{breathing}} becomes extremely {{rapid and}} the pelvic muscles begin {{a series of}} rhythmic contractions. Both men and <b>women</b> <b>experience</b> quick cycles of muscle contraction of lower pelvic muscles and women often experience uterine and vaginal contractions; this experience {{can be described as}} intensely pleasurable, but roughly 15% of women never experience orgasm and half report having faked it.

40|$|University In {{this paper}} the {{relationship}} of various types of work–family interaction (i. e. work-family conflict, and work-family enhancement) with individual, family, and employment characteristics was explored {{in a sample of}} 1000 married employed women with preschool children. By using cluster analysis, we tried to reveal whether specific combinations of the various dimensions of work-family interaction (WFI) exist. Our results showed that employed women did not simply experience work-family conflict or work-family enhancement, but that they should be classified in four distinct clusters: (1) 189 employed <b>women</b> <b>experienced</b> primarily work-family enhancement(i. e. positive WFI); (2) 289 employed <b>women</b> <b>experienced</b> primarily work-family conflict(i. e. negative WFI); (3) 338 employed <b>women</b> <b>experienced</b> work-family conflict and work-family enhancement simultaneously(i. e. both positive and negative WIF); (4) 184 employed <b>women</b> did not <b>experience</b> either work-family conflict or work-family enhancement(i. e. low WFI). Results further showed that the emerging WFI-clusters appeared to have distinct profiles with respect to individual, family and employment characteristics...|$|R

25|$|During the {{resolution}} phase, muscles relax, blood pressure drops, {{and the body}} returns to its resting state. Though generally reported that women do not experience a refractory period and thus can experience an additional orgasm, or multiple orgasms soon after the first, some sources state that both men and <b>women</b> <b>experience</b> a refractory period because {{women may also experience}} a period after orgasm in which further sexual stimulation does not produce excitement.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} explore gendered {{experiences}} of homelessness through {{an examination of}} survival sex. Survival sex is usually understood to be the exchange of sex for material support, however, this research found a greater complexity in the intimate relationships being undertaken by young <b>women</b> <b>experiencing</b> homelessness. In-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} 15 young women aged 18 - 25 years living in Melbourne, Australia. Participants were asked about their experiences of intimate relationships and survival sex while homeless in order to provide a better understanding of gendered practices of marginalisation. This research found that young <b>women</b> <b>experiencing</b> homelessness are subject to the pressures of individualisation that have been produced by the neoliberal policies of Western capitalist societies. As such, they are required to find individual solutions to structural problems and, for young <b>women</b> <b>experiencing</b> homelessness, sex and intimate relationships are among the few resources at their disposal. The reasons provided for engaging in intimate relationships included material support, physical protection and emotional security and stability. Some avoided intimate relationships or engaged in intimate relationships that challenged gendered expectations of survival sex. This article argues that survival sex and intimate relationship management occur within a context of gendered discourses regarding young <b>women</b> <b>experiencing</b> homelessness and their sense of personal responsibility for managing their situations...|$|R
