They were on paper {{the best team in}} the {{division}} last year and they were supposed to win, and they didn’t. One, there are four other teams in our division who are going to make sure that doesn't happen, and two, has anyone ever heard of plagiarism? [...] That was pretty good, especially coming from him. He's a quiet guy, so it was probably shocking <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it.</b> Not shocking in a bad way, like 'Wow, I can't believe he said that.' More like, 'Wow, he finally said something because he's a leader on that team and you definitely need to be a vocal leader." ...|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the election, the Rio de Janeiro bid {{committee}} lodged {{an official}} complaint against Madrid with the IOC Ethics Commission about comments made on September 30, 2009, by , {{vice president of}} the Spanish Olympic Committee (SOC); and considered doing it against Chicago due to comments by Richard M. Daley, Mayor of Chicago, on September 21, 2009. Odriozola called Rio de Janeiro [...] "the worst of the four candidates", while Rio officials believe that Daley implied that the city was incapable of hosting the Olympics <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "not the same as hosting the [...] FIFA World Cup". Mercedes Coghen apologised for Odriozola's comments on behalf of the Madrid bid committee. According to the IOC rules, rival cities are not allowed to directly criticise other bidders. After the conclusion of the bid process, Shintarō Ishihara, Governor of Tokyo, blamed [...] "invisible dynamics" [...] and political deals for Tokyo's failure. Rio officials repudiated [...] "the inappropriate statements" [...] and sent a formal notification to the IOC on October 6, 2009. On November 30, 2009, the Hollywood actor Robin Williams caused embarrassment due to humorous comments made in an interview with David Letterman. During the Late Show with David Letterman, broadcast by CBS, Williams said that Rio de Janeiro was elected as host city because it sent [...] "50 strippers and a pound of blow" [...] to compete with Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey, from Chicago. The comments were widely criticized by the Brazilian media and government authorities.|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

It was only this. [...] "Boys of the black flag, {{this is to be}} quickly done. Take all the prisoners you can. If they don't yield, kill the children to make them. Forward!" [...] Then, they all came on at the gate, and in another half-minute were smashing and splitting it in.|$|R
2500|$|Libby {{told the}} grand jury [...] "it seemed {{to me as if}} I was {{learning}} it for the first time" [...] when, according to his account, Russert told him about Plame on July 10 or 11, 2003. Only later, when looking at his calendar and notes, Libby said, did he remember that he actually learned the information from Cheney in June 2003. Libby told {{the grand jury}}: [...] "In the course of the document production, the FBI sent us a request for documents, or Justice Department, I'm not sure technically. In the course of that document production I came across the note that is dated on or about June 12, and the note... shows that I hadn't first learned it from Russert, although that was my memory, I had first learned it <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> to me." [...] The note Libby referred to contains no suggestion that either Cheney or Libby knew at the time of Ms. Wilson's undercover status or that her identity was classified, but they do show that Cheney did know and told Libby that Ms. Wilson was employed by the CIA and that she may have helped arrange her husband's trip.|$|E

5000|$|Later, Jamaluddin Jarjis {{was more}} {{specific}} {{as to the}} objective of the program <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that <b>it</b> [...] "was to create awareness among Malaysians the importance of science, technology and the space industry, which could help develop the economy further." ...|$|R

60|$|This {{short walk}} {{fatigued}} Philip thoroughly. He slept till dinner-time, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> awoke <b>said</b> <b>it</b> {{was the first}} refreshing dreamless sleep he had had for weeks. His head was much better, and at dinner he had something like an appetite.|$|R
60|$|The first work in {{the morning}} was to skin the wild beast. This was rather a {{difficult}} task since no one had had any experience, outside of the Rover boys, on small game. Old Jerry <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would try a steak cut from {{the best part of the}} the animal, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> did <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was too tough to eat. Then the carcass was dragged away and flung into a hole between the rocks.|$|R
6000|$|We do not {{venture to}} write down what <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> <b>it</b> the blank look of the elderly lady and the {{peculiar}} look of the girl induced him to repeat the speech in his broken--his very much broken-- French, whereupon the old gentleman turned to him gravely and said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's good-bye, my lord," [...] said Blood. [...] "And there's another thing." [...] He proffered a {{parchment}} that he {{had drawn}} from his pocket. [...] "It's the commission. Bishop was right <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was a mistake." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He was dead--we thought," [...] replied Brackton, with a grim laugh. [...] "But he's alive again. He told me he'd been in Idaho fer two years, in the gold-fields.

60|$|I was condoling {{with a young}} English cabin-boy on board, {{upon the}} loss of these poor fellows, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was their own fault; they would never wear monkey-jackets, but clung to their thin India robes, even in the bitterest weather.

6000|$|... "Wal, I'm sure glad. I heerd Nash call an' {{ask you to}} go with him. I {{seen his}} eyes <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it....</b> Sure I know you'd never look at the likes of him.

6000|$|... "Why, it's Jees Uck!"

6000|$|Manifestly Doctor Branson's {{interest}} in Lane had advanced beyond the professional.

6000|$|... "I {{should be}} sorry," [...] pursued the minister, [...] "to have you dwell upon such things. There are certain ignoble facts in life {{which we can}} best combat by {{ignoring}} them.

6000|$|... 'Well, well,' says he, 'and so I am, I hope, too. But I am {{something}} else too, madam; for,' says he, 'to be plain with you, I am a cuckold, {{and she is}} a whore.' He spoke it in a kind of jest, but it was with such an awkward smile, that I perceived it was what struck very close to him, and he looked dismally <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lemuel shyly {{dropped the}} subject, not feeling himself {{able to cope}} with his elder in these railleries. He always felt his {{heaviness}} and clumsiness in talking with the editor, who fascinated him. He did not know but he had said too much about city people being aristocratic. It was not quite what he meant; he had really been thinking of Miss Carver, and how proud she was, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Poor Raymond! it {{was plain}} {{that he had}} little liking for {{anything}} that autumn. He rode over to Swanslea with Cecil, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was six miles off, she called it four; what he termed bare, marshy, and dreary, was in her eyes open and free; his swamp was her lake; and she ran about discovering charms and capabilities where he saw nothing but damp and dry rot, and, above all, banishment.|$|E
6000|$|Washington himself {{thought so}} when more {{experienced}} in warfare. Being asked, many years afterwards, whether {{he really had}} made such a speech about the whistling of bullets, [...] "If I said so," [...] replied he quietly, [...] "it was when I was young." [...] [Footnote: Gordon, Hist. Am. War, vol. ii., p. 203.] He was, indeed, but twenty-two years old <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it; <b>it</b> was just after his first battle; he was flushed with success, and was writing to a brother.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> <b>it</b> {{and kissed}} the big book, the hay-trusser arose, and seemed {{relieved}} at having made a start in a new direction. While standing in the porch a moment he saw a thick jet of wood smoke suddenly start up from the red chimney of a cottage near, and knew that the occupant had just lit her fire. He went round to the door, and the housewife agreed to prepare him some breakfast for a trifling payment, which was done. Then he started on the search {{for his wife and}} child.|$|R
5000|$|The Southern Review is a {{quarterly}} literary magazine that {{was established by}} Robert Penn Warren in 1935 {{at the behest of}} Charles W. Pipkin and funded by Huey Long as a part of his investment in Louisiana State University. It publishes fiction, poetry, critical essays, and excerpts from novels in progress by established and emerging writers and includes reproductions of visual art. The Southern Review continues to follow Warren's articulation of the mission <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that <b>it</b> gives [...] "writers decent company between the covers, and concentrates editorial authority sufficiently for the journal to have its own distinctive character and quality".|$|R
