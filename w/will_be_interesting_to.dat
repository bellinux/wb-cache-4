25|$|Gap Junctions {{have been}} {{observed}} in various animal organs and tissues where cells contact each other. From the 1950s to 1970s they were detected in crayfish nerves, rat pancreas, liver, adrenal cortex, epididymis, duodenum, muscle, Daphnia hepatic caecum, Hydra muscle, monkey retina, rabbit cornea, fish blastoderm, frog embryos, rabbit ovary, re-aggregating cells, cockroach hemocyte capsules, rabbit skin, chick embryos, human islet of Langerhans, goldfish and hamster pressure sensing acoustico-vestibular receptors, lamprey and tunicate heart, rat seminiferous tubules, myometrium, eye lens and cephalopod digestive epithelium. Since the 1970s gap junctions have continued {{to be found in}} nearly all animal cells that touch each other. By the 1990s new technology such as confocal microscopy allowed more rapid survey of large areas of tissue. Since the 1970s even tissues that were traditionally considered to possibly have isolated cells such as bone showed that the cells were still connected with gap junctions, however tenuously. Gap junctions appear to be in all animal organs and tissues and it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> find exceptions to this other than cells not normally in contact with neighboring cells. Adult skeletal muscle is a possible exception. It may be argued that if present in skeletal muscle, gap junctions might propagate contractions in an arbitrary way among cells making up the muscle. At least in some cases {{this may not be the}} case as shown in other muscle types that do have gap junctions. An indication of what results from reduction or absence of gap junctions may be indicated by analysis of cancers or the aging process.|$|E

He added that, [...] "hile Bow Wow's more mature stance suits him well, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see how his younger fans and mainstream R radio {{react to the}} teenage MC's new image. Either way, Bow Wow has proven that his act is no child's play."

500|$|After its publication, The Immortals of Meluha {{received}} mostly {{positive response}} from critics for its concept but the prose received mixed reviews. Pradip Bhattacharya from The Statesman {{felt that the}} [...] "plot skips along at a brisk pace, the characters are well etched and the reader’s attention {{is not allowed to}} flag. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see how the trilogy progresses.

500|$|David Blackwell of the American review site Enterline Media said, [...] "MI-5 really {{impressed}} {{me with the}} first two seasons. The third season does start {{out for the first}} three episodes before it reaches some highs and lows until it stabilizes with the last two episodes of season 3." [...] He felt that Tom Quinn's exit was his favourite moment in the first two episodes, and that Adam is [...] "just [...] cold" [...] as Tom. He also praised the character development, stating [...] "character development is excellent in this season. Danny receives great moments as he is brought into the spotlight from his feelings for Zoe to his conflicted feelings about things he does in the name of Queen and Country, but Danny doesn't break and let his emotions become a crutch like Tom did (when Tom wanted a sleeper agent not to the job MI-5 wanted the sleeper to do)." [...] Blackwell concluded by saying [...] "sometime MI-5 fails as a show this season, but it still reaches levels of greatness. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see what they have in store for season 4." ...|$|E

[...] Corey Schroeder [...] of Comic Vine gave it five stars writing, [...] "Without going into TOO much detail, I will say that I love that this issue brings back a trope from old Thor comics and applies it to Valkyrie in a way that is far more interesting than even the original was." [...] Grey gave it a 9.3, writing, [...] "There's an energy to the book's visuals that is equal parts elegant and exciting. Bunn and Hans make for a hell of a team and issue #7 proves to be one of the series' best yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on 29 October 2007 that Patsy Palmer would be reprising {{the role of}} Bianca in EastEnders. A day later, it {{was announced}} that Sid Owen would also be returning to the show as Ricky. Owen commented: [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see what has been happening to Ricky and Bianca over the last few years. Although, I must admit I'm not looking forward to her nagging me by shouting his name." [...] Executive producer Diederick Santer commented: [...] "First Patsy comes home, now Sid! Ricky and Bianca were a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show [...] Seeing Bianca back on the show is exciting in itself, but to throw Ricky into the equation gives things an added dimension. Ricky's a great and much-loved character in his own right, but what's really exciting to me is the two of them together. There's so much history, drama and passion to explore [...] There'll always be a connection between Ricky and Bianca". To promote the characters' return, the BBC began airing trailers across the BBC network in March 2008. One trailer utilised Bianca's [...] "trademark holler" [...] of Ricky's name, which is so loud that it smashes the windows of The Queen Victoria public house. The trailer featured the Righteous Brothers' song [...] "Hung on You".|$|E
2500|$|Non-video game {{publications}} gave {{high praise}} for the game also. [...] The Digital Fix gave it nine out of ten, saying that it [...] "marks a new direction for the series and one that deserves your attention. Not only does it provide top notch visuals, a fantastic summer soundtrack and a wealth of racing options, it makes a traditionally sterile racing simulator just down right [...] fun." [...] The Daily Telegraph gave it a score of four stars out of five, calling it [...] "a thrilling, charismatic, feel-good racer. They are the definitions that matter." [...] The Globe and Mail also gave it a score of eight out of ten, calling it [...] "a refreshing take on the racing genre that successfully straddles the line between serious car porn simulation and arcade-like bang 'em up games (including its voracious hunger for your [...] "quarters")." [...] Digital Spy similarly gave it four stars out of five, saying, [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> see how Forza Horizon fares against , Criterion's new open world racer that is out next month. But {{in the absence of}} that review, it is clear that Playground Games has seriously raised the bar in all areas for the non-linear racing genre with Forza Horizon, and others will now have to play catchup." [...] The Guardian likewise gave it four stars out of five, stating, [...] "The game's most compelling aspect is its almost RPG-like popularity engine, which encourages you to see every slight kink in the road as a means to show off. If driving like a hooligan without having to face any consequences – in cars you'll never be able to afford – sounds appealing, then you'll love Forza Horizon. Whether by accident or design, Microsoft has hit upon a format that gives its flagship driving franchise the credibility it previously lacked." ...|$|E
