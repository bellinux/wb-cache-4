5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{damaged or}} <b>wrecked</b> numerous vessels. Six ships were <b>wrecked</b> or {{grounded in the}} Bahamas, and the crews of at least two, the John Stanley and the Linea, had to be rescued. The steamship Santiago de Cuba left port on August 4, and began to encounter squally conditions later that afternoon. Heavy seas and a strong gale inflicted some damage on the vessel. Several ships along the eastern coast of Cuba were <b>wrecked</b> during the storm, leading to great uncertainty and concern regarding {{the fate of the}} Santiago. At least three vessels were lost or grounded along the Florida Keys.|$|E

5|$|Comet was recommissioned in 1869 {{to perform}} the same duties as in the {{previous}} year; 1870 followed the same pattern as well, until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July interrupted Comets activities. On 16 July, Comet was assigned to the defense force in the Jade Bay outside Wilhelmshaven, but she saw no action during the conflict. She was decommissioned on 29 April 1871, at which point an investigation of her hull revealed the necessity of a major overhaul, which was done at the Königliche Werft in Danzig. Work ended in May 1872. In December, Comet was sent into the Baltic to search for vessels that had been <b>wrecked</b> in a severe storm, and if necessary, sink them to prevent them from becoming navigational hazards. She returned to Kiel without having located any wrecks on 31 December, in advance of the heavy sea ice that occurred in the Baltic every winter. Admiral Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the German admiralty, did not consider Comet to have sufficiently performed her duties, and so he relieved her captain of his command. With a new commander, Comet was sent out again on 5 January 1873, and this time did succeed in finding and sinking several <b>wrecked</b> vessels. After returning to Kiel on 24 January, she was decommissioned, but was temporarily recommissioned from 5 to 20 March for another patrol in the Baltic for <b>wrecked</b> ships. During this period, a detachment from the Torpedo Division based in Wilhelmshaven came aboard the vessel to test their new towed torpedoes. On 12 March, while cruising north of Cape Arkona, Comet encountered a <b>wrecked</b> vessel and was able to sink it with one of the torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 the Kirkhill was <b>wrecked</b> {{on a rock}} {{near the}} Falkland Islands. Stuart survived the sinking and {{returned}} to England to continue his training. He was posted to a new ship upon his return but she too was <b>wrecked</b> by a cyclone off the Florida coast. Eventually, after several years service he achieved his mariner's qualifications and gained {{a job with the}} Allan Line as a junior officer. He then served in a variety of sailing and steam ships traveling across most of the world. In 1910, the Allan Line was taken over by the Canadian Pacific Line and he continued working with the company's new owners as a junior ship's officer.|$|E
50|$|The 2002 {{discovery}} of the <b>wreck</b> {{turned out to be}} incorrect, with the <b>wreck</b> of the auxiliary cruiser HMS Patia being misidentified by amateur divers. SS Armenian was featured on the History Channel in an episode of Deep <b>Wreck</b> Mysteries entitled Search for the Bone <b>Wreck</b> where it was successfully located and identified by the <b>wreck</b> hunter and archaeologist Innes McCartney.

25|$|The British Protection of <b>Wrecks</b> Act, enacted {{to protect}} {{historic}} <b>wrecks,</b> controls access to <b>wrecks</b> such as Cattewater <b>Wreck</b> {{which can only}} be visited or investigated under licence. The British Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 also restricts access to <b>wrecks</b> which are sensitive as war graves. The Protection of Military Remains Act in some cases creates a blanket ban on all diving; for other <b>wrecks</b> divers may visit provided they do not touch, interfere with or penetrate the <b>wreck.</b> In the United States, shipwrecks in state waters are regulated by the Abandoned Shipwrecks Act of 1987. This act is much more lenient in allowing more open access to the shipwrecks.|$|R
5|$|In Haiti, the {{southern}} {{periphery of the}} hurricane killed three people in Port au Prince. Later, Donna brushed the north coast of Cuba with strong winds and heavy rainfall, causing damage along much of the coast. In Gibara, the storm <b>wrecked</b> 80houses.|$|E

50|$|So-called <b>wreck</b> masters {{used to be}} {{employed}} in the Danish coastal communities, in order to oversee, report on and collect valuables from new <b>wrecks.</b> A former <b>wreck</b> masters home can be experienced at the <b>Wreck</b> Master's Farm near Rubjerg Knude on the North Atlantic coast for example. The last <b>wreck</b> master here left in 1992.

25|$|The <b>wreck</b> {{is rapidly}} {{disintegrating}} due to natural rusting. The dive boats {{that rely on}} the <b>wreck</b> for their livelihood are also tearing the <b>wreck</b> apart by mooring the boats to weak parts of the <b>wreck,</b> leading to parts of the <b>wreck</b> collapsing. For this reason, in December 2007 the Hurghada Environmental Protection and Conservation Association (HEPCA) a non-governmental organisation installed 32 permanent mooring buoys and drilled holes in the <b>wreck</b> to allow trapped air to escape. During this work, the vessel was closed off to recreational diving. However, as of 2009, none of these moorings remain as the blocks themselves were too light (resulting in ships dragging them), and the lines connecting the moorings to the <b>wreck</b> were too long (meaning with the strong currents in the area, people would find it impossible to transfer from the mooring to the actual <b>wreck).</b> As a result, all boats now moor off directly to the <b>wreck</b> again.|$|R
