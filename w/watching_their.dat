5|$|During the screenwriting process when Ephron {{would not}} feel like writing, she would {{interview}} people {{who worked for the}} production company. Some of the interviews appeared in the film as the interludes between certain scenes featuring couples talking about how they met, although the material was rewritten and reshot with actors. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. For example, in the scene where Sally and Harry appear on a split screen, talking on the telephone while <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> respective television sets, channel surfing, was something that Crystal and Reiner did every night.|$|E
5|$|The Kaurava's {{learn about}} Kichaka's death {{due to a}} woman married to five Gandharvas in mysterious circumstances. They doubt that the Pandavas are hidden in Matsya and launch {{an attack on the}} kingdom's cattle. With all the {{soldiers}} engaged in war with Kauravas' allies, Virata's palace is almost empty. When Kauravas attack the remaining cattle, Uttara Kumara swears to fight against them. However, after <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> military troops, Uttara Kumara loses his confidence. Brihannala, who is his charioteer, volunteers to fight if Uttara Kumara handles the chariot, to which Uttara Kumara agrees.|$|E

5|$|Red {{follows a}} {{familiar}} scent and is reunited with her sister, {{a single mother}} with three chicks. The two hunt together and bring food back to the nest for the young. A white pterosaur, one Red has seen since she hatched, helps the two by finding carrion and prey {{in exchange for a}} helping of meat. On one hunting expedition, when the two adult Utahraptor are stalking a herd of Iguanodon, Red spies a young male Utahraptor that is <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> prey. He begins a courtship dance for Red, but Red's sister chases him off, hissing. Her growls agitate the Iguanodon, who stampede; the male hastily leaves. After climbing into a tree to escape a flash flood, Red encounters the male raptor again, who performs a courtship dance while hanging onto the tree branches. Red's sister begrudgingly allows the male to stay with them, provided he steers clear of her chicks.|$|E
5|$|The Allied commanders now {{marched to}} Friedberg, <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> enemy {{across the river}} Lech in Augsburg, {{at the same time}} {{preventing}} them from entering Bavaria or drawing from it any supplies. But the transfer of Bavaria from the party of the Two Crowns to the Grand Alliance was the prime concern to the Allies. As the Elector sat behind his defences at Augsburg Marlborough sent his troops deep into Bavaria on raids of destruction, burning buildings and destroying crops, trying to lure the Bavarian commander into battle or convince him to change his allegiance back to Emperor Leopold I. The Emperor had offered a full pardon, as well as subsidies and restoration of all his territories, with additional lands of Pfalz-Neuburg and Burgau if he returned to the Imperial fold, but negotiations between the parties were making little headway.|$|E
25|$|Children {{of alcoholics}} are often unable to trust other adults due to fear of abandonment. Further, because {{children}} learn their bonding behaviors from <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> parents’ interactions, daughters of alcoholic fathers {{may be unable}} to interact appropriately with men when they reach adulthood. Poor behavior modeling by alcoholic parents contributes to inadequate understanding of how to engage in opposite gender interactions.|$|E

At the Old Bailey on 4 March 1969, both were found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation that they should each serve a minimum of 30 years.

By the mid-1930s, the La Follettes had reformed the Progressive Party {{on the state}} level {{in the form of the}} Wisconsin Progressive Party. The party quickly, if briefly, became the dominant political power in the state, electing seven Progressive congressmen in 1934 and 1936. Their older son, Philip La Follette, was elected Governor of Wisconsin; their younger son, Robert M. La Follette Jr., succeeded his father as Senator, leading a caucus of Progressives composed of Progressive, Farmer-Labor, American Labor, and various Republican and Democratic Party congressional representatives.|$|E

25|$|As {{children}} {{gain more}} {{roles and responsibilities}} within their families, their eagerness to participate also increases. For example, Young Mayan children of San Pedro, Guatemala learn {{to work in the}} fields and family run businesses because they are motivated to contribute to their family. Many San Pedro women learned to weave by <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> mothers sew when they were children, sometimes earning their own wool through doing small tasks such as watching young children of busy mothers. Eager to learn and contribute, these young girls helped other members of their community in order to help their mothers with their weaving businesses or through other tasks such as helping carry water while young boys helped with tasks such as carrying firewood alongside their fathers.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1960s there was growing {{concern in the}} United States {{about the effects of}} urban sprawl and the {{resulting}} urban decay that followed. Major cities across the country were <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> downtown cores turn into ghost towns as the suburbs expanded and caused a flight of capital out of the cities. The only cities that were combatting this were the ones with effective mass transit systems, cities like New York City and Boston, where the utility of the subway was greater than a car. However, these solutions were extremely expensive to develop, well beyond the budgets of smaller cities or the suburbs of larger ones. Through the 1960s there was a growing movement in urban planning circles that the solution was the personal rapid transit system, small automated vehicles that were much less expensive to develop.|$|E
25|$|Óscar Malherbe de León {{was born}} in Mexico on 10 January 1964. Before joining the drug trade, he was a shoeshiner and a car washer for several local drug lords. He then turned to car theft and was later {{recruited}} by the crime boss Casimiro Espinoza Campos (alias El Cacho) in 1976 and join the Gulf Cartel. Espinoza Campos headed a criminal cell in Matamoros that oversaw the area's auto theft industry, drug trafficking rings, protection rackets, and the cartel's score-settlings. By the 1980s, Malherbe's notoriety within the Gulf Cartel grew because he {{proved to be a}} cold-blooded and cunning assassin. At the age of 22, he was indicted by the Public Ministry of Matamoros (Spanish: Ministerio Público de Matamoros) and was alleged to have been involved in at least 10 homicides from 1983 to 1984. The name of the late Luis Medrano García, another leader in the Gulf Cartel arrested in 1993 in Ciudad Juárez, also appeared in the indictment. Medrano and Malherbe usually worked together by supervising the drug trafficking shipments in the corridor of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Both of them had from six to eight armed henchmen <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> backs inside a walled compound from where they hid and gave orders.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide said [...] "A deliberately mawkish Christmas episode that is low on good jokes (although the Simpsons <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> own fire on television is a good start) and a retread of any number of episodes where Bart does wrong, feels guilty and eventually has to fess up. The only real ray of sunshine is the closing moments when the neighbours get their revenge but the Simpsons find the family spirit after all." ...|$|E

[...] Actor Phil Hartman made his fourth guest appearance on The Simpsons in this episode {{as the voice of}} celebrity Troy McClure.

Moore's parents, who were <b>watching</b> <b>their</b> son on {{television}} when the attack happened, also sued, seeking CAD$1.5 million for [...] "negligent infliction of nervous shock and mental distress". In December 2006, Bettman and top lieutenant Bill Daly facilitated {{a meeting between}} Moore's representatives and the defendants in hopes of agreeing on an out-of-court settlement.

Played to perfection by Donna Mills, Abby is wicked, vicious, bitchy, and heartless enough to keep us loving and hating her for years.
