5|$|In Romanian historiography, the {{consensus}} describes Menumorut {{as one of}} the three Romanian rulers <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> resist the Magyar conquest of the intra-Carpathian regions of present-day Romania. According to the Gesta, the Magyars eventually besieged and seized Menumorut's fortress at Biharia, and forced him to give his daughter in marriage to Zoltán, the son of Árpád, the Grand Prince of the Hungarians. The chronicle states that Menumorut died around 906 and was succeeded by his son-in-law.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Seljuks were {{advancing}} towards al-Jazira, and {{the descendants}} of Qatada ibn Idris fought with their Ayyubid overlords over control of Mecca. The conflict between them was taken advantage of by the Rasulids of Yemen <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> end Ayyubid suzerainty in the Hejaz and bring the region under their control which they accomplished in 1238 when Nur al-Din Umar captured Mecca.|$|E
5|$|The Scandinavian {{influence}} in Scotland was probably {{at its height}} in the mid eleventh century {{during the time of}} Thorfinn Sigurdsson, <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> create a single political and ecclesiastical domain stretching from Shetland to Man. The permanent Scandinavian holdings in Scotland at that time must therefore have been at least a quarter of the land area of modern Scotland.|$|E

5|$|The cyclone {{produced}} peak {{winds of}} 50mph (85km/h) in Nassau, Bahamas, causing no reported damage. Crops were damaged by high winds and heavy precipitation on Eleuthera. About 30 {{percent of the}} tomato crops were destroyed during the storm. A man <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> secretly seed and weaken the storm was missing and presumed dead after his plane disappeared off Miami, Florida. Multiple searches by the Coast Guard were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} {{that something was}} wrong at Vrbanja Bridge was radio silence from the French post. About 05:20 on 27 May, platoon commander Captain François Lecointre had lost radio contact with the posts, and drove to the bridge {{to find out what was}} happening; he was met by a Serb sentry in French uniform <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> take him prisoner. Lecointre quickly turned around and drove to Skenderija stadium, the headquarters of FREBAT4.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} modern AI were planted by {{classical}} philosophers <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> describe {{the process of}} human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in {{the invention of the}} programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.|$|E

5|$|An {{energetic}} and ambitious ruler, Michael Shishman led an aggressive but opportunistic and inconsistent foreign policy against the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia, {{which ended in}} the disastrous battle of Velbazhd which claimed his own life. He was the last medieval Bulgarian ruler who aimed at military and political hegemony of the Bulgarian Empire over the Balkans {{and the last one}} <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> seize Constantinople. He was succeeded by his son Ivan Stephen and later by his nephew Ivan Alexander, who reversed his policy by forming an alliance with Serbia.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the senior}} monks of Gautama Buddha, some of Koṇḍañña's {{writings}} and discourses to other monks are recorded in the literature. A poem consisting of sixteen verses in the Theragatha is attributed to him. The first of these {{is said to have}} been recited by Sacca in praise of Koṇḍañña, after Koṇḍañña had preached the Four Noble Truths to Sacca. In other verses, Koṇḍañña is shown admonishing monks who had fallen into ways contrary to Buddhist teaching. Koṇḍañña also acknowledged his own struggles against Mara, the demon <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> prevent the enlightenment of the Buddha. Koṇḍañña was also praised in the Udana by the Buddha, who observed his deliverance from the destructiveness of craving.|$|E
5|$|As {{soldiers}} {{approached the}} sacristy, {{one of the}} young sons of defender Anthony Wolf stood to pull a blanket over his shoulders. In the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him. Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker, <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> hide behind Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted in front of the women. Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy. Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Between 355 and 351BC, Demosthenes {{continued}} practising law privately {{while he}} was becoming increasingly interested in public affairs. During this period, he wrote Against Androtion and Against Leptines, two fierce attacks on individuals <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> repeal certain tax exemptions. In Against Timocrates and Against Aristocrates, he advocated eliminating corruption. All these speeches, which offer early glimpses of his general principles on foreign policy, such as {{the importance of the}} navy, of alliances and of national honour, are prosecutions (graphē paranómōn) against individuals accused of illegally proposing legislative texts.|$|E
5|$|During her regency in Hungary, Elizabeth faced several rebellions led by John Horvat and John of Palisna, <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> take {{advantage}} of Mary's insecure reign. In 1385, they invited King CharlesIII of Naples to depose Mary and assume the crown. Elizabeth responded by having Charles murdered two months after his coronation, in 1386. She had the crown restored to her daughter and established herself as regent once more, only to be captured, imprisoned and ultimately strangled by her enemies.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey {{submitted}} to John in 1206, and his lands {{were returned to}} him. But in 1207 Geoffrey led the clergy of England in their refusal to pay royal taxation and was forced into exile. Geoffrey excommunicated anyone <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> collect the tax in his archdiocese, but the king confiscated Geoffrey's estates in retaliation. Geoffrey once again secured the support of Pope Innocent, who ordered John to restore Geoffrey's possessions, {{but in the meantime}} the archbishop had fled to France. A medieval chronicler, Geoffrey of Coldingham, stated that the English church considered Geoffrey a martyr because of this stand against King John.|$|E

5|$|Henry VIII died in 1547 and Edward succeeded him. Mary {{inherited}} estates in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, and {{was granted}} Hunsdon and Beaulieu as her own. Since Edward {{was still a}} child, rule passed to a regency council dominated by Protestants, <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> establish their faith throughout the country. For example, the Act of Uniformity 1549 prescribed Protestant rites for church services, {{such as the use}} of Thomas Cranmer's new Book of Common Prayer. Mary remained faithful to Roman Catholicism and defiantly celebrated the traditional Mass in her own chapel. She appealed to her cousin Emperor Charles V to apply diplomatic pressure demanding that she be allowed to practice her religion.|$|E
5|$|In October 1675 the Swedish fleet under Gustaf Otto Stenbock put to sea, but sailed {{no further}} than Stora Karlsö off Gotland before it had to turn back to Stockholm after less than two weeks, beset by cold and stormy weather, disease, {{and the loss of}} vital equipment. Stenbock, held {{personally}} responsible for the failure by King Charles XI, was forced to pay for the campaign out of his own pocket. During the winter of 1675–76 the Swedish fleet was placed under the command of Lorentz Creutz, <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> put to sea in January to February 1676, but was iced in by exceptionally cold weather.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century Deddington Castle {{was adapted}} {{for use as}} a {{sporting}} facility by the local gentry. It was sold to Deddington's parish council, <b>who</b> <b>attempted</b> <b>to</b> build tennis courts in the inner bailey in 1947. Following the discovery of medieval remains and a subsequent archaeological investigation, these plans were abandoned and the western half of the castle became a local park. In the 21st century, English Heritage manage the inner bailey, the eastern half remaining in use for farming, and the site as a whole is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
