500|$|The terms animal testing, animal experimentation, animal research, in vivo testing, and {{vivisection}} {{have similar}} denotations but different connotations. Literally, [...] "vivisection" [...] means the [...] "cutting up" [...] {{of a living}} animal, and historically referred only to experiments that involved the dissection of live animals. The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals; for example, the Encyclopædia Britannica defines [...] "vivisection" [...] as: [...] "Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals", although dictionaries {{point out that the}} broader definition is [...] "used only by people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> such work". The word has a negative connotation, implying torture, suffering, and death. The word [...] "vivisection" [...] is preferred by those opposed to this research, whereas scientists typically use the term [...] "animal experimentation".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} acts of newly elected Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin was an {{executive}} order to remove clerks' names from the state marriage licenses. Bevin expressed his hope on November 6, 2015, that the executive order will protect the religious beliefs of officials <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> gay marriage. Kim Davis and her attorneys at Liberty Counsel immediately requested that the court dismiss her appeals, because the new regulation provides a religious accommodation for her and makes the case moot. Bunning agreed, dismissing the three lawsuits filed against her, saying the new governor's order to use a license form that {{does not require the}} county clerk's signature has removed the controversy before the court. Davis' attorneys asserted that such a legislative victory resolves the matter; the couples did not prevail against Davis, therefore they are not entitled to demand that Davis reimburse their legal fees. However, by May 2017, a Cincinnati federal appeals court found that Bunning had erred in finding that damages claims by David Ermold and David Moore became moot, saying, [...] "The district court's characterization of this case as simply contesting the 'no marriage licenses' policy is inaccurate, because Ermold and Moore did not seek an injunction—they sought only damages"; observing that the record does not prevent damages claims. The three-judge panel granted leave for the couple to sue for damages over one marriage license. Their case was sent back to Bunning, where he stated that the state of Kentucky was obligated to pay $222,695 in legal fees. The ACLU itself sued Davis to recover $233,000 in legal fees, but the motion was denied; the organization was not a [...] "prevailing party" [...] in the legal action.|$|E

Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform {{for the first time this}} year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion.

6000|$|... "Mr. Moderator," [...] he continued, [...] "as this {{question}} has altogether assumed a party character, it is manifestly proper {{that the party}} which has the majority should not be encumbered in its proceedings by {{the movements of the}} minority. Presbytery has been denounced by this meeting, and its friends stand in the light of a defeated party at a state election. They can have nothin' to do with the government. I move, therefore, that those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> presbytery go into caucus, in order to appoint a committee to recommend to the majority a denomination which will be acceptable to the people of Ravensnest. I hope the motion will be put without debate. The subject is a religious one, and it is unwise to awaken strife on anything at all connected with religion." ...|$|E
60|$|Lastly, I would ask, is not Congress itself under {{obligation}} to give legislative support to any right that is established under the United States Constitution? I repeat the question, is not Congress itself bound to give legislative support to any right that is {{established in the}} United States Constitution? A member of Congress swears to support the Constitution of the United States, and if he sees a right established by that Constitution which needs specific legislative protection, can he clear his oath without giving that protection? Let me ask you why many of us, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>to</b> slavery upon principle, give our acquiescence to a fugitive-slave law? Why do we hold ourselves under obligations to pass such a law, and abide by it when passed? Because the Constitution makes provision that the owners of slaves shall {{have the right to}} reclaim them. It gives the right to reclaim slaves; and that right is, as Judge Douglas says, a barren right, unless there is legislation that will enforce it.|$|E
