The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin <b>was</b> <b>legally</b> reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.|$|E

5|$|However, in the 1920s Christian fundamentalists in the United States {{developed}} their literalist arguments against modernist theology into {{opposition to the}} teaching of evolution, with fears that Darwinism had led to German militarism and was a threat to religion and morality.

Although early objectors dismissed evolution as contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument <b>was</b> <b>legally</b> invalidated when the Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v. Arkansas in 1968 that forbidding the teaching of evolution on religious grounds violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E

5|$|In practice, Russian women saw mixed {{gains in}} their rights under Communism. Women's {{suffrage}} was granted, though voting meant little in Soviet society {{owing to the}} Communist Party's monopoly on power. This monopoly also meant that many independent feminist organizations and journals were shut down. Abortion was legalized in 1920, making the Soviet Union the first country to do so; however, it was banned again between 1936 and 1955. Generous maternity leave <b>was</b> <b>legally</b> required, and a national network of child-care centers was established. The country's first constitution recognized the equal rights of women.|$|E
