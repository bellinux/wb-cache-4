25|$|Know, good reader, {{that this}} towne of Shrewsbury, {{the place of}} my birth and {{residence}} is greatly troubled with a sect of men and women, with <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had much intercourse of concernment, not by way of intimate familiarity approving their ways, but of vexation and trouble of minde, that I could not, in thirteene yeares painfull ministry among them, reclaime them from their wandring fancies, and reduce them to obedience to Supreme majestie, in the persons of two most illustrious and royal kings.|$|E

60|$|Some of this multitude, however, I {{knew well}} enough {{even when they}} had {{departed}} years and years ago. But about these I noted this, {{that every one of}} them was a man or a woman or a child for <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> felt love or sympathy or friendship. Not one was a person <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> disliked or <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no wish to see again. If they spoke at all I could not hear--or read--their speech, yet to a certain extent I could hear their thoughts.|$|R

[...] In 1772, Franklin's sister Jane Franklin Mecom, wrote him with news of his grandsons. Franklin replied that it [...] "brings often afresh to my mind the idea of my son Franky, though now dead thirty-six years, <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seldom since seemed equaled in everything, and whom to this day I cannot think of without a sigh." ...|$|E
500|$|At one point, Thompson {{was asked}} by the National Institute on Media and the Family to stop invoking the organization's name in his campaigns. NIMF {{president}} David Walsh felt Thompson cast the organization in a bad light whenever he brought up their name. [...] "Your commentary has included extreme hyperbole and your tactics have included personally attacking individuals for <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a great deal of respect," [...] Walsh said in an open letter to Thompson.|$|E
500|$|John Quincy Adams {{concluded}} in 1821 that [...] "Calhoun {{is a man}} of fair and candid mind, of honorable principles, of clear and quick understanding, of cool self-possession, of enlarged philosophical views, and of ardent patriotism. He is above all sectional and factious prejudices more than any other statesman of this Union with <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever acted." [...] Historian Charles Wiltse noted Calhoun's evolution, [...] "Though he is known today primarily for his sectionalism, Calhoun was the last of the great political leaders of his time to take a sectional position—later than Daniel Webster, later than Henry Clay, later than Adams himself." ...|$|E

500|$|The tale {{is about}} {{undesirable}} elements of society. Warne objected to Potter's opening paragraph: [...] "I am quite tired of making goody goody books about nice people. I {{will make a}} book about two disagreeable people, called Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod." [...] He altered the text to read, [...] "I have made many books about well-behaved people." [...] Potter responded:If it were not impertinent to lecture one's publisher—you are a great deal too much afraid of the public, for <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never cared one tuppenny-button. [...] I have always thought the opening paragraph distinctly good, because it gets away from [...] "once upon a time".|$|E
500|$|He enterered the University of Pisa {{intending}} to study engineering, {{but after two}} years he decided to switch to physics in 1931. On {{the advice of his}} brother Guido, he decided to study at the University of Rome La Sapienza, where Enrico Fermi had gathered together a group of promising young scientists known as the Via Panisperna boys after the name of the street where the Institute of Physics of Rome University was then situated. At the age of 18 he was admitted to the third year of Physics. Fermi described Pontecorvo as [...] "scientifically one of the brightest men with <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come in contact in my scientific career". As their youngest member, the group nicknamed him Cucciolo, which means [...] "puppy".|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of Tallard's retreating troops headed for Höchstädt but most {{did not make}} the safety of the town, plunging instead into the Danube where upwards of 3,000 French horsemen drowned; others were cut down by the pursuing cavalry. The Marquis de Gruignan attempted a counter-attack, but he was easily brushed aside by the triumphant Allies. After a final rally behind his camp's tents, shouting entreaties to stand and fight, Marshal Tallard was caught up in the rout and pushed towards Sonderheim. Surrounded by a squadron of Hessian troops, Tallard surrendered to Lieutenant-Colonel de Boinenburg, the Prince of Hesse-Kassel's aide-de-camp, and was sent under escort to Marlborough. The Duke welcomed the French commander – [...] "I am very sorry that such a cruel misfortune should have fallen upon a soldier for <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the highest regard." [...] With salutes and courtesies, the Marshal was escorted to Marlborough's coach.|$|E

500|$|Parr's fame for {{severity}} {{spread a}} sort of panic through the city, especially among the mothers, who would sometimes interpose a remonstrance, which occasioned a ludicrous scene, but seldom availed the culprit, while the wiser were willing to leave their boys in his hands. Richard Twining, the tea merchant, however, was advised by his brother John to send his eldest son to Norwich, writing of Parr, [...] "I {{have been told that}} he flogs too much, but I doubt those from <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard it think any use of punishment too much". Parr's daily teaching was interrupted at midday when he sent a boy to the pastry-cook's across the road for a pie, which he ate by the schoolroom fire. On the resignation of his headship in 1785, historian Warren Derry comments, [...] "an object of terror was gone, but the glory of the place had gone with it".|$|E
500|$|Producer Marc E. Platt {{contacted}} actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: [...] "I {{have this}} list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me [...] writers, directors, actors <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{to work with}} before I go onto another career or do something else with my life." [...] Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had {{always been interested in}} doing an action-oriented project. Gosling claimed that he was simply put off from the genre, believing that the action films of today focused more on stunts instead of characters. Despite this, Platt heard back from the actor around 48 hours later. Gosling has stated that his strong attraction to the plot led him to take on the leading role of the unnamed driver, saying that he was drawn to the [...] "very strong character" [...] at its core, as well as the [...] "powerful" [...] romance.|$|E
500|$|In November 1943, Kesselring {{met with}} Hitler. Kesselring gave an optimistic {{assessment}} {{of the situation in}} Italy and gave reassurances that he could hold the Allies south of Rome on the Winter Line. Kesselring further promised that he could prevent the Allies reaching the Northern Apennines for at least six months. As a result, on 6 November 1943, Hitler ordered Rommel and his Army Group B headquarters to move to France to take charge of the Atlantic Wall and prepare for the Allied attack that was expected there in the spring of 1944. On 21 November 1943, Kesselring resumed command of all German forces in Italy, combining Commander-in-Chief South, a joint command, with that of Army Group C, a ground command. [...] "I had always blamed Kesselring", Hitler later explained, [...] "for looking at things too optimistically ... events have proved Rommel wrong, and I have been justified in my decision to leave Field Marshal Kesselring there, <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen as an incredible political idealist, but also as a military optimist, and it is my opinion that military leadership without optimism is not possible." ...|$|E

Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back". Vokes then announced his draconian decision. “I summoned my GSO1 [...] [...] ‘Mac,’ I roared at him, ‘I’m going to raze that goddam town.’” ...|$|R
500|$|On September 15, 2017, Douglas Elmendorf, {{dean of the}} Kennedy School, {{announced}} that Chelsea Manning {{had been invited to}} spend only one day at the school, and that her title of visiting fellow did not convey a special honor. [...] "We did not intend to honor her in any way," [...] Elmendorf wrote, [...] "or to endorse any of her words or deeds…. However, I now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a Visiting Fellow was a mistake, for which I accept responsibility. … Therefore, we are withdrawing the invitation to her to serve as a Visiting Fellow—and the perceived honor that it implies to some people—while maintaining the invitation for her to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the Forum. I apologize to her and to the many concerned people from <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard today for not recognizing upfront the full implications of our original invitation." [...] When Elmendorf phoned Manning, a member of her support team challenged him to explain why Harvard was so concerned about the title [...] "visiting fellow." [...] The team was alienated by his response, which they inferred suggested she had nothing to contribute. Manning then hung up on the dean.|$|E
500|$|Whorf was {{a spiritual}} man {{throughout}} his lifetime although what religion he followed {{has been the}} subject of debate. As a young man he produced a manuscript titled [...] "Why I have discarded evolution", causing some scholars to describe him as a devout Methodist Episcopalian, who was impressed with fundamentalism, and perhaps supportive of creationism. [...] However, throughout his life Whorf's main religious interest was theosophy, a nonsectarian organization based on Buddhist and Hindu teachings that promotes the view of the world as an interconnected whole and the unity and brotherhood of humankind [...] "without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color". Some scholars have argued that the conflict between spiritual and scientific inclinations have been a driving force in Whorf's intellectual development, particularly in the attraction by ideas of linguistic relativity. Some of Whorf's unpublished manuscripts on spirituality also suggest that he was influenced by the ideas of Helena Blavatsky the founder of the Theosophical Society who wrote about cosmic evolution, a belief that regards reincarnation to be the source of evolution of human races towards continuously higher forms. Whorf said that [...] "of all groups of people with <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come in contact, Theosophical people seem the most capable of becoming excited about ideas—new ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|Bond, already ambitious, asked Gilbert if {{he might}} be able to {{increase}} the size of her role. [...] Gilbert tried to mollify her in a letter, concluding, [...] "I am writing such a particularly good part for you in the new piece that I should be distressed beyond measure if you should leave us. I've never said as much as this to any actor or actress before. I don't say it to induce you to play so insignificant a part as Edith, for if you left us now, and came back to us to play that part, I should be satisfied. But if you didn't play it, my calculations would be all upset, and I should lose a dear little lady for <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always had a very special regard." [...] True to Gilbert's word, Edith was followed by a string of roles of increasing importance. [...] First was Lady Angela in Patience (1881–82). [...] Bond did not much like the role, writing later that she did not relate to the sentimental lady of luxury indulging in the aesthetic craze. At the same time, Bond was becoming known to theatregoers and attracting the attention of young men. [...] Having had such bad experiences with romance in the past, Bond ignored such attentions. [...] One poem sent to her by an admirer ran in mock-Gilbertian style as follows (in part): ...|$|E
