5|$|Cells {{that stop}} {{dividing}} (post-mitotic) and differentiate into neurons early in cortical development {{are important in}} laying the groundwork on <b>which</b> <b>other</b> developing neurons can be guided to their proper destination. Tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex. It is largely expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the preplate, which forms a foundation upon which neurons are able to grow and move. As a transcription factor, Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN, which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells. Thus, through regulation of Reln expression, Tbr1 regulates {{the formation of the}} matrix through which neurons migrate. Without Tbr1, neurons fail to migrate properly.|$|E

They were en route to enroll the two boys at Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut. Lorna Colbert relocated the family downtown to the more urban environment of East Bay Street in Charleston. Colbert found the transition difficult and did not easily make new friends in his new neighborhood. Colbert later described himself during this time as detached, lacking a sense of importance regarding the things with <b>which</b> <b>other</b> children concerned themselves.|$|E

5|$|The Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus) is an {{extinct species}} of parrot that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar. It is unclear to <b>which</b> <b>other</b> species {{it is most}} closely related, but it is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the tribe Psittaculini, along with other Mascarene parrots. The Rodrigues parrot bore similarities to the broad-billed parrot of Mauritius, and may have been related. Two additional species have been assigned to its genus (N. francicus and N. borbonicus), based on descriptions of parrots from the other Mascarene islands, but their identities and validity have been debated.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of the}} exosome {{contains}} a six-membered ring structure to <b>which</b> <b>other</b> proteins are attached. In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex {{is present in the}} cytoplasm, nucleus, and especially the nucleolus, although different proteins interact with the exosome complex in these compartments regulating the RNA degradation activity of the complex to substrates specific to these cell compartments. Substrates of the exosome include messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, and many species of small RNAs. The exosome has an exoribonucleolytic function, meaning it degrades RNA starting at one end (the 3′ end in this case), and in eukaryotes also an endoribonucleolytic function, meaning it cleaves RNA at sites within the molecule.|$|E

5|$|The type {{species is}} M. carinatus; seven other {{species have been}} named during the past 150years, but only M. kaalae among these is still {{considered}} valid. Early sauropodomorphs systematics have undergone numerous revisions during the last several years, and many scientists disagree where exactly Massospondylus lies on the dinosaur evolutionary tree. The family name Massospondylidae was once coined for the genus, but because knowledge of early sauropodomorph relationships {{is in a state}} of flux, it is unclear <b>which</b> <b>other</b> dinosaurs—if any—belong in a natural grouping of massospondylids; several 2007 papers support the family's validity.|$|E

In a review for Molinos, {{it was noted}} that The Paperboys consistently write pop songs with melodic hooks, <b>which</b> <b>other</b> prior Irish-rock inspired bands such as The Pogues and Oysterband, and others were not always successful at. Postcards, which has songs that range musically from bluegrass, zydeco, flamenco, Irish traditional, country, to Celtic-new-age-Native, and with songs that mix some of the themes, was described as a satisfying example of how far the versatile scope of The Paperboys' music extends.|$|E
5|$|US losses {{during the}} battle were {{extremely}} light; unusual for fighting {{at a time in}} <b>which</b> <b>other</b> UN offensive forces were paying a heavy price when making similar pushes against the North Korean troops. The US infantry forces suffered only five killed and 54 wounded in the 27th Infantry, plus three killed and 16 wounded in the 23rd Infantry. This brought the total American casualty count to 8 dead, 70 wounded. South Korean troops suffered much more heavily during the fight. An estimated 2,300 South Korean men were killed in the fighting; 2,244 enlisted men and 56 officers. However, these losses were not crippling, as volunteers poured in from the surrounding countryside to fight for the South Korean Army.|$|E

5|$|Epsilon Eridani has an {{estimated}} mass of 0.82 solar masses and a radius of 0.74 solar radii. It shines with a luminosity of only 0.34 solar luminosities. The estimated effective temperature is 5,084K. With a stellar classification of K2V, {{it is the}} second-nearest K-type main-sequence star (after Alpha Centauri B). Since 1943 the spectrum of Epsilon Eridani has served {{as one of the}} stable anchor points by <b>which</b> <b>other</b> stars are classified. Its metallicity, the fraction of elements heavier than helium, is slightly lower than the Sun's. In Epsilon Eridani's chromosphere, a region of the outer atmosphere just above the light emitting photosphere, the abundance of iron is estimated at 74% of the Sun's value. The proportion of lithium in the atmosphere is five times less than that in the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Historical eclipses {{are a very}} {{valuable}} resource for historians, in that they allow a few historical events to be dated precisely, from <b>which</b> <b>other</b> dates and ancient calendars may be deduced. A solar eclipse of June 15, 763 BC mentioned in an Assyrian text {{is important for the}} chronology of the ancient Near East. There have been other claims to date earlier eclipses. The Book of Joshua 10:13 could refer to an annular eclipse on 30 October 1207 BC. The King Zhong Kang supposedly beheaded two astronomers, Hsi and Ho, who failed to predict an eclipse 4,000 years ago. Perhaps the earliest still-unproven claim is that of archaeologist Bruce Masse, who putatively links an eclipse that occurred on May 10, 2807 BC with a possible meteor impact in the Indian Ocean on the basis of several ancient flood myths that mention a total solar eclipse.|$|E
