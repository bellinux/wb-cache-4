500|$|The Cape sparrow was {{featured}} on the lowest-denomination South African coin, from the farthing (¼-cent) in 1923 to the cent that ceased to be minted in 2002, with designs based on an original by George Kruger Gray.

500|$|In 2005, British indie band Half Man Half Biscuitperhaps {{best known}} for [...] "The Trumpton Riots" [...] and [...] "Dickie Davies Eyes"included a song {{entitled}} [...] "For What Is Chatteris..." [...] on their award-winning Achtung Bono album. The song extolled {{the virtues of the}} town, offset against how unsatisfying the best place in the world can suddenly become when the one you love is no longer there: [...] "a market town that lacks quintessence / that's Chatteris <b>without</b> <b>your</b> presence". News of the song made the headlines of the Cambridgeshire Times and the Peterborough Evening Telegraph during September 2005, a month before the album's official release.|$|E
500|$|... "You're Mine (Eternal)" [...] is an R {{love song}} written and {{produced}} by Carey and Rodney Jerkins. The song is composed {{in the key}} of D major using common time and a moderately slow feel of 75beats per minute. Carey employs a breathy vocal style as she sings the lyric [...] "I can't seem to live <b>without</b> <b>your</b> love". Lyrically, Carey reminisces about a past lover, singing [...] "I can't seem to live <b>without</b> <b>your</b> love/ Suffocating here by myself/ Dying for your touch". Instrumentation consists of hypnotic, [...] "smooth, steady" [...] piano beat, which slowly builds to a climax with Carey hitting a whistle note for a sustained period of time {{at the end of}} the song. Music Times writer Carolyn Menyes described the [...] "up-and-down" [...] melodic structure as [...] "captivating", which causes the listener to be drawn [...] "deep into Carey's musical abyss". The urban remix featuring Songz incorporates an enhanced pop feel compared to the original, with additional drums and Auto-Tune on Songz vocals. [...] "You're Mine" [...] garnered comparisons to one of Carey's previous singles [...] "We Belong Together" [...] (2005). While Christina Garibaldi of MTV News and Jamieson Cox of Time simply highlighted that they have similar melodic structures and vocals styles, Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine was critical of the likeness between the two songs, writing that she was disappointed to hear a [...] "retread" [...] of [...] "We Belong Together" [...] following the positively received [...] "retro" [...] first and second singles [...] "#Beautiful" [...] featuring Miguel and [...] "The Art of Letting Go", respectively.|$|E

500|$|... "Born to Make You Happy" [...] is a teen pop and dance-pop {{song that}} lasts for four minutes and three seconds. The song is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of B minor and is set in time signature of common time, with a moderately slow tempo of 88 beats per minute. Spears vocal range spans over an octave, from F3 to B4. The song's lyrics are about a relationship that a woman desires to correct, not quite understanding what went wrong, as she comes to realize that [...] "I don't know how to live <b>without</b> <b>your</b> love/I was born to make you happy". The song has a basic sequence of Bm–G–D–A as its chord progression.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Sometimes" [...] is ...Baby One More Time's fourth track, [...] "Soda Pop", a {{song that}} draws {{influences}} from bubblegum pop and dancehall, and features background vocals from co-writer Mikey Bassie. Spears' vocals on the fifth track and fourth single, [...] "Born to Make You Happy", span more than an octave. Its lyrics allude to a relationship that a woman desires to repair, not quite understanding what went wrong, as she comes to realize that [...] "I don't know how to live <b>without</b> <b>your</b> love/I was born to make you happy". The sixth track and final single, [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart", is a sentimental slow-tempo teen pop ballad.|$|E

500|$|For the new songs, Madonna {{worked with}} David Foster, a {{well-known}} producer {{who had worked}} with the likes of Barbra Streisand, Al Jarreau and Earth, Wind & Fire. Foster initially did not expect Madonna would collaborate with him, as he believed that his music would not [...] "really [...] hip enough for her". The recording session with Foster resulted in two new songs to the final track list, [...] "You'll See" [...] and [...] "One More Chance". Foster commented: [...] "At the end of the day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, 'You'll See', was really neat. Madonna had written a great lyric ('You think that I can't live <b>without</b> <b>your</b> love / You'll see') and I thought my music was great". The track was produced and arranged by Madonna and Foster, who worked on the song during the third weekend of September 1995.|$|E
500|$|In 1908 Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra parted company, disagreeing about artistic control and, in particular, {{the deputy}} system. Under this system, orchestral players, if offered a better-paid {{engagement}} elsewhere, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. [...] The {{treasurer of the}} Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: [...] "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, <b>without</b> <b>your</b> knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able {{to play at the}} concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away." [...] Henry Wood had already banned the deputy system in the Queen's Hall Orchestra (provoking rebel players to found the London Symphony Orchestra), and Beecham followed suit. [...] The New Symphony Orchestra survived without him and subsequently became the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra.|$|E
500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{called it}} [...] "A first-rate action thriller, a vivid {{evocation}} of urban warfare in Iraq, a penetrating study of heroism and {{a showcase for}} austere technique, terse writing and a trio of brilliant performances."

If you can sit through The Hurt Locker <b>without</b> <b>your</b> heart nearly pounding through your chest, you must be made of granite." [...] Entertainment Weeklys film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film the rare [...] "A" [...] rating, calling it, [...] "an intense, action-driven war pic, a muscular, efficient standout that simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within {{as well as what}} it looks like on the ground.

500|$|Creating the {{orchestra}} admired by Strauss {{had not been}} achieved without a struggle. In 1904, Wood and Newman tackled the deputy system, in which orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: [...] "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, <b>without</b> <b>your</b> knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able {{to play at the}} concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away." [...] After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra, Newman came on the platform to announce: [...] "Gentlemen, in future there will be no deputies; good morning." [...] Forty players resigned en bloc and formed their own orchestra: the London Symphony Orchestra. Wood bore no grudge and attended their first concert, although it was 12 years before he agreed to conduct {{the orchestra}}.|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} commented on Frink's inventions. Patrick Goss of MSN's Tech & Gadgets wrote that [...] "When {{it comes to}} gizmos, Frink is the king", and listed the Death Ray {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} gadgets featured in The Simpsons. Although he added that it [...] "was not one of [...] most successful," [...] since it never received the funding it needed from Grampa. On the same list, Goss also featured Frink's automatic phone dialer, intra bovine ice-cream maker (an invention that is inserted into a cow and uses the four stomachs to mix the various ingredients), and hamburger earmuffs. In a profile about Frink, the publication UGO Networks wrote: [...] "Where would the town be <b>without</b> <b>your</b> Jerry Lewis/Julius Kelp-inspired voice and antics? A lot safer most likely. Professor John Frink's inventions range from distracting to disruptive. Who can forget his hamburger earmuffs? Or his teleportation device, responsible for switching Bart Simpson's head with that of a housefly?" [...] Howard Waldrop and Lawrence Person of Locus listed the scene in The Simpsons Movie that features Frink's drilling machine invention as one of the highlights of the film.|$|E
500|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century there were no {{permanent}} salaried orchestras in London. The main orchestras were those of Covent Garden, the Philharmonic Society and the Queen's Hall; their proprietors engaged players individually for each concert or for a season. As there were competing demands for the services of the finest players it was an accepted practice that, even though under contract to play for a concert, a player was at liberty to accept a better-paid engagement if it were offered. He would then engage another player to deputise at him for the original concert and the rehearsals for it. The treasurer of the Philharmonic Society described the system thus: [...] "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, <b>without</b> <b>your</b> knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away." [...] There was much competition for good orchestral players, with well-paid engagements offered by more than fifty music halls, by pit bands in West End musical comedies, and by grand hotels and restaurants which maintained orchestras.|$|E

500|$|Reilly further {{added that}} the renewal was also {{prompted}} by the high risk of trying to replace Fringe with another show with unknown viewership metrics; he commented that they [...] "have a far better shot of sticking with a show that has an audience that [...] think [...] can grow". Prior to {{the onset of the}} fourth season, Reilly reiterated that they do not expect any significant growth in Fringes viewership within that season: [...] "It’s a pretty complex show. If Fringe can do exactly what Fringe did last year, we’re going to be very happy. They’re right in the pocket creatively once again." [...] Wyman stated in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the Fox network had been [...] "supportive throughout this process", and though the show's viewership [...] "wasn't exactly what they would've hoped for", aspects such as a loyal fan base and supportive critics were enough to take the show forward for another season. Pinkner commented that [...] "there were no creative conditions" [...] on the show's renewal, nor any cuts in the show's budget, though was unsure if the show will be moved to a different time slot. Noble, at the 2011 Comic-Con Fringe panel, reiterated that the fans were responsible for the livelihood of the show, stated, [...] "Seriously, <b>without</b> <b>your</b> efforts, your rabid support, we wouldn’t be here right now. You are the best fans that ever existed". The fourth season premiered on September 23, 2011.|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} of orchestral playing in London was {{adversely affected by}} the deputy system, in which orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: [...] "A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. B, <b>without</b> <b>your</b> knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able {{to play at the}} concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away". The members of the Queen's Hall Orchestra were not highly paid; Wood recalled in his memoirs, [...] "the rank and file of the orchestra received only 45s a week for six Promenade concerts and three rehearsals, a guinea for one Symphony concert and rehearsal, and half-a-guinea for Sunday afternoon or evening concerts without rehearsal". Offered ad hoc engagements at better pay by other managements, many of the players took full advantage of the deputy system. Newman determined {{to put an end to}} it. After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra, Newman came on the platform to announce: [...] "Gentlemen, in future there will be no deputies; good morning". Forty players resigned en bloc and formed their own orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra. Newman did not attempt to bar the new orchestra from the Queen's Hall, and its first concert was given there on 9 June 1904, conducted by Richter.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's {{recording}} {{session with}} David Foster resulted two new songs {{to the final}} track listing, [...] "You'll See" [...] and [...] "One More Chance". Foster commented: [...] "At {{the end of the}} day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, [...] "You'll See", was really neat. Madonna had written a great lyric (You think that I can't live <b>without</b> <b>your</b> love / You'll see) and I thought my music was great." [...] "You'll See" [...] is a low bass track featuring wind chimes and a Spanish guitar. Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna's vocals dominance in the song, and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later. Lyrically, the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things. Madonna was asked whether the track was about revenge to which she replied [...] "No, it's about empowering yourself." [...] Madonna later recorded the Spanish version of [...] "You'll See" [...] in Gloria and Emilio Estefan's studio in Miami. Titled [...] "Verás", the song was adapted into Spanish by Paz Martinez. The next original song, [...] "One More Chance", is an acoustic ballad, whose lyrics are about attempting to win a lost lover back. The song was inspired by Madonna's real life experience, but she wrote it from the opposite point of view. Its composition has an organic arrangement, devoid of any synths and sequencing, and only based on guitars with plenty of chord changes and subdued strings.|$|E
