5|$|Species present {{all year}} round include little and great crested grebes, lapwing, redshank, tufted duck, gadwall, kingfisher, reed bunting, great spotted woodpecker, {{sparrowhawk}} and little owl. In the spring, passage waders visit the pools alongside the estuary; these include <b>whimbrel,</b> common, wood and green sandpipers, spotted redshank, common greenshank, avocet, godwit, little gull and black tern, and other migrants arriving at the reserve include wheatear, whinchat, redstart and black redstart.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{visitors}} to the island are the bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica baueri), grey-tailed tattler (Tringa brevipes), ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres interpres), red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis) and curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea). Other observed visitors include the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo novaehollandiae), nankeen kestrel (Falco cenchroides cenchroides), banded lapwing (Vanellus tricolor), greater sand plover (Charadrius leschenaultii), <b>whimbrel</b> (Numenius phaeopus variegatus), greenshank (Tringa nebularia), sanderling (Calidris alba), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys leucophrys) and brown songlark (Cincloramphus cruralis).|$|E
5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large expanse of {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common shelduck and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, <b>whimbrel,</b> and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E

50|$|Burntcoat Head is {{a popular}} {{location}} for migrating shorebirds, which include sandpipers, <b>whimbrels,</b> yellowlegs, willets, and plovers. During low tide when mud flats are exposed the birds will consume mud shrimps before heading south for the winter months.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the things}} that attract the most {{tourists}} is the great number of bird species to be found on the island. Thirty of the thirty-seven species of bird in Iceland are found there during the breeding season: puffins, terns, <b>whimbrels,</b> and plovers are examples.|$|R
5|$|Over 190 {{species of}} birds have been {{identified}} near the bay, some of which {{use it as a}} feeding ground during their migrations. Waders and wildfowl often over-winter on the reserve. The populations of <b>whimbrel</b> (Numenius phaeopus) and black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa) are internationally important. Significant populations of dunlin (Calidris alpina) and wigeon (Anas penelope) also frequent the bay. In early winter the wigeon select Puccinellia maritima in preference to Agrostis stolonifera and Festuca rubra. Avocets have become regular autumn and winter visitors to the area in recent years, favouring the lower reaches of the River Parrett, and, {{for the first time in}} over 50 years, bred on the reserve in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Several rivers, {{including}} the Parrett, Brue and Washford, drain into the bay. Man-made drainage ditches from the Somerset Levels, {{including the}} River Huntspill, also {{run into the}} bay. The mud flats provide a habitat {{for a wide range}} of flora and fauna. These include some nationally rare plants, beetles and snails. It is particularly important for over-wintering waders and wildfowl, with approximately 190 species recorded including <b>whimbrel</b> (Numenius phaeopus), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and wigeon (Anas penelope). Fishing has taken place using shallow boats, known as flatners, and fixed wooden structures for hundreds of years. It was also the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing'. There are several small harbours along the coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide variety}} of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane {{has been found to}} be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 {{discovered}} the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), <b>whimbrel</b> (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).|$|E
40|$|Distinct {{preference}} of species for habitats {{is most often}} driven by long term differences in demographic rates between habitats. Estimating variation in those rates is key for developing successful conservation strategies. Stochastic events can interact with underlying variation in habitat quality in regulating demography but the opportunities to explore such interactions are rare. <b>Whimbrels</b> in Iceland show a strong preference for sparsely vegetated riverplains. Such habitats in Iceland face various threats, e. g., climate change, river regulation and spread of alien plant species. In this study we compared demographic parameters of breeding <b>Whimbrels</b> between riverplains and other habitats before, during and after volcanic eruption events to estimate {{the importance of the}} habitats for the species and the effect of ash deposit on breeding success. We found that an estimated minimum of 23 % of the Icelandic population of <b>Whimbrels</b> and c. 10 % of the world population of the species breed in riverplain habitats in Iceland. <b>Whimbrels</b> bred consistently at much higher densities in riverplain habitats than in other habitats and riverplains also had higher densities of pairs with fledglings although the proportion of successful breeders was similar between habitats. Predation by livestock may have had a considerable negative effect on breeding success on our study sites. Breeding was negatively affected by the volcanic activity, probably through the effects of ash on the invertebrate food supply, with breeding success being gradually worse closer to the eruption. Breeding success was equally affected by volcanism across habitats which differed in underlying habitat quality. This study gives an example of how populations can be regulated by factors which operate at different spatial scales, such as local variation in habitat quality and stochastic events which impact larger areas.

50|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for seabirds, especially Atlantic puffins (15,000 pairs), European storm petrels (25,000 pairs) and black guillemots (100 pairs), as well as for about 50 breeding pairs of <b>whimbrels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Over {{a hundred}} species of native birds have been {{recorded}} in the sanctuary, including about 60 species of migratory birds which visit seasonally; these include terns, gulls, herons, sandpipers and cormorants. Notable species are <b>whimbrels</b> and brahminy kites. The sanctuary {{is well known for}} a wide variety of fish, mussels and crabs.|$|R
25|$|More common shorebird species include {{western and}} least sandpiper, semipalmated plover, black-bellied plover, Pacific golden plover, red phalarope, <b>whimbrel,</b> dunlin.|$|E
25|$|Three {{bird species}} occur in internationally {{important}} numbers: common shelduck, pied avocet and black-tailed godwit. Other notable visitors include spoonbill, Sandwich tern and <b>whimbrel.</b> Once rare, little egrets are now seen regularly and in increasing numbers.|$|E
25|$|Highlights: Thousands of {{gulls and terns}} are {{recorded}} during the winter months. Eurasian curlew, <b>whimbrel,</b> greater flamingo, great crested tern, Sandwich tern, white-winged black tern can be spotted during February and March. Black ibis were recorded {{for the first time}} in Chennai recently.|$|E
50|$|In spring, {{a variety}} of birds can be seen, {{including}} gadwalls, shovelers and pochards, which {{can be seen in}} the open water and in the ditches; lapwings, avocets, oystercatchers and redshanks nest in the marshes; marsh harriers and barn owls can also be found. Migrant waders and <b>whimbrels</b> can also be found in the grassland.|$|R
50|$|On {{the southwestern}} {{edge of town}} a boardwalk {{was created by the}} park with {{assistance}} of US Aid. It leads through mangrove environments passing along saltwater lagoons filled with flamingo, common stilts, <b>whimbrels,</b> Bahama pintails, and gallinules that come here to sweep the mud in search of brine. At the end of the walkway is the Tortoise Breeding Center which was built in order to help preserve the many species of Isabela Tortoises.|$|R
50|$|The {{marine park}} extends from Long Point {{south of the}} town of Rhyll, to the {{northern}} point of Churchill Island and along Churchill Island’s western coast to the bridge connecting it to Phillip Island and is part of the Western Port Ramsar site. It is an important roosting and feeding site for migratory waders, especially <b>whimbrels</b> and bar-tailed godwits. Its seagrass habitats are also important for black swans and many species of fish.|$|R
25|$|Other {{birds that}} {{regularly}} visit Yell include great and Arctic skuas, various terns, eider, <b>whimbrel,</b> red-throated diver, dunlin, golden plover, twite, lapwing and merlin. The Eigg, and Ern Stack {{in the north}} west of Yell, is the last known nesting site of Shetlandic sea eagles, which were recorded there in 1910.|$|E
25|$|Shorebirds, unlike seabirds, do {{not have}} webbed feet and spend {{their lives on the}} shore {{foraging}} for food, eating worms, insect larvae, amphipods, copepods, crustaceans, and mollusks. Among the types of shorebirds on the Coast are the western and least sandpiper, dunlin, <b>whimbrel,</b> the semipalmated and western snowy plover, and killdeer.|$|E
25|$|The {{crossing}} {{passes over}} mudflats in the Severn Estuary {{with part of}} the eastern approach viaduct sited on the English Stones, a rocky outcrop uncovered at low tide. The estuary wetlands are home to migrating birds such as the ringed plover, redshank and <b>whimbrel,</b> while the Eurasian curlew, dunlin and grey plover winter in the area. The birds feed on ragworm, lugworm and other invertebrates. Saltmarsh is found along {{the fringes of the}} coast. Beds of eelgrass occur on the more sheltered mud- and sandbanks. In 1976, in recognition {{of the importance of the}} estuary as a wetland used by migrating birds, an area of 247 km2 (95 sq miles) was designated a Ramsar site. In 1988 the Severn Estuary was designated a Special Protection Area. The same year an area of 99 km2 (38 sq miles) was notified as a SSSI and designated as such the following year; in 1995, this was extended to cover the whole of the Ramsar site.|$|E
50|$|A 483 km2 {{area of the}} bay and its surrounds, {{covering}} all the habitat types suitable for migratory waders, or shorebirds, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports over 1% of the world populations of pied oystercatchers, Far Eastern curlews and grey-tailed tattlers, and over 1% of the East Asian - Australasian Flyway populations of bar-tailed godwits, <b>whimbrels</b> and Terek sandpipers. It also contains populations of beach stone-curlews and mangrove honeyeaters.|$|R
50|$|Gwennap Head {{is renowned}} for its {{relative}} abundance of passing marine bird species such as Manx and sooty shearwaters, skuas, petrels and <b>whimbrels.</b> In addition, a colony of breeding gannets are close by. Therefore, the headland is favoured by birdwatchers and many travel the length and breadth of Britain to track rare seabirds. Annually, the Seawatch SW survey aims to record the numbers of such species from a designated location close to the cliff edge on Gwennap Head.|$|R
5000|$|A {{total of}} 24 {{species of birds}} {{including}} 14 species of waders and 10 species of terrestrial birds were identified in Bansaan. The counts made during the visits in February and September 1991 confirm {{the importance of the}} island as a wintering area and stop over site for the waders during their northward and southward migration. Grey-tailed tattlers (Heteroscelus brevipes), grey plovers (Pluvialis squatarola), <b>whimbrels</b> (Numenius phaeopus), and common redshanks (Tringa totanus) constitute the largest numbers recorded.|$|R
25|$|Yala {{is one of}} the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 {{bird species}} of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed {{bee-eater}} and brown-capped babbler. The number of waterbirds inhabiting wetlands of Yala is 90 and half of them are migrants. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck, garganey), cormorants (little cormorant, Indian cormorant), large waterbirds (grey heron, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, Asian openbill, painted stork), medium-sized waders Tringa spp., and small waders Charadrius spp. are among the most common waterbirds. Black-necked stork and lesser adjutant are many of the rare birds that {{can be seen in the}} park. The migrant great white pelican and resident spot-billed pelican are also have been recorded. Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, <b>whimbrel,</b> godwits, and ruddy turnstone. The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew. Rock pigeon, barred buttonquail, Indian peafowl, black stork, black-winged stilt, and greater flamingo are among the other bird species. Crested serpent eagle and white-bellied sea eagle are the raptors of the park. The forest birds are orange-breasted green pigeon, hornbills, Old World flycatchers, Indian paradise flycatcher, Asian barbets, and orioles.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of their wetland nature, the Moors and Levels contain a rich {{biodiversity}} of national and international importance. They support a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold, meadowsweet, and ragged robin. The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan, Eurasian curlew, common redshank, skylark, common snipe, common teal, wigeon, and <b>whimbrel,</b> as well as birds of prey including the marsh harrier and peregrine falcon. [...] A wide range of insect species is also present, including rare invertebrates, particularly beetles including the lesser silver water beetle, Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni, and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important otter population. Water voles (Arvicola amphibius) are being encouraged to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10years, by the capture of mink (Mustela vison).|$|E
500|$|The Parrett then {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, which {{contains}} a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi). The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), common redshank (Tringa totanus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), common teal (Anas crecca), Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) and <b>whimbrel</b> (Numenius phaeopus), as well as birds of prey including the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). A wide range of invertebrate species is also present including rare insects, particularly the hairy click beetle (Synaptus filiformis), which until recently was only known in Britain from the Parrett, and other insects, including the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides), Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important European otter (Lutra lutra) population. 282 American mink (Mustela vison) have been captured after their escape from breeding farms, which is encouraging water voles (Arvicola amphibius) to recolonise areas of the Levels {{where they have been}} absent for 10years. The Levels and Moors include 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (twelve of them also Special Protection Areas), the Huntspill River and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves, the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve, and numerous Scheduled Ancient Monuments. In addition, some [...] of the Levels are recognised as an environmentally sensitive area, while other portions are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential. Despite this, there is currently no single conservation designation covering the entire area of the Levels and Moors.|$|E
40|$|Landbirds {{undertaking}} within-continent migrations {{have the}} possibility to stop en route, but most long-distance migrants must also undertake large non-stop sea crossings, the length of which can vary greatly. For shorebirds migrating from Iceland to West Africa, the shortest route would involve {{one of the longest}} continuous sea crossings while alternative, mostly overland, routes are available. Using geolocators to track the migration of Icelandic <b>whimbrels</b> (Numenius phaeopus), we show that they can complete a round-trip of 11, 000 [*]km making two non-stop sea crossings and flying at speeds of up to 24 [*]m s− 1; one of the fastest recorded for shorebirds flying over the ocean. Although wind support could reduce flight energetic costs, <b>whimbrels</b> faced headwinds up to twice their ground speed, indicating that unfavourable and potentially fatal weather conditions are not uncommon. Such apparently high risk migrations might be more common than previously thought, with potential fitness gains outweighing the costs.

60|$|That was {{the first}} and only time I saw my father kill a bird, and nothing but his extreme anger against the robber of his {{precious}} pigeons would have made him do a thing so contrary to his nature. He was quite willing to have birds killed--young pigeons, wild ducks, plover, snipe, <b>whimbrel,</b> tinamou or partridge, and various others which he liked to eat--but the killing always had to be done by others. He hated to see any bird killed that was not for the table, and that was why he tolerated the falcon, and even allowed a pair of caranchos, or carrion-eagles--birds destructive to poultry, and killers when they got the chance of newly-born lambs and sucking- pigs--to have their huge nest in one of the old peach-trees for several years. I never saw him angrier than once when a visitor staying in the house, going out with his gun one day suddenly threw it up to his shoulder and brought down a passing swallow.|$|E
