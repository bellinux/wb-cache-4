5|$|Juvenile magpies begin {{foraging}} {{on their}} own three weeks after leaving the nest, and mostly feeding themselves by six months old. Some birds continue begging for food until eight or nine months of age, but are usually ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year. The age at <b>which</b> <b>young</b> birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males are usually evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City {{finished}} the 1966–67 season in mid-table, and continued {{in a similar}} vein {{at the start of the}} 1967–68 season, failing to win in their first three matches. A tactical switch saw Young and Mike Summerbee moved inside, and Young scored two goals in City's first win of the season, 4–2 against Southampton. Four more wins followed immediately, including a 2–0 win against Newcastle United in <b>which</b> <b>Young</b> scored a goal and missed a penalty. Young remained at inside-forward for the rest of the season. Following the arrival of striker Francis Lee and a long unbeaten run, Manchester City entered the New Year as potential title contenders. In mid-March, a 5–1 win against Fulham in <b>which</b> <b>Young</b> scored two goals took Manchester City top of the table. The lead changed hands several times in the following six weeks, but as the teams entered the final round of fixtures, Manchester City travelled to Newcastle knowing a win would guarantee the championship. Young scored twice and had another disallowed as Manchester City won 4–3 to win the title, the first major honour of Young's career. Young also {{finished the}} season as the club's highest goalscorer with 20 goals.|$|E
5|$|Mother rodents {{provide both}} direct parental care, such as nursing, grooming, {{retrieving}} and huddling, and indirect parenting, {{such as food}} caching, nest building and protection to their offspring. In many social species, young may be cared for by individuals other then their parents, a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding. This is known to occur in black-tailed prairie dogs and Belding's ground squirrels, where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own. There is some {{question as to whether}} these mothers can distinguish <b>which</b> <b>young</b> are theirs. In the Patagonian mara, young are also placed in communal warrens, but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse.|$|E

5|$|Young {{entered the}} All-Star {{break with the}} major league lead in ERA and {{opponent}} batting average {{as well as an}} undefeated streak extending back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals. Prior to the announcement of his election, Young dropped his appeal of the five-game suspension. Young served his suspension during the final four games before the All-Star break and the first game afterwards, yet was allowed to play in the All-Star Game at AT Park in San Francisco, California. In the fifth inning of the 5–4 American League victory for <b>which</b> <b>Young</b> was the losing pitcher, he surrendered the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star game history to Ichiro Suzuki.|$|E
5|$|Young's {{first full}} season {{was not a}} {{successful}} one for Manchester City; the team struggled to find form throughout. A four match unbeaten run in April, in <b>which</b> <b>Young</b> scored a winning goal against Bolton Wanderers, gave hope, but {{on the final day}} of the season Manchester City were relegated to the Second Division. For the following two seasons Young continued to be a regular first team player, though he missed the first two months of the 1964–65 season. Manchester City did not come close to promotion, and their 11th-place finish in 1965 was at that point the lowest in the club's history. Manager George Poyser departed in April 1965, and in July 1965 his replacement, Joe Mercer, joined the club, along with coach Malcolm Allison.|$|E
5|$|Nadanian {{was born}} on 19 September 1972 in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, which then {{was part of the}} Soviet Union, to Sergei and Irina, both hairdressers. He was taught to play chess by his father when he was seven. His early coach was Rafael Sarkisov, who took him on as a pupil at Spartak in Baku. In his article The Voiceless Old Man Nadanian recollects, that when he was nine or ten there were almost no chess tournaments in <b>which</b> <b>young</b> players could play with seniors and {{therefore}} he often went to the park near his house to play chess with older chess lovers. He remembers that in one of these park-battles he played against a mysterious, silent stranger {{who turned out to be}} the highly respected chess champion Vladimir Makogonov. In 1986 and 1987 Nadanian won the under-sixteen Azerbaijani championship. With the beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1988, his family was forced to leave Baku and flee to Armenia.|$|E

5|$|Often {{considered}} by commentators {{to be the}} benchmark against which other batsmen are compared for attractive, graceful batting, Palairet won many plaudits for his style. In his book, The Jubilee Book of Cricket, Ranjitsinhji includes a number of staged photographs of Palairet playing his shots, and describes his methods in places, using them as the model <b>which</b> <b>young</b> players should adopt. He played predominantly off the front foot, and tended to be less effective on soft pitches. He favoured shots on the off side, particularly the off drive and cover drive. During Palairet's career, bowlers favoured a tactic, known as off theory, of bowling the ball just outside the off stump. The strength of Palairet's off side strokes helped him to score effectively against this tactic. Fry suggests that the early practice that Palairet gained against Attewell and Martin, who bowled accurately at the stumps, was {{a key factor in}} limiting his range of leg side shots. He favoured lofted shots which were often compared to golf strokes.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the reasons}} the Saints had chosen the Great Basin as a {{settling}} place was that the area was at the time outside the territorial borders of the United States, <b>which</b> <b>Young</b> had blamed for failing to protect Mormons from political opposition from the states of Missouri and Illinois. However, in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico ceded the area to the United States. As a result, Brigham Young sent emissaries to Washington, D.C. with a proposal to create a vast State of Deseret, of <b>which</b> <b>Young</b> would naturally be the first governor. Instead, Congress created the much smaller Utah Territory in 1850, and Young was appointed governor in 1851. Because of his religious position, Young exercised much more practical control over the affairs of Mormon and non-Mormon settlers than a typical territorial governor of the time.|$|E

25|$|By 1857, {{tensions}} had again escalated between Mormons {{and other}} Americans, {{largely as a}} result of accusations involving polygamy and the theocratic rule of the Utah Territory by Young. The Utah Mormon War ensued from 1857 to 1858, which resulted in the relatively peaceful invasion of Utah by the United States Army, after <b>which</b> <b>Young</b> agreed to step down from power and be replaced by a non-Mormon territorial governor, Alfred Cumming. Nevertheless, the LDS Church still wielded significant political power in the Utah Territory.|$|E
