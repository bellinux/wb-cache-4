Large-scale railway maintenance equipment should always work in efficient statement. Focusing on this requirement, the reliability design of hardware for current leakage and impulse current which is proposed in the paper is necessary.

50|$|Another {{application}} of {{machine to machine}} network is in the health management for a fleet of similar machines using clustering approach. This method was introduced to address the challenge of developing fault detection models for applications with non-stationary operating regimes or with incomplete data. The overall methodology consists of two stages: 1) Fleet Clustering to group similar machines for sound comparison; 2) Local Cluster Fault Detection to evaluate the similarity of individual machines to the fleet features. The purpose of fleet clustering is to aggregate <b>working</b> <b>units</b> with similar configurations or working conditions into a group for sound comparison and subsequently create local fault detection models when global models cannot be established. Within the framework of peer to peer comparison methodology, the machine to machine network is crucial to ensure the instantaneous information share between different <b>working</b> <b>units</b> and thus {{form the basis of}} fleet level health management technology.|$|R

The sampling method used is purposive sampling. The study sample consists of 102 district/city governments that report the Local Government Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 2013 and have been audited by the Indonesia’s Supreme Audit Board in 2014. This study uses multiple regression analysis and t-test procedure and also does the classical assumptions test including normality, autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and multicollinearity test using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The results show that the local government’s administrative age has significant effect on the disclosure of local government investments, while the size of its investments, the number of SKPDs (<b>working</b> <b>units),</b> the educational background of the head of the local government and intergovernmental revenues have no significant effect on the disclosure of local government investments.
