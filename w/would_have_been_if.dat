5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined to be. Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado forces them to take cover; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school where the children <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E

25|$|In {{the later}} Master, it is {{revealed}} {{that while the}} Seventh Doctor is Time's Champion, the Master is Death's. This {{is a result of}} an incident in their youth, where the Doctor killed a school bully who was trying to drown the Master; unable to cope with his guilt and grief, the child who would become the Doctor accepted a deal with Death (personified as a woman) to take away his pain, unaware that this would result in her erasing his memory of committing the crime and transferring it to the Master. Temporarily restored to the person he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> Death had not marked him, the Master forgives the Doctor for this, understanding that the adult cannot be blamed for the actions of the child that did not foresee the consequences of his actions, but {{the end of the play}} implies that the Master will once again become Death's servant.|$|E
25|$|The retry of Deck’s penalty phase {{began on}} April 29, 2003, {{where he was}} brought into court wearing shackles. The defense objected to Deck being visibly restrained, stating that Deck’s {{behavior}} did not justify shackles. The defense stated the only justification for shackling Deck <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> he caused a disturbance in the courtroom. However, he did not. The defense also suggested other measures that the court could have taken to ensure safety instead of shackling Deck. These measures included adding extra security guards to the courtroom, and having the {{people who wanted to}} sit in the gallery walk through metal detectors. However, the defense’s objections were overruled. Deck’s attorneys once again objected during voir dire. Deck’s defense thought that asking jurors if the shackles biased them was not enough to ensure that Deck would receive reliable sentencing. The court overruled the objection again, stating “The objection that you’re making will be overruled. He has been convicted and will remain in legirons and belly chain.” The jury once again sentenced Deck to death.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{held that}} a person {{awaiting}} trial has a valid reason, protected under the due process clause, to refuse antipsychotic drugs, referencing Washington v. Harper (1990) and Bell v. Wolfish (1979). Therefore, once Riggins' requested termination of the medication, the State was obligated to establish both {{the need for the}} antipsychotic drug and its medical appropriateness for Riggins' safety and that of others as the less restrictive alternative available. If the state had done this, due process would have been satisfied. The State {{might have been able to}} justify the treatment, if medically appropriate, if it set forth that the adjudication of guilt or innocence could not be established by using less intrusive means. Since the trial court did not do this and allowed the drug's administration to continue without making any of the determinations stated above, it is very likely that this error violated Riggins' trial rights established by the Constitution. However, this is only speculative as there is no way to know what the outcome <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> the proper course had been followed.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, SF Line {{asked for}} tenders from various shipyards {{around the world}} for {{construction}} of a 1,700-passenger, 540-car ferry. The cheapest bid, 80 million Finnish markka (20 million United States dollar by exchange rates of the time), was made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan who outbid the Finnish Wärtsilä shipyard by 36 million markka. On 13 September 1977, SF Line signed a contract with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for construction of a ferry. However, the funding of the project was subject to approval by the Bank of Finland and as at the time the employment level in Finland's shipyards was low, the Bank of Finland decided not to grant its approval to the project's funding with hopes of forcing the company to order a ship from a Finnish shipyard. After prolonged negotiations between both SF Line and the Bank of Finland as well as SF Line and Wärtsilä, SF Line placed an order with Wärtsilä on 17 March 1978. In the end the cost of the ship from Wärtsilä was approximately 15% more expensive than it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> built by Mitsubishi, despite a subvention of 17 million markka from the Bank of Finland.|$|E

500|$|In its place, Stevens {{suggests}} that determining whether an intervention is a throffer depends {{not on the}} desirability of compliance and noncompliance {{when compared to the}} norm, but on the desirability of the actions entailed in compliance or noncompliance when compared with what their desirability would have been were no intervention made. He proposes that a throffer is made if P attempts to encourage Q to do A by increasing [...] "the desirability to Q of Q doing A relative to what it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> P made no proposal and decrease the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A relative to what it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> P made no proposal". An offer, by contrast, increases the desirability to Q of Q doing A compared to how it would have been without P's intervention, leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A as it would have been. A threat decreases the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A compared to what it would have been without P's intervention, while leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing A as it would have been.|$|E

500|$|The {{murder of}} Leigh's {{character}} in the shower is the film's pivotal scene {{and one of the}} best-known in all of cinema. As such, it spawned numerous myths and legends. It was shot from December 17–23, 1959, with 77 different camera angles. The finished scene runs three minutes and includes 50 cuts. Most of the shots are extreme close-ups, except for medium shots in the shower directly before and directly after the murder. The combination of the close shots with their short duration makes the sequence feel more subjective than it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>if</b> the images were presented alone or in a wider angle, an example of the technique Hitchcock described as [...] "transferring the menace from the screen into the mind of the audience".|$|E

Nancy Reichardt of the Los Angeles Times noted that the characters were acting out of character; she wrote: [...] "Katherine's breast cancer scare was touching and seeing Katherine and Jill come together added an intriguing new dimension to their relationship.
