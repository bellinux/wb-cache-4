40|$|OAK B 202 TOKAMAK EQUILIBRIA <b>WITH</b> CENTRAL <b>CURRENT</b> HOLES AND NEGATIVE CURRENT DRIVE. Several tokamak {{experiments}} have reported {{the development of}} a central region <b>with</b> vanishing <b>currents</b> (the current hole). Straightforward application of results from the work of Greene, Johnson and Weimer [Phys. Fluids, 3, 67 (1971) ] on tokamak equilibrium to these plasmas leads to apparent singularities in several physical quantities including the Shafranov shift and casts doubts on the existence of this type of equilibria. In this paper, the above quoted equilibrium theory is re-examined and extended to include equilibria <b>with</b> a <b>current</b> hole. It is shown that singularities can be circumvented and that equilibria <b>with</b> a central <b>current</b> hole do satisfy the magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium condition with regular behavior for all the physical quantities and do not lead to infinitely large Shafranov shifts. Isolated equilibria <b>with</b> negative <b>current</b> in the central region could exist. But equilibria <b>with</b> negative <b>currents</b> in general do not have neighboring equilibria and thus cannot have experimental realization, i. e. no negative currents can be driven in the central region...|$|R

The study estimated global lithium reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.|$|E

5|$|Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but gauging the ratios is {{difficult}} because juveniles are harder to catch; <b>with</b> <b>current</b> sampling methods, estimates of age distribution vary widely. Annual survival rate of painted turtles increases with age. The probability of a painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first birthday is only 19%.

The male survival rates follow a similar pattern, but are lower overall than females, creating an average male age {{lower than that of}} the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions.
