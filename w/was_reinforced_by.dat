5|$|After the {{successful}} defence of Wau the 3rd Division began advancing towards Salamaua in April 1943. This advance was mounted {{to divert attention}} from Lae, {{which was one of the}} main objectives of Operation Cartwheel, and proceeded slowly. In late June the 3rd Division <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team which staged an amphibious landing to the south of Salamaua. The town was eventually captured on 11 September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Dickens {{was touched}} by the lot of poor {{children}} in the middle decades of the 19th century. In early 1843 he toured the Cornish tin mines, where he was angered after seeing children working in appalling conditions. The suffering he witnessed there <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> {{a visit to the}} Field Lane Ragged school, one of several London schools set up for the education of the capital's half-starved, illiterate street children.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 the Australian {{military}} <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> units recalled {{from the}} Middle East and {{an expansion of}} the CMF and RAAF. United States Military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea. The Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942, with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943. From 1944 the Australian military was mainly relegated to subsidiary roles, but continued to conduct large-scale operations {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to clarify the effects of seismic motion and the {{reinforcement}} methods. Two kind of reinforcement specimens were tested: one <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the spiral steel and the other <b>is</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the steel pipe arranged in the center of the section. Test results show that the specimen <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the steel pipe is more effective than that by the spiral steel reinforcement for seismic damage...|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1914, the German Foreign Office and members of the {{military}} suggested attempting to use the pan-Islamic movement to destabilise the British Empire and begin an Indian revolution. The argument <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> Germanophile explorer Sven Hedin in Berlin two weeks later. General Staff memoranda in the last weeks of August confirmed the perceived feasibility of the plan, predicting that an invasion by Afghanistan could cause a revolution in India.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{fighting}} was very close, many of the Confederates were killed before {{they had a chance}} to retreat. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry drove the rebels {{to the end of the}} field, only to be partially driven back by a second group of Confederate cavalrymen. After the regiment <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the rest of Capehart's brigade, the Confederates were driven from the area, and numerous battle flags were captured.|$|E
5|$|The 738th Regiment of the 718th Infantry Division <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> pioneers, four NDH battalions, four NDH {{artillery}} {{batteries and}} two-and-a-half German mountain gun batteries. It pushed east from Sarajevo along the Prača valley then through the Romanija mountains towards Rogatica. Fighting in very difficult terrain, it captured 240 insurgents and {{significant amounts of}} weapons and ammunition. It also freed 10 Italian and 57 NDH soldiers. The other regiment of the 718th Infantry Division, the 750th Regiment, <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> a German artillery battery, an NDH infantry battalion and an NDH mountain battery. It moved south from an assembly area southwest of Tuzla towards Olovo. It reached Kladanj on 16 January, and spent the following days clearing {{both sides of the}} road west towards Vlasenica. It had been planned that the Italian 3rd Mountain Infantry Division Ravenna would provide a cordon to the south, blocking any southerly withdrawal by the insurgents. This did not occur, as the Italians claimed the railroad near Mostar had been damaged, resulting in several weeks delay.|$|E

5|$|The Suvla landing <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> {{the arrival}} of the 10th (Irish) Division on 7 August, the 53rd (Welsh) Division, which began landing on 8 August, the 54th (East Anglian) Division {{arriving}} late on 10 August and the dismounted yeomanry of the 2nd Mounted Division on 18 August. On 12 August the 54th Division attacked Kavak Tepe and Tekke Tepe, crossing the Anafarta Plain. The attack failed and Hamilton briefly considered the evacuation of Suvla and Anzac.|$|E
5|$|After {{service in}} the Mediterranean the brigade {{returned}} to Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, where it <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> {{the arrival of the}} 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers in November 1943. During the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944, the 1st Airlanding Brigade was part of the strategic reserve, on standby to deploy wherever they were needed to support the invasion. The division and brigade were next assigned to Operation Market Garden at Arnhem in the Netherlands. This entailed three airborne divisions capturing bridges to be used subsequently by the British Second Army. Prior to the operation, more than 15 planned airborne missions into France and Belgium had been cancelled due to the speed of the Allied advance.|$|E
5|$|At {{around the}} time Batch's {{squadron}} was working up for the summer cruise, Henry Abbott, the German consul in Salonika, then in the Ottoman Empire, was murdered. Further attacks on German citizens living in the area were feared, and so Batsch was ordered to sail to the Mediterranean Sea to stage a naval demonstration in June 1876. After arriving with the four ironclads, he <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> three unarmored vessels. After {{the threat of violence}} subsided in August, Batsch departed with Kaiser and Deutschland; the other two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean {{for the rest of the}} summer.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Jadar Chetniks were attacking Loznica, Račić's Cer {{detachment}} attacked the village of Bogatić in accordance with the Chetnik-Partisan agreement. The gendarmes had been reinforced by the 6th Company of the German 750th Infantry Regiment with artillery support. On the second day of the attack, the garrison <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the 7th Company of the 750th Infantry Regiment arriving from Sremska Mitrovica, and an additional platoon sent from Šabac. After two days fighting, Račić's Chetniks withdrew to Cer mountain with considerable losses, after which they marched to Loznica to join the Jadar Chetniks.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} she {{received}} her first radars. By August 1943 she mounted a Type 286 target indication set {{as well as a}} Type 285 anti-aircraft gunnery radar. By January 1944 she had received a Type 291 air warning radar. Her light AA armament had also been augmented by six Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon, three {{on each side of the}} roof of the large workshop abaft the funnel. In 1944 Vindictive was converted into a destroyer depot ship and her AA armament <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the addition of six more Oerlikons. Later that year, the 4-inch guns were removed and eight additional Oerlikons were added. In 1945 she received an additional six Oerlikons.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{continued}} the détente policy {{with both the}} Soviet Union and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War. Still in place from the Nixon Administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> Ford's December 1975 visit to that communist country. In 1975, the Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union, creating {{the framework of the}} Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into Human Rights Watch.|$|E

5|$|In 1543, Henry VIII allied {{himself with}} Spain {{in a war}} against France. Despite Henry's initial successes, France and Spain made peace in 1544, leaving England exposed to a French invasion, backed by her allies in Scotland. In response, Henry issued an {{instruction}} to improve the country's defences, particularly along the south coast. Dartmouth Castle <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> three new gun batteries, two {{either side of the}} gun tower, and another, Lamberd's Bulwarke, positioned in the south-east corner of the fortalice.|$|E
5|$|It was alleged by medieval chroniclers that Edward II and Piers Gaveston were lovers, a rumour that <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> later portrayals in fiction, such as Christopher Marlowe's late 16th-century play Edward II. This {{assertion}} {{has received}} the support of some modern historians, while others have questioned it. According to Pierre Chaplais, {{the relationship between the}} two was that of an adoptive brotherhood, and Gaveston served as an unofficial deputy for a reluctant king. Other historians, like J. S. Hamilton, have pointed out that concern over the two men's sexuality was not at the core of the nobility's grievances, which rather centred on Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E

5|$|Music with a fast {{rhythm of}} 120 bpm {{was used in}} an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the drummers in the stadium; {{nevertheless}} the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide. Once all of the athletes were inside the stadium, 7 billion small pieces of paper were dropped from a Westland helicopter, each piece representing one person on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Stirling {{still held}} the line against Grant on the American right, to the west. He held on for four hours, still {{unaware of the}} British {{flanking}} maneuver, {{and some of his}} own troops thought that they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling's center by 11:00, and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back, but British troops were coming at him from the rear, south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer's millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, {{on the other side of}} Brooklyn Heights.|$|E
5|$|Tack's column <b>was</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>by</b> the {{garrison}} of Semarang and marched southward to the Pajang district, where it fought {{the followers of}} Trunajaya's ally Raden Kajoran. Hurdt and Amangkurat's column re-assembled in Godong on the Serang River and stayed there for six days. Their artillery and supplies were brought there by river, but now had to join the southward march overland through enemy territory. This column then joined Tack's column in the Solo River valley (the river was then called the Semanggi River). Meanwhile, van Renesse and Mulder's column passed Pati, was joined by the VOC troops there, and marched through a different route towards Kediri.|$|E
