The new infrastructure will allow many parts of the kernel to be migrated out into userspace; here they will be more easily debugged as they will be smaller, isolated programs, instead of being small parts entwined in a larger chunk of code. Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit of making the system more robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.|$|E

Tancredi reveals {{he is really}} Scaroth, {{a member of the}} Jagaroth race. They had arrived on Earth 400 million years ago, but due an explosion in their craft, all of the others died and his own body was fragmented across time. Collectively, the fragments of Scaroth have manipulated humanity so that by the 20th century, they will have technology that <b>will</b> <b>enable</b> him to go back in time to stop the explosion. Tancredi is currently employing da Vinci to create copies of the Mona Lisa as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a felt-tip pen, and leaves a message to da Vinci to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E
