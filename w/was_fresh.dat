5|$|For {{their final}} home {{game of the}} season, Michigan hosted the Wisconsin Badgers. Michigan looked to extend its two-game win streak, but faced a tough challenge, as Wisconsin was ranked 6th in the AP Poll and <b>was</b> <b>fresh</b> off of an 83–20 {{pounding}} of Indiana. During the previous meeting between the two schools, Wisconsin won by a score of 45–24, with Scott Tolzien throwing 5 touchdown passes during the game.|$|E
5|$|Most of the salts {{dissolved}} {{in the lake}} and deposited in the desert flats around it reflect the concentration of solutes by evaporation; Lake Bonneville itself <b>was</b> <b>fresh</b> enough to support populations of fish. More salt is added yearly via rivers and streams, though the amount is {{much less than the}} relict salt from Bonneville.|$|E
5|$|As the Japanese regrouped, the U.S. forces {{concentrated}} on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 {{men from the}} U.S. 7th Marine Regiment to Guadalcanal. This regiment had previously formed part of the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade and <b>was</b> <b>fresh</b> from garrison duty in Samoa. These reinforcements allowed Vandegrift, beginning on 19 September, to establish an unbroken line of defense completely around the Lunga perimeter.|$|E

5|$|John Schneider {{was brought}} in to play Jonathan Kent. Schneider was already well known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard, and Gough {{believed}} Schneider's experience from The Dukes of Hazzard added believability to the idea that he could have grown up running a farm. Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, but during filming it was generally agreed—Ettinger included—that she was not right for the role. Annette O'Toole, who previously portrayed Lana Lang in Superman III, and who <b>was</b> <b>fresh</b> off the recent cancellation of her television series The Huntress, was cast in Ettinger's place, reshooting the scenes Ettinger had filmed.|$|E
5|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviewssome critics {{claimed it}} <b>was</b> <b>fresh</b> {{and a new}} sound, while others argued it was very similar to music already available. Desolate North has an extremely slow rhythm and has only limited vocals. The music is interspersed with various woodland sounds, such as running water and footsteps. The natural imagery used on the album is reminiscent of that used in black metal, but the music is closer to ambient.|$|E
5|$|American counterattacks {{continued}} into the morning of August 7, but the gains were slow, hampered by the hot weather {{and a lack of}} food and water. The North Koreans were able to press forward and regain the Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area. By 16:00 that day, the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd US Infantry Division, a unit newly arrived in Korea, was sent to the region. Church immediately ordered it to attack the North Korean salient at the bulge. 9th Infantry <b>was</b> <b>fresh</b> and well-equipped. They were also inexperienced, many of their number being reservists. Despite a tenacious attack, the 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of Cloverleaf Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement.|$|E

25|$|Clipper ships sacrificed cargo {{capacity}} for speed, {{but in some}} markets, the fast service allowed their owners to charge premium rates (Tea from China tasted better if it <b>was</b> <b>fresh,</b> so the cargo on the first ship of the season to arrive in New York was worth more). Also, faster speed meant that the vessel could complete more voyages in a given time period, which also helped {{make up for the}} diminished {{cargo capacity}}.|$|E
25|$|Since the oil industry's {{earliest}} days, {{discovery and}} production have periodically taken a human toll. For Canada's petroleum industry, the worst incident was the Ocean Ranger disaster of 1982. In that terrible tragedy the Ocean Ranger, a semi-submersible offshore rig drilling the Hibernia J-34 delineation well, {{went down in}} a winter storm. The vessel took 84 hands into the frigid sea; none survived. This memory <b>was</b> <b>fresh</b> in everyone's mind when the field's production system was being negotiated.|$|E

25|$|Ron Ganulin's 14 seasons {{were one}} of contrasts, but Ganulin helped restore the program to its glory days somewhat. Before joining the Terriers, Ganulin <b>was</b> <b>fresh</b> off the 1990 National Championship as an {{assistant}} with the 1989–90 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team. Ganulin's tenure began with several losing seasons, his 1993–94 squad went 1–26 and finished last in the Northeast Conference. Yet by the 1997–98 season Ganulin's squad's began {{to turn it around}} stringing together 5 consecutive winning seasons from 1997–2001. Ganulin's 1998–99 team won 20 games, the first time in 43 years that the Terriers had accomplished the feat.|$|E
25|$|In the 1780s there <b>was</b> <b>fresh</b> {{concern over}} security, quality and economy of supply. The deputy {{comptroller}} of the Royal Laboratory at Woolwich, Major, later Lieutenant General, Sir William Congreve advocated that the Waltham Abbey Mills should be {{purchased by the}} Crown to ensure secure supplies and to establish what would now be called a centre of excellence for development of manufacturing processes and to establish quality and cost standards by which private contractors could be judged. In October 1787 the Crown purchased the mills from John Walton for £10,000, starting a 204-year ownership. Congreve {{was a man of}} immense drive and vision, a pioneer of careful management, quality control and the application of the scientific method. Under his regime manufacture moved from what had been a black art to, in the context of its day, an advanced technology.|$|E

25|$|The most {{prolific}} fish such as herrings and sardines are abundant in given waters {{only in their}} season so keeping them for use out of season required salting or smoking them. This permitted their sale in inland markets too but fresh fish tasted better {{so long as it}} really <b>was</b> <b>fresh.</b> There was therefore a premium on fresh fish in this top end of the market. The medieval chasse-marée merchants catered to this originally by carrying fish in pairs of baskets on pack ponies, as far as possible, overnight. They rushed la marée (the batch from a particular landing) to market but the distance coverable before the fish deteriorated was limited. Another problem was that every lord through whose manor the road led wanted his toll so that if the road was too long, the enterprise became less economic.|$|E
25|$|The sensational {{incident}} {{of the track}} events was the non-selection of Marlene Matthews in the 4 x 100m relay. Matthews trained with the relay team up until the selection was made but Cuthbert, Strickland, Fleur Mellor and Norma Croker were picked for the team. There was outrage at the selection which increased when Matthews went on to run third in both the 100m and 200m finals. Personally she was devastated and felt {{that she had been}} overlooked for her poor baton change. Strickland was disappointed with the way Matthews was treated and maintained it was an opinion held in New South Wales that she had baton problems. One of the selectors, Doris Magee from NSW, said that selecting Matthews increased the risk of disqualification at the change. But Cuthbert maintained that the selectors made the right choice saying that Fleur Mellor <b>was</b> <b>fresh,</b> a specialist relay runner and was better around the curves than Matthews.|$|E
25|$|The {{animal is}} said to be of a brownish-gray color with a smooth skin, its size is {{approximately}} that of an elephant; at least that of a hippopotamus. It {{is said to}} have a long and very flexible neck and only one tooth but a very long one; some say it is a horn. A few spoke about a long, muscular tail like that of an alligator. Canoes coming near it are said to be doomed; the animal is said to attack the vessels at once and to kill the crews but without eating the bodies. The creature is said to live in the caves that have been washed out by the river in the clay of its shores at sharp bends. It is said to climb the shores even at daytime in search of food; its diet {{is said to be}} entirely vegetable. This feature disagrees with a possible explanation as a myth. The preferred plant was shown to me, {{it is a kind of}} liana with large white blossoms, with a milky sap and applelike fruits. At the Ssombo River I was shown a path said to have been made by this animal in order to get at its food. The path <b>was</b> <b>fresh</b> and there were plants of the described type nearby. But since there were too many tracks of elephants, hippos, and other large mammals it was impossible to make out a particular spoor with any amount of certainty.|$|E
