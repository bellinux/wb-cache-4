In October 2009, the Australian government was continuing {{to plan for}} a nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>dump</b> in the Northern Territory. However, there was opposition from indigenous people, the NT government, and wider NT community. In November 2009, about 100 anti-nuclear protesters assembled outside the Alice Springs parliamentary sittings, urging the Northern Territory Government not to approve a nearby uranium mine site.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the abundance of}} reptile and mammal species on five rehabilitated <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> in the early successional stages in the mined area around Ora Banda in Western Australia and compared these data with species richness and abundance in adjacent undisturbed areas. Mammal species common in the undisturbed areas were also found in relatively high abundance on <b>waste</b> <b>dumps,</b> {{with the exception of}} Pseudomys hermannsburgensis. In contrast, not all reptile species in the adjacent undisturbed areas had colonized <b>waste</b> <b>dumps.</b> However, a high proportion of those reptile species that were caught on rehabilitated <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> were at lower numbers than in the adjacent undisturbed areas, indicating that they were slow colonizers. Reptiles Underwoodisaurus milii, Heteronotia binoei and Pogona minor and mammals Mus musculus and Sminthopsis crassicauda are among the early colonizing species that flourish in the developing ecosystem on <b>waste</b> <b>dumps.</b> Species able to exploit a diverse range of niches, tolerate open spaces, have a generalist diet and good dispersal capabilities are the early colonizers. In contrast, species with a specialist diet or micro-habitat requirements are slow to colonize rehabilitated <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> and will initially be represented in low numbers. We encourage mining companies and regulators to change {{the size and shape of}} <b>waste</b> <b>dumps,</b> and to seed with species found in the adjacent undisturbed areas to hasten the colonization of vertebrate species on to <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> and the creation of functional ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the Czech {{parts of}} the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, tens of <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> of gangue {{material}} are located. These <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> were created during the mining of hard coal in the Czech part of the Upper Silesian Basin. It was an underground mining. As part of the mining process of opening, preparation and extraction, {{a large amount of}} gangue material remained after the extraction works and had to be deposited at <b>waste</b> <b>dumps.</b> <b>Waste</b> <b>dumps</b> are becoming a very common source of secondary raw materials, but also become a relatively common foundation soil in the Ostrava-Karvina coal district. The aim is to define the natural conditions of these <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> and to characterize the geological environment of these engineering geological specific districts. In terms of mining, gangues are located in the Ostrava-Karvina coal district. From the viewpoint of morphology, {{it is part of the}} Ostrava pan, which is composed of a large amount of Quaternary sediments, located on Miocene sediments external Carpathian depressions...|$|R

25|$|Peter Burdon, an {{academic}} at the University of Adelaide, has also {{speculated that the}} commission is likely {{to focus on the}} establishment of a nuclear waste repository in South Australia, most likely on aboriginal land.

However he suggests that the role of the senior aboriginal women's council of Coober Pedy in the defeat of this proposal was also very important.|$|E
25|$|A further {{issue is}} {{industrial}} and metropolitan waste from early-established landfills and waste-emitting factories {{on the banks}} of the river. These include an unlined <b>waste</b> <b>dump</b> at Horotiu, just downriver from Hamilton, whose leachates include persistent organic pollutants such as dieldrin in quantities toxic to freshwater marine life. The 2002 GHD report saw new regulations put in place to make industries comply with a new bylaw which stops hazardous substances entering the water system at all according to the HCC website. In 2002 dead eels were found in a tributary of the river when a container of pesticides and other chemicals was apparently illegally dumped. The chemicals were diluted when they entered the much bigger Waikato River. The harmful effect was temporary.|$|E

40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 289. Polish {{coal mining}} {{industry}} generates approximately 30 million Mg of mining wastes per year, {{which represents the}} largest amount of industrial waste in Poland. This results in the disposal of a huge volume of <b>wastes</b> at <b>waste</b> <b>dumps.</b> The coal mining <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> are spread within the area of over 4, 000 ha in more than 220 dumping sites, where over 760 million Mg of wastes from hard coal mining have been disposed. One {{of the most recent}} problems in Poland is the recovery of coal from mining waste. There is a possibility and necessity to recover coal from mining <b>waste</b> <b>dumps,</b> which should be linked with appropriate legal regulations. In this paper, distribution and dimensions of coal mining <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin and the Lublin Coal Basin are analyzed. Selected problems of negative environmental impacts of coal mining wastes – that may be reduced by the recovery of coal – are presented. Legal regulations referring to the mining waste management are analyzed. Some examples of a successful recovery of coal mining dumps as well as economic feasibility studies are given. The analysis of potential objects, which are the most valuable in terms of recovery processes, is presented. Coal mining <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> may be considered as important secondary deposits. Feasibility studies and past experiences in the coal recovery show a need for new recovery sites. Sustainable coal recovery is not only economically but also ecologically justified. The re-using and managing of reclaimed dumping sites for local communities is also of importance. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

25|$|The {{waste is}} {{classified}} as either sterile or mineralised, with acid generating potential, and the movement and storage of this material forms {{a major part of}} the mine planning process. When the mineralised package is determined by an economic cut-off, the near-grade mineralised waste is usually dumped separately with view to later treatment should market conditions change and it becomes economically viable. Civil engineering design parameters are used in the design of the waste dumps, and special conditions apply to high-rainfall areas and to seismically active areas. <b>Waste</b> <b>dump</b> designs must meet all regulatory requirements of the country in whose jurisdiction the mine is located. It is also common practice to rehabilitate dumps to an internationally acceptable standard, which in some cases means that higher standards than the local regulatory standard are applied.|$|E
25|$|At {{its peak}} in the 1880s and 1890s, Harshaw's {{location}} was considered scenic as it was surrounded by oak forests, lush pastures, and enough pure mountain water to adequately run the mill and work the ore. Today, Harshaw Creek is lined with sycamores, cottonwoods, and willows which are typical foliage in more arid riparian zones, as well as enough grass to sustain limited cattle grazing. While the waters of Harshaw Creek still flow, {{they are no longer}} as pure {{as they were in the}} 19th century, as recent studies conducted in compliance with the Clean Water Act have found high levels of copper and zinc, as well as high acidity in the creek. While several factors likely contributed to this pollution, mining and milling residue from waste dumps have been identified as the most significant source. In particular, the <b>waste</b> <b>dump</b> of the abandoned Endless Chain Mine, which is located near the headwaters of Harshaw Creek, is one of the largest contributing factors in the pollution.|$|E
25|$|The Gun Hill Depot {{is located}} at 1910 Bartow Avenue, near Gun Hill Road, {{just west of the}} New England Thruway (I-95) in Baychester, Bronx, and near the Co-Op City neighborhood, which a number of routes serve. Prior to the {{construction}} of the depot, the site was a garbage dump and toxic <b>waste</b> <b>dump,</b> used at various times for both legal and illegal waste disposal. It was selected by the MTA for a new garage in 1979, in order to replace the original West Farms Depot. It opened on September 10, 1989, replacing the old Kingsbridge Depot which was closed the same day awaiting demolition, rebuilding and reconstruction. In 1992, the MTA built little league baseball fields on an adjacent site one block west. The MTA also owned the lot immediately south of the depot until 2014, which was leased and used as a driving range from 1999 to 2010. This land was originally planned for an expansion of the depot, or a new central rebuild facility. The depot also contains heavy maintenance facilities, and served the Bronx's central maintenance facility upon opening, replacing the former West Farms Depot.|$|E
