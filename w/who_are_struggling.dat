25|$|Another {{facet of}} this {{controversy}} is {{the effectiveness of}} the programs dependent upon resources that are pushed more toward students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>struggling.</b> Gifted Education is not mandated in many states, making it elective for districts to earmark money for. Many lower-achieving districts and schools must make crisis decisions on programs that are not high priorities. As a result, gifted students at these schools are not served, or not served effectively.|$|E

Hazel effectively repudiates her nihilism and materialism as she responds across the barrier of death to Gus’s 'okay'."

2500|$|Criticisms of lecture based {{learning}} include {{that students}} get much less interaction with both tutor and colleagues - they passively absorb information in lectures rather than questioning and searching out answers. [...] The lack of interaction also means {{it is harder}} for tutors to know if individual students are struggling as they will only find out if students have not understood the lectures in exams, when arguably it is too late, whereas in problem-based learning, the tutor can assess how much each student is learning based on the student's participation in discussion within the weekly tutorials, and {{may be able to}} help students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>struggling</b> earlier.|$|E

2500|$|... "Special" [...] and [...] "Express" [...] are {{four-year}} courses {{leading up}} to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE [...] "O" [...] Level examination. The difference between these two courses is that in the [...] "Special" [...] stream, students take 'Higher Mother Tongue' (available for Standard Mandarin, Malay and Tamil only) instead of 'Mother Tongue'. A pass in the Higher Mother Tongue 'O' Level Examination constitutes the fulfilment of the Mother Tongue requirement in Singapore, whereas Normal Mother Tongue Students will have to go through one more year of study in their Mother Tongue after their 'O' Levels to take the 'A' Level H1 Mother Tongue Examinations and fulfil the MOE's requirement. A foreign language, either French, German, Japanese or Spanish can be taken in addition to the mother tongue or can replace it. This is especially popular with students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>struggling</b> with their mother tongues, expatriates, or students returning from abroad. Non-Chinese students may also study Standard Mandarin and non-Malay students Malay as a third language. This programme is known as CSP (Chinese Special Programme) and MSP (Malay Special Programme).

Students of Higher Mother Tongue languages are allowed to have up to two points taken off their O-level scoring, unless the student's Higher Mother Tongue is used as their L1 in computation of L1R5. a scoring system discussed below where a lower value is considered better, if they meet set benchmarks.
