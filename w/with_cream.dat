5|$|Flowers {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with two male flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two male and two female) have been reported. At {{the far end of}} the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the triads of male and female flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those <b>with</b> <b>cream</b> or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1970s, Ike Turner's {{excessive}} cocaine habit {{had gotten}} out of hand. During this period, Tina adopted the Nichiren Buddhism faith and chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo to help her deal with a stressful marriage and career. Due to Ike Turner's drug abuse, some shows were either canceled or postponed. In July 1976, Ike Turner had plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year, $150,000 deal <b>with</b> <b>Cream</b> Records. The deal was to be signed on July 6. On July 1, 1976, Ike and Tina were en route from Los Angeles to Dallas where the Revue had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. Ike and Tina got into a fight during their ride to the hotel. Shortly after arriving to the hotel, Tina fled from the hotel and later hid at a friend's house. On July 27, Tina sued for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating him so that she'd have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas.|$|E

25|$|White wine is also {{a dessert}} wine. All choices are allowed even if the sweet and {{fortified}} wines {{are more suitable for}} this.

Crèmes brûlées or caramel which combine sugar and cream can be eaten with a sweet and lively wine such as Jurançon or a late harvest wine. Chocolate requires a very powerful wine so white wine selection is quite limited: a natural amber sweet wine is the best compromise.|$|E
