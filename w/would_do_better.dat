However, Wahid rejected the idea and Yudhoyono became the Minister of Mining and Energy instead. At the same time, Yudhoyono ended his military career with the rank of Lieutenant General, although he would be made honorary General in 2000.|$|E

25|$|The {{pulp mill}} came {{off on a}} poor start, with declining pulp prices. Most of the pulp was {{exported}} and director Henry Melhuus therefore proposed that Saugbrugsforeningen establish a paper mill. He hoped to reduce the volatility in revenue and that the company <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> in poor times. This resulted in {{a plan for a}} paper mill with two paper machines with a combined capaicty of 10,000 tonnes, a new electrical pulp mill with an annual capacity of 12,000 tonnes, an expansion of the chemical pulp mill and an expansion of the power station. Total investments were NOK4 million.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the start}} of his MMA career, people had been advising Bisping that he was a little too small for light heavyweight and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> at middleweight. With the support of UFC {{president}} Dana White, Bisping then decided to drop down a weight division, following his loss to Evans. On 19 April 2008 at UFC 83, Bisping made his middleweight debut against Charles McCarthy. Bisping won by TKO, as McCarthy was unable to continue after the first round due to a forearm injury he sustained after receiving an unanswered series of knees and uppercuts from Bisping.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Yugoslav {{members of}} the Albanian Communist Party had begun {{to think that this}} was a plot by Tito who {{intended}} to destabilize the Party. Koçi Xoxe, Sejfulla Malëshova and others who supported Yugoslavia were looked upon with deep suspicion. Tito's position on Albania was that it was too weak to stand on its own and that it <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> as a part of Yugoslavia. Hoxha alleged that Tito had made it his goal to get Albania into Yugoslavia, firstly by creating the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Aid in 1946. In time, Albania began to feel that the treaty was heavily slanted towards Yugoslav interests, much like the Italian agreements with Albania under Zog that made the nation dependent upon Italy.|$|E

25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E
25|$|Mike Smith {{was called}} up as a {{makeshift}} opener against New Zealand in 1958, making 0 and 7 on debut {{on his home}} ground at Edgbaston in the First Test. In the Second Test at Lord's he took 230 minutes to make 47 in a match where England (269) beat New Zealand (47 and 74) by an innings on a poor wicket. In the Third Test at Headingley Smith made 3 and was dropped. Recalled as a top order batsman against India in 1959 he made his maiden Test century, exactly 100 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford followed by 98 in the Fifth Test at the Oval. He played his first full series in the West Indies in 1959–60, making 39 in the First Test, 108 in 350 minutes in England's 256 run victory in the Second Test, taking longer to reach three figures than the notorious stonewaller Ken Barrington. Thereafter his weakness against quality fast bowling was exposed by Wes Hall and Chester Watson with innings of 12, 0, 10, 0, 23 and 20, but he recovered with 96 in the second innings of the Fifth Test, adding 197 for the seventh wicket with the wicketkeeper Jim Parks. Against South Africa in 1960 he started well with 54 and 28 in the First Test and top-scoring with 99 in the Second Test, where England won by an innings on another poor wicket. This was followed by 0, 0 and 11 {{and the next year}} against Australia he was out for a duck in the First Test at Edgbaston when the part-time bowler Ken Mackay took 3 wickets in four balls and he was dropped {{for the rest of the}} summer. It was thought that Smith <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> in India and Pakistan on the MCC tour of 1961–62 and he made another 99 in the First Test against Pakistan, having come in at 21/2 and adding 192 with Ken Barrington. This stood him in good stead as he made three successive ducks against India before recovering with 73 when recalled for the Fifth Test. Despite his powerful run-making in the County Championship Smith's batting was classed as fragile and he was dropped from the England team for three years.|$|E
500|$|N. T. Rama Rao {{was chosen}} to play Nagaraju, a {{sculptor}} {{during the period of}} Krishnadevaraya's rule. Narasimha Reddy wanted to cast a fresh face for the role of Malliswari and screen-tested Kannada actress Revathi. He later finalised Bhanumathi Ramakrishna, who played a negative role in his previous film Swarga Seema (1945), as the film's female lead, as he felt an experienced actress with a good voice <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> justice to the role. Revathi made a cameo appearance in the song [...] "Poyi Ravamma". Differences arose between Narasimha Reddy and Bhanumathi due to the latter's lack of punctuality. Due to the delay in production of Malliswari, Bhanumathi had begun working in Prema (1952), which was produced by her husband P. S. Ramakrishna Rao. As she sported a curly hairdo, a body double was used for a few sequences as it was in contrast to the simple and soft tresses she sported in this film. Regarding the same, Bhanumathi criticised Narasimha Reddy, stating that he wanted his actresses to concentrate on his films and avoid getting married.|$|E

500|$|R.A., {{writing on}} The Economists Free Exchange blog, {{concluded}} that Cowen's analysis of education {{suggested that the}} rich world <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> by aiding mass education programs in developing countries rather than pursuing the diminishing returns in domestic education and research, in contrary [...] to President Obama's State of the Union speech in 2011. Looser immigration law would also allow rich and poor countries to exploit this source of growth. Secondly, it proposed to harvest [...] "policy low-hanging fruit" [...] i.e. reforming or abolishing foolish and costly policies. It proposed taxing [...] "bads" [...] such as traffic congestion and pollution rather than [...] "goods" [...] such as income, reducing spending on medical treatments with no clear benefits, and removing agricultural subsidies and mortgage interest reduction. In The Economist, two different sets of policy responses were considered {{depending on whether the}} true cause is ailing technological innovation or a decline in workers' bargaining power in the face of emerging-market industrialization. Progressive taxation and redistribution would offset labor's position of weakness whilst a limited state would reduce commitments it cannot expect to fulfill in a stagnating economy.|$|E
500|$|Taylor Swift {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} contemporary critics. Jeff Tamarkin of AllMusic described Swift as [...] "a fresh, still girlish voice, {{full of hope}} and naïveté, but it's also a confident and mature one". He said her [...] "talent to be reckoned" [...] was portrayed through the songs [...] "Tim McGraw", [...] "The Outside", and [...] "Mary's Song (Oh My My My)". Tamarkin criticized producer Nathan Chapman for applying [...] "a gloss that not all [...] really require {{and in some cases}} <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> to shed". Rick Bell of Country Standard Time gave a positive review, saying that Swift had [...] "smart songwriting" [...] and that [...] "her deeply personal, self-penned songs, particularly 'The Outside' and 'Our Song'" [...] were [...] "stirring." [...] He compared her sound to Cyndi Thomson and Hilary Duff. Chris Neal of Country Weekly said that Swift [...] "demonstrat an honesty, intelligence and idealism with which listeners of any age will be able to connect" [...] and added that [...] "the more thoughtful material suggests a talent poised to last well past high school." [...] Ken Rosenbaum of The Toledo Blade wrote Swift [...] "deftly handles lyrics and subjects in that shadowy area between teenager and womanhood." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{started working}} at EJ's {{when it was}} a strip club in about October 1994. A couple of the key staff and I {{convinced}} the owner we <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> as a rock-'n'-roll bar, and decided to launch the new format on [...] 1, 1995. As a future rock club, we decided we needed to rethink our drink selections to suit that clientele. While comparing the prices of the domestic beers, we found that Pabst was cheapest at $33 per keg. The club gained popularity, and Pabst became the drink of choice. On Tuesdays, Pabst was sold at the full price of $1.75, but there was no cover to see the bands. Things kept getting busier. It was suggested that Thursdays become a 'beer bust,' where a patron could get unlimited Pabst between opening at 6 pm and 8 pm, when the room was cleared for the show. By this time, perhaps mid-1996, EJ's had achieved some recognition from touring bands and had a steady influx of national talent, which again increased sales. During busy months, we were getting three deliveries a week and moving more than 40 kegs a month. Years later, Pabst became known as the 'hipster' beer of Portland. There is no way for me to warrant that EJ's decision to make PBR its house beer caused this impact, but I have done so nonetheless, for years.|$|E

500|$|Treloar {{continued}} to seek commercial opportunities {{to raise funds}} for the Memorial during the 1920s and 1930s. As well as selling guidebooks, reproductions of artworks and surplus items, the Memorial raised substantial amounts of money from placing an admission fee on Will Longstaff's painting Menin Gate at Midnight when it went on display in 1929. This painting proved so popular that Treloar engaged ex-servicemen to sell reproductions of it door to door. In 1931 Treloar ensured that the Memorial took over responsibility for the publication and distribution of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918 when the project suffered financial difficulties due to poor sales. As sales {{continued to}} be slow, Treloar actively promoted the series to RSL branches and members of the Australian Public Service; a scheme he developed in which public servants purchased the books through regular pay deductions proved particularly successful. Treloar also engaged more salesmen to sell the series to households. These efforts led to a large increase in sales, and Bean remarked that not only had Treloar been more successful in selling the books than Angus & Robertson, its original publisher, but that [...] "he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> than [...] David Jones selling shirts". This sales work was in addition to Treloar's regular duties as the Memorial's director, and he received an honorarium for it.|$|E

He also said he was worried about his crash because his legs and hips were tingling and his lower back was in pain. Stewart said the crash scared him and the tingling in his legs had improved after leaving the infield care center.

500|$|Ice's third studio album, Hard to Swallow, {{featured}} a darker sound and lyrics than Ice's previous {{work as well}} as various mixtures of different styles of hip hop and hard rock which caught the media's attention. Ice attracted a whole new audience when he started touring again, some who were even unfamiliar with his more mainstream sound. Despite getting its own audience and going Gold, reviews of the album were generally negative. Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote [...] "The most earnest new song, Scars, condemns an abusive father. The sentiments would sound more genuine if Korn hadn't gotten there first." [...] Richard Torres of Rolling Stone gave the album two out of five stars, writing that while [...] "nothing, however, can redeem Ice's wack boasting," [...] the album [...] "isn't half-bad." [...] In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rob Kemp gave the album three out of five stars, writing that it contained Ice's [...] "most convincing music". A lot of executives at SonyBMG were predicting that the album <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> than 'To The Extreme'. In promotion of Hard to Swallow, Ice toured with a seven-piece live band which included bassist Scott Shriner. The band opened with rock-oriented material from Hard to Swallow and concluded with older hip hop songs. The setlist also included [...] "Power", based upon Led Zeppelin's [...] "Immigrant Song". Ice said that writing the songs and performing them were like therapy, as he had tried to hide his anger when making his older songs but Robinson was the first producer who told him to use it to create.|$|E
