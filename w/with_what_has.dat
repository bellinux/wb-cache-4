5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E

The Catholic Church met {{the challenges of the}} reforming movements <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been called the Catholic Reformation, or Counter-Reformation. Europe became split into northern Protestant and southern Catholic parts, resulting in the Religious Wars of the 16th and 17th centuries.|$|E

25|$|Some predators, such as dolphins, hunt {{in groups}} of their own. One {{technique}} employed by many dolphin species is herding, where a pod will control a school of fish while individual members take turns ploughing through and feeding on the more tightly-packed school (a formation commonly known as a bait ball.) Corralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured. In South Carolina, the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin takes this one step further <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> become known as strand feeding, where the fish are driven onto mud banks and retrieved from there.|$|E
25|$|As {{the month}} {{comes to an}} end, with the sun due to rise, the vampires start to burn down the town to destroy {{evidence}} of their presence, and prevent any survivors from telling the world what happened. Realizing Stella is trapped and that he cannot beat the vampires in his current state, Eben turns himself into a vampire by injecting himself with Billy's infected blood. He confronts Marlow, and they get into a vicious fight, before Marlow is finally killed by having a hole punched through his head, causing the remaining vampires to flee. Knowing he will die soon, Eben and Stella go off to watch the sunrise together, sharing one last kiss. As the sun comes up, Eben's body burns to ash in Stella's arms, while {{she stares at the}} sky, coming to grips <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened.|$|E
25|$|The {{artifacts}} {{discovered at}} La Venta have been crucial to starting to understand Olmec religion and ideology. For example, hematite and iron-ore mirror fragments {{have been discovered}} in abundance at La Venta. Mirrors were an incredibly important part of Olmec society, used in both rituals and daily life. Celts, or “pseudo-axes,” are extremely common in both burials and offerings. It is unclear whether these artifacts were actually used in any practical way or if their meaning is ritual or symbolic. Most are smooth, but quite a few are decorated <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been interpreted as representing religious symbolism. Such celts and other jade artifacts were offered to deities during ceremonies at La Venta and the belief in supernatural beings is evidenced in Olmec artifacts. However, {{it is difficult to}} tell which important figures remaining on the stone monuments and artifacts are gods and which are human leaders. In fact, there might have been little difference between the divine and the Olmec king, in their ideology.|$|E

Bianca moves in with her grandmother Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement) in Walford and with Ricky's help, she gets her children back and a waitress job. She rebuffs Ricky's declaration of love, deciding to stand by imprisoned lover Tony. When he is released, Tony resumes his affair with Whitney while Bianca wants to set a date for their wedding. He eventually agrees after winding down his affair with Whitney, to whom {{he is no longer}} attracted. Whitney tells Bianca about their relationship, just as she thinks that she and Tony will run away together. There is a massive row and Tony leaves but he is arrested by the police on suspicion of rape of a minor. Bianca and Whitney's relationship is tested while they deal <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened but eventually bond again and Bianca supports Whitney through Tony's trial.|$|E
25|$|The exact findspots of many objects {{retrieved}} {{during the}} 1920s excavations {{could no longer}} be reconstructed due to the poor publication standards, so that many can only be dated by comparing them <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been found at other sites that do have a good stratigraphy and chronological control. Many of the objects found during the 1920s could be dated from the Uruk period to the Early Dynastic I period. Very few copper objects were found in Jemdet Nasr. These included an adze, a fish-hook and a small pendant {{in the shape of a}} goose. A particular type of stone vessel with ledge handles and a rim decorated by incised rectangles has so far not been found at any other site. The function of a number of flat polished stones incised with lines forming a cross is uncertain, but it has been suggested that they were used as bolas. They are common in Uruk period sites. Because clay as a raw material is widely available around Jemdet Nasr, clay objects are very common. Clay objects included baked clay bricks, clay sickels, fragments of drain pipes, spatulas, spindle whorls and miniature wagon wheels. Beads, small pendants and figurines were made of bone, shell, stone, clay and frit.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} the state's efforts to design the {{electric}} chair became intermixed <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> become {{to be known as}} the War of Currents, a competition between Thomas Edison's direct current power system and George Westinghouse's alternating current based system. The two companies had been competing commercially since 1886 and a series of events had turned it into an all-out media war in 1888. The committee head, neurologist Frederick Peterson, enlisted the services of Harold P. Brown as a consultant. Brown had been on his own crusade against alternating current after the shoddy installation of pole-mounted AC arc lighting lines in New York City had caused several deaths in the spring of 1888. Peterson had been an assistant at Brown's July 1888 public electrocution of dogs with AC at Columbia College, an attempt by Brown to prove AC was more deadly than DC. Technical assistance in these demonstrations was provided by Thomas Edison's West Orange laboratory and there grew to be some form of collusion between Edison Electric and Brown. Back at West Orange on December 5, 1888 Brown set up an experiment with members of the press, members of the Medico-Legal Society including Elbridge Gerry who was also chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC. Based on these results the Medico-Legal Society recommended the use of 1000-1500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities. Westinghouse criticized these test as a skewed self-serving demonstration designed to be a direct attack on alternating current and accused Brown of being in the employ of Edison.|$|E

Tracy, however, tells Kenneth that no deceiving will occur and that he will be honest during the date. Kenneth is still not convinced about the whole idea, but Tracy manages to change his mind. In the second scene, Jack and Elisa are in church.

As the song progresses, it transcends into a ballad, demonstrating romance, excitement and extreme emotions. [...] "Amor Gitano" [...] is completely dominated by flamenco guitars which is interlaced with alternating vocals. <b>With</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> {{been described as}} a [...] "thrilling blend of the stars" [...] by James P. Steyer of Common Sense Media, both Beyoncé and Fernández exchange [...] "heated declaration of love and passion." [...] Lyrically the song contains a broader, melodramatic concept of love with Beyoncé and Fernández exchanging words between verses, for instance in one part, Fernández sings [...] "I'm your gypsy, your pilgrimage" [...] and Beyoncé replies [...] "I'm your thief, I'm going to love you even if they tear my heart out." ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{night out}} with Sam Kingston (Scott Wright), Toyah decides to walk home alone but is {{attacked}} and raped. Toyah is found by Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), who takes her home. Janice initially thinks Toyah has been robbed and is shocked when Toyah tells her she was raped. Toyah gives {{a statement to the}} police and is examined at the hospital. Several male residents are suspected, particularly Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), but they are ruled out by DNA tests. Toyah struggles to deal <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened to her and she develops agoraphobia. While being comforted at home by her friend, Phil Simmonds (Jack Deam), Toyah recognises his voice as he calls out her name and realises that he raped her. Phil realizes that she knows and stops her escaping but Peter hears Toyah's screams and rescues her after knocking Phil unconscious. Phil is found guilty of rape and sent to prison. Toyah has a brief romance with Sam and moves into a flat with Fiz Brown (Jennie McAlpine) and Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie).|$|E

500|$|During {{the months}} that the {{expedition}} remained in Kabul, Habibullah fended off pressure to commit to the Central war effort <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been described as [...] "masterly inactivity". He waited for {{the outcome of the}} war to be predictable, announcing to the mission his sympathy for the Central Powers and asserting his willingness to lead an army into India—if and when Turco-German troops were able to offer support. Hints that the mission would leave if nothing could be achieved were placated with flattery and invitations to stay on. Meanwhile, expedition members were allowed to freely venture into Kabul, a liberty which was put to good use on a successful hearts and minds campaign, with expedition members spending freely on local goods and paying cash. Two dozen Austrian prisoners of war who had escaped from Russian camps were recruited by Niedermayer to construct a hospital. Meanwhile, Kasim Bey acquainted himself with the local Turkish community, spreading Enver Pasha's message of unity and Pan-Turanian jihad. Habibullah tolerated the increasingly anti-British and pro-Central tone being taken by his newspaper, Siraj al Akhbar, whose editor—his father-in-law Mahmud Tarzi—had accepted Barkatullah as an officiating editor in early 1916. Tarzi published a series of inflammatory articles by Raja Mahendra Pratap and printed anti-British and pro-Central articles and propaganda. By May 1916, the tone in the paper was deemed serious enough for the Raj to intercept the copies intended for India.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club was positive towards the episode {{and gave it}} an A. He applauded {{the fact that it}} [...] "lets Scully be flawed" [...] and allowed her to be [...] "far more human" [...] than usual on the show. Handlen concluded that the episode was a success because it illustrated [...] "the way our need to connect with others makes us vulnerable". He was, however, critical of Mulder's actions in the episode, calling him a [...] "spoiled ass" [...] and noted that there was a [...] "little boy ignored feel to his dialogue at the end". John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 7 out of 10 and called it [...] "one of the best character studies of the entire series". He concluded that [...] "Much of Scully’s underlying psychology is explored in this episode, and in keeping <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been revealed about Mulder, it’s not pretty. The final act doesn’t quite match the intensity of the third, but it’s rather clear what the writers were trying to convey." [...] Meghan Deans from Tor.com wrote positively of the episode and noted that [...] "t is fortunate, I think, that the Super Bowl forced the change in sequence." [...] She argued that, had “Leonard Betts” not aired before [...] "Never Again", the audience would have been forced to [...] "read her actions as reactions to Mulder and Mulder alone" [...] rather than against the fact that she has cancer.|$|E
500|$|Cryer's {{long run}} of {{unsuccessful}} TV projects finally ended three years later. Against {{the wishes of}} CBS executives (who were aware of his past failures) and due to a friendship with Charlie Sheen, he was cast in 2003 to portray Alan Harper on the hit comedy series Two and a Half Men. He has earned seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations and two wins for his acting work on the show. In a comment on the show's high ratings, he said: [...] "When you’re on a show that's fighting for survival every week, you stop trusting your instincts, because you think, ‘My instincts haven't worked so far.’ But when people clearly like the show and are watching it in great numbers, it takes {{a huge amount of}} pressure off you. It allows you to trust your instincts and go <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> worked for you before." [...] After former co-star Charlie Sheen's departure from the series, Cryer's character became the show's main protagonist (with Ashton Kutcher being cast as the co-lead) throughout the final four seasons, mainly due to the show's retooled plot. At the end of the series of Two and a Half Men, Cryer is the only actor to have appeared in every episode of the series, since Sheen was fired in March 2011 and his on-screen son Angus T. Jones left the series at the end of season 10, after expressing the show as [...] "filth" [...] and that Jones is a [...] "paid hypocrite". All appeared to be forgiven, however, as Jones, contrary to Charlie Sheen, appeared to great applause in the finale. [...] Before being cast for Two and a Half Men, Cryer auditioned for the role of Gaius Baltar on the Sci-Fi Channel's reimagined Battlestar Galactica, but the role went to James Callis. In 2008, Cryer appeared with Laurence Fishburne and James Cromwell in the film Tortured, and in 2009 co-starred with James Spader in the film Shorts.|$|E
