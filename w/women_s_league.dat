A positive and statistically significant correlation between exports and <b>women</b> <b>s</b> share of employment is found while there is a statistically significant and negative correlation between <b>women</b> <b>s</b> share in employment and imports. The correlations stem from variation between sectors rather than within sectors over time, indicating that export-competing industries tend to employ women while import-competing industries tend to employ men. Trade liberalization is likely to create jobs for women and over time increase their relative wages. ...|$|R

In The Feminine Mystique Betty Friedan gave a name to the frustration white middle-class women living in suburbia with 3. 2 children felt. Women suddenly realized that they were not alone with their problems. Betty Friedan named the frustration that many career homemakers felt the problem that has no name, and urged them to break away from their domestic confines, go back to school, pursue careers, and revive the vision of female independence that had been alive before World War II. The Feminine Mystique lit a spark for the <b>women</b> <b>s</b> liberation movement in the late 1960 s. The movement included the Old Left women in National Organization of Women (NOW), and the young women who created loosely affiliated small groups collectively known as the <b>women</b> <b>s</b> liberation movement. <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> rights entered the political agenda, with giving women the right to abortion in 1973 among the most important victories...|$|R

Recent demographic shifts have diminished the proportion of young white males, traditionally the major recipients of S 2 ̆ 6 E degrees. This trend, coupled with a production plateau of <b>women</b> <b>S</b> 2 ̆ 6 E doctorates after a sharp rise in the 1970 s and 1980 s, signals a need for effective recruitment and retention strategies toward reigniting an upward trend for <b>women</b> <b>S</b> 2 ̆ 6 E production if the U.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This PhD takes a social constructionist approach (see Burr, 2003) to explore how professional women in Sri Lanka make sense of and enact their careers. By explaining career through the recursive relationship between social context and individual agency, this study adds new insights into existing understandings of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers which are dominated by psychological models of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> development over their lifespans (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005; Pringle and Dixon, 2003). Most importantly this study which addresses <b>women</b> <b>s</b> experiences in Sri Lanka fulfils a significant gap in the extant literature which has paid only little attention to careers in South Asian nations. This study is based on qualitative interviews (see King, 2004) conducted with 24 professional Sri Lankan women: eight in early career, eight in mid-career and eight in late career (see O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005). All respondents aspired to reach the highest possible level in their organisations hierarchies and therefore continuously engaged with work organisations, home and family and wider contextual structures in Sri Lanka in pursuit of achieving their career goals, contributing towards maintaining and/or transforming these social structures in the process. Based on these findings I developed a theoretical framework to understand <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers in a dynamic and contextually significant manner. This framework highlights eight different strategies women use to develop their careers which has four possible social outcomes. In illuminating specifically what women do to advance their careers within their social contexts and with what implications this framework makes {{a significant contribution to}} the careers literature which gives only little attention to individuals career strategies. Moreover by appreciating both social context and individual agency as explanations of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers this model refrains from taking an overly deterministic (see McRae, 2003; Crompton, 2011) or voluntaristic (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005) stance to conceptualising <b>women</b> <b>s</b> career development. Second, I outline a South Asian model of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> career development highlighting family, moral notions, religious philosophies and wider belief systems such as astrology and horoscopes as central constituents of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers. I highlight how these understandings could be used to identify blind spots in existing literature and further develop prevailing ideas of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers in the West. Specifically I argue that traditional notions do not altogether disappear as societies develop (see Gerth and Mills, 1991), but rather individuals use these notions to walk towards modernity. Finally I conclude the thesis by outlining how scholars could develop my work further, calling upon authors to bring moral character, traditional notions and enchantment back to the careers field.
