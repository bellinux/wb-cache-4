2500|$|Producer Burk {{explained}} the viral tie-in, [...] "It was all done {{in conjunction with}} the studio... The whole experience in making this movie is very reminiscent of how we did Lost." [...] Director [...] Reeves described Slusho! as [...] "part of the involved connectivity" [...] with Abrams' Alias and that the drink represented a [...] "meta-story" [...] for Cloverfield. The director explained, [...] "It's almost like tentacles that grow out of the film and lead, also, to the ideas in the film. And there's this weird way where you can go see the movie and it's one experience... But there's also this other place <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> engaged where there's this other sort of aspect for all those people who are into that. All the stories kind of bounce off one another and inform each other. But, {{at the end of the}} day, this movie stands on its own to be a movie.... The Internet sort of stories and connections and clues are, in a way, a prism and they're another way of looking at the same thing. To us, it's just another exciting aspect of the storytelling." ...|$|E

Deluded friend, who suffered in Scotland last year a month of Tantalus his torments, furnished by art and nature with rods, flies, whisky, scenery, keepers, salmon innumerable, and all that man can want, except water to fish in; and who returned, having hooked accidentally by the tail one salmon--which broke all and ween to sea--why did you not stay at home and take your two-pounders and three-pounders out of the quiet chalk brook which never sank an inch through all that drought, so deep in the caverns of the hills are hidden its mysterious wells?

500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for {{the size}} of the game's worlds. Jes Bickham of GamesRadar described Banjo-Tooie as a game that requires a massive time-investment on the player's part, saying that [...] "Keeping track of what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do next, or <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> re-visit to <b>get</b> something new, requires either a photographic memory or copious note-taking". Similarly, GamePro remarked that the game is so large that players might lose their way and forget what they are supposed to do. GameSpot's Shane Satterfield praised the game's level design and progression for constantly requiring players to collect Jiggies. Despite the praise, Edge concluded that Rare should have innovated more instead of simply copying the formula of Super Mario 64. At the 2000 GameSpot Game of the Year awards, Banjo-Tooie was awarded Best Platform Game.|$|R
