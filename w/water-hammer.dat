50|$|Column {{separation}} {{is a phenomenon}} that can occur during a <b>water-hammer</b> event. If the pressure in a pipeline drops below the vapor pressure of the liquid, cavitation will occur (some of the liquid vaporizes, forming a bubble in the pipeline, keeping the pressure close to the vapor pressure). This {{is most likely to}} occur at specific locations such as closed ends, high points or knees (changes in pipe slope). When subcooled liquid flows into the space previously occupied by vapor the area of contact between the vapor and the liquid increases. This causes the vapor to condense into the liquid reducing the pressure in the vapor space. The liquid {{on either side of the}} vapor space is then accelerated into this space by the pressure difference. The collision of the two columns of liquid (or of one liquid column if at a closed end) causes a large and nearly instantaneous rise in pressure. This pressure rise can damage hydraulic machinery, individual pipes and supporting structures. Many repetitions of cavity formation and collapse may occur in a single <b>water-hammer</b> event.|$|E

50|$|A good {{explanation}} can {{be found}} in the 1901 article referenced below: The operation of the pulsometer is as follows: The ball being at the entrance of the left-hand chamber, and the right-hand being full of water, steam enters, pressing on the surface of the water, and forcing it out through the discharge passage. A rapid condensation of steam occurs from contact with the water and with the walls of the chamber, previously cooled by the water. When the water level has reached the horizontal edge of the discharge passage, a large volume of steam suddenly escapes and is at once condensed by the relatively cold water between the chamber and the discharge valve. The pressure in the chamber quickly decreases; it cannot be sustained by steam from the boiler, for, in accordance with the inventor's first specifications, the steam pipe is small. If now the pressure in the left chamber is equal, or nearly equal, to that in the right, friction caused by the rapid flow of steam past the ball will draw the ball over and close the right-hand chamber. Cut off from further supply, the steam, in contact with water, begins to condense; a jet of cold water from the discharge pipe spurts up through the injection tube, and by breaking into spray against the side of the steam space, completes the condensation. The partial vacuum produced brings water through the suction valve to fill the chamber; but at the same time the air valve admits a little air, which passes up ahead of the water and forms an elastic cushion to prevent the water from striking violently against the steam ball. The air chamber is for the purpose of preventing <b>water-hammer</b> in the suction pipe.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{performs}} linear stability {{analysis of}} base flow velocity profiles for laminar and turbulent <b>water-hammer</b> flows. These base flow velocity profiles are determined analytically, where the transient {{is generated by}} an instantaneous reduction in flow rate at the downstream end of a simple pipe system. The presence of inflection points in the base flow velocity profile and the large velocity gradient near the pipe wall are the sources of flow instability. The main parameters that govern the stability behavior of transient flows are the Reynolds number and dimensionless timescale. The stability of the base flow velocity profiles with respect to axisymmetric and asymmetric modes is studied and its results are plotted in the Reynolds number/timescale parameter space. It is found that the asymmetric mode with azimuthal wave number 1 is the least stable. In addition, {{the results indicate that}} the decrease of the velocity gradient at the inflection point with time is a stabilizing mechanism whereas the migration of the inflection point from the pipe wall with time is a destabilizing mechanism. Moreover, it is shown that a higher reduction in flow rate, which results in a larger velocity gradient at the inflection point, promotes flow instability. Furthermore, it is found that the stability results of the laminar and the turbulent velocity profiles are consistent with published experimental data and successfully explain controversial conclusions in the literature. The consistency between stability analysis and experiments provide further confirmation that (I) <b>water-hammer</b> flows can become unstable; (2) the instability is asymmetric; (3) instabilities develop in a short (<b>water-hammer)</b> timescale; and (4) the Reynolds number and the wave timescale are important in the characterization of the stability of <b>water-hammer</b> flows.

40|$|This {{technical}} note introduces an alternative method of transforming hyperbolic partial-differential equations into characteristic form.

Thus, the method {{is analogous to the}} 'moving observers' used traditionally in graphical <b>water-hammer</b> theory to solve the equations of motion [e. g., Parmakian (1963) and Bergeron (1961) ] or to the method of deriving simplified governing equations by using a translating reference frame [e. g., Henderson (1966) ]. The difference in the present case is that although the governing equations are assumed to be known, they are transformed into characteristic form by a shift in reference frame. In essence, the transformation uses the total derivative concept and is both simple and insightful. In fact, for both open-channel flow and <b>water-hammer</b> applications, it is shown that by transforming only the continuity equation along a characteristic curve, the dynamic equation naturally arises during the transformation.

40|$|One-dimensional <b>water-hammer</b> {{modeling}} {{involves the}} solution of two coupled non-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). These equations result from applying the principles of conservation of mass and momentum to flow through a pipe, and usually {{the assumption that the}} speed at which pressure waves propagate through the pipe is constant. In order to solve these equations for the interested quantities (i. e. pressures and flow rates), they must first be converted to a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by either approximating the spatial derivative terms with numerical techniques or using the Method of Characteristics (MOC). The MOC approach is ideal in that no numerical approximation errors are introduced in converting the original system of PDEs into an equivalent system of ODEs. Unfortunately this resulting system of ODEs is bound by a time step constraint so that when integrating the equations the solution can only be obtained at fixed time intervals. If the fluid system to be modeled also contains dynamic components (i. e. components that are best modeled by a system of ODEs), {{it may be necessary to}} take extremely small time steps during certain points of the model simulation in order to achieve stability and/or accuracy in the solution. Coupled together, the fixed time step constraint invoked by the MOC, and the occasional need for extremely small time steps in order to obtain stability and/or accuracy, can greatly increase simulation run times. As one solution to this problem, a method for combining variable step integration (VSI) algorithms with the MOC was developed for modeling <b>water-hammer</b> in systems with highly dynamic components.

40|$|AbstractThe {{reduction}} of elevated dynamic loads, affecting {{the elements of}} the hydraulic drive, is an important task in production equipment maintenance. In case of the hydraulic drive with actuators, remotely located from the power source, the piping defines the working capacity of the whole system. Hence the development of piping vibroacoustic analysis methods appears to be the vital task. The said methods would not only help to define the cause of increased loads, but also permit to develop an adequate design solution without prolonged experimental checks. The article proposes the method of pipeline system vibroacoustics analysis through the example of press-forge unit drain piping. The novelty of this method consists {{in the use of the}} fluid pulsation and piping vibration spectra analysis in their correlative comparison with account to the calculated modal parameters of a pipeline. The measurements of working fluid pressure pulsation and pipeline vibration in the vicinity of the breakage locations were carried out. The experimental data spectrum analysis indicated an apparition of intense <b>water-hammer</b> process along with the frequency coalescence of fluid pulsation and pipeline vibration. The resonant vibration amplification, caused by the <b>water-hammer</b> effect, was suggested. The pipeline system mathematical model, allowing to calculate its modal parameters, was derived. The comparison of the modal analysis with the vibroacoustic response confirmed the hypothesis of the pipeline resonant breakdown. The article depicts, that the study of the pipeline system vibroacoustic response, based only on Fourier analysis of the working fluid pulsation and pipeline vibration, is prone to fail the reliable causation of elevated dynamic loads. It is suggested to complement the vibroacoustic response analysis with the modal parameters calculation. The mathematical computation of the modal frequencies and shapes was implemented instead of their experimental observation in order to exclude the undesired signal, introduced with attached mechanical equipment. On top of that, the mathematical computation of the pipeline modal parameters allowed to perform the pipeline modal frequency shift from the <b>water-hammer</b> effect frequency range through cautious relocation of additional supports...|$|E
