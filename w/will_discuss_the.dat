25|$|In general, a {{heat sink}} {{performance}} {{is a function of}} material thermal conductivity, dimensions, fin type, heat transfer coefficient, air flow rate, and duct size. To determine the thermal performance of {{a heat sink}}, a theoretical model can be made. Alternatively, the thermal performance can be measured experimentally. Due to the complex nature of the highly 3D flow in present applications, numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can also be used. This section <b>will</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned methods for the determination of the heat sink thermal performance.|$|E

25|$|The {{campaign}} {{addresses the}} problem of patients receiving unnecessary health care, reasoning that this results in poor outcomes for the patient and could create significant waste in the United States healthcare system. To conduct the campaign, a coordinator from ABIM Foundation asks medical specialty professional organizations to make five recommendations for preventing overuse of a treatment in their field. Distributors then share this information with community groups nationwide, and the medical specialty societies disseminate it to their members. The intent is that patients and doctors <b>will</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> recommendations in these lists, believing that if patients and doctors {{communicate with each other}} more effectively when making health decisions patients will have better outcomes and the medical system itself will benefit.|$|E

With him are Air Marshal Sir George Carrington, his wife Lady Julia and son Reggie, Mrs. Vanderlyn, who is a beautiful brunette American woman, and Mrs. Macatta, a forthright MP. Mr. Carlile, Lord Charles' secretary, joins them for dinner.

They discuss Mrs. Vanderlyn, who is involved in espionage. Lord Charles invited her to tempt her with something big – the plans for the new fighter – to trap her once and for all.|$|E

Alexis books a flight ticket for Mary so that the dust and dirt of regular ground travel will not mar the clothing that Mary is given permission to take with her while away during that busy time of work.|$|E
