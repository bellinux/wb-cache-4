For both elementary and composite cases, the explicit solutions clarify the link between alluvial profile evolution and the migration of channel boundaries.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to carry out molecular dynamics simulations of chemical reactions in solution using combined density functional theory/molecular mechanics potentials is presented. We focus our attention on the analysis of reactive trajectories, dynamic solvent effects and transmission coefficient {{rather than on the}} evaluation of free energy which is another important topic that will be examined elsewhere. In a previous paper we have described the generalities of this hybrid molecular dynamics method and it has been employed to investigate low energy barrier proton transfer process in water. The study of processes with activation energies larger than a few kT requires the use of specific techniques adapted to “rare events” simulations. We describe here a method that consists in the simulation of short trajectories starting from an equilibrated transition state in solution, the structure of which has been approximately established. This calculation is particularly efficient when carried out with parallel computers since the study of a reactive process is decomposed in a set of short time trajectories that are completely independent. The procedure is close to that used by other authors in the context of classical molecular dynamics but present the advantage of describing the chemical system with rigorous quantum mechanical calculations.

40|$|There is a {{considerable}} practical interest in phosphorus recovery from <b>water</b> authorities, <b>elementary</b> P-industry, fertilizer industry and regulators {{in a number of}} countries. Due to a handful of full-scale plants worldwide, P-recovery can be seen as technically feasible. However, the economic feasibility of P-recovery from sewage can still be judged as dubious. The most important {{reason for this is that}} the prices of the techniques (in [/tonne P) are much higher compared to the prices of phosphate rock. In this paper an analysis is given to recover phosphate from municipal wastewater for the elementary P-industry Thermphos International B. V. and the fertiliser industry Amsterdam Fertilizers B. V. in The Netherlands. Several scenarios are evaluated and the end products of these scenarios are compared to the quality required by both industries. From a Dutch study it became clear that all end products from the final sludge treatment do not provide a good source of secondary phosphate. As a consequence of this, the most preferred possibility for P-recovery is to extract phosphate before sludge goes to the final sludge treatment. Different scenarios can be selected based on the position of P-recovery in the WWTP configuration, the type of P-recovery product, and the precipitation technique. Local conditions will determine which scenario is the most expedient. Because it is more realistic to judge a practical situation instead of theoretical estimations based on literature, some local situations have to be assessed in sufficient detail to gain more feeling for the expenses and possible savings of P-recovery. One important actor that should be involved in the process management around P-recovery, is the national government. Especially, the Government have the responsibility for sustainable development and should have attention for some stimulation of P-recovery in The Netherlands.

Here we present an original way to calculate both river depth and velocity from a method that remains embedded in the precipiton framework. The method solves the governing equations for water depth, where the water depth is increased by a constant quantity at each precipiton passage and decreased by a value based on a flow resistance equation. The precipitons are then routed downstream {{on top of the}} resulting water surface. The method is applicable even if the precipitons are routed one by one (i. e., independent of each other), which makes it simple to implement and computationally fast. Compared to grid-based methods, this particle method is not subject to the classic drying-wetting issue, and allows for a straightforward implementation of sediment transfer functions between the river bed and running water. We have applied the method to different cases (channel flow, flow over topographic barriers, and flood prediction on high-resolution lidar topography). In all cases, the method is capable of solving the shallow water equations, neglecting inertia. When coupled with erosion and sediment transport equations, the model is able to reproduce both straight and braided patterns with geometries independent of grid size.

Since the first known <b>elementary</b> <b>water</b> tunnel was used by Parsons in England in 1898 to investigate propellers, its application has remained primarily {{in the field of}} ship propeller testing. Meanwhile, investigations of other submerged bodies and of most fundamental phenomena in fluid dynamics have been performed in the many wind tunnels throughout the world. Even the broad development in hydraulic laboratory techniques that accompanied the revival of interest in scientific hydraulic research during the last twenty-five years did not emphasize the water tunnel as a general tool. In the early stages of World War II, however, there was a shortage of equipment in America, and apparently also abroad, to supply information for underwater ballistics design. Additional facilities in which flow could be produced with cavitation, as well as without, were needed, and these preferably of a type suitable to more general application than the existing propeller tunnels. As a result, there exists now, in addition to propeller testing tunnels, a limited number of water tunnels whose prime purpose is the investigation of flow about bodies in general. Two of these are in the United States, one at the University of Iowa, and one at the California Institute of Technology. This new practice with its additional techniques extends the role the water tunnel is destined to play in hydraulic research. Thus in the current period of reconversion, which applies to research objectives as well as production objectives, a discussion of the present development of water-tunnel equipment and the possible scope of its application in peacetime is appropriate...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} high {{temperature}} exposure on cement-based materials {{have been under}} investigation for quite some time, but a fundamental understanding {{of the sources of}} high temperature degradation has been limited by measurement capabilities. Using recent developments in nanotechnology and microporoelastic modeling, this study identifies sources of high temperature degradation at the nanoscale for the first time. For reference and comparison with existing literature, the traditional methods of thermo-gravimetry, uniaxial compression, and resonant frequency are used to measure mass loss, compressive strength and elastic modulus, respectively. However, microscopic measurement of the elastic modulus and hardness is the primary experimental focus of this study. Microindentation is used to measure the properties of homogenized cement paste, whereas nanoindentation is used to measure the properties of the various phases which make up cement paste. All experimental methods are performed on cement paste subjected to specified investigation temperatures ranging from 250 C to 700 C. Using experimental results in combination with data in the literature, microporoelastic modeling is used to identify the sources of high temperature elasticity degradation which are inherent to each cement paste phase. Only through this unique combination of experimental and theoretical investigations are two primary sources of high temperature elasticity degradation separately identified at the nanoscale: 1) dehydration (loss of bound <b>water)</b> within the <b>elementary</b> building block of C-S-H, and 2) a decrease in packing density of both the low-density and high-density C-S-H phases above 3000 C. Based on these identified sources of high temperature elasticity degradation, a model which predicts the elasticity of cement paste as a function of temperature (up to 700 C) is developed. by Matthew J.
