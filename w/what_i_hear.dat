500|$|Originally 11 Melbury Road, {{the house}} was renumbered as 31 Melbury Road in 1967. It was the second of two houses in Melbury Road {{designed}} by Shaw, the first, 8 Melbury Road, was designed for another painter Marcus Stone. Fildes and Stone were artistic rivals and each naturally regarded their own Shaw-designed house as superior. Of the construction of Woodland House Fildes wrote in November 1876 that [...] "The house is getting on famously and looks stunning... It {{is a long way}} the most superior house of the whole lot; I consider it knocks Stone's to fits, though of course he wouldn't have that by <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> he says of his, but my opinion is the universal one." [...] Fildes moved into the house in October 1877 and it remained his home until his death there in February 1927. Fildes was survived by his wife and six children. [...] In 1959 the London County Council commemorated Fildes at Woodland House with a blue plaque.|$|E
500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E

I use a different technique for each idea." [...] He elaborates further, [...] "The way I hear music {{is a series of}} constantly changing tensions. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> isn't individual melodies or harmonies, but something more like abstract shapes in motion." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 10, 2010, Nita Hanson, a {{black woman}} married to a white man, called Schlessinger's show to ask for {{advice on how to}} deal with a husband who did not care when she was the subject of racist {{comments}} by acquaintances. Schlessinger first replied that [...] "some people are hypersensitive" [...] and asked for some examples from the caller. Hanson informed Schlessinger that her acquaintances had stated, [...] "How you black people do this? You black people like doing that." [...] Schlessinger responded that her examples were not racist and that [...] "a lot of blacks only voted for Obama simply because he was half black. Didn't matter what he was going to do in office; it was a black thing. You gotta' know that. That's not a surprise." [...] Schlessinger continued by telling the caller that she had a [...] "chip on [...] shoulder," [...] was [...] "sensitive," [...] and also, [...] "Don't NAACP me," [...] and, [...] "a lot of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> from black think… it's really distressing and disturbing." ...|$|E

You don't piddle with music—it's a good-time-Charlie business, and for me, the wonderful good times come out of hearing somebody play beautifully. I don't care if it's ‘Stars and Stripes,’ ‘The Victors’ or what it is. I mean, there's a pride. And this guy knows he's good! And nobody can take that away from him.
