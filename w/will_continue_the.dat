5|$|On October 30, 2016, Murphy {{announced}} that a future crossover season of the series <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>the</b> Murder House and Coven stories, merging their characters and themes. He did not state which season it would be, {{but that he had}} already reached out to actors from both seasons to reprise their respective roles. Murphy later confirmed one of the Murder House characters will be moved in the season finale of Coven.|$|E
5|$|Brigade {{headquarters}} {{are scheduled}} to deploy to the Iraq War in fall 2008 to partake in Operation Iraqi Freedom. In July 2008, the 8th MP Brigade began its move into Iraq with a pre-deployment site survey to support the upcoming deployment into the country. The brigade headquarters was set to replace the 18th Military Police Brigade, which ended its deployment in fall of 2008. The 8th MP brigade <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>the</b> training and expansion of the national Iraqi Police force in the Baghdad area. On 2 December, the brigade officially took control from the 18th MP brigade and began its deployment.|$|E
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>the</b> conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E

Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard and affect the player's chosen morality. Morality is measured by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points allow the player to develop talents that affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether new {{elements}} <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>the</b> pattern of the current periodic table as period 8, or require further adaptations or adjustments. Seaborg expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, {{so that it would}} include a two-element s-block for elements 119 and 120, a new g-block for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks, culminating in element 168, the next noble gas. More recently, physicists such as Pekka Pyykkö have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the Madelung rule, which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table. There are currently several competing theoretical models for the placement of the elements of atomic number {{less than or equal to}} 172.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Slash reunited for the Not in This Lifetime... Tour, {{one of the}} most-anticipated reunion {{tours in}} rock history. Alongside Dizzy Reed and {{returning}} member Duff McKagan, who had previously made guest appearances with the band, they comprised two-thirds of the band's Use Your Illusion-era line-up, with Chinese Democracy-era members Richard Fortus and Frank Ferrer joining new member Melissa Reese {{to fill out the}} rest of the lineup. Rose shared a stage with Slash for the first time in nearly 23 years during the group's surprise performance at The Troubadour in April 2016, ahead of its headlining shows at Coachella. He additionally joined Australian hard rock band AC/DC to perform as lead singer for the remainder of the band's Rock or Bust World Tour, after long-time lead vocalist Brian Johnson had to stop touring due to hearing problems. Subsequent reports indicated that guitarist Angus Young <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>the</b> band with Rose as its official lead singer.|$|E

25|$|The {{first series}} proved successful, leading Telltale to begin {{development}} of a second episodic season. The first episode of the second season was released in late 2013.

25|$|The {{engineers}} {{feared that}} the remaining portion of the ship <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>the</b> disruption of the currents, and suggested to finish the destruction by explosives.

Later that day, the trumpet section will play the Notre Dame Victory March and the Notre Dame Alma Mater under the dome. The entire band will play a concert at the steps of Bond Hall, from where they will march into Notre Dame Stadium, leading fans and students alike across the campus to the game.|$|E
25|$|The patriot forces receive {{help from}} the sacristan of a chapel located next to {{the grounds of the}} royalist troops. The sacristan fakes loyalty to the king, but during the battles he sends {{messages}} to the gaucho guerrillas hiding in the mountains by means of a messenger boy and by ringing of the bell. When the royalists discover this, they attack and burn the chapel and smash the sacristan's eyes. Blinded, the sacristan unwittingly guides the royalists to the patriot camp. The royalists then proceed to annihilate the gauchos. In the final sequence, after the battle, the only three surviving characters (the badly injured sacristan, an old man, and the lieutenant who has fallen in love with Asunción and converted to the patriot cause) see Güemes' arriving troops, which <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>the</b> battle.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo Maugeri, vice {{president}} of the Italian energy company Eni, argues that nearly all of peak estimates do not take into account unconventional oil even though the availability of these resources is significant and the costs of extraction and processing, while still very high, are falling because of improved technology. He also notes that the recovery rate from existing world oil fields has increased from about 22% in 1980 to 35% today because of new technology and predicts this trend <b>will</b> <b>continue.</b> <b>The</b> ratio between proven oil reserves and current production has constantly improved, passing from 20 years in 1948 to 35 years in 1972 and reaching about 40 years in 2003. These improvements occurred even with low investment in new exploration and upgrading technology because of the low oil prices during the last 20 years. However, Maugeri feels that encouraging more exploration will require relatively high oil prices.|$|E
