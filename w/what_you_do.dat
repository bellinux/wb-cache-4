Warren Weaver {{pointed out that the}} word information in communication theory is not related to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> say, but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise.|$|E

Stefani also released a series of dolls named the [...] "Love. Angel. Music. Baby. Fashion Dolls", designed after the costumes from her tour.

500|$|The scenes {{depicting}} Washington, D.C. in {{the episode}} were filmed at Simon Fraser University on Burnaby Mountain in British Columbia. Shooting at this location was made difficult by the confined space available {{in which to}} set up the necessary equipment. The invisible alien featured in this episode appears to be inspired by the movie Predator. The alien was deliberately made invisible in order for it to be scarier to the audience, with series creator Chris Carter noting that [...] "what you don't see is scarier than <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> see". Casting director Lynne Carrow was proud of Scott Bellis' performance as Max, calling him in 1995 perhaps her proudest find in casting the show, saying that he [...] "Just knocked our socks off". Carter also praised the performance of guest star Marshall Bell as Colonel Henderson and was proud that the episode permitted the producers to expand the role of Deep Throat.

At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in lieder-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer.

[...] Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell.
