40|$|So far the lattice Boltzmann (LB) {{method has}} matured as a {{powerful}} tool to address a diversity of heat and mass transfer challenges. For most practical applications, the variation of thermophysical properties of <b>working</b> <b>media</b> will influence the performance of industrial systems substantially. However, nowadays the {{efforts to improve the}} LB method to consider variable thermophysical properties of <b>working</b> <b>media</b> are quite sparse. In the present work we firstly analyze the shortcomings of the available LB approaches for modeling working fluid with variable thermophysical properties. Based on the analysis, a simple LB model is proposed to overcome these shortcomings. The feasibility and reliability of the new LB model have been validated by three simple but nontrivial benchmark tests. Although it is originally proposed to simulate fluid flow with variable thermophysical properties, the present model can be extended directly to some other research areas where variation of thermophysical properties of <b>working</b> <b>media</b> should be considered, such as conjugate heat transfer between solid materials...|$|E
30|$|Heat {{exchange}} {{efficiency is}} an important property of <b>working</b> <b>media</b> used in heat transfer devices. It affects the economic attractiveness and general performance of the related devices. In the past several years, great {{efforts were made to}} improve the efficiency of the <b>working</b> <b>media</b> while nanofluids were explored. In the work of Choi et.al[1] and Eastman et.al[2], nanofluids showed great enhancements in thermal conductivity when small amounts of metallic or other nanoparticles were dispersed in common heat transfer fluids. When the composition of the nanofluids was settled, the heat transfer efficiency greatly depended on the synthesis procedure.|$|E
40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach to}} the production of thin-walled workpieces in high strength materials is the use of a special pneumomechanical high-speed-forming process. This process uses a pneumatically accelerated plunger that dives into a pressure chamber filled with the <b>working</b> <b>media</b> in order to generate a short pressure pulse. Ways in which the pressure pulse can be influenced include e. g. varying the type of <b>working</b> <b>media,</b> the density of the <b>working</b> <b>media,</b> the accelerating pressure distance and the plunger geometry. The influence of these parameters on the process formed the subject of intense technological research at the Chair of Forming and Machining Technology (LUF) at Paderborn University. The results of these investigations were used to achieve an appropriate process and tool design for the pneumomechanical high-speed forming process. It thus proved possible to manufacture complex workpieces and geometrical details from thin-walled, high strength stainless steel or aluminium alloys that cannot be produced by conventional stamping processes. Because of the high uniformity of the pressure distribution in the radial direction, it is possible to achieve just small dimensional or geometrical deviations in respect of the desired shape of the workpiece. The planned paper will present results of the basic research conducted into pneumomechanical high-speed-forming as well as a comparison with electrohydraulic forming...|$|E

During the whole reaction time, the conical flask was kept on a shaker with constant speed at 130  rpm (rotations per minute). On completion of reaction time, the adsorbate is separated from the solution using Whatman filter paper No. 42 and the filtrate is analysed for residual fluoride concentration using the SPADNS method. A known weight of adsorbent material is added into 50  mL of prepared samples of fluoride taken in a conical flask.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A high {{temperature}} heat pipe heat exchanger consists of heat pipes filled with different <b>working</b> <b>media</b> inside. In different temperature zones, heat pipes with different <b>working</b> <b>media</b> are linked safely by controlling the vapor temperature, the media inside the heat pipe. The vapor temperature inside the pipe is heavily {{affected by the}} temperature field of fluid outside the heat pipes and the heat transfer performance inside the heat pipe, while the heat transfer performance inside the pipe in turn has a bearing on the temperature distribution of fluid outside the pipe. to coordinate the fluid temperature distribution {{both inside and outside}} the pipes, study on local heat transfer enhancement has been conducted on {{high temperature}} heat pipe heat exchanger in this article, and CFD computational software was used to make rational and accurate prediction of fluid temperature distribution {{both inside and outside the}} pipes, so as to provide economic and reliable design basis for high temperature heat pipe heat exchanger...|$|E
