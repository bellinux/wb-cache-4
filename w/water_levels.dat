5|$|During {{the winter}} and spring, when the <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> were higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the highest}} <b>water</b> <b>level,</b> input <b>water,</b> output water and {{rainfall}} at Baiyangdian Lake in recent 50 years, the characteristics of <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changing and the corresponding reason are analyzed.

There exist more possibilities for Locusta Migratoria Manilensis Meyen to outbreak immediately after going back from the peak value and trough of <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> Moreover, the comparatively low <b>water</b> <b>level</b> between May and October may accelerate the outbreak of Locusta Migratoria Manilensis Meyen.

40|$|Temporal {{behaviors}} of the Yamula dam (on Kızılırmak River and far 35 km from Kayseri city in Turkey) were monitored by using geodetic measurements covering four periods of 1, 5 years. A developed deformation analysis technique {{was used to determine}} whether there was a relation between dam subsidence and reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising. Investigations indicated that there was an apparent linear relation between dam subsidence and reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising. In addition, there was evidence of reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising in the amplitude of displacement. So, reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising was regarded as a causative force in the formulation of the model. The analysis of reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising by the dynamic model clearly indicated that large <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising on the reservoir were an important triggering factor for the dam deformations. The developed model was capable of determining relations between vertical displacements and reservoir <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rising in addition to displacements, velocities and accelerations of displacements.

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>level</b> {{monitoring}} {{is important}} for understanding the global hydrological cycle. Remotely-sensed indices that capture localized instantaneous responses have been extensively explored for <b>water</b> <b>level</b> reconstruction {{during the past two}} decades. However, the potential usage of the Palmer’s Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices for <b>water</b> <b>level</b> reconstruction and prediction has not been explored. This paper examines the relationship between observed <b>water</b> <b>level</b> and PDSI based on a soil-moisture water balance model and three ENSO indices for the lower Mekong River estuary on a monthly temporal scale. We found that the time-lagged information between the standardized <b>water</b> <b>level</b> and the ENSO indices that enabled us to reconstruct the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> using the ENSO indices. The influence of strong ENSO events on the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> can help capture the hydrological extremes during the period. As a result, PDSI-based <b>water</b> <b>level</b> reconstruction can be further improved with the assistance of ENSO information (called ENSO-assisted PDSI) during ENSO events. The <b>water</b> <b>level</b> reconstructed from the PDSI and ENSO indices (and that of remote sensing) compared to observed <b>water</b> <b>level</b> shows a correlation coefficient of around 0. 95 (and < 0. 90), with an RMS error ranging from 0. 23 to 0. 42 m (and 0. 40 to 0. 79 m) and an NSE around 0. 90 (and < 0. 81), respectively. An external assessment also displayed similar results. This indicates that the usage of ENSO information could lead to a potential improvement in <b>water</b> <b>level</b> reconstruction and prediction for river basins affected by the ENSO phenomenon and hydrological extremes...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to confirm the role of <b>water</b> <b>level</b> and <b>water</b> temperature in inducing the spawning of tropical walking catfish. Mature males and females reared under 23 - 25 °C, were paired and induced to spawn by controlling <b>water</b> <b>level</b> and <b>water</b> temperature. Decreasing <b>water</b> <b>level</b> and returning it to its original level resulted in a low spawning rate (less than 6. 7 %) at 23 °C. Decreasing <b>water</b> <b>level</b> with simultaneous increase in water temperature, followed by returning the respective levels to their originals gave high spawning rates (41. 7 — 50 %); whereas the same treatment but without any water temperature decreased when the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> was returned to the initial level, gave a low spawning rate (16. 7 %). Increasing <b>water</b> <b>level</b> only, failed to induce spawning. A high spawning rate was obtained also when changes in <b>water</b> <b>level</b> were carried out under high temperature of 28 °C. No fish spawned {{in the absence of}} the environmental stimulation. From the results, it is confirmed that <b>water</b> <b>level</b> and temperature play important roles in inducing spawning of tropical walking catfish. Changes in water temperature probably increase the sensitivity of fish to the change in <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> Prolonged exposure to high water temperature could also improve the sensitivity of fish...|$|R

Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E

40|$|Obtaining a {{quantitative}} understanding of river–groundwater interactions is of high practical relevance, for instance {{within the context}} of riverbank filtration and river restoration. Modeling interactions between river and groundwater requires knowledge of the river’s spatiotemporal <b>water</b> <b>level</b> distribution. The dynamic nature of riverbed morphology in restored river reaches might result in complex river <b>water</b> <b>level</b> distributions, including disconnected river branches, nonlinear longitudinal <b>water</b> <b>level</b> profiles and morphologically induced lateral <b>water</b> <b>level</b> gradients. Recently, two new methods were proposed to accurately and efficiently capture 2 D <b>water</b> <b>level</b> distributions of dynamic rivers. In this study, we assessed the predictive capability of these methods with respect to simulated groundwater residence times. Both methods were used to generate surface <b>water</b> <b>level</b> distributions of a 1. 2 km long partly restored river reach of the Thur River in northeastern Switzerland. We then assigned these <b>water</b> <b>level</b> distributions as boundary conditions to a 3 D steady-state groundwater flow and transport model. When applying either of the new methods, the calibration-constrained groundwater flow field accurately predicted the spatial distribution of groundwater residence times; deviations were within a range of 30 % when compared to residence times obtained using a reference method. We further tested the sensitivity of the simulated groundwater residence times to a simplified river <b>water</b> <b>level</b> distribution. The negligence of lateral river <b>water</b> <b>level</b> gradients of 20 – 30 cm on a length of 200 m caused errors of 40 – 80 % in the calibration-constrained groundwater residence time distribution compared to results that included lateral <b>water</b> <b>level</b> gradients. The additional assumption of a linear <b>water</b> <b>level</b> distribution in longitudinal river direction led to deviations from the complete river <b>water</b> <b>level</b> distribution of up to 50 cm, which caused wide-spread errors in simulated groundwater residence times of 200 – 500 %. For an accurate simulation of groundwater residence times, it is therefore imperative that the longitudinal <b>water</b> <b>level</b> distribution is correctly captured and described. Based on the confirmed predictive capability of the new methods to estimate 2 D river <b>water</b> <b>level</b> distributions, we can recommend their application to future studies that model dynamic river–groundwater systems...|$|R
