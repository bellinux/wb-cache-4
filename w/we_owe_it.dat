500|$|The storyline was criticised by {{some former}} Coronation Street cast members, who {{believed}} the producers {{were using the}} subject of rape to gain higher ratings than rival soap opera EastEnders. Taylor defended the storyline and hoped that it would help other {{women who had been}} attacked to seek help. She stated [...] "The main focus of the storyline is the psychological effect that the attack has on Toyah. There are many women out there who have been raped or sexually assaulted and <b>we</b> <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to them {{to make sure that the}} story-line is handled sensitively and accurately. There is no denying that rape is a sensitive and controversial storyline. But I have put my heart and soul into it trying to portray it accurately and I only hope that women who have experienced it will think I have given it justice." [...] A show spokesperson commented that the storyline would be [...] "handled sensitively" [...] and that it would not become [...] "a whodunnit". Some of the male residents came under suspicion and were forced to give DNA samples. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) briefly became the prime suspect, but DNA soon eliminated him from enquires.|$|E

2500|$|In 1940, {{the team}} {{launched}} a similar stunt when Allen announced {{she was running}} for President of the United States on the Surprise Party ticket.

[...] Another typical Gracie-ism on the campaign trail went like this: [...] "Everybody knows a woman is better than a man when it comes to introducing bills into the house." [...] The Surprise Party mascot was the kangaroo; the motto was [...] "It's in the bag."

In a September 2015 interview, however, frontman Greg Graffin stated that he had been working on his first solo album since 2006's Cold as the Clay, and that a new Bad Religion album would not be released until around late 2016. Graffin also said that Bad Religion would begin writing their new album after the release of this third solo album Millport, which was released on March 10, 2017.

Asked in a March 2017 interview about the follow-up to True North, Graffin said, [...] "It's one of the great challenges as artist is to maintain the tradition of his or her prior work.

And she herself wanted to be doing something--it was just because she did not know what it was she ought to be doing that she was reading so extensively and voraciously. She wanted to lose herself in something. Deep in the being of Mr. Direck was the conviction that what she ought to be doing was making love in a rapturously egotistical manner, and enjoying every scrap of her own delightful self and her own delightful vitality--while she had it, but for the purposes of their conversation he did not care to put it any more definitely than to say that he thought <b>we</b> <b>owed</b> <b>it</b> to ourselves to develop our personalities.
