6000|$|NAPOLEON. Because {{their love}} of fighting, their desire for glory, their shame of being branded as dastards, their {{instinct}} to test themselves in terrible trials, their fear of being killed or enslaved by the enemy, their belief that they are defending their hearths and homes, overcome their natural cowardice, and make them willing not only to risk their own lives but to kill everyone who refuses to take that risk. But if war continues too long, {{there comes a time}} when the soldiers, and also the taxpayers who are supporting and munitioning them, reach a condition which they describe as being fed up. The troops have proved their courage, and want to go home and enjoy in peace the glory it has earned them. Besides, the risk of death for each soldier becomes a certainty if the fighting goes on for ever: he hopes to escape for six months, but knows he cannot escape for six years. The risk of bankruptcy for the citizen becomes a certainty in the same way. Now <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> me? ...|$|E

Another possibility might be: [...] "Although everyone heard three shots, only one chamber in the revolver found at the scene had been expended."

5000|$|Hosking {{noticed that}} {{citizenship}} was [...] "relatively narrowly distributed" [...] and excluded all women, all minors, all slaves, all immigrants, and most colonials, that is, citizens who left their city to start another usually lost their rights from their city-state of origin. Many historians felt this exclusiveness was a weakness in Athenian society, according to Hosking, but {{he noted that}} there were perhaps 50,000 Athenian citizens overall, and that at most, a tenth of these ever took part in an actual assembly at any one time. Hosking argued that if citizenship had been spread more widely, it would have hurt solidarity. Pocock expresses a similar sentiment and noted that citizenship requires a certain distance from the day-to-day drudgery of daily living. Greek males solved this problem to some extent with the subjugation of {{women as well as}} the institution of slavery which freed their schedules so they could participate in the assembly. Pocock asked: for citizenship to happen, was it necessary to prevent free people from becoming [...] "too much involved in the world of things"? Or, could citizenship be extended to working class persons, and if so, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> the nature of citizenship itself? ...|$|E
