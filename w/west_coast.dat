If feasible, the extension would be ready by 2030.|$|E

5|$|Following the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor in late 1941, IX Corps was {{assigned}} to defensive duties on the <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> of the United States, specifically the central and northern regions of the coast. The corps oversaw defenses on the <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> {{for the majority of}} the war, but in 1944 it was moved to Fort McPherson, Georgia in preparation for deployment overseas.|$|E

5|$|The {{half century}} {{or so of the}} {{maritime}} fur trade and the North <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> trade enriched Boston shipowners, creating capital that helped New England's transformation from an agrarian to an industrial society. The trade stimulated the culture of North <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> natives, made Hawaii famous and nearly overwhelmed the native Hawaiians with foreign influences. It played a role in increased commercial pressure on China at Canton. Fur bearing animals were devastated, especially sea otters. By 1850, sea otters were virtually extinct throughout the North <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> and found only in the Aleutian Islands and California.|$|E
5|$|Tucker {{began her}} service in 1936. Following shakedown, the new {{destroyer}} {{was assigned to}} the United States Battle Fleet in San Diego, California, operating along the <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> and in the Hawaiian Islands. She participated in naval exercises in the Caribbean Sea, and was then reassigned to duty between the <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> and Hawaii. After a goodwill tour to New Zealand, the ship returned to Pearl Harbor. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7December 1941, Tucker was berthed at the East Loch in Pearl Harbor undergoing overhaul but sustained no damage. Afterward, Tucker escorted convoys between the <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> and Hawaii. She then did escort work to American Samoa, the Fiji Islands, New Caledonia, and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides.|$|E

5|$|<b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> jazz, however, {{represented}} only a {{small part}} of Manne's playing. In Los Angeles, and occasionally returning to New York and elsewhere, Manne recorded with musicians of all schools and styles, ranging from those of the swing era through bebop to later developments in modern jazz, including hard bop, usually seen as the antithesis to the cool jazz frequently associated with <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> playing.|$|E
5|$|While {{alternative}} East Coast hip hop albums, such as De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising ultimately {{sold over}} a million copies, there was no equivalent from the <b>West</b> <b>Coast.</b> With Bizarre Ride, The Pharcyde {{became one of the}} first alternative acts on the <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> to sell large numbers of albums. Though Bizarre Ride did reach Gold status, the album's sales paled in comparison to <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> G-funk releases of the era, such as The Chronic by Dr. Dre and Doggystyle by Snoop Dogg.|$|E

Beginning in 1957 the Douglas A3D Skywarrior began to replace the Savages in the VAH Squadrons. Their {{refueling}} role was continued by the formation in January 1958 of VAH-15 on East Coast and VAH-16 on the <b>West</b> <b>Coast.</b> Both squadrons were equipped with AJ-2s, but both were short-lived and disbanded early the following year.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{original}} plan for Regional Eurostar services to destinations north of London was abandoned, the significantly improved journey times available since the opening of High Speed 1 — which is physically connected to both the East Coast Main Line and the North London Line (for the <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> Main Line) at St Pancras — and the recently increased maximum speeds on the <b>West</b> <b>Coast</b> Main Line may make potential Regional Eurostar services more commercially viable. This {{would be even more}} likely if proposals are adopted for a new high-speed line from London to the north of Britain.|$|E
