50|$|Besides the motor, {{the battery}} {{is the main}} {{component}} of pedelec technology. It is usually either a NiMH - Ni - or a lithium-ion battery. The battery capacity is up to 24 Ah n (Ah) at 24 or 36 V (V) or up to 15 amp hours at 48 volts. The stored energy can be up to about 800 <b>watt</b> <b>hour</b> n (Wh), but mostly about 400 Wh (2013). In ideal conditions, after a thousand charges NiCd batteries have 85% of their original capacity and are therefore considered worn. With NiMH batteries about 400 to 800 cycles are possible. The charging time {{depending on the type of}} battery is around 2 to 9 hours. The durability of the battery is dependent on other factors. As lead-acid batteries discharge they provide less power, so that full motor power is no longer achieved. The very light, more expensive lithium ion batteries are now used by most manufacturers and have a range of up to 100 kilometers with moderate pedaling and a medium capacity battery (e.g. 15 Ah). Lithium batteries do not tolerate frost and should not be charged at frosty temperatures. For safety, the chemical composition and the quality of the electronics are crucial. Especially with short circuit and over voltage, lithium-ion batteries react very strongly. These problems in laptops have led to recalls. Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries are a notable exception. They have far safer thermal characteristics as well as being non-toxic.|$|E

40|$|As the {{foundation}} of the nation’s information infrastructure, data centers have been growing rapidly in both number and capacity to meet the increasing demands for highlyresponsive computing and massive storage. Data center energy consumption doubled from 2000 to 2006, reaching a value of 60 TWh/year (Tera <b>Watt</b> <b>hour</b> / year). Coupled with increasing power and cooling demands imposed by the Moore’s law and with the quest for high density data centers, this trend has been rapidly raising the energy cost associated with data centers. Data centers are large cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with hundreds of variables that can be measured and controlled. Dynamics of the controlled processes span multiple time scales: electricity costs can fluctuate hourly, temperatures evolve in the order of minutes, and CPU power states can be changed as frequent as milliseconds. Processes also differ in the spatial areas they influence: computer room air conditioners (CRAC) affect the inlet air temperatures of multiple servers, whereas CPU power states affect only single servers.

Introduction: The intelligent selection and proper use of incandescent lamps largely determine the volume and growth of the electric lighting industry. Nothing produces such radical improvement in the lighting service as, first, the exclusive use of the best lamps and, second, the frequent and regular renewal of dim lamps. These principles are the precepts and practice of the leading central stations of the country, and should be law for every electric lighting company. Central stations {{are in the business}} of making and selling light. They may sell by the <b>Watt</b> <b>hour</b> or by contract, but, regardless of the way it is measured, the customer is in reality buying and using light. Since the lamp transforms the electrical energy of the generators into light, the best lamp is an absolute necessity to obtain the best light.
