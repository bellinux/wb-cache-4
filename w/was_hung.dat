5|$|City {{officials}} {{scheduled a}} public celebration with free {{food and drink}} for the testing of the recast bell. When the bell was struck, it did not break, but the sound produced was described by one hearer as like two coal scuttles being banged together. Mocked by the crowd, Pass and Stow hastily took the bell away and again recast it. When {{the fruit of the}} two founders' renewed efforts was brought forth in June 1753, the sound was deemed satisfactory, though Norris indicated that he did not personally like it. The bell <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> in the steeple of the State House the same month.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, Rae {{travelled}} to France {{and settled}} in Paris with her mother Janet and sister Alison. They lived there for three years, before {{the family moved to}} the artists' colony at the fishing village of Étaples, in northern coastal France. During this initial part of her career, Rae exhibited works in Australia and New Zealand, though she remained in Europe. Exhibitions in which she <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> included the 1889 New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in Dunedin, and the 1896 Victorian Artists' Society, at which several of her landscapes were shown.|$|E

5|$|James Kinzie, the son {{of early}} settler John Kinzie, built a tavern {{on the west bank}} of the river at Wolf Point in 1828. By 1829 this tavern was {{operated}} for Kinzie by Archibald Caldwell who was granted a liquor license on December 8 of that year. Caldwell left Chicago early in 1830 and Elijah Wentworth became the landlord of the tavern. He was in turn succeeded by Charles Taylor (1831–1833) and William Walters (1833–1836). The tavern became known as the 'Wolf Point Tavern' or 'Wolf Tavern' and a painted sign of a wolf <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> outside the tavern by approximately 1833.|$|E
5|$|Local weavers {{specialised}} in {{the production}} of kersey, a hardwearing and inexpensive woollen fabric that was often used for military uniforms; by the 16thcentury Halifax and the surrounding Calder Valley was the largest producer of the material in England. In the final part of the manufacturing process the cloth <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> outdoors on large structures known as tenterframes and left to dry, after having been conditioned by a fulling mill. Daniel Defoe wrote a detailed account of what he had been told of the gibbet's history during his visit to Halifax in Volume 3 of his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, published in 1727.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{professional}} wrestling matches {{were scheduled}} on the event's card. The main event saw WWE Champion Brock Lesnar defeat The Undertaker to retain his championship in a match where a chain <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> from a pole {{and the first}} man to reach it could use it as a legal weapon in what was called a Biker Chain match. Two featured bouts were scheduled on the undercard. In a standard match for the WWE United States Championship, the Big Show defeated Eddie Guerrero to win the title. The other was also a standard match, in which Kurt Angle defeated John Cena.|$|E

5|$|The Rokeby Venus is {{the only}} {{surviving}} female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively {{by members of the}} Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.|$|E

The Société not only hung many of her paintings and drawings: she was also elected an Associate to the organisation in that year.|$|E
5|$|Bridenbaugh's {{wife died}} on March 19, 1982. A plaque listing his accomplishments <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> {{at the school}} in 1971 and he was {{inducted}} into the Western Chapter of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1972, the Lawrence County Historical Society Sports Hall of Fame in 1984, the Pennsylvania High School Football Coaches Hall of Fame in 1989, and the Franklin & Marshall College Athletics Hall of Fame in 1994. He died on June 14, 1990 of heart disease, at the Indian Creek Nursing Center in New Castle, Pennsylvania, at the age of 100. The field at New Castle is named jointly in honor of Bridenbaugh and Lindy Lauro, a player under Bridenbaugh who later coached New Castle to a 220–104–15 record, making it the only high school in the nation with two coaches who earned 200 or more victories.|$|E

5|$|During a June 2007 {{visit to}} the {{predominantly}} Muslim Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania {{has a population of}} 2.8million, has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy. A huge image of the President <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> {{in the middle of the}} capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him. A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana. The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March, Harclay was arraigned {{before a}} royal justice in Carlisle, but was denied a proper hearing. He was brought forward apparelled in his robes of estate as a knight and earl. His spurs of knighthood were hewed off, and his sword was broken over his head. He was {{stripped}} of his robes, and proclaimed to be no knight, but a knave. He was then convicted as a traitor, and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered. He behaved with dignity at his execution, where he maintained that he had acted as he did {{out of concern for}} {{the best interest of the}} country. After his death, his head was taken to the king at Knaresborough in Yorkshire, before it <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> up on London Bridge. The four parts of his body were dispersed around the country, and displayed in Carlisle, Newcastle, Bristol, and Dover.|$|E
5|$|On the eastern-most beach, Fox Green, {{elements}} of five different companies had become entangled, {{and the situation}} was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of the second wave. Two more companies of the 3rd Battalion joined the melee, and, having drifted east in the first wave, I/16 finally made their traumatic landing on Fox Green, at 08:00. Two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to the east, and as they came in under fire, {{three of the four}} remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines, and the fourth <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> up on an obstacle. A captain from this company found himself senior officer, and in charge of the badly out of shape 3rd Battalion.|$|E

5|$|Spielberg wanted Donovan's death {{shown in}} one shot, {{so it would}} not look like an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover's {{forehead}} and cheeks that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, {{as well as a}} mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on Willow (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody's double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan's skeleton <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact.|$|E
5|$|Stokes {{returned}} from a European honeymoon in 1934, but she produced few works {{in the years immediately}} following. Although the Collins Street apartment had become a full-time studio for Stokes, only two paintings and two sketches from the period are known. The most notable is The Village (c.1933–1935), influenced, according to Stokes' own account, by the post-impressionist and portraitist Augustus John. This work <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> in the inaugural exhibition of the Contemporary Art Society, held at the National Gallery of Victoria. It was included in a travelling exhibition that appeared in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1941 and later in Canada. In 1946, Stokes presented the work to the National Gallery of Victoria.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 Dudley {{was made}} a Knight of the Garter; {{at the end of}} the year he was sent on a {{diplomatic}} mission to discuss Edward VI's hopes to mediate for peace between the Empire and France. He first travelled to Brussels, where he was received by Mary of Hungary on 8 January 1553. Impatient to see the Emperor himself, he tried to intercept him on his way to Flanders. Sir Richard Morrison, the English resident ambassador with Charles V, knew nothing of this until he met Dudley at Treves. The ailing ruler was averse to be molested by diplomats while journeying, nevertheless Morrison arranged an interview at Luxembourg in which Charles referred them to a later occasion. On 11 February 1553 the Emperor gave the Englishmen an audience at Brussels. When Dudley offered to kiss his hand, he embraced him. The visitors noted that the chamber <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> with tapestries depicting the Emperor's victories at Tunis. Charles V was non-committal, declaring that he was well-disposed to peace if he only could trust the French king. On returning to England Dudley had an audience with Edward on 19 February. Jehan Scheyfve, the Emperor's agent, reported that Dudley was discreet, and only mentioned that Charles had given him a present. The French ambassador in London was not pleased. Dudley was elected MP for Oxfordshire in the March parliament of 1553, carrying Edward's train at the proceedings.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at No Mercy was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship. In this match, a chain <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> on a pole above the ring, {{and when it was}} {{retrieved}} it {{could be used as a}} legal weapon. The match was between WWE Champion Brock Lesnar, who defended against The Undertaker. This title match would mark the third pay per view between Lesnar and The Undertaker for the championship. The first being September 2002 at Unforgiven where Lesnar and Undertaker fought to a double disqualification then the second event being the following month at No Mercy where Lesnar successfully defended the WWE title over the Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match. The buildup to the match began on the August 28 episode of SmackDown, when the Undertaker defeated Lesnar and The Big Show in a Triple Threat match, earning a title shot against then WWE Champion Kurt Angle. The following week on the September 4 episode of SmackDown, Angle defended the championship against the Undertaker, however, the match ended in a no contest after Lesnar interfered and attacked them both with a steel folding chair; Angle retained the championship as a result of Lesnar's interference. Two weeks later on SmackDown, Angle defended the title against Lesnar in a match in which the wrestler with the most scoring conditions by a set period of time would win the title in what is called an Iron Man match. Lesnar scored five falls, while Angle scored four in the encounter, thus, Lesnar won the match and became the new WWE Champion. The following week on SmackDown, legitimate WWE Chairman Vince McMahon held a ceremony to introduce the new WWE Champion Lesnar, but was interrupted by the Undertaker and SmackDown General Manager Stephanie McMahon, who announced that Lesnar would face the Undertaker at No Mercy for the WWE Championship. On the October 9 episode of SmackDown, Lesnar defended the title against Paul London. The match was interrupted by the Undertaker, who had a meeting with Stephanie earlier that night. He announced that his match with Lesnar at No Mercy would be a Biker Chain Match rather than a standard match.|$|E
