M. ----, {{one of the principal}} magnetisers of Paris, and from whom, among others, I have had an account of the whole affair, was engaged to magnetise this woman, while M. Cloquet operated on the diseased part. The patient was put asleep, or rather into the magnetic trance, for it can scarcely be called sleep, and the cancer was extracted, without the woman's manifesting the least terror, or the slightest sense of pain! To the truth of the substance of this account, M. Cloquet, who does not pretend to explain the reason, nor profess to belong, in any way, to the school, simply testifies. He says that he had such a patient, and that she was operated on, virtually, as I have told you. Such a statement, coming from so high a source, induced the Academy, which is certainly not altogether composed of magnetisers, but many of whose members are quite animal enough to comprehend the matter, to refer the subject to a special committee, which committee, I believe, <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> very clever men. The substance of their report was pretty much what might have been anticipated. They said that the subject was inexplicable, and that [...] "animal magnetism" [...] could not be brought within the limits of any known laws of nature. They might have said the same thing of the comets! In both cases we have facts, with a few established consequences, but are totally without elementary causes.|$|E

5000|$|Unique {{currencies}} used {{by local}} economies are often {{backed by a}} national currency. Totnes, England is a town that began using the Totnes Pound in 2010. [...] "The Totnes Pound is backed by the British Pound sterling at a one-to-one ratio." [...] The idea behind using a unique, local currency is to keep money flowing through the community while preventing money from leaving or relying on money to enter the community. This allows a community to become self-sufficient, have enough funds to create an energy source for the community to use, and eliminate transportation costs for bringing products into the community. A large reason Totnes wants to become self-sufficient is to decrease its dependence {{on the use of}} oil. The town believes that it is better off in the long run if it is able to operate without relying an oil, which is a finite resource. Multiple towns have followed in Totnes' footsteps and established a local currency. Brixton, Stroud, Bristol, and Exeter are towns in England that have established currencies of their own. A few towns in the United States have also adopted unique currencies. Berkshire, Massachusetts and Ithaca, New York have implemented Massachusetts BerkShares and the HOUR, respectively. While a BerkShare is worth $.95 US dollars, the HOUR is not convertible to US dollars or any other type of national currency. A British Quaker colony in Pennsylvania created and used the Pennsylvania Pound in the 18th century, but fiscal localism failed for the colony and the currency was abandoned.

5000|$|Ottoman Turkish rule {{lasted only}} until 22 April 1484; however, the Ottoman Turks did not occupy Zakynthos. Then it was swapped with the Turks by Venetian {{secretary}} Giovanni Dario, negotiator {{of the treaty}} of Constantinople (1479), against neighboring Cephalonia and the provision of an annual tribute of 500 ducats. From then on Zakynthos remained an overseas colony of the Venetian Republic until its very end in 1797, following the fate of the Ionian islands, completed by the capture of Cephalonia in 1500 and Lefkas in 1684 from the Turks.Venetian rule protected the island from Ottoman domination but in its place an oligarchy established and maintained. As in Venice itself, the Venetian Republic divided Zakynthian society across three broad societal classes, the Cittadini and Popolari based in Zakynthos town and the rural Villani. Shortly after, the infamous Libro d'Oro was first compiled on Zakynthos in 1542. It was a formal directory of nobles {{of the members of the}} local Community Council. After the Ionian Islands were conquered and annexed by Napoleon Bonaparte's France in 1797, the Libro d'Oro was ceremoniously burned in Zakynthos town.The civil and military governor of the Ionian Islands was the Provveditore generale da Mar, who lived on Kerkyra. Authority on Zakynthos was divided into the Venetian, occupied by Venetians and domestic authorities. The Venetian authorities represented the sovereign state and its political and military power over Zakynthos. The domestic authorities were appointed by the local Communal Council which <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> Zakynthians. (Consiglio della Comunità). The Venetian representatives led by the Provveditore (the title in Zakynthos or sometimes Retore) were appointed by the Great Council of Venice. The Provveditore's responsibilities included security from hostile raids, taxation, religious and other issues and was appointed for about two years. The subordinate Venetian officials were the consiglieri, two on each island, who performed administrative and judicial functions along with the Provveditore of each island. [...] The three Venetian officials constituted the reggimento ("regime") of Zakynthos. The title pf Provveditore in Zakynthos could only be held by a nobleman.The cultural influence of Venice (and of Venetian on local dialect) was considerable. The wealthy made a habit of sending their sons to Italy to be educated. Good examples are Dionysios Solomos, a native of Zakynthos and Greece's national poet, and Ugo Foscolo, also native of Zakynthos and a national Italian poet. However, apart from the wealthy, an overwhelming proportion of the population; particularly, from the Cittadini, Popolari and Villani would have spoken Greek and adhered to the Orthodox faith.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the interrelationships of Heterodera glycines races based on their resistance to soybean (Glycine max) cultivars and lines against which they were tested. Greenhouse tests determined the numbers of females of each of eight races of H. glycines that developed on 277 to 522 soybean cultivars and lines. A Female Index (number of females on a test cultivar as a percentage of the number on 'Lee 74 ') was calculated and used in frequency distributions, correlations, and duster analyses of the resistance reactions to the different races in an attempt to determine relationships among cultivars. Frequency distribution patterns of all cultivars and lines tested against each race were skewed in favor of resistance, and in some cases bimodality was observed. The majority of correlations between pairs of races were highly significant. Cluster analyses based on the correlations divided eight races into four clusters that explained 73 % of the variation in resistance. Cluster 1 <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> races 2, 4, and 14; Cluster 2 <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> races 6 and 9; Cluster 3 <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> races 1 and 3; and Cluster 4 <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> race 5.

The study sought to examine whether we can develop more homogenous groups within the adolescent population engaging in NSSI behaviors, and if membership in these clusters have empirical relationships with NSSI behavior, {{as evidenced by the}} chart review, PAI-A, and Rorschach variables. Archival data from a sample of 181 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 were utilized. A combination of hierarchical cluster analysis and k-means partitioning procedures revealed the presence of four clusters of homogeneous groups of adolescents. Meaningful relationships between cluster membership and the external criterion variables were explored. The clinical utility of these clusters indicates that cluster 1 <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> adolescents who were cognitively, affectively, and physiologically depressed, as well as suicidal.
