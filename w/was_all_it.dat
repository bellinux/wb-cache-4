500|$|In Jason Heller's 2013 article [...] "Did grunge really matter?", in A.V. CLUB, {{he stated}} that Nirvana's In Utero (September 1993) was [...] "grunge’s death knell. As soon as Cobain grumbled, “Teenage angst has paid off well / Now I’m bored and old,” it was all over." [...] Heller states that after Cobain's death in 1994, the [...] "hypocrisy" [...] in the grunge of the time [...] "became ...glaring" [...] and [...] "idealism became embarrassing", with the result being that [...] "grunge became the new [...] Aerosmith". Heller states that [...] "grunge became an {{evolutionary}} dead end", because [...] "it stood for nothing and was built on nothing, and that ethos of negation <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> was about." ...|$|E
500|$|Debate {{about how}} to use the slough and its {{watershed}} continued {{through the rest of the}} century. In 1964, the Port of Portland, interested in industrial development, began to fill Smith, Bybee, and Ramsey lakes with dredge sands from the Columbia. In the 1970s, the Oregon Legislature passed a law against filling Smith or Bybee lakes below a contour line [...] above mean sea level except to enhance fish and wildlife habitat. Plans for a Willamette River Greenway project proposed by Oregon Governor Tom McCall in the late 1960s called for park and recreation areas along the Willamette and many of its tributaries but ignored the slough. Some planners argued that the slough was so filthy that more industry <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> was good for. They portrayed cleanup as a lofty but impractical goal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coaching}} {{began to}} be criticized after a pair of midseason losses to the Minnesota Vikings and Denver Broncos. Denver players stated that shutting down Jimmie Giles <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> took to stop the Buccaneer offense, while the defense was still vulnerable to a short-yardage, ball-control attack. McKay felt that the team had become an [...] "aerial circus" [...] and that Williams' performance was being affected by trying to do too much, and so {{made a decision to}} establish a running game, taking over playcalling responsibilities on running plays. Having lost 4 of their last 5 games, there was concern that, about to face a Green Bay Packers team on a three-game win streak, the Buccaneers were about to repeat the late-season slides of the last three seasons. After breaking their two-game losing streak by routing the Packers, the Buccaneers demonstrated a newfound ability to continue to stick to and execute their game plan when playing with a deficit. Quarterbacks coach Bill Nelsen correctly predicted that the Buccaneers' performance against the Packers would cause the Vikings to underestimate the Packers, and thus lose their matchup the following week. Nelsen admonished the team not to miss a chance to take charge of the division, and they responded with an uncharacteristic rebound from a 14-point deficit against the Saints. A Week 14 last-minute victory over the Atlanta Falcons, combined with upset losses by the Lions and Vikings the same day, left the Buccaneers needing to win only one of their last two games to make the playoffs. They were one of only five teams in Week 15 who were capable of winning a division championship without help from another team. The season ended with a matchup against the Detroit Lions in front of a Pontiac Silverdome-record crowd of 80,444, with the Buccaneers and Lions tied for the division lead at 8–7. A season-ending New York Giants win against the Dallas Cowboys left the Giants at 9–7, guaranteeing that the winner of the Buccaneers-Lions game would win the division (the Packers were still in contention, but required an improbable set of circumstances that included a Buccaneers-Lions tie), while the loser would miss the playoffs entirely. Although the Lions outplayed the Buccaneers in most statistical categories, numerous Buccaneers stepped forward with key plays at crucial moments in the game, resulting in an upset victory. A crowd of over 8,000 gathered at team headquarters to greet them on their return from Detroit. The Buccaneers traveled to Dallas for a matchup with the Cowboys, where they suffered an embarrassing 38–0 shutout.|$|E
