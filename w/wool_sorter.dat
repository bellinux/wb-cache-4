In an era when rugby players also needed a 'day job' on leaving school Cockroft trained as a <b>Wool</b> <b>Sorter</b> with J W Allen firstly on Airworth Road and later at Springfield Mill on Oakworth Road. When the wool industry collapsed {{he took a job}} at Ondura working nights.|$|E
50|$|Cutaneous anthrax (<b>wool</b> <b>sorter's</b> disease) {{had become}} a serious problem in the woollen mills of Bradford, the use of alpaca and mohair from Central Asia {{was the source of}} the disease. To counter the problem, Bradford Council {{established}} a Pathological and Bacteriological Laboratory and Eurich was appointed bacteriologist. The laboratory was originally located in the Technical College but in 1905 the Bradford Anthrax Investigation Board relocated the laboratory to Morley Street, where Eurich became the bacteriologist to the board. With Eurich's expertise in the field of bacteriology, and putting his own health at great risk while investigating the disease, the Board instituted other medical measures against anthrax and, in 1918, built a Wool Disinfecting Station in Liverpool.|$|R
5000|$|Immediately before {{classing}} ‘skirting’ happened, {{the object}} being {{to render the}} fleece as evenly as possible by removing any wool which did not match the major portion of the fleece. Once a fleece has been handled, baled and pressed it did not lend itself to further skirting. Skirting and packing enhanced {{the value of the}} wool clip as a whole. Classing {{was one of the most}} important jobs i.e. grading of the skirted fleece in its entirety. This was the application of sounds knowledge acquired from experience and practice. Wool was put into lines according to its class. The first thing was to separate the Woollen and Worsted by the <b>Wool</b> <b>Sorters,</b> then the fleece was graded according to the following factors: ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{he was no}} 'industrial capitalist', a {{term that}} is clearly an anachronism for this era. He was instead principally a wool merchant, dealing in English and {{domestic}} wools, and {{his role as a}} cloth merchant was only secondary ... he owned land, with many properties in Douia itself and a sheep farm outside. As a merchant, he provided wool on credit to industrial drapers, who pledged their cloths, looms and sometimes even their home as security; and some of them also rented their houses from him. But most of his wage-earning employees were those required for the <b>wool</b> trade itself: <b>sorters,</b> beaters, washers and some wool dyers (who worked in his dyehouse). Although Boinebroke did employ a few others in cloth making, chiefly to work some tentering frames that he owned, there is absolutely no evidence that he ever directly supervised the central processes of cloth production.|$|R
