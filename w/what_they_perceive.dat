Grievances include discrimination, the minimum wage and the two-week stay limit at the end of a domestic worker's employment contract. According to the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor (HKHRM), foreign domestic helpers face discrimination from the Hong Kong government and their employers.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 American film {{directors}} Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New World Order, {{a critically}} acclaimed documentary film which explores {{the world of}} conspiracy theorists - such as American radio host Alex Jones - who consistently expose and vigorously oppose <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> as an emerging New World Order. The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing populist agitators (such as Alex Jones) and hip hop music's left-wing populist rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor Griff of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique), thus illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, the World Health Organization (WHO) has {{estimates that}} only 50% of people complete long-term therapy for chronic illnesses {{as they were}} prescribed, which puts patient health at risk.

25|$|The women's liberation {{movement}} is closely {{connected to the}} New Left and other new social movements that challenged the orthodoxies of the Old Left. Socialist feminism, as exemplified by the Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women; and Marxist feminism, as with Selma James, saw themselves {{as a part of}} the left that challenged <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> to be male-dominated and sexist structures within the Left. Liberal feminism is closely connected with social liberalism and the left wing of mainstream American politics (e.g., National Organization for Women).|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} having Tajikistan {{in this article}} is {{primarily}} because the government of the country itself, is - or is seen to be - the source of claimed persecution of Muslims. (As opposed to coming from outside forces or other religious groups.) This can make the reported issues open to bias by media and personal religious beliefs or preferences. In actual fact, the government - with the apparent approval of the people - is attempting to keep the government completely secular (full separation of Church and State) to avoid <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> as problems in other surrounding countries.|$|E

As many as 22% of Spanish citizens feel that a republic would be the better form of government for Spain, while separatists and independence supporters in the Basque Country and Catalonia routinely protest the monarchy as the living symbol of a united Spain. Part of the left criticize the institution of monarchy as anachronistic, while the far right criticize King Juan Carlos personally because he has given his royal assent and tacit approval to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> to be a liberal agenda in Spain and a secularism of Spanish life.|$|E

If some Kaali enthusiasts, therefore, careen ahead, reveling in a goddess of power, many others, particularly since the early 1990s, have decided to reconsider their theological trajectories. These, whether of South Asian descent or not, are endeavoring to rein in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>perceive</b> as excesses of feminist and New Age interpretations of the Goddess by choosing to be informed by, moved by, an Indian view of her character.|$|E
