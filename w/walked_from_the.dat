25|$|Edrich {{should have}} gather in another hundred in the {{following}} Test at Melbourne. He was 89, and batting with audacious unconcern, when Scott gave him out leg before to a ball from Lindwall which even some Australian fieldsmen believed {{had come from the}} bat. It was one of the hotly discussed decisions of the tour, and while Edrich was distressed and disappointed he was still able to grin as he <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> field.|$|E

25|$|Three of {{the crew}} members—the captain, first officer and radio operator—were killed in the collision. Two of the {{passengers}} who were unhurt, one British and one Norwegian, <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wreck to the farm at Askheim, where {{they were able to}} notify about the accident by telephone. A crew of rescue workers were immediately dispatched from Gardermoen. They remained at the site for about four hours; the time was needed to get the steward free from the wreck. He and a passenger were severely injured and were freighted by car to Stensby Hospital. The rest of the passengers were able to walk by themselves and were treated for shock and cuts.|$|E
25|$|His {{grandfather}} {{was murdered in}} 1937 for his labor-related activities. His grandfather had returned from a union meeting when one or more assailants attacked him as he <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> garage to his home. His skull was crushed and {{he was shot in}} the head. Law enforcement authorities suspected thugs under the control of Bugs Moran, head of the Chicago Mafia. Moran opposed Corcoran's efforts to organize workers at Walgreens, and had already severely beaten Corcoran several times while warning him to stop organizing workers. The Teamsters declared a holiday for Corcoran's funeral, and the event at the Basilica of St. Mary flowed into the street.|$|E
25|$|A late 19th/early 20th century {{chapter house}} of the University of Mississippi's St. Anthony Hall Phi Chapter {{subsequently}} was an on-campus childhood home of later Nobel Laureate author William Faulkner, although Rowan Oak is better known for having been his home when he achieved greatness. The older house was a large brick turreted edifice where the Alumni Center Hotel now stands. The Falkners lived in it during the period 1912–22 when fraternities were outlawed {{and was the first}} building of note that incoming freshmen saw when they <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> train station into campus. It and a successor burned down. The Cofield photographic Collection , p.58, cites Faulkner's younger brother, Dean Faulkner, that his brother's room was in the tower.|$|E

25|$|By 1940, {{the work}} Blalock {{had done with}} Thomas placed him at the {{forefront}} of American surgery, and when he was offered the position of Chief of Surgery at his alma mater Johns Hopkins in 1941, he requested that Thomas accompany him. Thomas arrived in Baltimore with his family in June of that year, confronting a severe housing shortage and a level of racism worse than they had endured in Nashville. Hopkins, like the rest of Baltimore, was rigidly segregated, and the only black employees at the institution were janitors. When Thomas walked the halls in his white lab coat, many heads turned. He began changing into his city clothes when he <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> laboratory to Blalock's office because he received so much attention.|$|E
25|$|The {{producers}} and director James Strong paid {{particular attention to}} the visual style of the reveal. Chibnall wanted to expose the murderer's identity visually and dynamically, not through dialogue in a static scene on a set. During a location site visit prior to filming, Chibnall, Strong, and Holmes <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> house at Lavington Close to the house on St Andrews Drive. As they crossed a footbridge over the Land Yeo, Chibnall—struck by the scenery of the area—realised that a single, uncut point of view shot of DI Hardy walking through the Miller house, through the garden, and into the garden shed was the way to reveal the killer's identity. Chibnall and Strong decided that the shot in the first episode of Mark Latimer walking through the Broadchurch High Street should mimic this reveal shot in the eighth episode.|$|E
25|$|Poor weather {{delayed the}} driving of the piles, which took from March to July 1821. The pier was {{decorated}} with flags for its opening ceremony on 14 August. Steamboats fired salutes from alongside the pier. Three hundred people <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Trinity Hotel to the pier, and boarded a steamboat for a brief excursion, while a band played from a second vessel. The opening was attended by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, the local magistrates, as well as Crichton, Ramsay, Scott, Stevenson, and the other proprietors of the company. Admiral Robert Otway (commander-in-chief of naval forces at Leith), General Duff, Sir George Mackenzie, George Baird (the Principal of Edinburgh University), Robert Jameson, John Leslie, William Wallace, and Brown the designer were also present. When they returned they took refreshment in a tent {{at the head of}} the pier.|$|E

25|$|Rosalie Tsannie-Burseth, the province’s local coroner who had {{arranged}} {{the removal of}} Carnegie's body, gave a hypothetical reconstruction of what happened. Her reconstruction was based on tracks of people and animals she observed {{near the site of}} the attack the day after the event occurred. She speculated that Carnegie had <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> camp {{and by the time he}} was a kilometer away near Lake Wollaston, a wolf began following his tracks. One wolf stalked Carnegie from the forest and another wolf stalked him from the lake. Boot prints in the snow showed that Carnegie quickened his pace, as two more wolves approached him from the sides. The first apparent struggle occurred 2.2metres (7ft) from where the chase began. Four more scuffle sites were found leading to where his body was discovered. Tsannie-Burseth believed that Carnegie probably fought hard before finally succumbing.|$|E
25|$|He was {{a member}} of Company C, 325th Glider Infantry, on 9 June 1944 {{advancing}} with the forward platoon to secure a bridgehead across the Merderet River at La Fière, France. At dawn the platoon had penetrated an outer line of machineguns and riflemen, but in so doing had become cut {{off from the rest of}} the company. Vastly superior forces began a decimation of the stricken unit and put in motion a flanking maneuver which would have completely exposed the American platoon in a shallow roadside ditch where it had taken cover. Detecting this danger, Pfc. DeGlopper volunteered to support his comrades by fire from his automatic rifle while they attempted a withdrawal through a break in a hedgerow 40 yards to the rear. Scorning a concentration of enemy automatic weapons and rifle fire, he <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ditch onto the road in full view of the Germans, and sprayed the hostile positions with assault fire. He was wounded, but he continued firing. Struck again, he started to fall; and yet his grim determination and valiant fighting spirit could not be broken. Kneeling in the roadway, weakened by his grievous wounds, he leveled his heavy weapon against the enemy and fired burst after burst until killed outright. He was successful in drawing the enemy action away from his fellow soldiers, who continued the fight from a more advantageous position and established the first bridgehead over the Merderet. In the area where he made his intrepid stand his comrades later found the ground strewn with dead Germans and many machineguns and automatic weapons which he had knocked out of action. Pfc. DeGlopper's gallant sacrifice and unflinching heroism while facing insurmountable odds were in great measure responsible for a highly important tactical victory in the Normandy Campaign.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of February 12, 2008, McInerney was {{witnessed}} repeatedly looking at King during a class in a computer laboratory. At approximately 8:15a.m. local time, McInerney drew from his backpack a [...]22-caliber revolver belonging to relatives and shot King twice {{in the back of}} the head. Following the shooting, McInerney tossed the handgun on the floor and <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> classroom. He was apprehended by police five blocks away from the school campus about seven minutes later.|$|E

2500|$|Weißheimer was {{attracted}} by Lassalle's writings. In July 1864 Weißheimer {{found out that}} Lassalle had arranged an excursion in the Palatinate with the countess Sophie von Hatzfeld. He invited both to Stone Mill. The news of Lassalle's arrival quickly spread in Osthofen. The villagers watched, with curiosity, as both guests <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> railway station to the Stone Mill on 6 July. At the Stone Mill the reception was polite. Lassalle captivated the Weißheimer family for hours describing his plans and goals and he spoke with Johann Weißheimer on his studies about Franz von Sickingen. Lassalle made friends there and when they parted, he ordered a barrel of the [...] "Riesling" [...] {{which he had been}} served.|$|E
2500|$|After the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral the Earps {{relocated}} {{their families}} to the Cosmopolitan Hotel for mutual support and protection.

2500|$|Goodfellow treated Virgil Earp again {{two months}} later on December28,1881 after he was ambushed. At about 11:30p.m. that night, three men hid in an {{unfinished}} building across Allen Street from the Cosmopolitan Hotel where the Earps were staying for mutual support and protection. They shot Virgil as he <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Oriental Saloon to his room, hitting {{him in the back}} and left arm with three loads of double-barreled buckshot from about [...] Goodfellow advised Virgil that the arm ought to be amputated, but Virgil refused. Goodfellow operated on Virgil in the Cosmopolitan Hotel using the medical tools he had in his bag, and asked George Parsons and another fellow to fetch some supplies from the hospital. Virgil had a longitudinal fracture of the humerus and elbow that could not be repaired, requiring Goodfellow to remove more than [...] of shattered humerus bone from Virgil's left arm, leaving him permanently crippled.|$|E
2500|$|Harris {{walked toward}} the bookcases {{between the west and}} center section of tables in the library. He jumped on one and shook it, then shot in an unknown {{direction}} within that general area. Klebold walked through the main area, past the first set of bookcases, the central desk area and a second set of bookcases into the east area. Harris <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bookcase he had shot from, past the central area to meet Klebold. The latter shot at a display case located next to the door, then turned and shot toward the closest table, hitting and injuring 17-year-old Mark Kintgen in the head and shoulder. He then turned toward the table to his left and fired, injuring 18-year-olds Lisa Kreutz and Valeen Schnurr with the same shotgun blast. Klebold then moved toward the same table and fired with the TEC-9, killing 18-year-old Lauren Townsend. At this point, the seriously injured Valeen Schnurr began screaming, [...] "Oh my God, oh my God!" [...] In response, Klebold asked Schnurr if she believed in the existence of God; when Schnurr replied she did, Klebold simply asked [...] "Why?" [...] before walking from the table.|$|E

At 5:00 P.M. (dusk) on Christmas Eve, President Coolidge touched a button {{at the foot of}} the tree which lit the lights and electric candles adorning the tree, but he did not speak. A searchlight from the nearby Washington Monument was trained on the tree to help illuminate it as well. The Coolidge family invited citizens of the city to sing Christmas carols on the Ellipse after dark. [...] Between 5,000 and 6,000 people thronged the park, joined by 3,000 more people by 9:00 P.M. The crowds were joined by the Epiphany Church and First Congregational Church choirs, which sang carols, and the Marine Band played Christmas-themed music. The singing ended shortly before midnight. [...] After the white residents of the city had dispersed, African American residents of the city were permitted on the park grounds to see the National Christmas Tree. An outdoor Christian worship service was held, and a mass choir composed of signing groups from area community centers sang more Christmas carols. An illuminated Christian cross was flashed on the Washington Monument, and men dressed as shepherds <b>walked</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> National Christmas Tree to the monument.|$|E
