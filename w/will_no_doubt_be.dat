5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

500|$|Sense and Sensibility has {{received}} overwhelmingly positive reviews from film critics, and was included {{on more than}} a hundred top-ten of the year lists. Writing for Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy observed that the film's success was assisted by its [...] "highly skilled cast of actors," [...] as well as its choice of Lee as director. McCarthy clarified, [...] "Although [...] previously revealed talents for dramatizing conflicting social and generational traditions <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> noted, Lee's achievement here with such foreign material is simply well beyond what anyone could have expected and may well be posited as the cinematic equivalent of Kazuo Ishiguro writing The Remains of the Day." ...|$|E

500|$|William R. Trotter of PC Gamer US wrote, [...] "Don't expect {{too much}} from this game. It breaks no new ground, pushes no 'envelopes,' and veteran gamers <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> bored by parts of it." [...] However, he argued that players who [...] "accept Hodj 'n' Podj in the spirit {{in which it is}} offered" [...] will derive [...] "considerable delight in playing it — {{especially}} if you have kids." [...] Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai found the game's use of traditional games [...] "downright baffling", given their presence in past compilations, as well as in [...] and the Dr. Brain series. Although he enjoyed the game's graphics and humor, he summarized, [...] "You've seen all the puzzles before, often done better than they're done here. How jazzed can you get about Life or Solitaire, anyway?" ...|$|E
500|$|In contrast, {{the film}} {{gathered}} positive reviews from top critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times enjoyed {{the film and}} gave it {{three out of four}} stars, stating that [...] "Final Destination <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> a hit and inspire the obligatory sequels. Like the original Scream, this movie is too good {{to be the end of}} the road. I have visions of my own". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film, saying [...] " [...] was playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing". Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film, saying [...] " [...] generates a respectable amount of suspense and takes a few unexpected turns while covering familiar territory", while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said it was [...] "a terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong". Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun found the film [...] "fitfully thrilling", while Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide defined the film as [...] "serviceable enough, if you come to it with sufficiently modest expectations".|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{commented that}} this episode {{might have been}} the [...] "best Tracy [...] episode of the season" [...] {{explaining}} that Tracy Morgan [...] "delivered one genius non sequitur after another describing the comically over-the-top horrors of his childhood. [...] The insane, eminently quotable one-liners were flying so fast and so furious that I could barely keep up with them." [...] In regards to Jack's love triangle, Rabin opined that this arc [...] "could easily have worn out its welcome long ago" [...] but that Alec Baldwin, Julianne Moore, and Elizabeth Banks [...] "have kept lively and vibrant." [...] In conclusion, he gave it an A− grade rating. Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was positive about Liz getting engaged, noting that she has become a woman, and concluded that [...] "it <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> one of television's most memorable weddings" [...] if Liz and Wesley get married. Nick Catucci of New York magazine said that [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land" [...] was good, [...] "aybe the best episode ever." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel said that Banks played her role [...] "perfectly", but that he was still not convinced that Sheen's Wesley is the right man for Liz.|$|E

5000|$|Frank Rich in {{his review}} in the New York Times wrote:"...this musical <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> always <b>be</b> remembered, and not without fondness, for its troubled preview period, its much-postponed opening, its hassles with {{snooping}} journalists and its conflict with the city's Consumer Affairs Commissioner. Indeed, the story of 'Nick and Nora' in previews, should it ever be fully known, might in itself make for a riotous, 1930's-style screwball-comedy musical. But the plodding show that has emerged from all this tumult is, a few bright spots notwithstanding, an almost instantly forgettable mediocrity." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{preparation}} for his appearance on Question Time, Griffin researched the first appearance of Sinn Féin's Gerry Adams. In {{an e-mail to}} BNP supporters, Griffin said [...] "Never before have we {{had the chance to}} present our patriotic, common sense solutions to Britain's nightmare situation to the public at large in such prominent fashion ... I am relishing this opportunity, and I [...] know that ... the ordinary members, supporters and voters of the BNP will [...] be in the studio with me as I take on the corrupt, treacherous swine [...] destroying our beautiful island nation." [...] Contrasting to Griffin's earlier 2001 appearance on HARDtalk and later appearances on Newsnight with Jeremy Paxman, Griffin claimed that he was non-combative in his Question Time appearance in order to gain sympathy from the viewers via a [...] "root-for-the-underdog mentality". He had expected to salvage his reputation in expected a later 12 episodes of the programme with him appearing as a panellist, which did not occur. However, he also stated in a letter on the BNP website: [...] "I <b>will,</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> <b>be</b> interrupted, shouted down, slandered, put on the spot, and subjected to a scrutiny that would be a thousand times more intense than anything directed at other panellists. It will, in other words, be political blood sport. But I am relishing this opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics who praised Cole's sense of fashion but cited that the video was unoriginal. Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said [...] "even with all this, she hardly manages {{to create a}} strong impression [...]., the video fails to break any visual ground, albeit standing on its own as a stylish video." [...] The Daily Mail agreed saying [...] " [...] which <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> interpreted by fans as an insight into Cheryl's marriage to footballer Ashley Cole. Cheryl has ditched her street dance gear for a gown fit for a diva along with suitably styled big hair ... But as she teams up with Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am is sporting a more feminine look. The net result is, sorry to say it, very regal but {{a bit on the}} dull side." [...] Lisa McGarry of 'Unreality TV' [...] said the platinum wig was [...] "strange" [...] She also said [...] "if it doesn’t look great, at least it looks shocking." [...] Meanwhile, David Balls of 'Digital Spy' said [...] " [...] this glitzy split-screen affair, Cheryl looks effortlessly classy and glam as she transforms into an Egyptian goddess and - with more success than a certain Mrs. B (Mel B) back in 2001 [...] - shows how to wear a blonde wig without looking like you're on a dirty weekend in the Toon. Perfectly complimenting the song itself, this super-glossy clip also suggests that Cole has a firm eye on global stardom over the next year." [...] Fame magazine called the video [...] "a little edgier than anything Girls Aloud have done".|$|E
500|$|Richard Corliss of Time {{magazine}} considered McConaughey's portrayal to be a [...] "bold, drastic {{and utterly}} persuasive inhabiting of a doomed fighter", remarking that [...] "if the camera occasionally suffers a fashionable {{case of the}} jitters, the movie transcends its agitated verismo to impart dramatic and behavioral truth". Chris Bumbray reviewed the film for JoBlo.com and gave it 9 out of 10, and said, [...] "Like Woodroof, the film never wants your pity, and while tears <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> shed while watching it, they're well-earned." [...] The Philadelphia Inquirers Steven Rea talked about McConaughey's role, [...] "Just about everything is right with Dallas Buyers Club, beginning with Matthew McConaughey's literally transformative portrayal. McConaughey's performance isn't just about the weight loss. It's about gaining compassion, even wisdom, and it's awesome." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "Dallas Buyers Club" [...] takes audiences back to {{the worst of the}} AIDS crisis, where the disease was a death sentence, and the public's terror and hostility were at its height." [...] Film critic Richard Roeper reviewed the film for his own website, and talked about McConaughey: [...] "Once we get past McConaughey's stunning transformation, we're transfixed by a performance that reminds us of why this guy became a movie star in the first place." [...] Ann Hornaday gave the film 4 out of 4 ratings, and then gave her remarks on McConaughey's remarkable performance for The Washington Post, [...] "McConaughey delivers the performance of his career, characterized not just by an astonishing physical transformation but by a wellspring of deep compassion and fearlessness." ...|$|E

They {{have seen a}} great deal of the war, and belong to one of the mounted {{volunteer}} corps.

You will be aware, therefore, that this very deplorable business {{was the result of}} a misapprehension, and that the nuns of Tavora might very well have avoided all this trouble had they behaved in a sensible, reasonable manner. If instead of shutting themselves up in the chapel and ringing the alarm bell the Mother-Abbess or one of the sisters had gone to the wicket and answered the demand of admittance from the officer commanding the detachment, he would instantly have realised his mistake and withdrawn." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{reviews for}} the Virtual Console release ranged from mixed to positive, applauding the {{gameplay}} and depth, but criticizing {{the choice to}} release the primitive NES version over the more comprehensive SNES version. Lucas Thomas of IGN awarded the game an 8.0 out of 10, praising the game's unique approach to the puzzle genre and graphics that [...] "took {{full advantage of the}} 8-bit hardware [...] full of character", but recommended [...] "saving [...] points for the SNES version, if it becomes available." [...] Aaron Thomas of GameSpot gave Wario's Woods a score of 7.0 out of 10, admiring the [...] "fun, addictive game play" [...] and [...] "surprising amount of depth", but criticizing the game's repetitive music and poor sound effects, adding that he also prefers the [...] "ideal" [...] SNES version. Nintendo Life scored the game 6 out of 10, stating that while the game is fun, [...] "enjoyment for most <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> short-lived." ...|$|E

"When the {{evidence}} shows that a lacuna in professional practice exists by which risks of grave danger are knowingly taken, then, however small the risk, the court must anxiously examine that lacuna—particularly if the risk can be easily and inexpensively avoided. If the court finds, on {{an analysis of the}} reasons given for not taking those precautions that, in the light of current professional knowledge, there is no proper basis for the lacuna, and that it is definitely not reasonable that those risks should have been taken, its function is to state that fact and where necessary to state that it constitutes negligence.

They must know that, however large our stock of provisions, they will not last forever; and indeed they will have learned, from the men who bore them in, something {{of the amount of}} stock which we have. It will last, you say, for two months; which would be little enough, were it not that we are expecting the ship you spoke of. If that comes shortly we shall, with the additional force which it is bringing; and the crew, who <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> aid; <b>be</b> able to attack them in the open.

All I would ask of you is sometimes, when far-away, to think of me; to think of me as perhaps, the presumptuous young fellow who did his best to make a long and rather trying journey agreeable to you.

Nobody but yourself takes the slightest objection to his absence. The other side appear to regard it as {{a good opportunity to}} score. Five minutes later he resumes the game. His friend comes with him, also the dog of his friend. The dog is welcomed with enthusiasm; all balls are returned to the dog. Until the dog is tired you do not get a look in. But all this <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> soon <b>be</b> changed. There are some excellent French and Belgian players; from them their compatriots will gradually learn higher ideals. The Frenchman is young in the game. As the right conception of the game grows upon him, he will also learn to keep the balls lower.|$|R
