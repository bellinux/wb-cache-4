5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses the <b>whole</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> a universe— {{it is not}} just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E
5|$|I thus learnt {{my first}} great {{lesson in the}} inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the {{repeated}} observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest. The <b>whole</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a spatial}} dynamic {{analysis}} {{model for the}} train-bridge system under random excitations was established. The random excitations were analyzed and generated by the time series autoregressive model from the experimentally measured wheel accelerations. The <b>whole</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> the train running on the bridges were simulated on computer. The responses of bridges were calculated and statistically studied. Based on the calculation results, the reinforcement schemes for steel girders were designed {{and some of them}} were applied to real bridges. The field-tests were carried out before and after the bridge reinforcement. The measured data from the tests proved the effectiveness of the reinforcement schemes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a contribution to}} qualitative reasoning for continuous process supervision. Tools for formalizing empirical knowledge of continuous processes and a naive reasoning naturally integrating perception are proposed. A new paradigm emerges: maintenance of a single instantaneous and possibly partial understanding of a physical system during its evolution. This understanding in closed loop includes prediction and truth maintenance <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> evolution at the data sampling rate. This technique relies on both deep and empirical knowledge, using mainly intuitive notions like order of magnitude of non-negligible quantity, gain, delay and duration. Our approach is compared to existing work in qualitative physics basically focused on qualitative calculus of classical physics formalization. ...|$|R

5|$|France competes {{annually}} in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations: England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. France first contested the tournament in 1910 when the Home Nations became the Five Nations. France were expelled from the tournament due to rumours of professionalism in the then-amateur sport in 1932, but rejoined in 1947. They first won the competition in 1954, sharing the championship with both England and Wales. France shared with Wales again the following season, and won it outright {{for the first time}} in 1959. France's longest wait for a championship spanned 37 tournaments (1910–1954). The Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy is also contested between France and Italy during the Six Nations. Over the <b>whole</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the Tournament, they are the third most-winning nation, ten wins behind England. However, it should be taken into account that France have been present in 33 fewer tournaments than the Home Nations. France has won almost exactly the same proportion of Six Nations Tournaments in which it has competed as England, and is the most successful nation in the post-World War II era (1945–present).|$|E
5|$|Indeed, a {{thorough}} reading of historical newspaper articles and historical government reports {{reveals that the}} <b>whole</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> wild Murray cod between the mid–1800s and the mid–1900s was one of citizen agitation, government inaction, and ongoing stock decline. For decade after decade, riverside residents, commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, local fisheries inspectors, fish retailers, and others agitated in newspapers and other fora about the evidently, continuously declining Murray cod stocks, to be met in turn either with government denials, or conversely, with various ineffective inquiries into Murray cod stocks and fisheries, and various ineffective control measures. For decade after decade, debate about excessive fishing pressure, number of fishermen, number of nets, net mesh size, bag limits, minimum size limits and take of small cod, closed seasons and the taking of spawning cod full of eggs during spring, and other sundry issues, raged on and on without proper resolution, with fishing regulations either not amended, or amended and largely unenforced and completely ignored, and with heavy commercial, recreational and illegal fishing pressure continuing unrelenting and unabated. The end result was a Murray cod population, initially unimaginably abundant, continually fished down and down and down without pause, until {{in the early to}} mid 20th century a number of other factors such as river regulation (listed below) emerged to drive the species even further into decline. All of these drivers of decline have left this iconic Australian fish in a perilous situation. There are now grave concerns for the long-term survival of wild Murray cod populations.|$|E

In 1194–1204, Tamar's armies crushed new Turkish invasions from the south-east and south and launched several successful campaigns into Turkish-controlled Southern Armenia. As a result, most of Southern Armenia, including the cities of Karin, Erzinjan, Khelat, Muş and Van, came under Georgian control. Although it {{was not included in}} the lands of the Georgian Crown, and was left under the nominal rule of local Turkish Emirs and Sultans, Southern Armenia became a protectorate of the Kingdom of Georgia.|$|E
25|$|Then, after a 6 years break, {{which only}} saw the {{publication}} of L'accélérateur atomique, a Spirou spoof by Lewis Trondheim {{not included in the}} official series (but which received Dupuis' approval), the series went back to a more classical storytelling mode with seasoned cartoonists Jean-David Morvan (writing) and José-Luis Munuera (art). The latter kept close to the spirit of Franquin's graphical style, while bringing its own touch of manga-inspired modernism. Morvan and Munuera's Spirou is partly remarkable in that it uses background elements and secondary characters from the <b>whole</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the title, and not just from Franquin's period.|$|E

Even more impressive, however, was the response to ″strong mental emotion″: ″The cure of asthma by violent emotion is more sudden and complete than by any other remedy whatever; indeed, I know few things more striking and curious in the <b>whole</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> therapeutics. … The cure … takes no time; it is instantaneous, the intensest paroxysm ceases on the instant.″ ″Cure″ due to release of adrenaline from the adrenals is the retrospective interpretation.|$|E

Nevertheless, Ayyoub al-Jalili and the Jalili family returned again and tried to claim ownership of Bakhdida. On 21 Nov. 1949 judge Moslih al-Den al-Salhani awarded Bakhdida to the Jalili family.

25|$|In 1921, {{after years}} of planning, Stopes and her husband Humphrey Verdon Roe opened the Mothers' Clinic in Holloway, North London. The clinic, run by {{midwives}} and supported by visiting doctors, offered mothers birth control advice and taught them {{the use of a}} cervical cap. Later in the same year, Stopes founded the Society for Constructive Birth Control and Racial Progress, a support organization for the clinic. Her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by framing it in scientific terms and gained an international reputation. The Malthusian League opened up a second clinic shortly afterward, but admitted that Stopes clinic had been the first in the British Empire, although the League emphasised that theirs was the first scientific clinic where birth control instruction was given under medical supervision (the medical officer was Norman Haire). These two clinics 'opened up a new period {{in the history of the}} movement aimed at the emancipation of women from their slavery to the reproductive function'. Although the clinic helped few patients in 1921 'the year was one of the most important in the <b>whole</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> birth control simply because of their very existence'.|$|E
