5|$|As the war progressed, the {{clientele}} of Salon Kitty decreased. In July 1942, {{the building was}} demolished during a British air attack and the brothel had to be relocated. Within the year the SD decided to abandon the project and handed the salon back to Schmidt, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> that she would keep silent or face retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Llywelyn the Great {{initially}} {{controlled the}} princedom of Gwynedd, but grew more powerful {{over the course}} of his reign, extending his influence over much of Wales during the early years of the 13th century. Llywelyn was faced by several challenges, including dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> from the kings of England, and maintaining his authority over the native Welsh.|$|E
5|$|The Sack of Shamakhi {{took place}} in 1721, when rebellious Sunni Lezgins, within the declining Safavid Empire, {{attacked}} the capital of Shirvan province, Shamakhi (in present-day Azerbaijan Republic). The initially successful counter-campaign was abandoned by the central government at a critical moment and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> then left unchecked, Shamakhi was taken by 15,000 Lezgin tribesmen, its Shia population massacred, and the city ransacked.|$|E
50|$|In early 2017, {{a wave of}} {{more than}} 100 bomb threats were made against Jewish Community Centers in the United States. Two arrests {{have been made in}} {{connection}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> and investigations are ongoing.|$|R

5|$|About 16hours {{before the}} storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, the {{government}} of Saint Lucia declared a tropical storm warning. Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands issued tropical storm watches. Combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154oil platforms and 32oil rigs. The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2million barrels of loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas reserves were also limited. The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, the castle was occupied by Captain Richard Swanley, a supporter of Parliament. In December 1648 it was briefly used to detain the King before his trial and execution. During the interregnum, it remained in use under the command of Colonel Thomas Eyre and was reinforced in 1650 to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of a Royalist invasion.|$|E
5|$|Concerns over {{possible}} violent outbreaks {{continued for}} many years. Chartism became {{prominent in the}} region in the late 1830s, again causing Bute considerable worries in 1839 and leading to him encouraging the mobilisation of military forces to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat.</b> Bute began to advocate the creation of a police force to suppress the problems in the northern valleys, for once allying himself with the local ironmasters to overcome rural opposition to the scheme. In 1841 the scheme was passed by the Glamorgan magistrates, with a chief constable and headquarters established that year.|$|E

50|$|The Malayan Emergency was {{declared}} over on 31 July 1960 {{and the first}} anti-terrorism law was enacted in the same year, known as the Internal Security Act 1960, to provide sweeping power to the Federal Government to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> of armed communists resistance.|$|R
50|$|In 163, he {{was sent}} to Britain to control uprisings in the north. He rebuilt a number of forts, most notably that at Coria (Corbridge). He withdrew troops southwards from Scotland towards the line of Hadrian's Wall to contend <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> of further rebellion.|$|R
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the Caribbean Sea was {{initially}} an important theatre of naval conflict, as ships operating {{from the various}} French, British, Spanish and Dutch colonies preyed on enemy trade. During 1809 and 1810 however, the Royal Navy launched a series of co-ordinated amphibious operations that eliminated the French and Dutch colonies and brought {{the conflict in the}} Caribbean to an end. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of attacks on British trade in the region significantly reduced, the Royal Navy correspondingly reduced their presence in the Caribbean and the remaining British ships were distributed to observe trouble spots in the region, which in 1812 included the independent nation of Haiti.|$|E
5|$|In 1001, Edward's relics (for he was {{considered}} a saint, although never canonized) were translated to a more prominent place within the nunnery at Shaftesbury. The ceremonies {{are said to have}} been led by the then-Bishop of Sherborne, Wulfsige III, accompanied by a senior cleric whom the Passio calls Elsinus, sometimes identified with Ælfsige, the abbot of the New Minster, Winchester. King Æthelred, preoccupied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of a Danish invasion, did not attend in person, but he issued a charter to the Shaftesbury nuns late in 1001 granting them lands at Bradford on Avon, which is thought to be related. A 13th-century calendar of saints gives the date of this translation as 20 June.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, Parliament {{ordered that}} {{supplies}} of ammunition and powder {{be sent to}} Sandown and the other castles of the Downs. Fresh earthworks were erected during the Interregnum between Sandown and Deal to address <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of Dutch attack. The garrison at Sandown remained substantial during the period, with a governor and 21 soldiers, but when Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 he reduced the numbers again to a captain and 18 men. In the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles' brother, King James II, the townsfolk of Deal seized Sandown Castle on behalf of William III, the Prince of Orange.|$|E

5|$|In 1698, the Company of Scotland {{attempted}} {{a project to}} secure a trading colony on the Isthmus of Panama. Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare {{is said to have}} invested in the Darien scheme. Its failure bankrupted these landowners, but not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of an English invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England.|$|E
5|$|In January 1941, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of {{invasion}} of England reduced, {{it was decided}} to send the 2nd AIF units there to the Middle East and the battalion arrived in Egypt in March 1941. Following this the battalion moved to Palestine where it undertook further training and received a draft of reinforcements which enabled it to raise a fourth company in order to bring it up to establishment. Having been transferred to the 7th Division, the battalion took up defensive positions around Mersa Matruh before taking part in the Syria-Lebanon campaign, during which it took part in several battles.|$|E
5|$|Leigh {{appeared}} with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), {{which was the}} first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E

50|$|Local campaigns emerged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> {{to various}} canals, {{including}} the Oxford and Kennet and Avon. An all-party parliamentary committee {{was set up}} with 30 sympathetic MPs becoming honorary members of IWA. A fight to save the Stroudwater Canal was lost in Parliament, although 112 MPs voted against it.|$|R
50|$|He {{learned to}} exploit the open, yet restrained, {{hostilities}} between the Byzantine Empire and the Crusader principalities of Edessa and Antioch. Most of his successes benefited from Byzantium’s pre-occupation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> of Zengi (<b>the</b> atabeg of Mosul) from Aleppo {{and the lack of}} effective Frankish rule, especially in the Principality of Antioch.|$|R
5|$|Llywelyn the Great {{initially}} {{controlled the}} princedom of Gwynedd, but grew more powerful {{over the course}} of his reign, extending his influence over much of Wales during the early years of the 13th century. Llywelyn was faced by several challenges, including dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> from the kings of England, and maintaining his authority over the native Welsh. As part of this strategy, Llywelyn built Castell y Bere, an innovative stone Welsh castle, in the 1220s. Shortly afterwards he began the first phases of Dolbadarn Castle, constructing the initial stone fortifications on the site, including two square stone towers.|$|E
5|$|North Vietnam {{continued}} {{to build up}} its combat units in South Vietnam. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of U.S. airpower removed, the North Vietnamese military moved anti-aircraft units into South Vietnam, and deployed a sophisticated air-defence network that included the long-range SA-2 surface-to-air missile system, radar-guided anti-aircraft guns and the SA-7 Grail shoulder-launched missile The strong presence of North Vietnamese anti-aircraft units, which covered much of the northern provinces of South Vietnam, forced Republic of Vietnam Air Force reconnaissance and fighter aircraft to fly at higher altitudes to avoid being hit by surface-to-air missiles. Consequently, when North Vietnam went on the offensive again in 1975, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was severely handicapped.|$|E

Fortune easily charms the crowd and hands out dollar bills to his customers. This embarrasses the unpopular Mr. Burns, who asks Homer to help him be loved by all.|$|E
