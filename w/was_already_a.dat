He was buried in Stratford on 11 August 1596. At that time in England about a third of all children died before age 10.|$|E

5|$|With weak {{steering}} currents {{provided by}} {{an area of}} high pressure to the north, the disturbance slowly moved towards the east-southeast. At 1500UTC, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the disturbance which they designated as Tropical Cyclone 16S. With high oceanic heat content, low wind shear, and good divergence aloft, significant strengthening was likely. Early the next day, Météo-France upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression as winds increased to 55km/h (35mph 10-minute winds). However, in the post-season analysis, Météo-France determined that the system had become a depression about 12hours earlier and <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> moderate tropical storm {{by the time of}} the operation upgrade. At 0600UTC, Météo-France classified the depression as a moderate tropical storm and was given the name Hondo; a name submitted to the World Meteorological Organization by Zimbabwe. It was later determined that Hondo <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> severe tropical storm by the time it was named operationally.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was present in}} the east-central Atlantic on October17. It moved northwestward at first before turning to the northeast on October19, when it <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> small, compact tropical cyclone. The storm steadily intensified as it tracked toward the Azores, and it reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October21. Maintaining its peak strength for 30hours, the storm began a steady weakening trend before crossing through the southern Azores. It turned to the southeast, weakening to tropical depression status on October24. Subsequently, the system turned {{to the south and}} quickly dissipated. This {{tropical storm}} {{was not included in the}} Monthly Weather Reviews summary of the 1950 hurricane season, and it was added to the Atlantic hurricane database in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Adolphus Woodford {{was born}} on 9 July 1821.

It seems a natural progression for Adolphus to have become {{an officer in the}} same regiment. He was gazetted as a lieutenant on 25 December 1838, but resigned on 23 April 1841. His father was, by this time, Governor-general of Gibraltar, and it was there, on 9 February 1842, that Adolphus was initiated into his father's lodge, the Lodge of Friendship No 345 (now the Royal Lodge of Friendship No 278). He took the customary three degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft and Master Mason, and is known to have attended nine meetings of the lodge in total, before returning to England in the autumn, matriculating at the University of Durham to study Theology.|$|E
