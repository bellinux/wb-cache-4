This study examined whether the impact of cellulase treatment was different on denim fabrics having torque-free ring spun yarn in the <b>warp</b> <b>direction.</b> Commercially produced torque-free ring spun cotton yarn was used for manufacturing denim fabric. One specimen of denim fabric had torque-free ring spun yarn in the <b>warp</b> <b>direction</b> and conventional ring spun yarn in the weft direction while the other had normal conventional ring spun yarn in both warp and weft directions. Both warp yarns of the fabrics were dyed with the same indigo dyeing process. The denim fabric samples were treated with neutral cellulase under the same conditions, and weight change and color properties, such as reflectance, K/S value, CIE Lab values, and color fastness ratings, were measured. Experimental {{results showed that the}} weight loss percentages of the denim fabric samples after cellulase treatment were very similar. The specimen with torque-free ring spun yarn in the <b>warp</b> <b>direction</b> produced a lower reflectance value and higher color yield compared with the specimen with conventional ring spun yarn in both warp and weft directions.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} second part of the results from the round robin test program {{proposed}} by the Society of Interfacial Materials Science (SIMS) to characterise the interlaminar fracture behaviour of E-glass woven fabric reinforced vinylester composites. Special emphasis was placed on the study of loading direction (i. e. weft and warp directions) effect on interlaminar shear strength and fracture toughness. Ten laboratories worldwide participated in this test (Table 1). Each laboratory was supplied with composite laminates and conducted the tests according to its own procedure. The results showed that although there were large variations in absolute magnitude between laboratories, a general trend was established with higher interlaminar fracture resistance in the weft direction than in the <b>warp</b> <b>direction</b> for a given silane agent. The larger number of strands running in the <b>warp</b> <b>direction</b> with rougher, more undulating areas perpendicular to the direction of crack propagation was mainly responsible for this result.

40|$|A brane {{universe}} {{derived from}} the Randall-Sundrum models is considered in which an additional Misner-like periodicity is introduced in the extra direction. This model solves the ambiguity {{in the choice of}} the brane world by identifying the branes with opposite tensions, {{in such a way that}} if one enters the brane with positive tension, one finds oneself emerging from the brane with negative tension, without having experienced any tension. We show that the cosmological evolution resulting from this model matches that of the standard Friedmann scenario, at least in the radiation dominated era, and that there exist closed timelike curves only in the bulk, but not in the branes which are chronologically protected from causality violations by quantum-mechanically stable chronology horizons. 1 In his public lecture Space and time warps Stephen Hawking has recently pointed out [1] that string theory might now be offering a new room for possible violation of the chronology protection conjecture [2], coming out from some special mixing between our four flat directions of space and time and the extra highly curved or <b>warped</b> <b>direction...</b>|$|R

To highlight the biocomposites as a perfect replacement, the plain woven jute fabric (WJF) reinforced poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) composites were prepared by the hot press molding method. The influence of woven structure and direction on the mechanical properties i. e. tensile, flexural and impact properties was investigated.

The original test methods capable to imitate similar to the real clothing wearing conditions, to evaluate the influence of external friction, of deformation method and of the position of seam allowances in respect to stitching line on the yarn slippage parameters were designed. Applying the new method based on the yarn pulling out from woven fabric with sewn seam, the analysis of the friction that occurs between warps and wefts during their sliding was done.

40|$|The {{deformation}} {{and failure}} micromechanisms of a hybrid 3 D woven composite were studied in tension. Plain and open-hole composite coupons {{were tested in}} tension until failure in the fill and <b>warp</b> <b>directions,</b> as well as fiber tows extracted from the dry fabric and impregnated with the matrix. The macroscopic evolution of damage in the composite coupons was assessed by means of periodic unloading–reloading (to obtain the elastic modulus and the residual strain), whereas the microscopic mechanism were established by means of X-ray computed microtomography. To this end, specimens were periodically removed from the mechanical testing machine and infiltrated with ZnI-containing liquid to assess the main damage modes {{as a function of}} the applied strain. The experimental observations and the predictions of an isostrain model were used to understand the key factors controlling the elastic modulus, strength and notch sensitivity of hybrid 3 D woven composites in tension. It was found that the full contribution of the glass fibers to the composite strength was not employed, due to the premature fracture of the carbon fibers, but their presence increased the fracture strain and the energy dissipated during fracture.

40|$|The tensile {{performance}} of coated woven fabrics under multiaxial loads is {{examined in the}} present study. Two groups of experiments were conducted to investigate the influences of {{the configuration of the}} fabric specimen and the loading speed on the multiaxial tensile properties of the fabrics. The configuration of the specimen for the multiaxial tensile tests is identified as gear-shape with large arm widths. A loading speed of lower than 20 mm/min is suggested to obtain the tensile properties of the coated woven fabrics under multiaxial loads. The tensile performances of coated woven fabrics under uni-, bi-, and multiaxial loads were compared. We found that the tensile performances under bi- and multiaxial loads are much better than those under uniaxial loads. Therefore, for the application of the coated woven fabrics in lightweight structures, biaxial or multiaxial loading conditions will be necessary.
