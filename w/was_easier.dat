5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as it <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> to shape, but much of {{it had to be}} dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E
5|$|Josquin {{probably}} {{remained in}} the service of Louis XII until 1503, when Duke Ercole I of Ferrara hired him for the chapel there. One of the rare mentions of Josquin's personality survives from this time. Prior to hiring Josquin, one of Duke Ercole's assistants recommended that he hire Heinrich Isaac instead, since Isaac <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> to get along with, more companionable, was more willing to compose on demand, and would cost significantly less (120 ducats vs. 200). Ercole, however, chose Josquin.|$|E

5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing {{of the guns}} {{under the command of}} the director positioned on the foremast. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy as it <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually.|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire-control under the gunnery officer who now fired the guns. To align their {{guns on the}} target, the turret crewmen had to follow pointers whose position was transmitted from the director. This greatly increased accuracy as it <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> for the director to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the shell spread caused by the ship's roll as the turrets fired individually.|$|E

5|$|Because of his father's background, Thakkar's {{early years}} in India were spent around actors. During these initial years, Thakkar worked with his father for some time in Mumbai, {{contributing}} to a 1971 Films Division of India documentary, and playing parts in television and radio shows. Thakkar also worked as a voice-over artist for television advertisements. At the same time, Thakkar's interest in mathematics and science remained predominant. Later on, {{he moved to the}} United States as he believed it <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> to make visual effects movies in Hollywood. Currently, Thakkar stays with his wife and family in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|By the 21st century, Highway 82 {{had grown}} to four lanes. It <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> for traffic to get to Aspen but did not resolve the {{congestion}} that developed when it got there. Since the 1970s various plans to alleviate the congestion had been put forth, some involving ballot initiatives decided by the voters of the city and/or county. In 1998 CDOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), after considering all the proposals and taking public input, released a Record of Decision. The preferred alternative combined highway and intersection improvements, mass transit and incremental transportation management.|$|E

5|$|Co-writer Theroux {{revealed}} that the initial script concept was to have actors go to a mock boot camp and return with posttraumatic stress disorder. The final script was developed to satirize Vietnam War films such as Apocalypse Now, Rambo, Missing in Action, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, and The Deer Hunter. Theroux pointed out that since viewers had an increased awareness of {{the inner workings of}} Hollywood due to celebrity websites and Hollywood news sources, the script <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> to write. Dialogue for unscripted portions of the storyboard was developed on set by the actors or was improvised.|$|E

5|$|Satchel <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> to catch. He {{could throw}} it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E

5|$|Sega AM2's {{first attempt}} in the genre was the 1993 arcade game Burning Rival, but gained renown {{with the release}} of Virtua Fighter for the same {{platform}} the same year. It was the first fighting game with 3D polygon graphics and a viewpoint that zoomed and rotated with the action. Despite the graphics, players were confined to back and forth motion as seen in other fighting games. With only three buttons, it <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> to learn than Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, having six and five buttons respectively. By the time the game was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan, the game and system were selling at almost a one-to-one ratio.|$|E
5|$|Siber's brigade {{moved from}} Raleigh Court House to Fayette Court House, which <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> to defend. His brigade was {{attacked}} (and briefly surrounded) by Loring on September 10, prompting a retreat toward Ohio with continuous skirmishing from Gauley Bridge to Charleston. The {{portion of the}} 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry that was not pursuing Jenkins' cavalry was involved in fighting in the region between Charleston and Fayetteville/Fayette Court House. Siber was assisted in his brigade's escape from Fayetteville by a 25-man detachment from the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry. On September 12, Lieutenant George K. Weir from the regiment's CompanyI was killed near Fayetteville.|$|E
5|$|The Hound Pits pub, {{which acts}} {{as a base for}} the player, was {{initially}} a larger structure. Filling out the interior of the pub required too many stairs and rooms, and the large amount of climbing made navigation confusing. The team found retaining the large exterior they wanted while creating and disguising a smaller interior that <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> to traverse challenging. The pub's exterior was shrunk to resemble an Edwardian building, but the interior remained labyrinthine so Colantonio required that a chain be placed outside Corvo's bedroom, allowing him to reach the roof quickly. In frustration, the designers decided to simply close off the third floor entirely. The art team continued to receive requests throughout development, requiring them to extend pre-production {{until the end of the}} development cycle. Each design was hand drawn.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} Smart's eclipse may be traced {{in part to}} a {{prejudice}} of the age, one which was founded in reason but developed in fear. There was one inescapable fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart's work—he had been confined for madness. It <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it. What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so irrationally? To some degree, it was the fear of 'enthusiasm'.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Western Pennsylvania was 17,000 in 1790. Among the {{farmers in the}} region, the whiskey excise was immediately controversial, with many people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners. Whiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small stills. Farmers living west of the Appalachian Mountains distilled their excess grain into whiskey, which <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A whiskey tax would make western farmers less competitive with eastern grain producers. Additionally, cash was always in short supply on the frontier, so whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. For poorer people who were paid in whiskey, the excise was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not pay.|$|E
5|$|As it <b>was</b> <b>easier</b> {{to raise}} money for medical purposes, {{particularly}} cancer treatment, than for nuclear physics, Lawrence encouraged the use of the cyclotron for medical research. Working with his brother John and Israel Lyon Chaikoff from the University of California's Physiology Department, Lawrence supported research into the use of radioactive isotopes for therapeutic purposes. Phosphorus-32 was easily produced in the cyclotron, and John used it to cure a woman afflicted with polycythemia vera, a blood disease. John used phosphorus-32 created in the 37-inch cyclotron in 1938 in tests on mice with leukemia. He found that the radioactive phosphorus concentrated in the fast-growing cancer cells. This then led to clinical trials on human patients. A 1948 evaluation of the therapy showed that remissions occurred under certain circumstances. Lawrence also had hoped for the medical use of neutrons. The first cancer patient received neutron therapy from the 60-inch cyclotron on November 20. Chaikoff conducted trials on the use of radioactive isotopes as radioactive tracers to explore the mechanism of biochemical reactions.|$|E
