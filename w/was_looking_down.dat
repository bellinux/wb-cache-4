25|$|On February 22, 2011, in a {{game against}} the Carolina Hurricanes, Staal was checked by his brother, Eric. Marc <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>down,</b> {{fighting}} for the puck with another Hurricanes player, when Eric came and threw a hard shoulder check, and Marc was slow to get up. It was a legal check, and Marc played {{for the rest of the}} season, setting career highs with 22 assists and 29 points. However, it was revealed before the Rangers' 2011 training camp began that Staal was suffering from post-concussion symptoms. He did not play until January 2, 2012, in the 2012 NHL Winter Classic against the Philadelphia Flyers. He only played 46 games in 2011–12, struggling to get his timing back from the injury as he posted a career worst −7 and only five points (two goals and three assists). He got better as the season went on, however, and helped the Rangers reach the Eastern Conference Finals.|$|E
500|$|... "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] is a bass solo by Burton, {{accompanied}} on drums by Ulrich. A {{staple of}} Burton's live performances since {{his high school}} days in the band Agents of Misfortune, the instrumental track featured Burton's distinctive [...] "lead-bass" [...] style of playing, incorporating heavy distortion, use of wah-wah pedal and tapping. Bubacz introduces the track as [...] "Bass solo, take one", informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take. [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig. Hetfield stated: [...] "We heard this wild solo going on and thought, 'I don't see any guitar player up there.' We were both counting the strings and I finally turned to Lars and said, 'Dude, that's a bass!' Cliff was up there on stage with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his huge mop of red hair. He didn't care whether people were there. He <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> at his bass, playing." [...] "Whiplash" [...] was the album's first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute. Hetfield and Burton performed with palm muted technique and precise metronomic control. The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging. Rock journalist Mick Wall wrote that [...] "Whiplash" [...] signified the birth of thrash metal, stating: [...] "If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world, 'Whiplash' is indisputably it." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Edvard remembered it, Christian's {{positive}} {{behavior toward}} his children was overshadowed by his morbid pietism. Munch wrote, [...] "My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to {{the point of}} psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by my side since the day I was born." [...] Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>down</b> from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior. The oppressive religious milieu, Edvard's poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; the boy felt that death was constantly advancing on him. One of Munch's younger sisters, Laura, was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died {{a few months after}} the wedding. Munch would later write, [...] "I inherited two of mankind's most frightful enemies—the heritage of consumption and insanity." ...|$|E
