Many of Zelda's friends and {{members of her family}} were <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship, as they did not approve of Scott's {{excessive}} drinking, and Zelda's Episcopalian family did not like {{the fact that he was}} a Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Though {{initially}} <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FROLINAT, Gaddafi {{had come}} to see by 1970 the organization as useful to his needs. With the support of Soviet bloc nations, particularly East Germany, he trained and armed the insurgents, and provided them with weapons and funding. On 27 August 1971 Chad accused Egypt and Libya of backing a coup against then-president François Tombalbaye by recently amnestied Chadians.|$|E

5|$|With {{the draft}} screenplay, Doran pitched {{the idea to}} various studios in order to finance the film, but found that many were <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{beginner}} Thompson as the screenwriter. She was considered a risk, as her experience was as an actress who had never written a film script. Columbia Pictures executive Amy Pascal supported Thompson's work, and agreed to sign as the producer and distributor.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenger}} to Planica {{arrived in}} 1949 {{with the construction}} of Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze ("Heini Klopfer ski flying hill") in Oberstdorf, West Germany. Designed by former ski jumper turned architect Heini Klopfer, as well as then-active ski jumpers Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler, the hill had a K-point of 120m to match that of Bloudkova velikanka. The FIS, still <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rising popularity of ski flying and wanting to keep it in check, refused to sanction the construction of the hill, having previously denounced the 1947 and 1948 events in Planica.|$|E
5|$|In June 1865, {{two months}} after Robert E. Lee's {{surrender}} at Appomattox, General Sherman received his first postwar command, originally called the Military Division of the Mississippi, later the Military Division of the Missouri, which came to comprise the territory between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Sherman's efforts in that position were focused on protecting the main wagon roads, such as the Oregon, Bozeman and Santa Fe Trails. Tasked with guarding a vast territory with a limited force, Sherman was <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multitude of requests by territories and settlements for protection.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{original}} {{score was}} composed by Alexandre Desplat. In {{a film about}} a man struggling to articulate himself, Desplat was <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> overshadowing <b>the</b> dramaturgy: [...] "This is a film about <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voice. Music {{has to deal with}} that. Music has to deal with silence. Music has to deal with time." ...|$|R
50|$|Dawson withdrew, and Wellington {{found him}} {{a seat in}} the English {{treasury}} borough <b>of</b> Harwich. <b>The</b> Beresfords had agonised over who they might choose as a candidate, seeking someone popular but <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> increasing <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> a potential rival. Now with Dawson going and Londonderry accepting one seat, they had a free hand.|$|R
50|$|Because of that, {{we will be}} <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> populism: <b>the</b> ideas <b>of</b> Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès {{in favor}} of {{national}} sovereignty and representative democracy prevailed over popular sovereignty. However, Napoleon knew all too well how to take a direct appeal to the people, while domesticating them, and the long period that followed discredited the process.|$|R
5|$|To {{enter the}} whole wheat bread market, the bakery {{imported}} its own wheat-cleaning machine from Hungary; the machine {{actually had to}} be smuggled out since Hungary did not have diplomatic relations with Israel at the time. However, health-food consumers were <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first whole-wheat loaves because they were white, not brown. Working with the Health Food Association, Angel's {{came up with the}} solution of adding all-natural molasses to the bread to give it a brown color.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{potential}} dangers (particularly {{the possibility}} of a prolific bacteria with a viral cancer-causing gene), the scientific community as well as a wide range of scientific outsiders reacted to these developments with both enthusiasm and fearful restraint. Prominent molecular biologists led by Berg suggested a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA research until the dangers could be assessed and policies could be created. This moratorium was largely respected, until the participants in the 1975 Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA created policy recommendations and concluded that the technology could be used safely.|$|E
5|$|While {{the flag}} {{agitation}} got its impetus from Gandhi's writings and discourses, the movement received political acceptance following the Nagpur incident. News reports, editorials and letters to editors published in various journals and newspapers {{of the time}} attest to the subsequent development of a bond between the flag and the nation. Soon, the concept of preserving the honour of the national flag became an integral component of the independence struggle. While Muslims were still <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swaraj flag, it gained acceptance among Muslim leaders of the Congress and the Khilafat Movement as the national flag.|$|E

50|$|Backward throw - This is {{when the}} {{competitor}} throws the welly over their head, whilst facing away from their target. Whilst this enables a large back swing, {{it also means that}} the target is out <b>of</b> sight for <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> throw. The competitor must also be <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> having <b>the</b> boot land on their head when throwing in this position.|$|R
5|$|By 1790, on the {{political}} front, the Commonwealth had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed, giving false hope that the Commonwealth might have at last found an ally that would shield it while it reformed itself. The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established {{the separation of the}} three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of Repnin Sejm. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Again Poland dared to reform and improve itself without Russia's permission, and again the Empress Catherine II was angered; arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France. Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Hepburn {{ventured into}} {{television}} {{for the first}} time, starring in a production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie. She had been <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medium but {{it proved to be}} one of the main television events of the year, scoring high in the Nielsen ratings. Hepburn received an Emmy Award nomination for playing wistful Southern mother Amanda Wingfield, which opened her mind to future work on the small screen. Her next project was the television movie Love Among the Ruins (1975), a London-based Edwardian drama with her friend Laurence Olivier. It received positive reviews and high ratings, and earned Hepburn her only Emmy Award.|$|E
5|$|In the east, Selvo {{not only}} {{maintained}} good {{trade relations with}} the Byzantine Empire, but also married into their royal family to consolidate the alliance that had existed for many years between the two nations. In 1075, Selvo married Teodora Ducas, daughter of Constantine X and sister of the reigning emperor, Michael VII. Though Venetians, especially the nobles, were <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pageantry that accompanied the marriage and the royal bride, the strengthened alliance meant even greater mobility for Venetian merchants in the east. Though {{the popularity of the}} new dogaressa was not great, Selvo was the hero of the merchant class that had had even greater political sway since the depositions of the Orseoli.|$|E
50|$|As the baby's birth approaches, nerves {{among the}} parents and {{grandparents}} become frayed. <b>The</b> eventual birth <b>of</b> a baby boy delights everyone, except Stanley, a distant and <b>wary</b> observer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> as-yet-unnamed baby, who starts to cry whenever Stanley comes near him.|$|R
50|$|During the Early Modern era, European monarchs {{would often}} default on their loans or {{arbitrarily}} refuse {{to pay them}} back. This generally made financiers <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> lending to <b>the</b> king and <b>the</b> finances <b>of</b> countries that were often at war remained extremely volatile.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} the Nazis {{commenced}} their programme <b>of</b> killing invalids, <b>the</b> Catholic Church in Germany had been subject to prolonged persecution from the State, and had suffered confiscation of property, arrest of clergy, and closure <b>of</b> lay organisations. <b>The</b> Church hierarchy was therefore <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> challenging <b>the</b> regime, for fear of further consequences for the Church. However, on certain matters of doctrine they remained unwilling to compromise.|$|R
5|$|Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man, {{believing that}} he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion. Mulder is adamant that the public should know the truth about Pinck's actions. The Smoking Man {{counters}} that public knowledge of the truth would create mass panic and {{do more harm than}} good. Mulder tries to take his case to Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck may result in a deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situations he will find himself in.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1964, the British {{aircraft}} carrier HMS Victorious {{and her two}} destroyer escorts sailed through the Sunda Strait, an international waterway claimed by Indonesia, en route to Australia. Upset by the casual warning the British had given of the ships' impending passage through the Strait (a telephone call made two days before), the lack of mention of the carrier in the warning, and <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility that the British were attempting to provoke them into a violent response, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided two days later to attempt to bar the warships from making the return journey to Singapore, scheduled for the middle of September.|$|E
5|$|Phan {{rallied to}} the cause of the boy Emperor Hàm Nghithe fourth monarch in little over a yearafter an {{abortive}} royal uprising at Huế in 1885. Thuyet and fellow regent Nguyễn Văn Tường had enthroned Hiệp Hòa after disposing of Dục Đức. However, the new emperor was <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regents' behaviour and attempted to avoid their influence, leading Thuyet to organise his execution. The teenage Kiến Phúc ascended the throne, but was poisoned by his adoptive mother Học Phione of Tự Đức's wiveswhom he caught having intercourse with Tuong. Kien Phuc was thus replaced by his 14-year-old brother Hàm Nghi. In the meantime, the French concluded that the regents were causing too much trouble and had to be disposed of.|$|E
50|$|By then, West Coast {{animal rights}} activists began clamoring for moving the conference to Los Angeles. Unsure <b>of</b> whether <b>the</b> West Coast could support a conference and <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> losing <b>the</b> {{continuing}} interest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Washington area, FARM organized two conferences in <b>the</b> summer <b>of</b> 2003, in both Washington and Los Angeles. <b>The</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter ensured that, beginning in 2004, the annual animal right rights national conference alternated between the two cities.|$|R
50|$|Fergus Barrowman {{said in an}} {{interview}} on Radio New Zealand that although he had been approached with various offers of additional funding, and people have suggested he crowdfunds the journal's operations, he is <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> adding to <b>the</b> yearly workload <b>of</b> producing <b>the</b> journal if it is forced to rely on non-CNZ funding.|$|R
50|$|A {{third and}} {{successful}} {{effort was made}} late in the session by state Senator Hillman Frazier. This measure merely established a legislative study commission, rather than an executive branch committee, and required the legislative committee to issue a report by December 31, 2006. The legislative study ran into problems, however. African Americans in Mississippi, accustomed to exclusion from museum efforts, were <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> backing <b>the</b> proposal for fear of created a white-washed version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's difficult civil rights struggle.|$|R
5|$|The {{existence}} of the Kangchu was not recognised by the British colonial government, even though they exercised a similar degree of autonomy as their counterparts in Johor. Nevertheless, the Kangchu in Singapore had easy access to forested land in Singapore compared to their counterparts in Johor, as the British colonial government adopted a laissez-faire attitude to the Kangchu and imposed very little regulation on their agricultural activities. However, the British were <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that many Kangchu in Singapore {{were members of the}} Ngee Heng Kongsi, which was illegal in Singapore and enjoyed monopoly rights over the regional opium trade. The British appointed a Chinese official among the Kangchu to oversee the social and economic affairs of the gambier and pepper plantations in Singapore and to act as the intermediary.|$|E
5|$|The nearby {{kingdom of}} Karasahr grew <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese troops {{stationed}} at Gaochang, now under Tang domination. It refused to send {{tribute to the}} Tang court and formed an alliance with the Western Turks. A Tang campaign led by commander Guoxiao Ke captured the kingdom in 644 and installed a Tang loyalist as ruler. Military assistance by the Western Turks failed to deter the Tang forces. With {{the support of the}} Western Turks, the puppet ruler was later deposed, and another military campaign, led by the Tang general Ashina She'er, a member of the Turkic Ashina royal family, arrived in 648 to re-establish Tang control.|$|E
5|$|Amid the {{euphoria}} generated by Egypt's military intervention, serious unity discussions commenced between Syria and Egypt. Towards {{the end of}} October, Anwar al-Sadat, the Egyptian speaker of parliament, visited the Syrian parliament in Damascus {{in a gesture of}} solidarity, only for the visit to end with the Syrian parliament voting unanimously to enter into a union with Egypt without delay. A Syrian delegation then headed for Cairo to persuade Nasser to accept unity with Syria, but Nasser expressed his reservations regarding unity to the delegates and Quwatli, who was in Damascus. Nasser was <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Syrian military's habitual interference in the country's political affairs and the stark difference in the countries' economies and political systems. The Syrian political and military leadership continued to press Nasser out of both sincere commitment to Arab nationalism and a realization that only unification with Egypt could prevent impending strife in the country due to increasing communist influence.|$|E
5|$|By September 1949, {{information}} from the Venona project indicated to GCHQ that Fuchs was a spy, but the British intelligence services were <b>wary</b> <b>of</b> indicating <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> their information. <b>The</b> Soviets had broken off contact with him in February. Fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by Kim Philby. In October 1949, Fuchs approached Henry Arnold, <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> security at Harwell, {{with the news that}} his father had been given a chair at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Leipzig in East Germany.|$|R

He retained the sole rights to shuttle production in France, and brought three of his sons to Paris to make them.
