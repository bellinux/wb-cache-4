5|$|A slow-rotating <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> can {{not exceed}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E

5|$|A <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> {{in a close}} {{binary system}} can {{accumulate}} material from its companion until it ignites and blows off in a thermonuclear explosion, known as a nova.

Nova Circini 1926, also known as X Circini, was observed at magnitude 6.5 on 3 September 1926, before fading and fluctuating between magnitudes 11.7 and 12.5, during 1928, and magnitude 13, in 1929. Nova Circini 1995 (BY Circini) reached an maximum apparent magnitude of 7.2 in January 1995. BW Circini is a low mass X-ray binary system, comprising a black hole of around 8 solar masses and a yellow G0III-G5III subgiant star.

We fit the DA and DB spectra with a grid of models to determine the Teff and log(g) for each object. For all objects, we provide coordinates, proper motions, SDSS photometric magnitudes, and enough information to retrieve the spectrum/image from the SDSS public database.

5|$|A <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> may {{accumulate}} sufficient {{material from}} a stellar companion {{to raise its}} core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites. The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required {{to compensate for the}} gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a closed binary star system. The larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence, and it expands to form a red giant. The two stars now share a common envelope, causing their mutual orbit to shrink. The giant star then sheds most of its envelope, losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion. At this point it becomes a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>star,</b> composed primarily of carbon and oxygen. Eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant. Matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf, causing the latter to increase in mass. Despite widespread acceptance of the basic model, the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the catastrophic event are still unclear.|$|E

25|$|Dust and {{molecules}} in {{the interstellar medium}} not only obscures photometry, but also causes absorption lines in spectroscopy. Their spectral features are generated by transitions of component electrons between different energy levels, or by rotational or vibrational spectra.

2500|$|The {{first of}} the {{classical}} tests discussed above, the gravitational redshift, is a simple consequence of the Einstein equivalence principle and was predicted by Einstein in 1907. As such, {{it is not a}} test of general relativity {{in the same way as}} the post-Newtonian tests, because any theory of gravity obeying the equivalence principle should also incorporate the gravitational redshift. Nonetheless, confirming the existence of the effect was an important substantiation of relativistic gravity, since the absence of gravitational redshift would have strongly contradicted relativity. The first observation of the gravitational redshift was the measurement of the shift in the spectral lines from the <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> Sirius B by Adams in 1925, discussed above, and follow-on measurements of other white dwarfs. [...] Because of the difficulty of the astrophysical measurement, however, experimental verification using a known terrestrial source was preferable.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, {{the light}} from a {{supernova}} in NGC 3982 (later called SN 1998aq) reached earth and was discovered by British amateur astronomer Mark Armstrong. It was discovered when it had an apparent magnitude of 14.9 and it had grown considerably brighter by two days after its initial sighting (it reached a maximum magnitude of 14.0). The explosion resulted from a binary system where a <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> was capturing mass from its companion star. When the white dwarf had gathered enough mass and was {{no longer able to}} support itself, the star detonated in a violent and extremely bright explosion.

2500|$|The Chandrasekhar [...] limit (...) is {{the maximum}} mass {{of a stable}} <b>white</b> <b>dwarf</b> <b>star.</b> [...] The limit was first {{indicated}} in papers published by Wilhelm Anderson and E. C. Stoner in 1929. It was named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the Indian astrophysicist who independently discovered and improved upon {{the accuracy of the}} calculation in 1930, at the age of 20, in India. [...] The limit was initially ignored by the community of scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of black holes, which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time. [...] White dwarfs resist gravitational collapse primarily through electron degeneracy pressure (cf. main sequence stars, which resist collapse through thermal pressure). [...] The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction. [...] Consequently, a white dwarf with a mass greater than the limit is subject to further gravitational collapse, evolving into a different type of stellar remnant, such as a neutron star or black hole. [...] Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs. Collapse is not inevitable: most white dwarfs explode rather than undergo collapse.|$|E
