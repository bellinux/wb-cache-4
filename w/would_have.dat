5|$|A crosstown line via Worth Street {{would serve}} as a branch of the IND Eighth Avenue Line's local tracks. The line <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{branched}} off at Church Street, from where it would run via Worth Street and East Broadway to Lewis Street. This two-tracks segment <b>would</b> <b>have</b> cost $15,200,000. The line would then tunnel under the East River between Lewis Street to Driggs Avenue. This section <b>would</b> <b>have</b> cost $18,500,000. The South Fourth Street junction would be completed.|$|E
5|$|A {{modified}} version of the spacecraft was proposed, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module. The spacecraft <b>would</b> <b>have</b> approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the cargo module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port. The rear-docking Gemini <b>would</b> <b>have</b> simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been controlled by its own crew, from a station {{at the back of the}} cargo module.|$|E
5|$|A third {{theme of}} the work is the stress on the {{importance}} and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They <b>would</b> <b>have</b> increased the desire of others to be buried there, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> benefited the community by the donations that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E

5|$|Although the RF-4M <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{had some}} advantages, it was {{discounted}} {{as the cost}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been greater, with consequently fewer aircraft purchased, while only those that had been modified <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been able to undertake the reconnaissance mission.

5|$|An {{extension}} {{of a proposed}} Madison Avenue Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line operating via 59th Street, with two branches. One branch <b>would</b> <b>have</b> operated along Second Avenue with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to be modified to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch connecting to the IND Concourse Line. The other branch <b>would</b> <b>have</b> continued under the East River, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area. Subway trains <b>would</b> <b>have</b> continued via the Port Washington Branch to Little Neck, and via the LIRR Main Line to Rego Park, where it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> turned via the former Rockaway Beach Branch and then <b>would</b> <b>have</b> turned onto the Lower Montauk Branch, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> continued on the branch through Jamaica, where it would continue via the Atlantic Branch until Rosedale, staying within city limits.

5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> enabled creatures to {{interact}} {{those of other}} players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been set up with a match-making system and players <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been able to do battle, like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had a persistent online world.|$|E
5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been launched by a Titan II rocket, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} mission <b>would</b> <b>have</b> seen a Gemini spacecraft {{rendezvous with}} a Pegasus satellite in low Earth orbit. The spacecraft <b>would</b> <b>have</b> either been launched directly into an orbit to rendezvous with the Pegasus, or into a lower orbit, subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that {{to raise its}} orbit. The Gemini <b>would</b> <b>have</b> flown around the Pegasus, {{and then one of}} the crew <b>would</b> <b>have</b> performed an EVA to recover a piece of one of the spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|E

5|$|Boston College (ACC: 3–3) {{could travel}} to the ACC Championship Game if they won out by beating both Wake Forest and Maryland.

Under those circumstances, Florida State <b>would</b> <b>have</b> finished with a 5–3record, tied with Maryland. Florida State would win the tiebreaker because they had defeated Maryland head-to-head. As it happened, Maryland lost to Boston College, which relegated Florida State to a second-place finish in the division. Wake Forest (ACC: 4–3) <b>would</b> <b>have</b> won the division if they won their last game against Boston College, and both Florida State and Boston College beat Maryland. In that case, Florida State and Wake Forest <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had identical conference records (ACC: 5–3), and Wake Forest <b>would</b> <b>have</b> won the tiebreaker because they defeated Florida State earlier in the season.|$|E

5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been connected to the lungs {{as part of the}} respiratory system.

5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{may also}} have used its neck to capture its prey via suction feeding. After flexing its neck to the side (which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{facilitated}} by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening the neck <b>would</b> <b>have</b> caused the cervical ribs to splay outwards due to {{the action of the}} neck muscles attached to the ribs.
