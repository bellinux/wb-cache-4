As the syndrome presents frequently as a forme fruste (incomplete, or unusual form) variant, an examination of all family members must be undertaken. As an autosomal dominant trait there is a fifty percent chance with each child that they will also be born with the syndrome. Although fully penetrant, since the syndrome has variable expressivity, one generation may have a mild expression of the syndrome, while the next may be profoundly affected.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{then joined}} the Spartan army in Rhodes, intent on destruction. Zeus, however, {{weakened}} Kratos and tricked him into abandoning his godly powers into the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus {{used to kill}} Kratos. Although he overcame all obstacles, Kratos was stunned at Zeus's betrayal and swore revenge as he died. Kratos fell into the Underworld, but was rescued by the Titan Gaia. Banished to Tartarus with the other surviving Titans after the First Great War, Gaia and her brethren seek the death of Zeus. Kratos, fueled by anger at his betrayal, agreed to aid the Titans and was instructed to find the Sisters of Fate, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> returning him to the moment of Zeus' treachery. Kratos became determined and utterly ruthless—in the pursuit of his goal he wounded a Titan, killed several Greek heroes without hesitation, and deliberately sacrificed two scholars. All three of the Sisters of Fate were killed when they opposed Kratos, who was prepared to kill Zeus in a final confrontation. Zeus was only saved when Athena intervened and sacrificed herself for him; only then does Kratos show remorse. He learned from a dying Athena that Zeus is, in fact, his father, a fact Zeus kept secret because he wished to avoid a repetition {{of what he did}} to his own father, Cronos. Kratos rejected any notion of a relationship and vowed to kill Zeus and destroy Olympus. Encouraged by Gaia, Kratos used the power of the Fates to retrieve the Titans before their defeat in the Great War, and with their assistance, stormed Mount Olympus.|$|E

On the contrary, an attitude of love toward themselves will be found in all those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> loving others.

For example, in United States Military Hospitals, Air Force Aerospace Medical Technicians and Navy Hospital Corpsmen perform tasks that fall under the scope of practice of both doctors (i.e. sutures, staples and incision and drainages) and nurses (i.e. medication administration, foley catheter insertion, and obtaining intravenous access) and also perform splinting of injured extremities, nasogastric tube insertion, intubation, wound cauterizing, eye irrigation, and much more. Often, some civilian education and/or certification will be required such as an EMT certification, in case of the need to provide care outside the base where the member is stationed. The presence of highly trained enlisted personnel in an Emergency Departments drastically reduces the workload on nurses and doctors.|$|E
500|$|The book {{sets forth}} several {{original}} theories, {{which can be}} applied to the practices of filmmaking, the arts, and beyond. Of these the theory of literature as [...] "humanics" [...] and the [...] "seed theory" [...] are the most important ones. Humanics centers on the question of a good and worthy life. In art, it emphasizes truly independent individuals <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> transforming society. The seed theory has become essential to North Korean film theory. It seeks to direct all artistic creation through a single ideological foundation, or [...] "seed". In an individual work, the seed is the synthesis of its subject matter and idea and the basis of its propaganda message. These ideas complement the themes of nationalistic form and socialist content of films. Many ideas presented in the book are justifications for the creation of propaganda supporting the Workers' Party of Korea's policies.|$|E

500|$|The {{context of}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{and the fact}} that it occurs before Ariel meets and falls in love with Eric is often used to defend Ariel against critics who accuse her of sacrificing her talents for a man. Boing Boings Caroline Siede {{explained}} that Ariel [...] "just happens to end up with a prince in the process of achieving her larger dream" [...] to become human. Similarly, Sophie Katz of The Odyssey Online wrote that the song proves that Ariel [...] "doesn’t give up her voice only for a guy. She already wanted to be 'part of that world.' The prince was a bonus." [...] Writing for Yahoo! Movies, Gwynne Watkins penned [...] "There’s little doubt that Ariel’s crush on Prince Eric strengthens her resolve to be part of the human world.

However, Times Laura Stampler joked that Ariel will find the human world disappointing [...] "considering my dad definitely still reprimanded me (even though I had legs)." [...] In the reprise, the lyrics [...] "Part of that world" [...] are replaced with [...] "part of your world" [...] to distinguish that the character is now referring to her feelings for Eric, whom Ariel had not yet met when she sang the original song.|$|E

[...] Diagonal sequence walks and runs (aka trots) are most frequently used by sprawling tetrapods such as salamanders and lizards, due to the lateral oscillations of their bodies during movement. Bipeds are a unique case, and most bipeds will display only three gaits - walking, running, and hopping - during natural locomotion.

2500|$|Goodall is {{best known}} for her study of {{chimpanzee}} social and family life. She began studying the Kasakela chimpanzee community in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania, in 1960. Without collegiate training directing her research, Goodall observed things that strict scientific doctrines may have overlooked. Instead of numbering the chimpanzees she observed, she gave them names such as Fifi and David Greybeard, and observed them to have unique and individual personalities, an unconventional idea at the time. She found that, [...] "it isn't only human beings who have personality, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> rational thought [...] emotions like joy and sorrow." [...] She also observed behaviours such as hugs, kisses, pats on the back, and even tickling, what we consider [...] "human" [...] actions. Goodall insists that these gestures are evidence of [...] "the close, supportive, affectionate bonds that develop between family members and other individuals within a community, which can persist throughout a life span of more than 50 years." [...] These findings suggest that similarities between humans and chimpanzees exist in more than genes alone, but can be seen in emotion, intelligence, and family and social relationships.|$|E
