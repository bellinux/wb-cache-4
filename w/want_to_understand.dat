5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} classification is {{a simplified}} version {{based on current}} understanding suitable for non-specialists who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how living genera are related to each other. The classification ignores differences in levels and thus cannot be used to estimate the respective distances between taxa. It also ignores taxa that became extinct in pre-historic times. Finally, English names are preferred whenever they exist. This makes it especially suited for non-specialists who wish to gain an easy overview. For the full picture, the non-simplified versions above should be consulted.|$|E

500|$|The {{excessive}} {{volume of}} traffic on Deerfoot Trail is a contributing factor to the 10,000 collisions recorded between 2002 and 2007, including 24 fatalities. [...] Constable Jeff Klatt of the Calgary Police Service stated {{that there is a}} [...] "consensus among police officers that it’s dangerous to do traffic stops" [...] on Deerfoot Trail. [...] A 1993 incident in which a stolen vehicle struck and killed a police officer on Deerfoot was the catalyst for the Calgary Police Service's acquisition of a helicopter. [...] 2013 statistics confirmed that Deerfoot Trail had more crashes and traffic jams than any other road in Calgary. [...] Deerfoot has many entrances and exits in close proximity which exacerbates problems, but some have attributed a portion of the congestion to driver error. Constable Jim Lebedeff of the Calgary Police Service stated, [...] "a lot of people don’t understand, or don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> how to merge properly.” [...] 30% of respondents to a 2016 poll stated that the main reason they avoid Deerfoot Trail is because they do not feel safe on the freeway.|$|E

25|$|Richardson et al. {{provide the}} example of {{behavioral}} therapy and psychodynamic therapy. If a therapist <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how the world affects his clients, he might integrate behavioral therapy into his practice. But, once he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the inner dynamics of the psyche, {{he would have to}} integrate psychodynamic therapy in with behavioral therapy. The problem is that psychodynamic therapy says human suffering is caused by the conflicts and turmoil within the inner psyche while behavioral therapy says that human suffering is caused by external stimuli, reinforcement, and other forms of conditioning. These two theories are in direct contradiction to each other.|$|R

2500|$|In 2005, Survival {{published}} the book There You Go! (Oren Ginzburg), which depicted a tribal society being harmed by development. In the book's foreword, Stephen Corry wrote: [...] "The 'development' of tribal peoples against their wishes – really to let others get {{their land and}} resources – is rooted in 19th century colonialism ('We know best') dressed up in 20th century 'political correct' euphemism. Tribal peoples are not backward: they are independent and vibrant societies which, {{like all of us}} always, are constantly adapting to a changing world. The main difference between tribal peoples and us is that we take their land and resources, and believe the dishonest, even racist, claim that it's for their own good. It's conquest, not development.

2500|$|Many times an {{individual}} has a physical sickness {{and goes to the}} physician for help. But is that the only kind of sickness there is? Kierkegaard was interested in spiritual sickness called sin and the expectancy of forgiveness which are both Christian categories. We [...] "must <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the forgiveness of sins-and then despair of understanding it." [...] Later, in The Sickness Unto Death Kierkegaard writes of the sin of despairing over one's sin and the sin of despairing of the forgiveness of sins. Robert L. Perkins from Mercer University published a group of essays about these three discourses in 2006. Kierkegaard has moved forward from fear and trembling to fear and wonder within the two years of his published works. Wonder is more positive than fear.|$|E
