The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 20 pairs of specific primers. The products formed were identified based on a melting point temperature (Tm) curve analysis. The 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens examined were enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, Aeromonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacillus cereus.

Runtime: 53 : 51 minutesVibrio cholerae, the <b>waterborne</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{responsible}} for the deadly disease cholera, is both a transient human pathogen and a ubiquitous inhabitant of marine environments. The pathogenesis and ecology of this deadly microbe {{are the focus of}} research in the Hammer lab. V. cholerae has become a model organism to understand a process of microbial cell-cell communication called quorum sensing, which allows bacterial groups to act in unison by synchronizing gene expression in response to population density. V. cholerae, and many other Vibrio species, achieves quorum sensing by producing and then responding to chemical signal molecules, called autoinducers, which control the production of multiple regulatory small RNAs. In V. cholerae, these non-coding sRNAs are predicted to base-pair with, and alter the translation of, several mRNAs encoding protein regulators that alter the expression of > 100 genes. Many of the quorum-sensing regulated genes (such as the cholera toxin and attachment factors) are critical for host colonization, while others (such as genes involved in horizontal gene transfer) are important in marine ecosystems. We are currently using genetic, biochemical, and computational methods to define the mechanism of sRNA control and the role of V. cholerae quorum sensing in clinical and environmental settings...|$|R

The use of iodine as a disinfectant for space-vehicle water is described, and references are made to studies of iodine sensitivity and the relationship between growth rate and iodine sensitivity. Growth following iodination is discussed, and bacterial responses to nutrient restriction are examined for both P aeruginosa and Legionella pneumophila. The low level of organic nutrients in spacecraft water allows the selection for bacteria that are less sensitive to halogens. The formation of biofilms within the water-treatment system enhances bacterial resistance to iodine, {{and in the case of}} high-quality water it is shown that sublethal doses of iodine can stimulate bacterial growth.

40|$|The <b>waterborne</b> <b>bacterium</b> Vibrio cholerae, {{responsible}} for epidemics of cholera diarrhea, associates {{with the human}} gut and with chitinous surfaces in aquatic reservoirs. Prior studies of two clinical V. cholerae isolates revealed that natural competence for genetic transformation, a horizontal gene transfer mechanism, requires the chitin-induced TfoX regulator, and quorum sensing transcription factor HapR made at high cell density. To further understand this regulation, I helped identify, in a genetic screen, CytR, a new positive regulator required for competence gene expression and natural transformation. Recently, this complex regulatory network in V. cholerae was shown to also control a type VI secretion system (T 6 SS) that allows contact-dependent killing of other bacteria by injecting toxic proteins. I characterized a diverse set of sequenced V. cholerae isolates, revealing that transformation was rare in all isolates, while constitutive type VI killing was common among environmental but not clinical isolates. These latter results were consistent with a “pathoadaptive” model that tight regulation is beneficial in a host, while constitutive killing is advantageous in the environment. We hypothesized that two sequenced V. cholerae isolates with distinct T 6 SSs could generate structured populations from initially well-mixed conditions by killing competitors, but not kin. Indeed, when both isolates were rendered T 6 SS-, a well-mixed population was observed via fluorescence microscopy. In contrast, mutual killing generated clonal patches with each isolate segregating into distinct groups. Structural dynamics were recapitulated with three mathematical models and a cooperation model developed supports that this assortment promotes cooperation among kin. My work in V. cholerae has helped elucidate a complex regulatory network controlling multiple important phenotypes, diversity of these phenotypes among species members, and ecological consequences of antagonistic microbial interactions in the environment.

40|$|Soil- and <b>waterborne</b> <b>bacteria</b> such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa are {{constantly}} challenging body surfaces. Since infections of healthy skin are unexpectedly rare, {{we hypothesized that}} the outermost epidermis, the stratum corneum, and sweat glands directly control the growth of P. aeruginosa by surface-provided antimicrobials. Due to its high abundance in the upper epidermis and eccrine sweat glands, filaggrin- 2 (FLG 2), a water-insoluble 248 kDa S 100 fused-type protein, might possess these innate effector functions. Indeed, recombinant FLG 2 C-terminal protein fragments display potent antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa and other Pseudomonads. Moreover, upon cultivation on stratum corneum, P. aeruginosa release FLG 2 C-terminus-containing FLG 2 fragments from insoluble material, indicating liberation of antimicrobially active FLG 2 fragments by the bacteria themselves. Analyses of the underlying antimicrobial mechanism reveal that FLG 2 C-terminal fragments do not induce pore forma-tion, as known for many other antimicrobial peptides, but membrane blebbing, suggesting an alternative mode of action.

In South Africa however, as in most developing countries, the access and supply of water safe for human consumption is challenged or complicated by pollution and more recently water availability. Point-source pollutants in surface- and groundwater are normally the most concentrated closest to the pollutant source (such {{as the end of}} a pipe or an underground injection system). Examples of point-source pollution are commercial and industrial businesses, that often discharge waste such as solvents and heavy metals from their operations. In contrast, non-point-source pollution occurs due to runoff moving across or through the ground and absorbing and accumulating pollutants which eventually end up in streams, rivers and dams. The lack of waste removal and adequate sanitation facilities results in the disposal of faecal matter and sewage into storm water drains which flow directly into the river systems contributing to the incidence of diseases such as gastroenteritis, diarrhoea and chronic lung ailments, caused by <b>waterborne</b> pathogenic <b>bacteria,</b> viruses and fungi...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect that}} climate change and {{variability}} will have on <b>waterborne</b> <b>bacteria</b> is a topic of increasing concern for coastal ecosystems, including the Chesapeake Bay. Surface water temperature trends in the Bay indicate a warming pattern of roughly 0. 3 - 0. 4 °C per decade over the past 30 years.

We find that the predicted response of V. vulnificus probability to high temperatures in the Bay differs systematically between models of differing structure. As existing publicly available datasets are inadequate to determine which model structure is most appropriate, the impact of climatic change on the probability of V. vulnificus presence in the Chesapeake Bay remains uncertain.

Water samples were put in Cookits and exposed to solar radiation for different time intervals (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min).

The m-T 7 method was used to survey operating drinking water treatment and distribution systems for the presence of injured coliforms that were undetected with currently used media. The mean recovery with m-Endo LES medium was less than 1 / 100 ml while it ranged between 6 and 68 / 100 ml with m-T 7 agar. The majority of samples giving positive results with m-T 7 medium yielded no detectable coliforms with m-Endo LES agar. Over 95 % of the coliform bacteria in these samples were injured. Laboratory experiments were also done to ascribe the virulence of injured waterborne pathogens. Enteropathogens including Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica and Shigella spp. required up to 20 times the chlorine levels to produce the same injury in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and nonpathogenic coliforms.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of {{residence}} time on the chemical and microbial quality of reclaimed water in two distribution systems located in southern Arizona. Utility A produced Class A water and utilized chlorine as a means of disinfection whereas Utility B produced Class A+ water and utilized UV radiation as a means of disinfection. Water-based pathogens were consistently detected in both distribution systems beyond the point of compliance, while microbial indicators like Escherichia coli was only detected in Utility B suggesting that treatment eliminated waterborne pathogens. Heterotrophic plate concentrations in samples from both utilities initially increased rapidly with increased distance from the point-of-compliance and were as high as 10 ⁹ CFU/ 100 ml. Regardless of the initial level of treatment, the microbial quality deteriorated with increased residence time in the distribution systems. The second study was designed to evaluate the effect of reclaimed water storage on microbial and chemical quality of two classes of reclaimed water (Class A and Class A+). In Class A water, nitrification was observed during both field scale trials resulting in concentrations greater than 10 mg/L while nitrification was not observed in Class A+. Chlorine residuals rapidly decreased within 48 hours of storage. HPC concentration were as high as 10 ⁷ - 10 ⁸ / 100 ml. In both field scale trials, there was no observed growth of HPC during storage and <b>waterborne</b> indicator <b>bacteria</b> were rarely detected, and if detected, only at low concentrations. Based on this data, deterioration of microbial water quality during storage is minimal...|$|R
