The structure analysis divided the 159 jute accessions from white and dark jute into Co and Cc group, further into Co 1, Co 2, Cc 1 and Cc 2 subgroups. Out of Cc 1 subgroup, 81 accessions were from China and the remaining 10 accessions were from India (2), Japan (5), Thailand, Vietnam (2) and Pakistan (1). Out of Cc 2 subgroup, 35 accessions were from China, and the remaining 3 accessions were from India, Pakistan and Thailand respectively. It can be inferred that the genetic background of these jute accessions was not always correlative with their geographical regions. Similar results were found in Co 1 and Co 2 subgroups. Analysis of molecular variance revealed 81 % molecular variation between groups but it was low (19 %) within subgroups, which further confirmed the genetic differentiation between the two groups.

40|$|Abstract [...] It is {{well known}} that jute plays an {{important}} role in our daily life. Jute ranks next to cotton as the most important natural fibre. Corchorus capsularis is popularly known as <b>White</b> <b>jute</b> or 'tita ' pat and Corchorus olitorius known as Tossa jute or 'mitha ' pat. Basically jute is regarded as cash crop. The role of jute in eastern part of India is important from economic point of view. India earns 1450 crores foreign exchange out of jute and its products. Approximately 40 lakh farmer families are depend it on jute cultivation. Apart from that more or less 20 lakh people are involved directly or indirectly in this trade. Jute has an important position in the packaging world for many years due to its cheapness, hardwearing properties and biodegradability. The fibre, which spins into the fine yarn, is considered to be of very good quality. The process of classification of the fibre quality on the basis of the physical properties of unsorted jute fibre is called Jute Grading. It is a process of establishment of certain standards based on the intrinsic physical properties of the fibre with a view to subdivide it into several grades or classes. Quality of jute determines its end uses. For diversification of jute products supply of superior and fine quality of fibre has to be ensured. Thus improvement of quality of jute fibre has assumed much importance in the recent times. The ICT technique aimed at enabling the user to make faster and logical decisions...|$|E
40|$|Corchorus capsularis (<b>white</b> <b>jute)</b> and C. olitorius (dark jute) {{are the two}} {{principal}} cultivated species of jute that produce natural bast fiber of commercial importance. We have identified 4509 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci from 34, 163 unigene sequences of C. capsularis to develop a non-redundant set of 2079 flanking primer pairs. Among the SSRs, trinucleotide repeats were most frequent (60 %) followed by dinucleotide repeats (37. 6 %). Annotation of the SSR-containing unigenes revealed their putative functions in various biological and molecular processes, including responses to biotic and abiotic signals. Eighteen expressed gene-derived SSR (eSSR) markers were successfully mapped to the existing single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage map of jute, providing additional anchor points. Amplification of 72 % of the 74 randomly selected primer pairs was successful in a panel of 24 jute accessions, comprising five and twelve accessions of C. capsularis and C. olitorius, respectively, and seven wild jute species. Forty-three primer pairs produced an average of 2. 7 alleles and 58. 1 % polymorphism in a panel of 24 jute accessions. The mean PIC value was 0. 34 but some markers showed PIC values higher than 0. 5, suggesting that these markers can efficiently measure genetic diversity and serve for mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in jute. A primer polymorphism survey with parents of a wide-hybridized population between a cultivated jute and its wild relative revealed their efficacy for interspecific hybrid identification. For ready accessibility of jute eSSR primers, we compiled all information in a user-friendly web database, JuteMarkerdb ([URL] {{for the first time}} in jute.

We always will strive to understand and modify the world around us and the stuff of which it is made. A new era is opened when the thorough understanding of a particular material and combining the valuable properties of the different materials are taken together to optimize the individual properties. Nowadays, engineering material at the atomic and molecular levels are creating a revolution in the fields of materials and processing. Nanoscale particles are presently considered to be high potential filler material for improving the properties of the existing material. Due to the nano technology the polymer composites are become more attractive. As surely as polymer composites changed the face of industry twenty-five years ago, polymer nanocomposites will Busher in a new era in materials development. Natural materials are one of the prominent and cost effective options for alternating the synthetic fibers reinforced composites. The availability of the natural material and ease of manufacturing attracts the researchers to try the locally available inexpensive fibers and to study their feasibility in reinforcing in to polymers. Accordingly extensive studies on preparation and properties of polymer matrix composite (PMC) replacing the synthetic fiber with natural fiber like Jute, Sisal, Pineapple, Bamboo and Kenaf were carried out. These plant fibers have many advantages over glass fiber or carbon fiber like renewable, environmental friendly, low cost, lightweight, high specific mechanical performance.

40|$|In {{the context}} of sustainabiiity it is {{suggested}} to replace the fiberglass by natural fibers of jute, hemp and flax as reinforcement for composites. The reason being the latter option is seen as more environmentally friendly and consumes less energy. This report uses calculation and data collection from literature to assess the energy consumption (direct and indirect) and C 02 emission during jute fibers production in 1 ha field. The total energy consumed {{and the amount of}} CO 2 emitted per tonne of Jute fibers production is then compared with the embodied energy and CO 2 emission per tonne of fiberglass. The direct energy consumption involves farm operations i. e. Plough, Sowing, Fertilizers and Pesticides Spray and harvesting. The two times plough operation consumes 1422. 8 MJ, sowing operation 201. 1 MJ, two times fertilizers spray 172. 9 MJ, two times pesticides spray 356. 64 MJ and harvesting operation 694. 8 MJ (Appendix 1). The energy consumed in farm operations thus comes out to be 2. 85 GJ (Appendix 1). The total amount of fuel (Diesel) consumed during farm operations is 62. 02 kg (Appe~dix 1). The C 02 emission coefficient of diesel is 0. 94. Thus the total amount of CO 2 emitted during farm operations comes out to be 58. 38 kg (Appendix 1). The indirect energy consumption involves the embodied energy of fertilizers and pesticides. Fertilizers and Pesticides are practiced twice during Jute growth. The average total amount of fertilizers practiced in 1 ha Jute field is; Nitrogen 276 - 287. 4 kg/ha, Phosphates (P 205) 76 - 102. 66 kglha and Potassium (K 20) 103. 34 - 118 kglha (Table 24). The amount of energy (MJlkg) for each constituent ingredient of fertilizers is; Nitrogen (N) 58. 86 MJlkg, Phosphates (P 20 5) 6. 25 MJ/kg and Potassium (K 20) 5. 96 MJlkg (Table 24). Thus the average total amount of embodied energy of fertilizers is 17. 37 - 18. 26 GJ (Table 24) which is the sum of Nitrogen (N) 16280. 6 - 16916. 4 MJ, Phosphates (P 20 5) 475 - 641. 62 MJ and Potassium (K 20) 615. 9 - 703. 28 MJ (Table 24). Natural gas is used as fuel during fertilizers manufacturing. The average total amount of natural gas consumed during fertilizers manufacturing is (502. 1 - 527. 8) kg (Table 24) which is the sum of natural gas consumption in Nitrogen (N) 470. 56 - 488. 92 kg, Phosphates (P 20 5) 13. 76 - 18. 58 kg and Potassium (~O) 17. 78 - 20. 3 kg (Table 24). The C 02 emission coefficient of natural gas is 0. 85 per kg of natural gas. Thus the average total amount of CO 2 emitted during fertilizers manufacturing comes out to be 426. 8 - 448. 6 kg (Table 24) which is the sum of CO 2 emission during Nitrogen (N) 400 - 415. 6 kg, Phosphates (P 20 S) 11. 7 - 15. 8 kg and Potassium (K 20) 15. 12 - 17. 26 kg (Table 24). The average amount of Pesticides practiced in 1 ha Jute field is 2. 8 - 4. 2 kg/ha (Table 27). The total energy consumed in the required amount of pesticides manufacturing is 762. 6 - 1144 MJ (Table 27). For this, the amount of fuel (Diesel) consumed is 16. 6 - 24. 9 kg (Table 27) and the amount of C 02 emitted is 15. 6 - 23. 4 kg (Table 27). Jute Plant produces 1. 14 tonneslha of Jute fiber (Table 28), (average of <b>white</b> <b>jute</b> 1. 03 tonnes/ha and Tossa Jute 1. 25 tonneS/ha). Collectively the average total amount of energy consumed (direct and indirect) during the Jute fiber production is 18. 45 - 19. 64 GJltonne and the average total amount of C 02 emitted is 445. 5 - 470 kg/tonne of Jute fiber (Table 32). On the other hand the average amount of embodied energy of fiberglass is 52. 4 - 55. 8 GJ/tonne and the average amount of CO 2 emitted during fiberglass production is 990 - 1064 kgltonne of fiberglass (Table 32). This analysis shows that for the same amount of fibers production, both the energy consumption and CO 2 emission in Jute fiber production is less by an amount of 35. 21 % and 45 % from fiberglass.
