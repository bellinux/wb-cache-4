5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> see a {{shift in}} gender {{representation}} in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
25|$|Clearly, SA has far {{reaching}} applications, as it {{is necessary}} for individuals and teams to function effectively in their environment. Thus, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> see SA going beyond the field of aviation to work being conducted {{in a wide variety of}} environments. Currently, SA is being studied in such diverse areas as air traffic control, nuclear power plant operation, vehicle operation, and anesthesiology.|$|E
500|$|His {{policies}} have been praised by some other world leaders and {{are seen as a}} model for at least one country. In response to a question about Belarus's domestic policies, President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela said [...] "We see here a model social state like the one <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> create." [...] Chairman of the Chinese Standing Committee of National People's Congress Wu Bangguo noted that Belarus has been rapidly developing under Lukashenko. Lithuanian MPs have also praised the Belarusian economy and its contribution to the Lithuanian economy; Stanislovas Gedraitis said that he was in awe of the Belarusian progress created mostly by the efforts of the national leader.|$|E

6000|$|As we rushed {{down the}} ravine {{we could see}} clearly all before us. But [...] now, just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> fear lest some mischance might [...] allow {{some of them to}} reach the glade, there was another cause of [...] surprise--of rejoicing.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> descend. In the {{distance}} below us already twinkled {{the lights in}} the solitary rancho of Lone Valley. I turned to my companion. [...] "But you have forgotten that I don't even know your name. What am I to call you?" ...|$|R

2500|$|The paranormal {{interpretation}} of OBEs {{has not been}} supported by all researchers within the study of parapsychology. Gardner Murphy (1961) wrote that OBEs are [...] "not very far from the known terrain of general psychology, which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> understand more and more without recourse to the paranormal".|$|E
2500|$|Interventions, {{like the}} TOP-100 poets that DAS GEDICHT {{identified}} {{by way of}} a commission, headed by 50 major literary critics, poets, editors, and literary scholars, have made DAS GEDICHT not only an internationally recognized publication for poetry, but also a model for successfully raising cultural awareness of poetry. With respect to the success of DAS GEDICHT, the [...] put for the question: “What is going on with the reading humanity? Why can't they suddenly be without poetry?” With DAS GEDICHT in view, the critic and member of the Group 47, , said in the Bayerischer Rundfunk: “Suddenly, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> understand how important poetry can be.” ...|$|E
5000|$|We trained hard ... but {{it seemed}} that every time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> form up into teams <b>we</b> would <b>be</b> reorganized. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new {{situation}} by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralization.|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Wald, who at {{the time}} was Reddy's husband and manager, would recall being bowled over upon first hearing the demo of [...] "Angie Baby": [...] "I heard 'Angie...' at 11 am...By noon, Helen had heard it. By three, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> put an {{arrangement}} together. Eight days later it was on the street. Her biggest hit. It had story, melody, everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{big event}} filled us {{young people with}} talk, too. We let it flow in a steady stream while we tended the flocks. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> feel pretty {{important}} now, for I was eighteen and the other youths were from one to four years olderyoung men, in fact. One day the Paladin was arrogantly criticizing the patriot generals of France and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. ("This {{is the way}} to have him! <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{hold our}} own, I think, Mum?") ...|$|E
60|$|PHILIP. Well, {{there are}} certain matters upon which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> feel that you might take us a little more into your confidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{depends on}} what you mean by miracle. Science shows us all kinds of wonders which our great grandfathers would have called miracles, but these are nothing but laws that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> understand. Give me an instance." ...|$|E
60|$|Looking {{at it now}} I can {{see that}} the days which {{followed}} Audrey's arrival at Sanstead marked the true beginning of our acquaintanceship. Before, during our engagement, <b>we</b> had <b>been</b> strangers, artificially tied together, and she had struggled against the chain. But now, for the first time, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> know each other, and were discovering that, after all, we had much in common.|$|R
50|$|When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{work out}} the songs for Sunday Mornings, my friend Dave Gibbs, {{formerly}} of Gigolo Aunts and now Low Stars, said ‘Why don’t you record ‘You Can’t Count On Me’?’ I told him I {{had no idea what}} he was talking about. He said it was one of his favorite songs of mine and sent me an mp3 of my original demo.|$|R
60|$|The term we had {{assigned}} for {{the duration}} of our stay in Washington was now at an end, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> travel; for the railroad distances we had traversed yet, in journeying among these older towns, are on that great continent looked upon as nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{run away}} from us just when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> feel the comfort of your being with us. There, he won't catch cold now;" [...] and so having thrown a rug over Dumpling's back, he {{followed}} Adela into the station.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can see nothing," [...] said Edwin, [...] "except {{that the}} guard and fireman are both looking back as {{if they wanted to}} see {{something}} on the line. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> slow, however, being not far from the station now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's the uselessness of it, {{for this}} age," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I think clergymen don't {{understand}} the harm {{it is doing}} in concentrating the attention on such a vulnerable and non-essential point. Those {{of us who are}} striving to reorganize our beliefs and make them tenable, do not bother our heads about miracles. They may be true, or may not, or some of them may be. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> see that the virgin birth does not add anything to Christ. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> see that perfection and individuality are not incompatible,--one is divine, and the other human. And isn't it by his very individuality that we are able to recognize Jesus to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed," [...] Mrs. Rintoul agreed; [...] "the night seemed endless. The {{worst time}} was the waiting till <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> move over. After that I did not so much mind, though it seemed more like a week than a night while the things were being brought in here." ...|$|R
50|$|We trained hard, but {{it seemed}} that every time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> form up into teams <b>we</b> would <b>be</b> reorganized. Presumably the plans for our {{employment}} were being changed. I was to learn later in life that, perhaps because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> so good at organizing, we tend as a nation to meet any new situation by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency and demoralization.|$|R
60|$|Our spiritual vision <b>was</b> glowing clearer. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> {{perceive}} that charity did not consist in dispensing largesse {{after making a}} fortune {{at the expense of}} one's fellow-men; that there was something still wrong in a government that permits it. It was gradually becoming plain to us, after two thousand years, that human bodies and souls rotting in tenements were more valuable than all the forests on all the hills; that government, Christian government, {{had something to do with}} these.|$|R
6000|$|... 23d. The Farm of Appletreewick.--Too tired, {{after our}} move yesterday, {{to write a}} word in my diary about our journey to this {{delightful}} place. But now that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> get settled, I can manage {{to make up for}} past omissions.|$|E
60|$|Jerome. Yes, {{our school}} is {{increasing}} so much {{we are getting}} a grant for technical instruction. Some of the Fathers are learning handicrafts. Father Aloysius is going to study industries in France; but we are all busy. We are changing with the times, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> do useful things.|$|E
6000|$|... "My seat must go, {{if this is}} to be the price," [...] said Raymond. [...] "I felt {{through all}} the speeches at that gilt-gingerbread place, that it was a {{monument}} of my truckling to expediency. We began the whole thing at the wrong end, and I fear <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> see the effects." ...|$|E
60|$|SURGE. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> just <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> talk seriously; {{and now you}} snatch at {{the chance}} of talking rot. [He rises]. Good evening. [He turns to the door].|$|R
5000|$|In recent times, {{a popular}} quotation, {{actually}} written by Charlton Ogburn in 1957, on reorganization is often spuriously {{attributed to a}} Gaius Petronius. In one version it reads:We trained hard ... but it seemed that every time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> form up into teams <b>we</b> would <b>be</b> reorganized. I was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralization.|$|R
60|$|In {{five minutes}} or less we reached the foot of it, and, breathless and perspiring though <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> search amongst the reeds and bushes growing {{at the edge of}} the lake for the canoe of which <b>we</b> had <b>been</b> told by the Kalubi. What if there were none? How could we cross that wide stretch of deep water? Presently Hans, who, {{following}} certain indications which caught his practised eye, had cast away to the left, held up his hand and whistled. We ran to him.|$|R
6000|$|It is time we {{had more}} pride. What right have we to the word [...] "civilised" [...] till we give mothers and {{children}} a proper chance? This is but the Alpha of decency, {{the first step of}} progress. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> realise that; but, even now, to make a full effort and make it at once--we have to beg for jewels.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be impatient. We are prospering; we can wait; {{there is}} no hurry. Our small dead-certain income {{increases}} all the time; and as to futures, I have not made a mistake yet--they are piling up by the thousands and tens of thousands. There is not another family in the state with such prospects as ours. Already <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> roll in eventual wealth. You know that, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it {{is because}} of my {{suspicious}} nature," [...] Peter said. [...] "There is a man staying in our hotel whom <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> see quite a great deal of. He was talking to the head porter a few minutes before you this afternoon. He supped at the same restaurant last night. He is dining now three places behind you to the right, with a young lady who has been making flagrant attempts at flirtation with me, notwithstanding my gray hairs." ...|$|E
60|$|As dinner drew {{towards a}} close it {{occurred}} to me that my vis-à-vis had studiously avoided turning once towards our neighbours. If he desired to escape recognition, however, he was unsuccessful, for just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> think of quitting our places, Lord Langerdale left his seat to speak to some acquaintances at the other end of the room, and on his way back he looked straight into my companion's face. He started slightly, hesitated, and then came slowly up to our table.|$|R
60|$|Good and I looked accordingly, and there, winding away {{towards the}} plain, was what {{appeared}} to be a wide turnpike road. We had not seen it at first because, on reaching the plain, it turned behind some broken country. We did not say anything, at least, not much; <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> lose the sense of wonder. Somehow it did not seem particularly unnatural that we should find a sort of Roman road in this strange land. We accepted the fact, that was all.|$|R
5000|$|Glenn Tillbrook {{said of the}} song, [...] "It's {{slightly}} grandiose-sounding, {{which is}} not my cup of tea really. On the whole it's not a bad version.It's a bit like Bruce Springsteen's 'Born to Run'. And yet another song about drinking." [...] Chris Difford said, [...] "'I've Returned' could have been on East Side Story. It's a lyric that reflects our early writing, so I suppose <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> repeat ourselves. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> cocooned {{in a web of}} touring and it was suffocating our skills. We didn't have any time to observe.|$|R
