It was too low down and people felt insecure, hence it got bad press." [...] Sam Dawson of Classic and Sport Car Magazine described the C5 as [...] "incredibly fun to drive", suggesting that the safety concerns [...] "could have been addressed if it wasn't {{for the fact that}} it was already doomed as a national joke." [...] He noted the disconnect between the media's expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called [...] "just a fun way of getting around". Professor Stuart Cole of the University of South Wales comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: [...] "In the days before unleaded petrol, your face would have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren't used to having to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to the car, and hopefully <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so in the future." ...|$|E

2500|$|The exact {{meaning of}} the phrase musica reservata has been debated by musicologists for decades, since the {{contemporary}} mentions of the term are ambiguous and contradictory. [...] Current consensus among music scholars is that the term refers to an innovative practice which began around {{the middle of the}} 16th century, both in composition and in performance, involving 'affect' in text-setting and possibly chromaticism; {{that it was not a}} wide movement; and that it was principally a kind of music intended for connoisseurs. Cornelius Canis is one of the composers mentioned as not writing in the style of musica reservata. [...] Shortly before Canis's departure from the imperial chapel, the Bavarian ambassador to Charles V wrote a letter to his employer, Duke Albrecht V, in which he seems to use the term in a wide sense, meaning roughly [...] "a musical style which is new": [...] "musica reservata <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> fashionable now than before, , since Canis was not able to reconcile himself to it." [...] He therefore considered Canis to be a composer in a conservative style. [...] The date of this letter, 28 April 1555, is shortly before Orlande de Lassus joined the musical establishment of Albrecht V in Munich; Lassus was then, and remains now, the most famous practitioner of musica reservata.|$|E

40|$|This chapter reviews {{research}} on political communication in referendums {{that have become}} increasingly popular in democracies worldwide. The authors define key characteristics of referendums, touch upon participation in and popular support for referendums, and highlight the differences between them and presedential or parliamentary elections for political actors, the media, and citizens. Furthermore, they discuss findings regarding media effects on issue salience, issue understanding, turnout, and voting behaviour. The authors argue that the potential for communication and campagin effects on citizens is generally larger in a referendum campaign than in other electoral contests. Finally, the authors call for more research into referendums that <b>will</b> likely <b>become</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> important in the future...|$|R

In particular, the introduced provenance framework supports the documentation of workflows in a legally binding way. The authors therefore use the concept of layered XML documents, i. e. history-tracing XML. Furthermore, the proposed provenance framework enables the executors (actors) of a particular workflow task to attest their operations and the associated results by integrating digital XML signatures...|$|R
40|$|Global {{climate change}} will affect {{many areas of}} the world in differing degrees of magnitude. High {{latitude}} regions have shown the impact of climate change the most. In 1995 and 1996, two study sites were established in Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska. Atqasuk is approximately 60 miles south of Barrow. The ongoing study uses open-top chambers to examine the response of vegetation to experimental warming. The change of numerous Arctic species has been documented. The phenology of the dominant sedge, Carex aquatilis-stans, was investigated and patterns of change have become apparent. Generally, the study has shown that Carex aquatilis-stans has grown taller, has longer leaves, and has flowered earlier over time.

I focus on the constitutional answers to immigration in France, Italy and Canada. In France, in 2010, legislation was adopted prohibiting the wearing of face-covering clothing in public. With this ban, the French intended to enhance the equal participation of citizens in society and to protect the equality of the sexes. In Italy, a heated debate took place about the display of crucifixes in (public) schools, which resulted in a restoration of the predominance of the Catholic religion.

The role of medical teams {{in the implementation of}} quarantine and isolation has been equivocal, particularly when such measures are opposed by communities who are coerced by the temporary suspension of civil liberties. In their encounters with Ebola victims, outreach teams face moral dilemmas, where the boundaries are unclear between coercion, persuasion and appeals for self-sacrifice. For those teams, we propose a set of practical recommendations aimed at respecting the autonomy of epidemic victims and easing tensions within communities. We recognize that some of these recommendations are progressively achievable, depending on the specific stage or setting of an outbreak. Yet with the increasing availability of experimental treatments and research interventions, weighing patients' autonomy against the common good <b>will</b> <b>become</b> an <b>even</b> <b>more</b> pressing ethical obligation...|$|R
