We do not see how you could. We do not ask it.|$|E
500|$|A {{couple of}} days after the Roker Park defeat, Manchester City {{completed}} the signing of centre-forward Francis Lee from Bolton Wanderers for a club record £60,000. During negotiations Mercer stated to Lee that [...] "we feel we've got the start of a good side. We are just one player short, and <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are that player." [...] Lee made his debut in a 2–0 win at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers, the start of an 11 match unbeaten run, including a 6–0 win against Leicester City.|$|E
500|$|... "Oceania" [...] was [...] "spoilt by some overenthusiastic vocal whoopings", {{according}} to David Hooper from BBC Music. The Guardians writer David Peschek {{said that when}} the singer sings in the song, [...] "choral swoops [...] like fireworks behind her". AllMusic's Heather Phares noted that the song, along with Medúllas lead single [...] "Who Is It", [...] "have an alien quality {{that is all the}} stranger considering that nearly all of their source material is human (except for the odd keyboard or two)". Dominique Leone of Pitchfork thought [...] "Oceania" [...] was hardly the most obvious choice for a promotional single release, despite its [...] "bizarre, swooping soprano lines and cyclical chord progression outlined by a chorus of Wyatt vocal samples". Jeremy D. Larson from Time magazine provided a mixed review to the song, stating that it was the best Olympic theme song, but during the Olympics performance, [...] "when she sang 'Every pearl is a lynx is a girl' <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> could hear the world collectively sigh, 'Where's Celine Dion?'". In 2005, the song was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 47th Grammy Awards but lost out to Norah Jones' [...] "Sunrise".|$|E

2500|$|The censor, the Lord Chamberlain, {{hastened to}} see the show, and demanded changes. After an {{uncertain}} start, the revue was a huge success; the song [...] "We don't want to lose you, but <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> ought to go", encouraging young men to join the army, was a particular hit for Delysia. Within weeks the other items in the triple bill were dropped, and Odds and Ends was expanded to a full evening, with only a brief curtain raiser. Within two months of the opening, Delysia was an established star, invited to take part with Muriel Foster, Charles Hawtrey, Oscar Asche and Isidore de Lara in a charity matinée attended by Queen Alexandra. It {{was the first of}} many charity appearances that Delysia made during the war. Her biographer Anne Pimlott Baker writes that Delysia entertained wounded troops, and took many French refugees and orphans into her home. In 1916, she made her film début, and took a leading role in SHE, an adaptation of the Rider Haggard story, about a woman's passion for a young traveller.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} alternative weekly Montreal Mirror on June 8, Day addressed some of the perceptions that he was homophobic. He began by denying that he had ever referred to homosexuality as a [...] "mental disorder". He acknowledged having gay staffers working on his campaign: [...] "First of all, {{as far as my}} campaign, I don't ask people if they're homosexual, lesbian or heterosexual. People who are working on my campaign are doing so because they believe in me. That doesn't mean that they necessarily agree 100 per cent with everything I believe. But in principle they're saying <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can take this Alliance to the next step and we think you'd be good for Canada. So I don't ask. Nobody has to pass a sex test to be on this campaign." [...] But the statement that made headlines in newspapers across the country was Day's acknowledgment that he would indeed consider using the Notwithstanding Clause to block a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, then a distinct possibility that was unnerving many social conservatives. After being pressed by journalist Matthew Hays on the Notwithstanding Clause question, Day replied [...] "Yes, and the reason I say that is because such a significant number of constituents would reflect concern on that and would want the discussion. The Alberta position on this is that the definition of marriage changing would allow {{for the use of the}} Notwithstanding Clause. That's because the sense of the elected officials in Alberta is that the people would be significantly motivated on that issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1920s {{and most}} of the 1930s, the Labour Party's {{official}} policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and collective security under the League of Nations. At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, [...] "We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty. We are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country. We say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country." [...] During a debate on defence in Commons a year later, Attlee said [...] "We are told (in the White Paper) that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. We do not think you can do it by national defence. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can only do it by moving forward to a new world. A world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system. I shall be told that that is quite impossible." [...] Shortly after those comments, Adolf Hitler proclaimed that German rearmament offered no threat to world peace. Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the Soviet Union, created [...] "A chance to call a halt in the armaments race...We do not think that our answer to Herr Hitler should be just rearmament. We are in an age of rearmaments, but we on this side cannot accept that position." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There I {{disagree}} with you. You must excuse me, but I do; {{and so does}} Dr. Tempest. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> {{have been a little}} too much in a hurry since he communicated to you the result of our first meeting." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It simply {{amounts to}} this,--that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{are taking a}} little too much on yourself. No doubt, it's a fault on the right side, and arises from your wishing to have the work well done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, pretty one; <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} but a hindrance or anything that is unbecoming, and would willingly run twice this risk to do you and the honest Sergeant a service. Do I not speak your mind, Eau-douce?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'To starve for six {{or seven}} years, Mr. Warden,' said Snitchey, 'would be very {{uncommon}} indeed. You might get another estate by showing yourself, the while.

6000|$|... 'When did you come, Mr. Somerset?' she gaily said, {{looking up}} surprised. 'How industrious {{you are to}} be at work so {{regularly}} every day! <b>We</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would be here to-day: Paula has gone to a vegetable show at Markton, and I am going to join her there soon.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is to say, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> cannot do so. People {{can do so}} {{many things}} that they don't think they can do; and can't do {{so many things that}} they think that they can do! When will the dean be home?" ...|$|E

"You {{have paid}} it indeed most nobly, Hassan," [...] the captain said, {{holding out his}} hand, and {{grasping}} that of the chief, when, sentence by sentence, the story was translated to him.
