5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect <b>wobbling</b> and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Fungal {{and animal}} {{mitochondrial}} genomes typically have one tRNA for each synonymous codon family. The codon-anticodon adaptation hypothesis {{predicts that the}} <b>wobble</b> nucleotide of a tRNA anticodon should evolve towards maximizing Watson-Crick base pairing with {{the most frequently used}} codon within each synonymous codon family, whereas the <b>wobble</b> versatility hypothesis argues that the nucleotide at the <b>wobble</b> site should be occupied by a nucleotide most versatile in <b>wobble</b> pairing, i. e., the tRNA <b>wobble</b> nucleotide should be G for NNY codon families, and U for NNR and NNN codon families (where Y stands for C or U, R for A or G and N for any nucleotide). Results We here integrate these two traditional hypotheses on tRNA anticodons into a unified model based on an analysis of the <b>wobble</b> costs associated with different <b>wobble</b> base pairs. This novel approach allows the relative cost of <b>wobble</b> pairing to be qualitatively evaluated. A comprehensive study of 36 fungal genomes suggests very different costs between two kinds of U:G <b>wobble</b> pairs, i. e., (1) between a G at the <b>wobble</b> site of a tRNA anticodon and a U at the third codon position (designated M U 3 :G) and (2) between a U at the <b>wobble</b> site of a tRNA anticodon and a G at the third codon position (designated M G 3 :U). Conclusion In general, M U 3 :G is much smaller than M G 3 :U, suggesting no selection against U-ending codons in NNY codon families with a <b>wobble</b> G in the tRNA anticodon but strong selection against G-ending codons in NNR codon families with a <b>wobble</b> U at the tRNA anticodon. This finding resolves several puzzling observations in fungal genomics and corroborates previous studies showing that U 3 :G <b>wobble</b> is energetically more favorable than G 3 :U <b>wobble.</b> </p...|$|R

Despite this, the score remained the same through the 30 minutes of extra time and the match went to a penalty-shoot-out. Liverpool {{were the first to}} take a penalty, but Nicol put his shot over the crossbar. Graziani stepped up to take Roma's first penalty, but Roma captain Agostino Di Bartolomei took the ball from him and took the penalty instead, scoring to give Roma the lead. Liverpool's next penalty was taken by their regular penalty taker Neal who scored to level the shoot-out. Conti took the next penalty for Roma, but like Nicol he put his shot over the crossbar. Souness and Ubaldo Righetti converted their respective penalties to make the scoreline2–2. Rush scored Liverpool's next penalty to make the score 3–2. Graziani stepped up again to take Roma's fourth penalty. While he was placing the ball on the penalty spot, Liverpool goalkeeper Grobbelaar was <b>wobbling</b> his legs in the Liverpool goal, hoping to distract Graziani. The tactic appeared to have worked as Graziani placed his penalty over the crossbar. Alan Kennedy was the next player to take a penalty and if he scored Liverpool would win the match. Kennedy scored the penalty sending Tancredi the wrong way. Liverpool won the shoot-out 4–2, thereby winning their fourth European Cup.|$|E

40|$|Background: Animal {{mitochondrial}} genomes typically encode one tRNA {{for each}} synonymous codon family, {{so that each}} tRNA anticodon essentially has to <b>wobble</b> to recognize two or four synonymous codons. Several factors have been hypothesized to determine the nucleotide at the <b>wobble</b> site of a tRNA anticodon in mitochondrial genomes, such as the codon-anticodon adaptation hypothesis, the <b>wobble</b> versatility hypothesis, the translation initiation and elongation conflict hypothesis, and the <b>wobble</b> cost hypothesis. Principal Findings: In this study, we analyzed codon usage and tRNA anticodon <b>wobble</b> sites of 29 marine bivalve mitochondrial genomes to evaluate features of the <b>wobble</b> nucleotides in tRNA anticodons. The strand-specific mutation bias favors G and T on the H strand in all the 29 marine bivalve mitochondrial genomes. A bias favoring G and T is also visible in the third codon positions of protein-coding genes and the <b>wobble</b> sites of anticodons, rejecting that codon usage bias drives the <b>wobble</b> sites of tRNA anticodons or tRNA anticodon bias drives the evolution of codon usage. Almost all codon families (98. 9 %) from marine bivalve mitogenomes support the <b>wobble</b> versatility hypothesis. There are a few interesting exceptions involving tRNA Trp with an anticodon CCA fixed in Pectinoida species, tRNA Ser with a GCU anticodon fixed in Mytiloida mitogenomes, and the uniform anticodon CAU of tRNA Met translating the AUR codon family. Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate {{that most of the}} nucleotides at the <b>wobble</b> sites of tRNA anticodon...|$|R

40|$|The first extrasolar planets {{have been}} {{detected}} by the measurement of the <b>wobble</b> of the parent star.

Thus, the observation of the <b>wobble</b> does not, by itself, constitute a proof of a planet detection. In particular, astrometric confirmation of a <b>wobble</b> does not necessarily provide a sufficient proof of the existence of a planet candidate detected by radial velocity.
