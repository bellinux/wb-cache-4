5|$|When the war ended, Holt's planned {{expansion}} to {{meet the}} military's needs was no longer needed. The company was left in a difficult situation. The types of tractors needed by the military <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from what farmers needed. Their situation was worsened as artillery tractors were brought back from Europe, depressing prices for new equipment and Holt's unsold inventory of military tractors. The company moved to focus less on agricultural machinery and more on producing road-building equipment. To keep the company afloat, they borrowed heavily.|$|E
5|$|A ruling of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 6 August 2017 {{decided that}} a disputed {{military}} facility in Han Pijesak is to be registered as property of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It {{is expected to be}} a precedent for all other similar facilities, and could thus be the final factor that will enable the activation of the MAP for Bosnia. An August 2010 poll showed that 70 percent of the country supports NATO membership, but results <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> in the two constituent entities. While 90 percent of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina supported NATO membership, only 33 percent in Republika Srpska did.|$|E

5|$|Early {{concepts}} <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> {{from the}} final film. The initial version featured a floating castle with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other. Docter's next idea introduced many of the elements that eventually {{made their way into}} the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but it was decided that this subplot was too distracting, and that people would forgive the minor inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} seasons {{featured}} sixteen fighters, in either {{one or two}} weight categories. The first two seasons, however, <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from each following season. The original format for The Ultimate Fighter saw each team compete in challenges, such as hoisting their respective coach up on their shoulders and sprinting down a beach, or a team tug-of-war. These challenges resulted in eliminations of fighters who hadn't fought, {{until late in the}} season when the challenge incentive was to select the next fight where fighters would be eliminated, having lost the fight. In the first two seasons, fighters would also leave the house for good upon losing and this often resulted in odd numbers for teams, which forced the moving of fighters to opposing teams.|$|E
5|$|From the 1830s to the interwar period (1919–1939), the Anglo-Norman {{was one of}} {{the main}} horses used by the French cavalry. Although author Alfred Gallier stated that it was a good breed for this use, many {{opposing}} scholars argued that this was not the case. Military requirements conflicted with Norman breeders, as the carriage horses preferred by the breeders <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> from the style sought by the military, which required fast horses with stamina and agility. According to military equestrian Denis Bogros, the economic weight of the Norman horse breeders was such as they negatively influenced the effectiveness of the French army until the early 20th century, producing only large, overweight trotters that became fatigued more easily than Barbs or Arabians. Bogros states that breeders of Norman horses managed to deceive the French government, through powerful lobbying groups, by selling the military rejects from the breeding programs. The Anglo-Norman was a commercial success as carriage horses, but proved worthless for the cavalry. This led to the creation of the Société du cheval de guerre (Society of the War Horse), which in 1906 severely criticized the use of the Anglo-Norman. Bogros considered the Anglo-Arabians bred near Tarbes to be much more useful for the military.|$|E

25|$|The early 1980s <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> {{from the}} rest of the decade, with some {{carryovers}} from the late 1970s. The early 1980s saw a minimalist approach to fashion, with less emphasis on accessories, and practicality considered just as much as aesthetics. Clothing colors were subdued, quiet and basic; varying shades of brown, tan, and orange were common.|$|E

In Ancient Greece, it was common practice to tie strips of rawhide round the hands for protection. In Roman times, this developed into the gladiatorial cestus, with metal added to the gloves to inflict greater damage. The brutality of the sport caused the boxing to be banned in AD 393.|$|E
