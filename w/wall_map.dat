25|$|Emery Molyneux and Petrus Plancius {{have also}} been cited as the first uranographers to {{distinguish}} Crux as a separate constellation; their representations date from 1592, the former depicting it on his celestial globe and the latter {{in one of the}} small celestial maps on his large <b>wall</b> <b>map.</b> Both authors, however, depended on unreliable sources and placed Crux in the wrong position. Crux was first shown in its correct position on the celestial globes of Petrus Plancius and Jodocus Hondius in 1598 and 1600. Its stars were first catalogued separately from Centaurus by Frederick de Houtman in 1603. Later adopters of the constellation included Jakob Bartsch in 1624 and Augustin Royer in 1679. Royer is sometimes wrongly cited as initially distinguishing Crux.|$|E

500|$|In 1554 Mercator {{published}} the long-awaited <b>wall</b> <b>map</b> of Europe, dedicating {{it to his}} friend, now Cardinal, Antoine Perrenot. He had worked at {{it for more than}} twelve years, collecting, comparing, collating and rationalising a vast amount of data and the result was a map of unprecedented detail and accuracy. It [...] "attracted more praise from scholars everywhere than any similar geographical work which has ever been brought out."

The map is remarkably accurate and it is presumed to be based on a triangulation of Flanders by Jacob van Deventer.

500|$|Mercator never {{committed}} any of {{his prison}} experiences to paper; all he would say {{was that he had}} suffered an [...] "unjust persecution". For the rest of his time in Leuven his religious thoughts were kept to himself and he turned back to his work. His brush with the Inquisition did not affect his relationship with the court and Nicholas Perrenot recommended him to the emperor as a maker of superb instruments. The outcome was an Imperial order for globes, compasses, astrolabe and astronomical rings. They were ready in 1545 and the Emperor granted the royal seal of approval to his workshop. Sadly they were soon destroyed {{in the course of the}} Emperor's military ventures and Mercator had to construct a second set, now lost. He also returned to his work on a large up-to-date and highly detailed <b>wall</b> <b>map</b> of Europe which was, he had already claimed on his 1538 world map, very well advanced. It proved to be a vast task and he, perfectionist that he was, seemed unable to cut short his ever-expanding researches and publish: as a result it was to be another ten years before the map appeared.|$|E
500|$|As the Chronologia {{was going}} to press in 1569, Mercator also {{published}} {{what was to become}} his most famous map: Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata (A new and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation). As mariners had started to explore the oceans in the Age of Discovery the problem of accurate navigation had become more pressing. Their locations could be a hundred miles out after a long voyage because a course of constant direction at sea (a rhumb line) did not correspond to a straight line on their chart. Mercator's solution was to make the scale of his chart increase with latitude in a very special way such that the rhumb lines became straight lines on his new world map. Exactly how he arrived at the required solution is not recorded in any of his own written works but modern scholars [...] suggest that he used the tables of rhumbs devised by Pedro Nunes. The large size of what was a <b>wall</b> <b>map</b> meant that it did not find favour for use on board ship but, within a hundred years of its creation, the Mercator Projection became the standard for marine charts throughout the world and continues to be so used to the present day. At a later stage this mariner's map became a general purpose map of the world although its distortion at high latitudes was abundantly evident. Usage other than for marine charts is now deprecated and more suitable projections are available.|$|E

2500|$|Matteo Ricci (1552–1610) was a Jesuit priest. Ricci {{was one of}} {{the first}} Western {{scholars}} to live in China and he became a master of Chinese script and the Classical Chinese language. In 1583, Ricci was among the first Jesuits to enter China from Macao. The first Chinese world map was named Yudi Shanhai Quantu (輿地山海全圖) and made in Zhaoqing in 1584 by Matteo Ricci with Chinese collaborators.

2500|$|Cartographers {{had long}} despaired over publishers' inapt {{use of the}} Mercator.

Although its usage ... has diminished ... it is still highly popular as a <b>wall</b> <b>map</b> apparently in part because, as a rectangular map, it fills a rectangular wall space with more map, and clearly because its familiarity breeds more popularity." [...] Because of the lack of novelty both in the projection Peters devised and in the rhetoric surrounding its promotion, the cartographic community had no reason to think Peters would succeed any more than Edwards or his predecessors had.|$|E

2500|$|Exploration of the Southern Ocean was {{inspired}} by a belief in the existence of a Terra Australis—a vast continent in the far south of the globe to [...] "balance" [...] the northern lands of Eurasia and North Africa—which had existed since the times of Ptolemy. The doubling of the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 by Bartolomeu Dias first brought explorers within touch of the Antarctic cold, and proved that there was an ocean separating Africa from any Antarctic land that might exist. Ferdinand Magellan, who passed through the Strait of Magellan in 1520, assumed that the islands of Tierra del Fuego to the south were an extension of this unknown southern land. In 1564, Abraham Ortelius published his first map, Typus Orbis Terrarum, an eight-leaved <b>wall</b> <b>map</b> of the world, on which he identified the Regio Patalis with Locach as a northward extension of the Terra Australis, reaching as far as New Guinea.|$|E
