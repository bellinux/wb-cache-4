There are two schools of thought on the right time to harvest Merlot.

Each difference in the DNA indicates divergence between one species and another. This divergence, whether via drift or natural selection, is representative of some lapse of time. Comparing DNA sequences alone gives {{a record of the}} history of evolution with an arbitrary measure of phylogenetic distance “dating” that last common ancestor. However, if information about the rate of genetic mutation is available or geologic markers are present to calibrate evolutionary divergence (i.e. fossils), we have a timeline of evolution. From there, with an idea about other contemporaneous changes in life and environment, we can begin to speculate why certain evolutionary paths might have been selected for.|$|E

500|$|Hurricane Catarina (...) was an {{extremely}} rare South Atlantic tropical cyclone that hit southeastern Brazil in late March 2004. The storm developed out of a stationary cold-core upper-level trough on March12. Almost a week later, on March19, a disturbance developed along the trough and traveled towards the east-southeast until March22 when a ridge stopped the forward motion of the disturbance. The disturbance was in an unusually favorable environment <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> below-average wind shear and above-average sea surface temperatures. The {{combination of the two}} led to a slow transition from an extratropical cyclone to a subtropical cyclone by March24. The storm continued to obtain tropical characteristics and became a tropical storm the next day while the winds steadily increased. The storm attained wind speeds of 75mph (120km/h)—equivalent to a low-end Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale—on March26. At this time it was unofficially named Catarina and was also the first hurricane-intensity tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Unusually favorable conditions persisted and Catarina continued to intensify and was estimated to have peaked with winds of 100mph (155km/h) on March28. The center of the storm made landfall later that day at the time between the cities of Passo de Torres and Balneário Gaivota, Santa Catarina. Catarina rapidly weakened upon landfall and dissipated the next day.|$|E
