5|$|Inscriptions for the {{practice}} of magic in Gaul show the characteristic use of Greek for spells in the Imperial period. A 2nd-century curse tablet from Autun (Augustodunum) lists the names of those to be cursed in Latin, two magic words in Greek, and a series of voces magicae. A defixio (binding spell) from Amélie-les-Bains seems composed in Celtic <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> of Latin. A lamella from Roman Britain has been interpreted as Hebrew written in Greek characters.|$|E
5|$|The nest {{is usually}} a {{depression}} in the ground, {{which may or may}} not be lined <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> of grass or similar materials. The eggs are mottled and camouflaged. Both sexes share incubation duties. The young hatch after 22–27 days and fledge after 21–24 days. If the parents are disturbed and flush from the nest frequently the incubation period could be extended to as long as 34 days.|$|E
5|$|In early 1929 Robey {{returned}} to South Africa and then Canada for another tour <b>with</b> <b>Bits</b> and Pieces, {{after which he}} started another series of variety dates back in England. Among the towns he visited was Woolwich, where he performed to packed audiences {{over the course of}} a week. Here he met the theatre managers Frank and Agnes Littler, with the latter briefly becoming his manager. In 1932 Robey appeared in his first sound film, The Temperance Fête, and followed this with Marry Me, which was, according to his biographer A. E. Wilson, one of the most successful musical films of the comedian's career. The film tells the story of a sound recordist in a gramophone company who romances a colleague when she becomes the family housekeeper.|$|E

At the same time, fresh pork sausages and pig liver sausages and several varieties of salami are prepared as well.|$|E
25|$|The ‘galleries' {{produced}} by embiopterans are tunnels and chambers woven from the silk they produce. These woven constructions {{can be found}} on substrates such as rocks and the bark of trees, or in leaf litter. Some species camouflage their galleries by decorating the outer layers <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> of leaf litter or other materials to match their surroundings (see image). The galleries are essential to their life cycle, maintaining moisture in their environment, plus offering protection from predators and the elements while foraging, breeding and simply existing. The only occasion when an embiopteran will leave the gallery complex is when winged males fly out or wingless males walk out in search of a mate, or when females explore the area immediately surrounding them in search of a new food source. On detection of a potential predator or threat, the embiids retreat into their galleries, and some species have even been observed to 'play dead' until the threat is no longer present.|$|E
25|$|An earthworm's {{digestive}} system {{consists of a}} mouth, pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in {{the walls of the}} gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown. This releases carbohydrates, protein, fat, and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body.|$|E

500|$|According to Los Angeles Times critic Don Heckman, the {{resulting}} textures heard in Black Beautys music exhibited [...] "an almost pointillistic quality, <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> {{and pieces of}} sounds darting {{in and out of}} the overall texture, and Davis' trumpet skimming through the mix". In Spin, Erik Davis highlighted Grossman's [...] "squonking sax", Corea's [...] "nastily distorted" [...] keyboards, and Davis' [...] "milky, yearning, sometimes angry" [...] trumpet playing. Because they were playing around a preceding vamp or theme when Davis signaled the next, Tingen said the musical shifts heard on the record had the effect of post-production crossfades, similar to those used by producer Teo Macero on the studio recordings In a Silent Way (1969), Bitches Brew, and Jack Johnson. Macero claimed Davis conceived his onstage approach from him: [...] "It was because of me, because we always overlapped sections in our edits." ...|$|E

[...] However, she concluded the review by noting that [...] "for all its flaws, it is an authentic work of great talent". School Library Journal wrote that in Eragon [...] "sometimes the magic solutions are just too convenient for getting out of difficult situations".

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of August 16, the weather cleared, and Stark ordered his men {{to be ready to}} attack. Stark is reputed to have rallied his troops by saying they were here to fight for their [...] "natural born rights as Englishmen" [...] and he added [...] "There are your enemies, the Red Coats and the Tories. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow." [...] Upon hearing that the militia had melted away into the woods, Baum assumed that the Americans were retreating or redeploying. However, Stark had decided to capitalize on weaknesses in the German's widely distributed position, and had sent sizable flanking parties to either side of his lines. These movements were assisted by a ruse employed by Stark's men that enabled them to get closer safely without alarming the opposing forces. The Germans, most of whom spoke no English, had been told that soldiers <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> of white paper in their hat were Loyalists, and should not be fired on; Stark's men had also heard this and many of them had suitably adorned their hats.|$|E

500|$|The {{black vulture}} lays its eggs {{on the ground}} in a wooded area, a hollow log, or some other cavity, seldom more than [...] above the ground. While it {{generally}} does not use any nesting materials, it may decorate the area around the nest <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> of brightly colored plastic, shards of glass, or metal items such as bottle caps. Clutch size is generally two eggs, though this can vary from one to three. The egg is oval and on average measures [...] The smooth, gray-green, bluish, or white shell is variably blotched or spotted with lavender or pale brown around the larger end. Both parents incubate the eggs, which hatch after 28 to 41 days. Upon hatching, the young are covered with white down. Both parents feed the nestlings, regurgitating food at the nest site. The young remain in the nest for two months, and after 75 to 80 days they are able to fly skillfully. Predation of black vultures is relatively unlikely, though eggs and nestlings are readily eaten if found by mammalian predators such as raccoons, coatis and foxes. Due to its aggressiveness and size, few predators can threaten the fully-grown vulture. However, various eagles may kill vultures in conflicts and even the ornate hawk-eagle, a slightly smaller bird than the vulture, have preyed on adult black vultures.|$|E

500|$|The {{negative}} reviews generally {{disliked the}} film's Cold War-period setting, using various adjectives {{to describe it}} such as [...] "stuffy", [...] "stiff", [...] "bor", [...] "oddly hollow", [...] "embalmed", [...] "truncated", and [...] "psychic suffocation". They cited the film's much-advertised reverence of the source material as a fault, referring to the story as [...] "trapped" [...] in a faithful representation of Alan Moore's graphic novel. [...] "Watchmen is a bore [...] It sinks {{under the weight of}} its reverence for the original," [...] wrote Philip Kennicott of The Washington Post. Devin Gordon wrote for Newsweek, [...] "That's the trouble with loyalty. Too little, and you alienate your core fans. Too much, and you lose everyone—and everything—else." [...] Owen Gleiberman's Entertainment Weekly review reads, [...] "Snyder treats each image with the same stuffy hermetic reverence. He doesn't move the camera or let the scenes breathe. He crams the film <b>with</b> <b>bits</b> and pieces, trapping his actors like bugs wriggling in the frame." [...] " [...] never pause to develop a vision of his own. The result is oddly hollow and disjointed; the actors moving stiffly from one overdetermined tableau to another," [...] said Noah Berlatsky of the Chicago Reader. David Edelstein of New York agrees: [...] "They've made the most reverent adaptation of a graphic novel ever. But this kind of reverence kills what it seeks to preserve. The movie is embalmed." [...] A reviewer in The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "Watching 'Watchmen' is the spiritual equivalent of being whacked on the skull for 163 minutes. The reverence is inert, the violence noxious, the mythology murky, the tone grandiose, the texture glutinous." [...] Donald Clarke of The Irish Times was similarly dismissive: [...] "Snyder, director of the unsubtle 300, has squinted hard at the source material {{and turned it into a}} colossal animated storyboard, augmented by indifferent performances and moronically obvious music cues." [...] The trade magazines Variety and The Hollywood Reporter were even less taken with the film. Variety's Justin Chang commented that, [...] "The movie is ultimately undone by its own reverence; there's simply no room for these characters and stories to breathe of their own accord, and even the most fastidiously replicated scenes can feel glib and truncated," [...] and Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter writing, [...] "The real disappointment is that the film does not transport an audience to another world, as 300 did. Nor does the third-rate Chandler-esque narration by Rorschach help...Looks like we have the first real flop of 2009." ...|$|E
