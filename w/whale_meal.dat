40|$|AS A {{result of}} the post war revival of- whaling {{operations}} in Antarctica and elsewhere, condensed whale solubles is appearing in increasing amounts on the feedstuffs market. Due to the simi-larity in processing and appearance to condensed fish solubles, it was desired to subject condensed whale solubles to an analysis, and to conduct comparative feeding tests, so that its merits as a supple-ment in poultry nutrition could be ascer-tained. Condensed whale solubles is manufac-tured as a byproduct during the reduction into <b>whale</b> <b>meal</b> of the flensed whale carcass. This process resembles in man...|$|E
40|$|Protein concentrates, {{mainly of}} marine origin, {{were tested in}} {{nitrogen}} balance experiments with young rats. Commercial herring meals produced by several methods showed only small differences in protein utilization values. In most cases when differences in nitrogen balance values were found they were mainly due to corresponding differences in the protein digestibility. Press cake meals were slightly better utilized than whole meals, this difference was not accounted for by a corresponding difference in digestibility. Steam drying did not produce meals of better protein value than flame drying. No effect on the protein quality of herring meals was found of the preservatives sodium nitrite or formalin used during the storage of the raw material. Extraction of a whole meal with light petrol did not improve the protein quality wheras extraction of another whole meal with ethyl alcohol, ethyl ether and acetone improved the quality. Four foreign fish meals were of about the same protein value as Norwegian herring meal, whereas one was decidedly better. A sand-eel press cake meal was better than a whole meal produced from this raw material. The whole meal was of about the same protein quality as the herring meals. A flash dried whale meat meal was of about equal protein value as herring meals, but decidedly better than a slowly dried <b>whale</b> <b>meal.</b> A squid meal, a spray dried herring solubles meal and two fish off-fall meals were of decidedly poorer protein quality than the herring meals. Rennet casein was of about the same protein value as the herring meals, whereas the reference protein source, spray dried egg albumin, was better {{than all the other}} protein sources tested. Acetone dried samples of herring fillets and whole herring were of moderately better protein value than commercial herring meals. Acetone dried male herring was of poorer protein value than a corresponding sample of female herring. Acetone dried herring roe was of good protein value whereas the corresponding sample of herring milt was of poor protein value...|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} a planktivore is the {{humpback}} whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). Humpback whales and other similar whales are classified as baleen whales. This means they consume all types of plankton and krill {{with the help of}} baleen. Baleen are bristle like structures in the whales mouth that hang down in place of teeth. They are similar to the bristles on a broom. Baleen whales take in large amounts of water into their mouths and all of the plankton and krill that was in the water is filtered through the baleen. This allows the whale to separate their food from the water column. The water is pushed out of the mouth and all of the remaining plankton become the <b>whales</b> <b>meal.</b> Another planktivore is jellyfish which are actually considered plankton themselves. The jellyfish sting the small plankton with their tentacles and bring the plankton to the center of their body where their mouth is found. It is also possible for the jellyfish to drift along in the current and eat the plankton that happen to find their way into the jellyfishes mouth. A feather duster is a segmented fan worm that also eat plankton in the water column. Their long arms look like feathers and each of the bristles helps the worm catch plankton in the water and brings the food to its mouth.|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The aim was {{to explore}} whether {{maternal}} consumption of seafood is a determinant of birth weight in a dose dependent manner. DESIGN [...] A population based survey of lifestyle factors in pregnancy was linked with information from antenatal and obstetric records. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS [...] Seventy five per cent of all 1362 women who delivered in the Faroe Islands {{during the study period}} 1986 - 87 who gave a structured post partum interview on lifestyle factors. MAIN RESULTS [...] Altogether, 2, 6, 16, 33, 26, 14, and 3 % of women had consumed approximately 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 + respectively seafood (fish or <b>whale)</b> dinner <b>meals</b> per week during pregnancy. The average birth weight (p = 0. 02) and birth length (p = 0. 002) varied significantly between the seven groups, and increased by about 0. 2 kg and 1 cm, respectively between women who ate 0 and those who consumed 3 seafood meals per week. Mean birth weight and length tended to level off with further fish consumption: when fitting a second degree polynomial, the quadratic terms were negative and significant for both birth weight (p = 0. 005) and length (p = 0. 001). Analogous analyses for pregnancy duration were not significant, but exhibited similar trends. All analyses were adjusted for maternal height, weight, parity, age, marital status, and smoking. CONCLUSIONS [...] The weight and length of the newborn increased with the frequency of seafood dinner meals consumed in pregnancy but only up to a consumption level of about 3 meals per week...|$|R
