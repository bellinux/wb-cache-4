5|$|As {{it became}} clear the stocks were nearly depleted, the world banned right whaling in 1937. The ban was largely successful, {{although}} violations continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two right <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> 1968. Japan took 23 Pacific right <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> the 1940s and more under scientific permit in the 1960s. Illegal whaling continued {{off the coast of}} Brazil for many years and the Imbituba land station processed right whales until 1973. The Soviet Union illegally took at least 3,212 southern right whales during the 1950s and '60s, although it reported taking only four.|$|E
50|$|On May 18, 1965, a few Rhine skippers near Duisburg {{reported}} a white <b>whale</b> <b>in</b> the Rhine {{to the water}} police. They reacted by first making the mariners take a blood alcohol test, which came up negative: there really was a white <b>whale</b> swimming <b>in</b> the Rhine 300 kilometers from the ocean and thousands of kilometers from the usual habitat of the beluga <b>whale</b> <b>in</b> arctic waters.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, after the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and {{the ban on}} hunting Killer <b>Whales</b> <b>in</b> Washington in 1976 as {{discussed}} later in this article, the hunting of Killer <b>Whales</b> <b>in</b> Iceland resumed, this time aiming to capture live animals for the entertainment industry. The first two Killer Whales captured went to Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands. One of these animals was soon after transferred to SeaWorld. These captures continued until 1989, with the additional animals going to SeaWorld, Marineland Antibes, Marineland Canada, Kamogawa Sea World, Ocean Park Hong Kong and Conny-Land.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous Ainu tribe often {{refereed}} killer <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> their {{folklore and}} myth as Repun Kamuy (God of Sea/Offshore) to bring fortunes (whales) to the coasts, {{and there had}} been traditional funerals for stranded or deceased orcas akin to funerals for other animals such as brown bears.|$|E
5|$|Killer <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> {{many areas}} may prey on {{cormorants}} and gulls. A captive killer whale at MarineLand discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds. Four others then learned {{to copy the}} behaviour.|$|E

5|$|The vocalizations of killer <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> {{other parts}} of the world have also been studied. Norwegian and Icelandic herring-eating orcas appear to have {{different}} vocalizations for activities like hunting and traveling.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales may be wounded, {{sometimes}} fatally, after {{colliding with}} ocean vessels, {{as well as}} becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear. Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> California. In September 2007, three dead blue whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes. Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka, and scientists believe this problem could be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which {{makes it harder for}} them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Research on blue <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> the Southern California Bight has shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding. Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.|$|E
5|$|Fin {{whales are}} rorquals, {{members of the}} family Balaenopteridae, which also {{includes}} the humpback whale, the blue whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whales. The family diverged from the other baleen <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Miocene, although it is not known when the members of these families further evolved into their own species.|$|E

5|$|In October 2006, Iceland's {{fisheries}} ministry {{authorized the}} hunting of 9 fin whales through August 2007. In 2009 and 2010, Iceland caught 125 and 148 fin whales, respectively. An Icelandic company, Hvalur, caught {{over a hundred}} fin <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> 2014, and exported a record quantity of 2071 tonnes in a single shipment in 2014. Since 2006, Hvalur has caught more than 500 fin whales and exported more than 5000 tonnes of whale meat to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{southern}} right whales are seen with rolls of fats behind blowholes that northern species often lack, {{and these are}} regarded {{as a sign of}} better health condition due to sufficient nutrition supply, and could have contributed in vast differences in recovery status between right <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> southern and northern hemisphere, other than direct impacts by mankind.|$|E

5|$|New England whaling ships hunting sperm <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific {{began to}} arrive in Hawaii in 1819, and many ships {{anchored}} in Honolulu and Lahaina. The impact of the whaling fleets on the Hawaiian Islands {{during the reign of}} Kamehameha III (1825–1854) shaped the entire Hawaiian economy and was the primary source of income for the islands until the discovery of oil in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859 and the onset of the American Civil War (1861–1865).|$|E
5|$|So-called lobtail feeding was {{observed}} in the North Atlantic. This technique involves the whale slapping {{the surface of the}} ocean with its tail between one and four times before creating the bubble net. Using network-based diffusion analysis, the study authors argued that these whales learned the behavior from other <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> the group over a period of 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey.|$|E
5|$|Sperm whales {{increase}} {{levels of}} primary production and carbon export by depositing iron-rich faeces into surface {{waters of the}} Southern Ocean. The iron-rich faeces cause phytoplankton to grow and take up more carbon from the atmosphere. When the phytoplankton dies, it sinks to the deep ocean and takes the atmospheric carbon with it. By reducing the abundance of sperm <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> the Southern Ocean, whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year.|$|E

5|$|The Exxon Valdez {{oil spill}} {{adversely}} affected killer <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> Prince William Sound and Alaska's Kenai Fjords region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod {{disappeared in the}} following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local killer whales. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered {{part of a larger}} population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill. This population is expected to die out.|$|E
5|$|The varying {{patterns}} on the tail flukes distinguish individual animals. A study using data from 1973 to 1998 on <b>whales</b> <b>in</b> the North Atlantic gave researchers detailed information on gestation times, growth rates and calving periods, as well as allowing more accurate population predictions by simulating the mark-release-recapture technique. A photographic catalogue of all known North Atlantic whales was developed over this period and is maintained by College of the Atlantic. Similar photographic identification projects operate around the world.|$|E
