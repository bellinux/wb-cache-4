500|$|The {{return of}} Bitch Hunter {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. Exton said [...] "thank you NBC for re-airing Bitch Hunter, more Will Ferrell for us!" [...] Canning opined that 30 Rock [...] "may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> of overdoing this funny but one-note joke." [...] Carlson enjoyed the reappearance, noting it was [...] "a welcome touch." ...|$|E
500|$|At 10:37, CNN {{correspondent}} Aaron Brown, {{covering the}} collapse of the World Trade Center, announced, [...] "We are getting reports and we are getting lots of reports and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> to tell you when we have confirmed them and not, but we have a report that a 747 is down in Pennsylvania, and that remains unconfirmed at this point." [...] He followed that up at 10:49 by reporting that, [...] "We have a report now that a large plane crashed this morning, north of the Somerset County Airport, which is in western Pennsylvania, not too terribly far from Pittsburgh, about 80 miles or so, a Boeing 767 jet. Don't know whose airline it was, whose airplane it was, and we don't have any details beyond that which I have just given you." [...] In the confusion, he also erroneously reported a second hijacked plane heading for the Pentagon after the crash of the first.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, the {{executive}} producers of [...] It was directed by Mike Vejar, his sixth episode of the series. He previously directed episodes for three other Star Trek series. When asked {{about the use of}} time travel stories in Star Trek in relation to [...] "Carpenter Street", Scott Bakula said that [...] "Obviously it's something you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> of, and {{yet at the same time}} I'm told that the fans love the time travel episodes, and there's certainly an effort on Rick and Brannon's part to write things that they hope the fans will love. This particular journey back in time is very grounded in story." [...] He added that he believed that the setting for the episode was chosen because the production values were [...] "easily accomplished" [...] and that [...] "because the episode deals with germ warfare, and that certainly is a relevant topic today." ...|$|E
60|$|Philip {{thanked her}} for the suggestion, {{but it seemed to}} him odd. He did not know that he {{particularly}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, hardly anybody {{uses that}} road,--so the stableman told me," [...] {{answered}} Roger. [...] "Besides, we can watch out. One always <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> when shooting, at a target or otherwise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>was</b> enough. You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>careful</b> {{with your}} car after this. You auto fellows {{seem to think}} you own the whole road." ...|$|R
500|$|Test {{screenings}} for {{the film}} were encouraging for 20th Century Fox. Joe Roth, then president of the company, considered marketing Edward Scissorhands {{on the scale of}} [...] "an E.T.-sized blockbuster," [...] but Roth decided not to aggressively promote the film in that direction. [...] "We have to let it find its place. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to hype the movie out of the universe," [...] he reasoned. Edward Scissorhands had its limited release in the United States on December 7, 1990. The wide release came on December 14, and the film earned $6,325,249 in its opening weekend in 1,372 theaters. Edward Scissorhands eventually grossed $56,362,352 in North America, and a further $29,661,653 outside North America, coming to a worldwide total of $86.02 million. With a budget of $20 million, the film was declared to be a box office success. The New York Times wrote [...] "the chemistry between Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, who were both together in real life at the time (1989–1993), gave the film teen idol potential, drawing younger audiences." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> and {{say that}} the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office has used race – has illegitimately used race as a factor, {{and to the extent that}} {{constitutes}} racial profiling, that's what it is and that's what I found and the sheriff is saying that people have wrongfully accused him of that as of last Wednesday, which was after the meeting in which he was here.|$|E
6000|$|... "That, of course, is {{something}} we'll {{have to figure}} out. We'll <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful,</b> {{so as not to}} get our own fingers burnt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not now," [...] {{answered}} Jed Sanborn. [...] "He'll be {{on guard}} all day. You {{can come back}} some other day if you <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> But <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> he don't chew ye up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can go ahead, but we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mighty <b>careful.</b> Don't {{take a step}} {{until you}} are sure of your footing. If you find {{yourself}} sinking, grab hold of some tree or bush." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{the company}} had {{assembled}} by appointment, some mistake had crept in their understanding. He had appeared before a larger audience than this one to-day, and he would repeat what he then said, namely, he supposed owing to the great, good news, {{there would be some}} demonstration. He would prefer to-morrow evening, when he should be quite willing, and he hoped ready, to say something. He desired <b>to</b> <b>be</b> particular, because every thing he said got into print. Occupying the position he did, a mistake would produce harm, and therefore he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not <b>to</b> make a mistake.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful,</b> Nannie," [...] {{her father}} added, [...] "about people's {{feelings}} {{when you meet}} them, and afterwards seem not to know them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{heavy rains}} are {{responsible}} for this," [...] said Snap. [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful,</b> or the boat will be smashed {{on some of the}} rocks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> here," [...] he said. [...] "This {{island is}} full of caves and pitfalls and, before you know it, you'll break a leg." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Devilish hard no, I don't mean that;" [...] and Dan bit his lips, for the {{forbidden}} word slipped out {{in spite of}} him, and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>careful</b> with Demi than {{with any of the}} other boys.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed! Well, you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>careful</b> in the future," [...] was Captain Putnam's advice, {{and then}} he left Baxter. If he {{suspected}} anything he did not let on. To a certain extent he believed in letting boys fight out their own battles.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. TRAVERS. Well, I only <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful,</b> my dear. So {{much depends}} on how you begin, and with {{prudence}} there's really no reason why you shouldn't do very well. I suppose there's no doubt about Harry's income. He won't object to a few inquiries? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They say {{a band of}} {{them are}} in the woods around here," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "If you go out you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> or they may scalp you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> how you journey around here," [...] cautioned John Barrow. [...] "If that hollow {{had been}} twice as deep the snow might have smothered you to death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{allow that}} must be so, Tom. But you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> even so. A big {{mountain}} deer or a bear aint to be fooled with, I can tell you that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{bound to}} eat, Carrots. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so awful <b>careful</b> of your money, you might give up smokin' cigarettes," [...] Teddy replied.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have been}} {{spending}} {{a great deal}} of time with him of late, very sensibly and pleasantly, I know; I don't blame you at all, my dear, so you need not look distressed. I only <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful.</b> You know, though we call him cousin, he is scarcely a relation at all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You sea-lawyers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mighty <b>careful</b> {{with your}} tongues, or there'll be trouble. I've {{come here to}} make a fair trade, an' you'd better listen to it. We'll help repair the tug, an' give up an equal share of the brig if you'll turn to with us an' get her off the shoal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that road}} {{will take you}} {{right up to the}} top," [...] he said. [...] "But you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> and not make a wrong turn, or you may get lost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> how you attack wildcats around here, lad. It aint likely they'll tech you, if {{you don't}} tech them. But if you do, why, look out, that's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{a narrow}} escape," [...] he remarked presently. [...] "You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> how {{you try to}} cross the river at this point. What were you doing on the tree?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I not?" [...] {{she said}} joyously. [...] "Oh, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so <b>careful,</b> and I <b>was</b> <b>careful.</b> That <b>is</b> why I am so happy now." [...] Her face was glowing. She {{was full of}} odd, {{delightful}} fancies to-night. She kissed her hand to the gloaming; no, not to the gloaming--to the little hunted, anxious girl she had been.|$|R
5000|$|On one occasion, {{and as a}} young teenager, Milagros {{was called}} by {{the mother of a}} friend whose 15 year {{birthday}} celebration <b>was</b> soon <b>to</b> take place. The mother told Ortiz that she could not go to the party because Trujillo's daughter Angelita Trujillo had confirmed her attendance to the same event. She resigned herself as Ortiz <b>was</b> already used <b>to</b> that kind of behaviour by friends, defenders and people wary of the Trujillo regime. Many people simply <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not <b>to</b> fall out of favor with [...] "The Boss", as Trujillo would often be called by his supporters. Even as a child Ortiz's parents and grandparents had warned her that the entire family was classified as not supportive of the regime, so discrimination of this kind was common against Ortiz and her cousins. One particular target was the son of the uncle Juan, Leon Bosch himself, who at the time was also a young man and he had grown up with his grandparents.|$|R
6000|$|... "Probably. You {{looked it}} up, eh? Um! Send {{me in the}} two order-records. Well. But, anyway, I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>careful</b> after this, Wrenn. You're pretty sloppy. Now get out. Expect me to make firms pay twice for the same order, cause of your carelessness?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure we can, by {{the aid of}} {{the hooks}} and ropes, and the horses. But we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> how it's done. There is no sense in {{breaking}} the machine still more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> about {{walking over}} the Marshes," [...] he said. [...] "In the summer time {{there are lots}} of bog holes, an' it ain't none too safe in the winter time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{must have}} been before we started to look for you," [...] {{returned}} Dave. [...] "After this you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> how you climb around. Some of the rocks are loose and very treacherous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, they’ll {{do for the}} ship, but you can’t go ashore in ’em," [...] said Joe, as he edged {{towards the}} ladder, and {{suddenly}} sprang up {{a step or two}} to let fly at the boy, [...] "The old man <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> see you; <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> what you say to him." ...|$|R
500|$|A's {{pitching}} coach Dave Duncan said of Henderson, [...] "You have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> {{because he can}} knock one out. But you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too <b>careful</b> because he's got a small strike zone and you can't afford to walk him. And that's only half the problem. When he gets on base he's more trouble still." [...] Sportswriter Tom Verducci wrote, [...] "Baseball <b>is</b> designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an egalitarian sort of game in which one player among the 18 <b>is</b> not supposed <b>to</b> dominate... Yet in {{the past quarter century}} Henderson and Barry Bonds have come closest to dominating a baseball game the way Michael Jordan could a basketball game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{just dropped}} in, Miss Blair," [...] said that worthy woman, [...] "to say that I dunno as I mind your making candy {{once in a}} while if you <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> Only do <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not <b>to</b> set the place on fire. Please <b>be</b> {{particularly}} <b>careful</b> not <b>to</b> set it on fire." ...|$|R
