25|$|Deutz AG {{produced}} two-hundred 4-wheel {{internal combustion}} locomotives with an evaporative cooling <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> surrounding the single cylinder oil engine. Fifty similar 6-wheel locomotives were produced by Deutz.|$|E
25|$|The firebox was {{separate}} from the boiler and was double walled, with a <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> between them. Stephenson recognised that the hottest part of the boiler, and thus the most effective for evaporating water, was that surrounding the fire itself. This firebox was heated by radiant heat from the glowing coke, not just convection from the hot exhaust gas.|$|E
25|$|Combining an {{adsorbent}} with a refrigerant, adsorption chillers use heat {{to provide}} a cooling effect. This heat, {{in the form of}} hot water, may come from any number of industrial sources including waste heat from industrial processes, prime heat from solar thermal installations or from the exhaust or <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> heat of a piston engine or turbine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>jackets</b> {{are often}} used in watercooling. They are also used in {{laboratory}} glassware: Liebig, Graham, and Allihn condensers. <b>Water</b> <b>jackets</b> were used to cool the barrels of machine guns {{at the time of}} the First World War, but modern machine guns are air-cooled to conserve weight and hence increase portability.|$|R
25|$|Mechanical hazards {{may include}} moving parts in vacuum and {{pressure}} pumps; implosion or explosion of flashlamps, plasma tubes, <b>water</b> <b>jackets,</b> and gas handling equipment.|$|R
50|$|The Turbo, GT2 and GT3 models use the Aluminum {{crankcase}} of the air-cooled 911 {{with its}} true dry sump oiling system. The six separate individual Nikasil lined cylinders in this engine {{are covered with}} two separately installed <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> each covering a bank of 3 cylinders {{on each side of}} the engine, thus adding water cooling to a crankcase originally designed for air-cooled cylinders (the normal 996 Carrera engine has the cylinders and <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> cast together with the crankcase). This engine is very similar to that of the Le Mans winning Dauer Porsche 962 and Porsche GT1 racing cars' engines.|$|R
25|$|The first witness called was Edward N. Trump, a {{mechanical}} and chemical engineer, who is {{general manager of}} the Solvay Process Company. He reported that Wilkinson was hired by the men composing the New York Automobile Company to develop an automobile. The machine that Wilkinson showed to him was cooled by air, instead of a <b>water</b> <b>jacket.</b> Up to that time he had never heard of an air-cooled automobile. The machine had four-cylinders and gasoline was the fuel used. Wilkinson afterward developed an improved machine, which was made for the New York Automobile Company at the plant of the Straight Line Engine Company.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{has much}} in common with modern ones. It has two cylinders, a carburetor, a {{familiar}} arrangement of valves and cams. However, unlike modern engines, and unlike the earlier 1807 François Isaac de Rivaz engine, the explosion did not directly provide power. Instead, the explosion expelled air from the cylinder through a one-way valve. The cylinder was cooled by a <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> and water injected into the combustion chamber after it fired. The cooling gasses caused a vacuum and atmospheric pressure drove the piston. Morey did mention trying direct action, and elaborated on it in other descriptions. However, his method was more complicated and possibly less efficient because it used more of the engine’s stroke to draw in fuel.|$|E
25|$|A {{block heater}} warms {{the engine of}} an {{automobile}} in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs, or may be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. The block heater, first known as a head bolt heater, was invented in 1945 by Andrew Freeman in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons. U.S. patent #2,487,326 was filed on November 4, 1946 and issued to Freeman on November 8, 1949.|$|E
50|$|Individual {{cylinders}} with {{sheet metal}} <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> shared the aluminium alloy heads, four to a bank. Inlet and exhaust valves were actuated by shaft driven overhead camshafts. The aluminium alloy crankcase was split top and bottom.|$|R
50|$|Designed to give {{reliable}} service under prolonged hard use, {{the engine}} featured deep <b>water</b> <b>jackets,</b> thermostatically controlled oil cooling, copper-lead bearings and a hardened crankshaft. With no natural cruising speed, the car could sustain anything {{up to its}} maximum speed all day, road conditions permitting.|$|R
50|$|If {{the heat}} leak {{from the gas}} turbine and exhaust pipes to the <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> is prevented, and if the cooling system is kept under a {{constant}} pressure independent of that of the atmosphere, no additional radiator equipment should be required when a supercharging compressor is fitted to an airplane engine.|$|R
500|$|She {{was armed}} with two low-angle [...] guns in single mounts and four quick-firing Mk V 4-inch {{anti-aircraft}} guns, also in single mounts. The latter guns were {{controlled by a}} High-Angle Control System mounted above the bridge. Medway was protected by an internal anti-torpedo bulge which incorporated a <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> of [...] Amidships a [...] torpedo bulkhead was located 13 feet inboard that inclined outwards above the waterline. The main deck was 1.5 inches thick amdiships.|$|E
2500|$|The Allihn {{condenser}} or [...] "bulb condenser" [...] {{or simply}} [...] "reflux condenser" [...] {{is named after}} Felix Richard Allihn (1854–1915). The Allihn condenser consists of a long glass tube with a <b>water</b> <b>jacket.</b> [...] A series of bulbs on the tube increases the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense. Ideally suited for laboratory-scale refluxing.|$|E
2500|$|All {{variants}} of the R.C.40 had {{much in common}} with construction of the earlier Asso 750 R.C., though they had two, rather than three, banks of 6 cylinders and 4 rather than 2 valves per cylinder. [...] Cylinder barrels were machined from carbon steel with flat-topped heads and valve seats. Each barrel had a separate sheet steel <b>water</b> <b>jacket.</b> [...] Cast aluminium head blocks were bolted to each of the two banks of 6 cylinders, providing valve ports, guides, coolant passages and camshaft supports. The pistons were also aluminium castings. The crankshaft was a 6-throw design with 8 plain bearings and a double row ball thrust bearing between the front two. [...] The connecting rods had bronze bush little ends and white metal big ends. [...] The crankcase was cast in two parts, the upper one with the housings for the crankshaft bearings.|$|E
50|$|Designed to give {{reliable}} service under prolonged hard use, {{the engine}} featured deep <b>water</b> <b>jackets,</b> thermostatically controlled oil cooling, copper-lead bearings and a hardened crankshaft. A 3-speed Borg-Warner automatic transmission was standard. With no natural cruising speed, the car could sustain anything {{up to its}} maximum speed all day, road conditions permitting.|$|R
50|$|The lightest of the {{new designs}} were not capable of {{sustained}} automatic fire, as {{they did not have}} <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> and were fed from comparatively small magazines. Essentially machine rifles with a bipod, weapons like the Lewis Gun, Chauchat and the Madsen were portable by one soldier, but were made for single and burst fire.|$|R
50|$|Casting {{technology}} {{at the dawn of}} the internal combustion engine could reliably cast either large castings, or castings with complex internal cores to allow for <b>water</b> <b>jackets,</b> but not both simultaneously. Most early engines, particularly those with more than four cylinders, had their cylinders cast as pairs or triplets of cylinders, then bolted to a single crankcase.|$|R
60|$|The barrel, {{thickened}} by its <b>water</b> <b>jacket,</b> gleamed ominously {{in front}} of the steel shield as the men got the gun into position; but it was unthinkable that they should be left to do so undisturbed, and Cliffe scrambled back to his post when an order rang out. He felt that he hated the venomous machine, which had perhaps been bought with his money. Steadying his rifle, he fired as fast as he could.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{innovations}} incorporated into Zimmerman's new engine {{was the fact}} that the <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> was shaped like a bowl and was larger at the top than at the bottom. If water were left in the bowl-shaped <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> of this new engine during a cold winter's night, the ice could expand harmlessly upwards and outwards without cracking the castings of the cylinder or engine. Thus, because of this bowl-shaped <b>water</b> <b>jacket,</b> Zimmerman's new engine was [...] "freeze proof." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} M1919 {{was designed}} for use with tanks. The water-cooled M1917 was inappropriate due to weight and {{the vulnerability of the}} <b>water</b> <b>jacket.</b> Browning modified the M1917 to be air-cooled by making changes that included dropping the <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> and using a heavier barrel.|$|E
50|$|Heat {{generated}} an engine's cylinders {{is transferred}} to a <b>jacket</b> <b>water</b> cooling system through the cylinder wall. In addition to cooling the cylinder walls, <b>jacket</b> <b>water</b> is often found as an insulator between the exhaust header and the engine room. <b>Jacket</b> <b>water</b> cooling systems can be cooled by a central cooling water loop or can be cooled directly by seawater.|$|R
50|$|The thermal module (Therm) {{combines}} {{lumped circuit}} and finite element thermal calculations for optimising the cooling {{system of the}} machine. Cooling methods modelled include natural convection (Totally enclosed non ventilated - TENV), forced convection (Totally enclosed fan cooled - TEFC), through ventilation, <b>water</b> <b>jackets,</b> submersible, wet rotor and wet stator, spray cooling, radiation and conduction.A wide range of housing types can be modelled.|$|R
5000|$|The V.5's {{construction}} was fairly typical of aircraft engines {{of the period}} with cast-iron cylinders mounted in pairs with common heads and <b>water</b> <b>jackets.</b> It had {{much in common with}} the six-cylinder Isotta Fraschini V.4 and was built at a similar time. Though powerful, it was very heavy and thus, like some other Isotta Fraschini engines, better suited to airships than aircraft.|$|R
50|$|In the wintertime, the <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> {{had to be}} {{drained of}} water when the farmer was through working with the engine. If not drained, the water would freeze in the <b>water</b> <b>jacket,</b> the ice would expand when {{freezing}} and this expansion would crack the cast iron engine.|$|E

5000|$|The outdoor {{wood boiler}} is a variant on the indoor wood, oil or gas boiler. An outdoor wood boiler or outdoor wood stove is a unit about 4-6 {{feet wide and}} around 10 feet long. It {{is made up of}} three main parts, the firebox, which can be either round or square, the <b>water</b> <b>jacket,</b> and the exhaust heat {{reclaiming}} system. The fire box ranges from 2 to 5 feet long and can be as tall as 4 feet. It is fit lengthwise inside the outer shell and is surrounded by the <b>water</b> <b>jacket.</b> The <b>water</b> <b>Jacket</b> is a second shell around the fire box which is filled with water, which is circulated through insulated underground lines to the house, where the heat can be transferred from the water to the existing heating system.

25|$|The Green D.4 was {{a natural}} {{development}} of the Green C.4, a 30-35hp engine used by some early aviators in the UK, such as Roe and the Short Brothers. It was an inline, water-cooled 4-cylinder piston engine with characteristic Green features: cast-steel single-piece cylinders and cylinder heads, two valves per cylinder driven by an overhead camshaft, white metal crankshaft bearings and copper <b>water</b> <b>jackets,</b> rubber-sealed to allow for differential expansion.|$|R
50|$|Compression of gas {{will cause}} a rise in temperature. The heat is mostly {{carried out by the}} {{compressed}} gas, but the booster components will also be heated by contact with the hot gas. Some boosters are cooled by <b>water</b> <b>jackets</b> or external fins to increase convectional cooling by the ambient air, but smaller models may have no special cooling facilities at all. Cooling arrangements will improve efficiency, but will cost more to manufacture.|$|R
