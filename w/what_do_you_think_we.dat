6000|$|... 'A baddish {{state of}} things, eh, doctor!' said Charles. 'Well, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> this lady proposes? To set off forthwith, both of us, {{to take charge}} of him. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of that, Dr. Mayerne?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{those little}} rolls and pats of butter!' said Mr. Ormsby. 'Short commons, though. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> did in my time? We {{used to send}} over {{the way to get}} a mutton-chop.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] said Capes, [...] "what {{on earth}} do you want? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can do? Don't {{you know what}} men are, and what life is?--to {{come to me and}} talk to me like this!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But listen--listen," [...] {{interrupted}} Sir Arthur in his turn, [...] "it will do you no harm.

3000|$|The {{second phase}} of {{fieldwork}} was conducted in 2011 by an anthropologist and included eight interviews centred on the contemporary scientific publications on moths, reindeer and mountain birches (e.g. Klemola et al. 2003, Klemola 2009, Tømmervik et al. 2009, Ammunét 2011). The results put forward in these publications were presented in popular form to the herders, who were asked key questions such as: <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> if outbreaks of both autumnal and winter moth become more common as the climate gets warmer? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{about the impact of}} global warming and reindeer on the growth of birch trees? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the future of reindeer herding? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the future of the mountain birch forests in your area?

Well, old John, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the music? as good as one of your war-songs, ha?” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Crawford, [...] "and {{do you not}} scold us for our imprudence? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{have been}} sitting down for but to be talked to about it, and entreated and supplicated never to do so again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I think. But if we {{can only}} trace L. L. it should clear up the whole business. We have gained that much. We {{know that there is}} someone who has the facts {{if we can}} only find her. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You did {{not look}} frightened a bit, Marion; and you {{certainly}} gave that fellow a tremendous scare. Didn't he drop his club sharp? And now, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had better do? The first thing {{is to get the}} Grimstones in. Those fellows may have been watching for some time and saw them go out." ...|$|E

Though I lived abroad with such as them for twelve months, I have not forgotten the sweet scent of our English hedgerows, nor the wholesomeness of English household manners. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of them?" ...|$|R

"Fellers," [...] he said, gravely, as he seated {{himself in}} the Deacon's chair, {{understanding}} the importance of his position, [...] "we've got to do something to get ahead of the girls, an' I go in for havin' each one say what he thinks is best. After that we can pick out a plan. Now, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> ought to do, Si?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was a long}} silence, {{and then}} Sir Walter said, seriously: [...] "Well, Mr. Wilson, I am not a detective, and these unhappy happenings have left you in charge of that branch of the business. We all lament the cause of this, but I should {{like to say that}} I myself have the strongest {{confidence}} in your capacity for carrying on the work. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should do next?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we fellows {{were talking}} over the late {{interesting}} case of circumstantial evidence," [...] said Tommy, quoting at random from a speech Franz had {{made at the}} club, [...] "and I proposed giving Dan something {{to make up for}} our suspecting him, to show our respect, and so on, you know something handsome and useful, that he could keep always and be proud of. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> chose?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Some of them swam {{for some}} time," [...] Slim replied. [...] "But I don't fancy {{they made the}} land. We were ten days' in doing it. And we had a spanking breeze most of the way. And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had in the boat with us? Cases of square-face gin and cases of dynamite. Funny, wasn't it? Well, it got funnier later on. Oh, {{there was a small}} beaker of water, a little salt horse, and some salt-water-soaked sea biscuit--enough to keep us alive to Tagalag.|$|E
6000|$|But {{every evening}} at a regular time we all three sat {{out in the}} balcony of the hotel {{at the end of}} the courtyard, looking up at the golden and rosy light as it changed on the great towers, and looking at the shadows of the towers as they changed on all about us {{ourselves}} included, and <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> did there? My dear, if Jemmy hadn't brought some other of those stories of the Major's taking down from the telling of former lodgers at Eighty-one Norfolk Street, and if he didn't bring 'em out with this speech: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense! I {{am going}} to do all I can for them. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can do? They haven't the first idea how to amuse {{themselves}} here. It's a miracle they ever got that dress the girl is wearing. They just made a bold dash because they saw it in a dressmaker's window the first day, and she had to have something. It's killingly becoming to her; but I don't believe they know it, and they don't begin to know how cheap it was: it was simply THROWN away. I'm going shopping with them in the morning." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Cliff and Burke {{now retired}} to consult. [...] "Madam," [...] said he, [...] "I'm bound {{to ask you}} as owner, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> ought to do? If you take my advice, {{the first thing to}} be done is {{to get rid of the}} ministers. You can settle with them about their {{travelling}} and let them go to their hotels. Then perhaps I can rake up a few loafers, landsmen, or anybody who can shovel coal or push on a capstan bar, and by offering them double wages get them to ship with us. Once in Jamaica, we shall be all right!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Black Hawk and I {{were after}} buffalo one time, but didn't find 'em {{as soon as}} we expected; so our food gave out, and there we were a hundred miles from Red Deer River, where our camp was. I thought we were done for, but my brave pal says: [...] "Now I'll show you how we can live till we find the herds." [...] We were unsaddling for the night by a little pond; there wasn't a living {{creature}} in sight anywhere, not even a bird, and we could see for miles over the prairies. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> did?' And Dan looked into the faces round him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But how am I to {{understand}} her neglect of my aunt--the one relation whom I have tried to teach her to value--my aunt, who was the comfort of my sister and of her brother--who had suffered enough {{to give her a}} claim to every one's veneration! To run away from her to the races, and the society of Mark Gardner and Mrs. Finch! Ay, and <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> heard yesterday of her doings there, from Gardner's own mother? That she is giving him decided encouragement! That was the general remark, and on this, poor Mrs. George Gardner is founding hopes of her son settling down and becoming respectable.' ...|$|E
