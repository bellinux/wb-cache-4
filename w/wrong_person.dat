After {{receiving}} {{a call from}} someone who immediately hangs up, Scully leaves her apartment and tells Melissa that she'll head to her home instead. As she leaves, Skinner pulls up in his car, telling her they need to speak in private. Melissa shows up soon afterwards and is mistakenly shot by Luis Cardinal, who is hiding there with Alex Krycek.

Meanwhile, after taking Skinner to Mulder's apartment, Scully holds him at gunpoint, believing he is the traitor the Well-Manicured Man spoke of. Skinner tells Scully {{that he is in}} possession of the digital tape. Just then, someone steps outside the door. This distracts Scully enough for Skinner to pull his gun on her.|$|E

25|$|Torts {{and crimes}} at common law {{originate}} in the Germanic system of compensatory fines for wrongs (OE unriht), with no clear distinction between crimes and other wrongs. In Anglo-Saxon law, most wrongs required payment in money or in kind (bōt, literally 'remedy') to the <b>wronged</b> <b>person</b> or their clan. Wīte (literally 'blame, fault') was paid to the king or holder of a court for disturbances of public order.|$|R

25|$|The {{prosecution}} showed video {{evidence from}} {{a post office}} in the city center, where Elgaas was seen paying for the massive amount of giros. Included in this pile, was one {{for a woman who}} had reported AUF to the police in 1995, after she had attempted to leave the organisation nine times. Elgass had stated that he did not 'advance' for people {{who did not want to}} be members of the party. When questioned about the woman, he said that it could happen that they 'advanced' for the <b>wrong</b> <b>person.</b> The police had also found Elgsaas' mother's name on two of the giros. Elgsaas explained that he experienced pressure from the leader of AUF, Trond Giske, and the general secretary, Rita Ottervik, to continue with the 'advancements'.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{identification}} of a suspect can help police with their inquiries, and evidence of identification is accepted in some courts. The most approved method of identification is for the hound to jump up, and place its paws on the subject’s chest. In {{the case of a}} lost person or a known fugitive identification will not be significant, {{and in the case of}} a potentially violent, possibly armed, fugitive a bloodhound handler will not want his dog to approach the quarry for fear of injury to the bloodhound. Many bloodhounds reaching the end of a trail will show no interest in the person they have been trailing, and are difficult to train to identify. Leon Whitney recommended a method of initial training in which identification was the first thing learned, based on giving the young hound a scent-article from someone who walks a very short distance out of sight into a barn, where he stands with a piece of liver, while another person, also smelling of liver, stands nearby. The hound is led along the 'trail', and if it shows an inclination to go to the <b>wrong</b> <b>person</b> it is chastised, but gets the liver if it goes to the right one. When the hound goes to the right person almost infallibly, the number of people is increased, making the choice more difficult, and eventually the brief walks are extended into full trails.|$|E

After the agents leave, Klemper calls the Well-Manicured Man and informs him that Mulder is alive. The news causes the Syndicate to further mistrust the Smoking Man. Meanwhile, at the hospital, Albert Hosteen visits Melissa while a suited man loiters nearby.|$|E

Whichever it was, he managed to convey it to me even during the period when he appeared almost too weak to talk. I treated him to my invariable kindliness.|$|R
40|$|Radicalism and {{terrorism}} are often {{connected to a}} misconception of religion’s teachings. It emerges since one {{or a group of}} persons learn a religion’s teachings from wrong sources.

Critic Kirk Honeycutt referred to Connelly as [...] "a bland and minimally talented young actress" [...] Writing for The Miami News, Jon Marlowe stated, [...] "Connelly {{is simply the}} <b>wrong</b> <b>person</b> for the right job. She has a squeaky voice that begins to grate on you; when she cries, {{you can see the}} onions in her eyes."

500|$|Publishers Weekly {{noted that}} themes such as family, {{friendship}} and responsibility are also {{taught in the}} warrior code, the set of rules that the Clans must follow. Holmes has {{said that one of}} her favorite things about writing the series is being able to add in themes that apply to us all such as family, loss, honor, bravery, death, loyalty, and following rules. Other themes include [...] "death and spirituality and family and relationships". She also added in human themes such as [...] "starting at a new school (Rusty joining ThunderClan), falling in love with the <b>wrong</b> <b>person</b> (Graystripe and Silverstream) and being bullied by someone who should look after you (Tigerclaw bullying Ravenpaw)". To a reviewer for Kirkus Reviews, the human theme of fitting in was easily found and applauded when Rusty succeeds.|$|E
500|$|Whether {{or not a}} work is {{attributed}} to the <b>wrong</b> <b>person</b> depends on, according to Clark v Associated Newspapers, [...] "the single meaning which... the work conveys to the notional reasonable reader". There {{is no need to}} prove that the false attribution caused any harm to the actual author, and the right has been interpreted to cover situations as diverse as a newspaper parody of Alan Clark's diaries, an interview with Dorothy Squires and a replica painting that contained the signature of the original author. The right is closely linked to passing off, defamation and other non-statutory causes of action, which may be used to supplement a claim for infringing the right to object to false attribution. David Vaver, writing in the International Journal of Law and Information Technology, goes as {{far as to say that}} the right to object to false attribution is merely [...] "passing off, writ large". Cornish, Llewelyn and Aplin also note a strong overlap between the rights against false attribution and against derogatory treatment.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{psychological}} concept and virtue, {{the benefits of}} forgiveness have been explored in religious thought, {{the social sciences and}} medicine.

In most contexts, forgiveness is granted without any expectation of restorative justice, and without any response on the part of the offender (for example, one may forgive a person who is [...] or dead).

When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the <b>wrong</b> <b>person.</b> I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing.

5000|$|Vengeance demons are a {{group of}} beings that appear in the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Some of them, according to Halfrek in the episode [...] "Older and Far Away", prefer to be called justice demons, which carries less stigma than 'vengeance'; the term [...] "vengeance demon" [...] itself was first used in [...] "Pangs". Their typical method is to encourage a <b>wronged</b> <b>person</b> to vent spleen about those who have hurt them. The moment {{the object of the}} demon's attention expresses their preferred method of punishment {{in the form of a}} wish, the vengeance demon can cause his or her wish to come true, whether it requires gruesome dismemberment or even the creation of a new alternate universe (as in [...] "The Wish").|$|R

This ID {{system does not}} require any specific codes to memorize, thus has a potential to flee us from the flood of increasing number of passwords. Although the RIP is different every time, it reflects peculiarities of individuals and distinguish each person to a certain degree. The identifier is constructed by using 6 parameters extracted from the pre-registered data for each individual. The average accuracy evaluated by using 9 individuals was that the Type-I error rate that disapproves the right person is 23 % and Type-II error rate that approves <b>wrong</b> <b>persons</b> is 19 % on the average.
