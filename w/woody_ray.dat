5000|$|Though most {{conduction}} in xylem {{tissue is}} vertical, lateral conduction along {{the diameter of}} a stem is facilitated via rays. [...] Rays are horizontal rows of long-living parenchyma cells that arise out of the vascular cambium. In trees and other <b>woody</b> plants, <b>rays</b> radiate out {{from the center of}} stems and roots, and appear like spokes on a wheel in cross section. Rays, unlike vessel members and tracheids, are alive at functional maturity.|$|R

Shelley enters, obviously high, and Ray beats him until he reveals his stash of heroin, concealed in some art he has been working on. Shelley roars off into the night on his motorcycle to his death; the next day, <b>Woody</b> dies. <b>Ray</b> and Alice have a hippie-style wedding in the church, and a drunken Ray proposes to sell the church and start a country commune instead, revealing that he blames himself for Shelley's death.

At another bar, they run into Woody's former business partner, Ed Pegram, whom the family blames for stealing Woody's air compressor decades ago.

50|$|Within a year, the Tommy Dorsey Band {{was at the}} top of {{the jazz}} trade paper polls. Into the 40’s, it {{remained}} one of the key aggregations of the Swing Era, despite the shifting personnel problems generated by World War II.

50|$|Petrillo {{had long}} thought that {{recording}} companies should pay royalties. As {{head of the}} Chicago {{local chapter of the}} union in 1937 he had organized a strike there. He was elected president of the American Federation of Musicians in 1940.When he announced that the recording ban would start at midnight, July 31, 1942, most people thought it would not happen. America had just entered World War II on December 8, 1941, and most newspapers opposed the ban. By July {{it was clear that the}} ban would take place and record companies began to stockpile new recordings of their biggest names. In the first two weeks of July, these performers recorded new material: Tommy Dorsey, Bing Crosby, Charlie Barnet, Jimmy Dorsey, Guy Lombardo, and Glenn Miller, who made his last records as a civilian bandleader. Recording during the last week was a long list of performers, including Count Basie, <b>Woody</b> Herman, Alvino <b>Ray,</b> Johnny Long, Claude Thornhill, Judy Garland, Crosby (again), Glen Gray, Benny Goodman, Kay Kyser, Dinah Shore, Spike Jones, and Duke Ellington, among others.|$|R
