25|$|Openhole {{completions}} (in {{comparison with}} cemented pipe) require {{better understanding of}} formation damage, <b>wellbore</b> clean-up and fluid loss control. A key difference is that perforating penetrates through the first 6-18 inches (15–45cm) of formation around the <b>wellbore,</b> whilst openhole completions require the reservoir fluids to flow {{through all of the}} filtrate-invaded zone around the <b>wellbore</b> and lift-off of the mud filter cake.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} obtained from these monitoring devices {{can be used}} to model reservoirs or predict the life or problems in a specific <b>wellbore.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pre-holed liner {{may provide}} some basic control of solids production, where the <b>wellbore</b> {{is thought to}} fail in {{aggregated}} chunks of rubble, {{but it is not}} typically regarded as a sand control completion.|$|E
30|$|Effect of {{seawater}} on {{the profiles}} of SCW pressure in <b>wellbores</b> is negligible. However, {{the flow of}} seawater results in a rapid decline in the temperature/enthalpy of SCW in <b>wellbores.</b>|$|R
30|$|However, these {{previous}} {{models were}} focused on the single-phase flow of superheated steam in <b>wellbores,</b> which cannot be {{used to analyze the}} effect of non-condensing gases on SMTF in <b>wellbores</b> (de Almeida et al. 2017). Dong et al. (2014) proposed a numerical model for estimating pressure and temperature of SMTF in perforated horizontal <b>wellbores.</b> However, the predicted values of temperature from their model deviated from field data under high injection rate. At present, the study on SMTF flow in <b>wellbores</b> is still at the early stage. In this paper, based on the momentum and energy balance equations, a flow model in <b>wellbores</b> is established. Then, coupled with S-R-K real gas model and transient heat conduction model in formation, a comprehensive model is proposed. The new model is useful for practicing engineers to estimate key parameters of SMTF at well-bottom condition.|$|R
30|$|It is {{observed}} from Fig.  5 a that effect of seawater on SCW pressure is negligible under various values of injection pressure. Pressure gradient in the seawater section of <b>wellbores</b> is almost {{equal to that}} in the formation section of <b>wellbores.</b>|$|R
25|$|Also {{often called}} {{pre-drilled}} liner. The liner is prepared with multiple small drilled holes, then set across the production zone to provide <b>wellbore</b> stability and an intervention conduit. Pre-holed liner is often combined with openhole packers, such as swelling elastomers, mechanical packers or external casing packers, to provide zonal segregation and isolation. It is now quite common {{to see a}} combination of pre-holed liner, solid liner and swelling elastomer packers to provide an initial isolation of unwanted water or gas zones. Multiple sliding sleeves {{can also be used}} in conjunction with openhole packers to provide considerable flexibility in zonal flow control {{for the life of the}} <b>wellbore.</b>|$|E
25|$|TNT {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used explosives for military, industrial, and mining applications. TNT has been used in conjunction with hydraulic fracturing, a process used to recover oil and gas from shale formations. The technique involves displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in hydraulically induced fractures followed by <b>wellbore</b> shots using pelletized TNT.|$|E
25|$|Range Resources drilled an {{unsuccessful}} {{well to the}} Oriskany Sandstone in 2003. Hoping to save some value by finding producible gas in the shallower formations in the <b>wellbore,</b> Range geologists noted that the Marcellus Formation {{had some of the}} same properties as the Barnett Shale of North Texas, which was a prolific source of gas. In late 2004 Range completed the well in the Marcellus, using hydraulic fracturing techniques developed for the Barnett, and started producing the well in 2005.|$|E
30|$|In recent years, Zhou et al. (2010), Xu et al. (2013 a, b), Fan et al. (2016) and Sun et al. (2017 h, i) {{developed}} {{different models}} {{to predict the}} distributions of pressure and temperature of SHS in the vertical <b>wellbores.</b> However, it is a constant mass flow process in the vertical <b>wellbores.</b> Dong et al. (2014, 2016) proposed a numerical model for predicting steam pressure in the horizontal <b>wellbores.</b> However, it is conventional heel-point steam injection technique, and they focused on the flow characteristics of multi-component thermal fluid. Gu et al. (2015) proposed a numerical model for predicting superheated steam pressure along the horizontal <b>wellbores.</b> Besides, it is also focused on the heel-point steam injection technique.|$|R
30|$|It is {{observed}} from Fig.  3 a that: (a) The {{value of pressure}} gradient in the seawater section of the <b>wellbores</b> (from 0 to 150  m) {{is close to the}} that in the formation section of the <b>wellbores</b> (from 150 to 1350  m). Therefore, it is concluded that the effect of seawater on SCW pressure in <b>wellbores</b> is negligible. (b) SCW pressure increases with well depth. This is because the SCW density increases with well depth, as shown in Fig.  3 b.|$|R
30|$|However, these {{previous}} works {{were focused on}} superheated steam (or multi-component thermal fluid), which cannot be {{used to analyze the}} flow behaviors of SCW in <b>wellbores.</b> At present, the study on SCW flow in <b>wellbores</b> was very limited. This paper moves one step forward to develop a numerical model for simulating SCW flow in offshore <b>wellbores.</b> There are mainly three contributions of this paper to the existing body of the literature: (1) a numerical model is developed for SCW flow in offshore wells with consideration of turbulent flow of seawater. (2) Type curves of SCW flow in offshore wells were obtained by finite difference method on space and iteration technique. (3) Effect of injection parameters on the profiles of thermophysical properties of SCW in offshore <b>wellbores</b> was discussed in detail.|$|R
25|$|A ram blowout {{preventer}} {{is a large}} valve that can seal off a wellhead by using ram-types employing steel cut off rams to seal the borehole. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the <b>wellbore</b> and threaten the rig. In 1922, James Smither Abercrombie collaborated with Harry S. Cameron {{with the idea of}} creating a mechanically operated ram-type {{blowout preventer}}. A patent was issued in January 1926.|$|E
25|$|An annular blowout {{preventer}} {{is a large}} valve that uses a wedge to seal off a wellhead. It has a donut-like rubber seal, known as an elastomeric packing unit, reinforced with steel ribs. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the <b>wellbore</b> and threaten the rig. The annular {{blowout preventer}} was invented by Granville Sloan Knox in 1946 who received a patent on September 9, 1952.|$|E
25|$|Crude oil {{development}} and production in U.S. oil reservoirs can include {{up to three}} distinct phases: primary, secondary, and tertiary (or enhanced) recovery. During primary recovery only about 10 percent of a reservoir's original oil in place is typically produced. Secondary recovery techniques extend a field's productive life generally by injecting water or gas to displace oil and drive it to a production <b>wellbore,</b> resulting in the recovery of 20 to 40 percent of the original oil in place. However, {{with much of the}} easy-to-produce oil already recovered from U.S. oil fields, producers have attempted several tertiary, or enhanced oil recovery, techniques that offer prospects for ultimately producing 30 to 60 percent, or more, of the reservoir's original oil in place.|$|E
30|$|It is {{observed}} from Fig.  3 d that: (a) SCW enthalpy decreases with well depth. This {{is because there}} always exists heat loss from SCW to seawater/formation due to temperature difference. (b) The enthalpy gradient in the seawater section of the <b>wellbores</b> is larger than that in the formation section of the <b>wellbores.</b>|$|R
30|$|Heat {{transfer}} rate inside the <b>wellbores</b> {{is assumed to}} be steady state.|$|R
30|$|Modeling {{of thermal}} fluid flow in <b>wellbores</b> was firstly {{conducted}} in the 1950 s. Both analytical and numerical solutions were obtained of thermal fluid flow in <b>wellbores.</b> Alves et al. (1992) and Hasan and Kabir (1994) presented two rigorous models for estimating temperature and steam quality in <b>wellbores</b> by solving the continuity, energy and momentum balance equations simultaneously. Then, huge amount of works were done by Hasan et al. (Hasan and Kabir 1996, 2012; Hasan et al. 2009) and Kabir et al. (1996) on heat conduction rate in radial direction and flow models in <b>wellbores</b> under various injection conditions, which laid a solid foundation for following studies on multiphase flow, coupling effect of wellbore/formation and Joule–Thomson effect, etc. (Pourafshary et al. 2009; Livescu et al. 2010; Bahonar and Azaiez 2011 a, b; Mao and Harvey 2013; Gu et al. 2014; Sivaramkrishnan et al. 2015).|$|R
25|$|This is {{selected}} where the liner {{is required to}} mechanically hold back the movement of formation sand. There are many variants of openhole sand control, the three popular choices being stand-alone screens, openhole gravel packs (also known as external gravel packs, where a sized sand 'gravel' is placed as an annulus around the sand control screen) and expandable screens. Screen designs are mainly wire-wrap or premium; wire-wrap screens use spiral-welded corrosion-resistant wire wrapped around a drilled basepipe to provide a consistent small helical gap (such as , termed 12 gauge). Premium screens use a woven metal cloth wrapped around a basepipe. Expandable screens are run to depth before being mechanically swaged to a larger diameter. Ideally, expandable screens will be swaged until they contact the <b>wellbore</b> wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculus}} for {{peak oil}} has {{changed with the}} introduction of unconventional production methods. In particular, the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has resulted in a significant increase in production from previously uneconomic plays. Analysts expect that $150 billion will be spent on further developing North American tight oil fields in 2015. The large increase in tight oil production {{is one of the reasons}} behind the price drop in late 2014. Certain rock strata contain hydrocarbons but have low permeability and are not thick from a vertical perspective. Conventional vertical wells would be unable to economically retrieve these hydrocarbons. Horizontal drilling, extending horizontally through the strata, permits the well to access a much greater volume of the strata. Hydraulic fracturing creates greater permeability and increases hydrocarbon flow to the <b>wellbore.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to extended reach, horizontal drilling drastically increases production. In [...] "tight" [...] rock (low permeability) like the Barnett Shale, the gas uses fractures {{to move out}} of the rock and into the <b>wellbore.</b> The fractures may be natural or induced (see below). A horizontal well exposes more rock (and therefore more fractures) to the <b>wellbore</b> because it is usually designed with the horizontal portion of the well in the productive formation.|$|E
30|$|Thermal methods, such as steam-assisted gravity {{drainage}} (SAGD) (Butler 1991; Vander et al. 2007; Al-Bahlani and Babadagli 2009; Miura and Wang 2012; Yang et al. 2016) and steam huff-puff (Marx and Langenheim 1959; Willman and Valleroy 1961; Boberg and Lanz 1966; Hou and Chen 1997; Sandler et al. 2014; Sun et al. 2017 a) have been proved successful for heavy oil recovery. Precisely predicting thermophysical parameters of thermal fluid along <b>wellbores</b> {{is the first}} important task for oilfield engineers. However, the prediction of thermophysical properties of thermal fluid in <b>wellbores</b> is never easy due {{to the complexity of}} thermal fluid flow in <b>wellbores</b> (Sun et al. 2017 b, c, d).|$|R
30|$|It is {{observed}} from Fig.  3 b that: (a) SCW density increases with well depth. This {{is because there}} always exists heat loss from SCW to seawater/formation, which causes the decrease in SCW volume. Therefore, the SCW density increases with decreasing of SCW temperature. (b) There exists a turning point where SCW reaches the seabed (the depth of 150  m). The gradient of density curve in the seawater section of the <b>wellbores</b> is larger than that in the formation section of the <b>wellbores.</b> This is because the SCW temperature drops faster in the seawater section of the <b>wellbores,</b> as shown in Fig.  3 c.|$|R
30|$|Based {{upon the}} energy balance equation, Satter (1965) gave {{a model for}} {{predicting}} steam quality in <b>wellbores.</b> Pacheco and Ali (1972) proposed a comprehensive mathematical model for predicting pressure in <b>wellbores</b> taking friction losses into consideration. Farouq Ali (1981) developed a model to analyze the pressure profiles for both upward and downward flow. Adopting iteration technique, Durrant and Thambynayagam (1986) gave an improved model for quick estimation of transient heat transfer rate along the <b>wellbores,</b> which laid a solid foundation for follow-up studies (Ejiogu and Fiori 1987; Tortike and Ali 1989; Sagar et al. 1991; Alves et al. 1992; Bahonar et al. 2010, 2011).|$|R
2500|$|In 2011 it was {{reported}} that increased concentration of , possibly due to oil field practices, was observed in the Bakken formation crude and presented challenges such as [...] "health and environmental risks, corrosion of <b>wellbore,</b> added expense with regard to materials handling and pipeline equipment, and additional refinement requirements".|$|E
2500|$|Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is an {{enhanced}} oil recovery technology for producing {{heavy crude oil}} and bitumen. It is an advanced form of steam stimulation in which a pair of horizontal wells are drilled into the oil reservoir, one a few metres above the other. High pressure steam is continuously injected into the upper <b>wellbore</b> to heat the oil and reduce its viscosity, causing the heated oil to drain into the lower <b>wellbore,</b> where it is pumped out to a bitumen recovery facility. Dr. Roger Butler, engineer at Imperial Oil from 1955 to 1982, invented steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) in the 1970s. Butler [...] "developed the concept of using horizontal pairs of wells and injected steam to develop certain deposits of bitumen considered too deep for mining." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes, {{productivity}} may be hampered due to {{the residue}} of completion fluids, heavy brines, in the <b>wellbore.</b> [...] This is particularly a problem in gas wells. [...] In these cases, coiled tubing {{may be used to}} pump nitrogen at high pressure {{into the bottom of the}} borehole to circulate out the brine.|$|E
30|$|It is {{observed}} from Fig.  4 c that (a) the temperature gradient in the seawater section of <b>wellbores</b> is always {{larger than that}} in the formation section of <b>wellbores</b> under various values of injection rate. (b) SCW temperature increases with increasing of injection rate. (c) When the injection rate is large enough (larger than 240 t/d), the {{rate of temperature rise}} decreases.|$|R
30|$|It is {{observed}} from Fig.  5 d that (a) the enthalpy gradient in the seawater section of <b>wellbores</b> is always {{larger than that}} in the formation section of <b>wellbores</b> under various values of injection pressure. (b) The SCW enthalpy decreases with increasing of injection pressure. This is because the pressure is decreasing while the injection temperature is kept unchanged at wellhead.|$|R
30|$|It is {{observed}} from Fig.  6 c, d that (a) the temperature/enthalpy gradient in the seawater section of <b>wellbores</b> is always {{larger than that}} in the formation section of <b>wellbores</b> under various values of injection temperature. (b) The SCW temperature increases with increasing of injection temperature. As a result, SCW enthalpy increases with increasing of temperature, as shown in Fig.  6 d.|$|R
2500|$|In cased hole {{completions}} (the {{majority of}} wells), once the completion string is in place, {{the final stage}} {{is to make a}} connection between the <b>wellbore</b> and the formation. [...] This is done by running perforation guns to blast holes in the casing or liner to make a connection. Modern perforations are made using shaped explosive charges, similar to the armor-penetrating charge used on antitank rockets (bazookas).|$|E
2500|$|In {{hydraulic}} fracturing, well operators force water {{mixed with}} a variety of chemicals through the <b>wellbore</b> casing into the rock. The high pressure water breaks up or [...] "fracks" [...] the rock, which releases gas from the rock formation. Sand and other particles are added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the rock open, thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface. Chemicals are added to the fluid to perform such functions as reducing friction and inhibiting corrosion. After the [...] "frack," [...] oil or gas is extracted and nearly 30 percent to 70 percent of the frack fluid, i.e. the mixture of water, chemicals, sand, etc., flows back to the surface. Many gas-bearing formations also contain water, which will flow up the <b>wellbore</b> to the surface along with the gas, in both hydraulically fractured and non-hydraulically fractured wells. This produced water often has a high content of salt and other dissolved minerals that occur in the formation.|$|E
2500|$|This {{involves}} the injection of chemicals to eat away at any skin damage, [...] "cleaning up" [...] the formation, thereby improving {{the flow of}} reservoir fluids. [...] A strong acid (usually hydrochloric acid) is used to dissolve rock formations, but this acid does not react with the Hydrocarbons. As a result, the Hydrocarbons are more accessible. Acid {{can also be used}} to clean the <b>wellbore</b> of some scales that form from mineral laden produced water.|$|E
30|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{is defined as}} thermal energy in transit due to a spatial temperature difference to temperature differences (Bergman et al. 2011). As long as the temperature of <b>wellbores</b> and formations are unequal, energy exchange will take place, and the internal energy of the objects will change. Two dominate modes, conduction and convection transferred in <b>wellbores</b> during heat extraction process, are briefly discussed below.|$|R
30|$|At present, {{the study}} of {{supercritical}} water (SCW) flow in <b>wellbores</b> is at the starting stage. In this paper, a simple but useful model is developed to study the effect of seawater on the thermophysical properties of SCW in offshore vertical <b>wellbores.</b> Firstly, based on the momentum and energy balance equations, a flow model describing SCW flow in a tube is established. Then, coupled with transient heat transfer model in seawater and formation, and thermophysical parameters of SCW, a comprehensive mathematical model is established. In order to solve the model, the governing equations are expressed {{in the form of}} difference equations. The straight forward numerical method is adopted to solve the model from wellhead to well-bottom. In the process of solving, iterative technique is used to control the calculation accuracy. Finally, type curves of SCW flow in offshore <b>wellbores</b> and sensitivity analysis are discussed. Results show that (a) the flow of seawater results in a rapid decline in the temperature/enthalpy of SCW in <b>wellbores.</b> (b) Heat loss is the dominant factor of physical parameter distribution in <b>wellbores</b> when the injection rate is relatively small. (c) Heat loss has an obvious influence on temperature drop when SCW is sparse in volume. (d) The SCW pressure decreases with increasing of injection temperature.|$|R
30|$|It is {{observed}} from Fig.  5 b that (a) the density gradient in the seawater section of <b>wellbores</b> is always {{larger than that}} in the formation section of the <b>wellbores</b> under various values of injection pressure. (b) SCW density increases with increasing of SCW pressure. This is because the volume becomes smaller under a higher pressure. As a result, the flow velocity decreases with increasing of density.|$|R
