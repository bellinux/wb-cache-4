5|$|Captain Archer is {{confined}} in a Cargo bay, and the aliens are unconvinced that Enterprise carries no currency or valuable materials. They set-off {{to find the}} vault themselves, leaving Krem and Archer to transfer the loot. Archer sees Tucker and sends him to the launch-bay to retrieve the Ferengi's hypospray. Doing so, Tucker revives Sub-Commander T'Pol, and they {{try to find a}} <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Ferengi. She assumes the gas-machine was intentionally placed on the surface as a 'Trojan Horse'. In Sickbay, three of the four Ferengi search for the non-existent vault, and T'Pol uses a PADD to distract and then start an argument between them.|$|E

Towards the end of the game, players on each team acted with hostility towards each other, and several received personal foul penalties. The penalties had no effect on the final outcome of the game, and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and an automatic bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{decides to}} join Mulder in the game, {{and the two}} fight Maitreya together. Maitreya begins to {{duplicate}} herself, making the task of killing her more difficult. Finally, Maitreya sits atop a virtual tank and aims it at the agents. Phoebe admits there is one <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> game, but doing so will erase the entire program. Despite protests from Ivan, Phoebe gives Byers the kill command, effectively destroying Maitreya along with the game while saving Mulder and Scully. During Mulder's narration, we {{see that in the}} control room one of the monitors is still active. There, Ivan sees Maitreya's avatar, but with Scully's face.|$|E

5|$|Ignoring {{the events}} of the {{previous}} Doom games, the game is the first reboot to the series. Doom 3 is set in 2145 on Mars, where a military-industrial conglomerate has set up a scientific research facility to research into fields such as teleportation, biological research and advanced weapons design. However, the teleportation experiments inadvertently open a gateway to Hell, resulting in a catastrophic invasion by demons. The player, an anonymous space marine, must fight through the base and find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> demons attacking Mars. Doom 3 utilizes the id Tech 4 game engine, which has since been licensed out to other developers, and later released under the GNU General Public License in November 2011.|$|E

After its defeat, half-vampire and half-zombie creatures known as Vambees appear in the nearby village. While searching for a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Vambees, Musashi finds the Water Scroll and defeats its crest guardian in the basement where the Vambees originate. While Musashi searches for the Fire Scroll, Musashi's rival, Kojiro, kidnaps Princess Fillet and uses her as a hostage to force a battle with Musashi. Kojiro is defeated and Fillet is then rescued. Musashi then searches for thieves from the Thirstquencher Empire and {{makes his way to}} the next crest guardian. It is then revealed that Princess Fillet is actually one of Thirstquencher's thieves disguised and that the real Fillet is still in their hands. Musashi then continues his journey, finds the Wind Scroll, and defeats its crest guardian in an ants' nest.|$|E
5|$|Kirie and Shuichi {{devise a}} plan to escape Kurōzu-cho, but when they attempt to escape, their efforts are unsuccessful. After {{returning}} to the town, they discover that several {{years have passed since}} they left, as time speeds up away from the spiral. The other citizens have expanded the terraced houses until they connect into a single structure forming a spiral pattern. Kirie and Shuichi decide to search for Kirie's parents, which brings them {{to the center of the}} spiral. At the center, they fall down a pit, within which they discover the corpses of Kirie's parents and an ancient city completely covered with spiral patterns. Shuichi urges Kirie to move forward and find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> curse, but she replies that she does not have the strength and wishes to stay with him. The two embrace each other, and their bodies twist and wrap together as a result of the curse. As they lie together, Kirie notes that the curse ended at the same time it began, for just as time speeds up away from the center, it freezes at the center, and concludes that the curse is eternal, and all the events will repeat when a new Kurōzu-cho is built where the previous one laid.|$|E

50|$|The {{story begins}} with an immortal mystic named Aknaton, whose Osirosian race was the {{ancestor}} of all humanoid life in the Milky Way galaxy. The Osirosians were faced with a terrible threat, a race of destroying conquerors known as the Zygoteans.

The Osirosians withdrew to their heavily guarded world and considered other <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Zygotean menace.|$|R
5|$|Back on Earth, {{the world}} is {{suddenly}} terrorised by severe natural disasters, leading Aku Aku to conclude that Uka Uka is up to something. A confrontation with Uka Uka confirms his suspicions and nearly results in his destruction {{at the hands of}} the Elementals. Aku Aku returns to Crash and Coco Bandicoot and alerts them of the current situation, disclosing that the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Elementals is to imprison them once more with the Crystals, which have been scattered across the Earth. Using Coco's new Virtual Reality Hub System, Crash and Coco travel the world and gather the Crystals, fending off attacks from Cortex's superweapon, Crunch Bandicoot, and the Elementals along the way. However, by the time the Crystals have been gathered and the Elementals have been put in their hibernation state, Crunch's elemental powers have reached maximum capacity, forcing Crash to battle Crunch at full power in Cortex's space station. Nevertheless, Crash defeats Crunch, which releases him from Cortex's control. Infuriated by this failure, Uka Uka attacks Cortex with a fireball, only to have it hit a vital part of the space station, which causes a chain reaction that results in the space station's self-destruction. Crash, Aku Aku, and Crunch escape and return to the Bandicoot home on Coco's space fighter ship, while Cortex and Uka Uka deploy an escape pod and end up landing somewhere in Antarctica, where Uka Uka furiously chases Cortex around a small ice floe.|$|E
5|$|Tech's offense {{took the}} field at their 20-yard line with 1:53 {{remaining}} in the game, two timeouts left (used to stop the clock as necessary), and needing at least a field goal to win the game. Tech picked up one first down via a pass, then another as the Hokies drove to their 44-yard line. Stopped short of midfield {{with less than a}} minute to play, Tech called its second timeout in order to stop the game clock from ticking down. In college football, the clock stops after a team earns a first down, and because Virginia Tech had not earned a first down on the short run, Tech was forced to call the timeout. Following the timeout, the Hokies ran for a first down, penetrating to the NC State 44-yard line. With 53seconds remaining, Chapman scrambled out of bounds on a short run. Another short run brought the Hokies to the State 36-yard line, and the Hokies called their final timeout to stop the clock. A few plays later, Tech ran a short running play that kept the clock running down. With just 33seconds remaining and no other <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> clock, Tech's Maurice Williams questionably stayed down with a leg cramp and the referees stopped the clock to allow the injured player to receive assistance from athletic trainers before the next play. Facing fourth down and needing three yards for drive-continuing first down, Chapman passed for a first down at the State 29-yard line with 15seconds remaining in the game. On the game's next play, Tech committed a holding penalty, which pushed the Hokies 10yards further away from the end zone, out of field goal range, with 11seconds remaining.|$|E

50|$|To get {{the steel}} {{required}} by the German Ruhr industry, Germany was, in 1939-1940, dependent on shipments of Swedish iron ore, since access to the supplies from the mines in France, the traditional supplier, were cut off until the invasion of France. In 1939-1940 the Allies tried various <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> shipments of Swedish ore, for example by mining Norwegian territorial waters. Also, payments from the Allies reached in an agreement <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> sale of steel to Nazi Germany, which was broken, and the Germans were charged extortionate 'smugglers rates' for the steel.|$|R
50|$|Asthma {{accounts}} for one-quarter of all emergency room visits in the U.S. each year. It might {{come as a}} surprise to many that asthma results from the good intentions of the body, gone bad. Asthma can occur when T cells, the body's disease-fighting cells, respond to a stimulus and cause inflammation of the bronchial tubes, making breathing difficult. Michael Croft, Ph.D., and Institute President Mitchell Kronenberg, Ph.D., are studying <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> overzealous response from the immune system's T cells, which occurs due to contact with an external allergen such as those from pollen.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an attempt}} to protect the {{survivors}} and ward off the effects of consumption, bodies were exhumed and examined {{of those who had}} died of the disease. The corpse was deemed to be feeding on the living if it was determined to be unusually fresh, especially if the heart or other organs contained liquid blood. After the culprit was identified, {{there were a number of}} proposed <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> attacks. The most benign of these was simply to turn the body over in its grave. In other cases, families would burn the [...] "fresh" [...] organs and rebury the body; occasionally, the body would be decapitated. Affected family members would also inhale smoke from the burned organs or consume the ashes in a further attempt to cure the consumption.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{minimum wage}} laws were first passed in New Zealand and Australia in the 1890s.

Over time, minimum wages {{came to be seen}} as a way to help lower-income families. Most countries had introduced minimum wage legislation by the end of the 20th century.|$|E

Armed with Mauser rifles but wearing traditional uniforms, Dong's troops had threatened the foreign Legations in the fall of 1898 soon after arriving in Beijing, so much that troops from the United States Marine Corps had been called to Beijing to guard the legations. The German Kaiser Wilhelm II was so alarmed by the Chinese Muslim troops that he requested the Caliph Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire to find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Muslim troops from fighting.

The true Dark Genie has possessed Flag, and destroys the Sun Giant. However, the Genie's power proves too great for Flag's body, and he dies, leaving the Genie without a host. Toan and the crew are rescued by Dran, and the party pursue the Genie into the castle, where they encounter Seda, who tells them he is responsible for the existence of the Genie. He reveals he was King of the East, and was losing a war to the West. He was approached by a dark wizard, who offered him the power to win the war. However, after winning, the dark power remained in his body, and after a tragic loss, it was released {{in the form of the}} Genie. Seda learned the only thing strong enough to defeat the Genie was Atlamillia. However, no Atlamillia would exist for another 400 years, so he opened a portal to the future. He tells Toan the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Genie is to prevent his birth in the past, and opens the Gallery of Time to allow the party to travel back to the past.
