5|$|On 17 September 1374, Louis granted various {{concessions}} to the Polish nobility by the Privilege of Koszyce, {{in exchange for their}} promise that a daughter of his would succeed him and that he, Elizabeth or his mother could indicate which one. In Hungary, he focused on the centralization of power as means of ensuring that his daughters' rights would be respected. Securing marriage to one of the princesses was a priority in European royal courts. Mary <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> one year old when she was promised to Sigismund of Luxembourg. In 1374, Catherine was betrothed to Louis of France, but died towards the end of 1378. The same year, Hedwig, promised to William of Austria in a sponsalia de futuro, left her mother's court and moved to Vienna, where she spent the next two years. The Polish lords swore to uphold Mary's rights in 1379, while Sigismund received this recognition three years later. Elizabeth was present, along with her husband and mother-in-law, at a meeting in Zólyom on 12 February 1380, whereby Hungarian lords confirmed Hedwig's Austrian match; this indicates that Louis may have intended to leave Hungary to Hedwig and William.|$|E
25|$|The Queen's House, {{though it}} <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> being used, {{provided}} the distant focal centre for Sir Christopher Wren's Greenwich Hospital, with a logic and grandeur that has seemed inevitable to architectural historians {{but in fact}} depended on Mary II's insistence that the vista to {{the water from the}} Queen's House not be impaired.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, Gustav {{cannot be}} said to have been well educated, but he read widely; there <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> a French author of his day with whose works he was not intimately acquainted. His enthusiasm for the ideas of the French {{enlightenment}} was as sincere as that of his mother, if more critical.|$|E
50|$|Spondylidinae are insects characterised by cerambycine aspect, {{generally}} {{with a more}} or less flattened, dark body, oblique {{head and}} scarcely elongated antennae. Their sexual dimorphism <b>is</b> <b>scarcely</b> evident, that <b>i,s</b> males and females <b>are</b> <b>scarcely</b> distinguishable. Unlike Cerambycinae, their stridulitrum is divided.|$|R

25|$|It {{would be}} {{inaccurate}} {{to claim that}} {{a major part of}} the Townshend Acts had been repealed. The revenue-producing tea levy, the American Board of Customs and, most important, the principle of making governors and magistrates independent all remained. In fact, the modification of the Townshend Duties Act <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> any change at all.|$|E

He was usually concerned with France, but he also visited Normandy and Brittany, Flanders, Hainault and Holland, Scotland, Spain, Portugal, and Italy.|$|E
25|$|The National Cemeteries in the National Park System {{are closely}} related to the National Military Parks. The battle of Gettysburg <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> over when Governor Andrew Y. Curtin (Pennsylvania) hastened to the field to assist local {{residents}} in caring for the dead or dying. More than 6,000 soldiers had been killed in action, and among 21,000 wounded hundreds more died each day. Initially interred in improvised graves on the battlefield, Curtin approved plans for a Soldier's National Cemetery.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} areas of new {{settlement}} such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Brazil, New Zealand and Uruguay, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants. When it is considered that Argentina was {{second only to the}} United States (27million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such {{other areas of}} new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia; and that the country <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> populated following its independence, the impact of the immigration to Argentina becomes evident.|$|E
25|$|Spiritualists {{reacted with}} {{uncertainty}} to {{the theories of}} evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century. Broadly speaking, the concept of evolution fit the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time, however, {{a belief in the}} animal origins of man threatened the foundation of the immortality of the spirit, for if man had not been created, it <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> plausible that he would be specially endowed with a spirit. This led to spiritualists embracing spiritual evolution.|$|E
25|$|On August 24, 1970, near 3:40am, a bomb {{exploded}} next to Sterling Hall, aimed at destroying the Army Math Research Center.

The physics department was severely damaged, while the intended target, the AMRC, <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> affected. Karleton Armstrong, Dwight Armstrong, and David Fine were found responsible for the blast. Leo Burt was identified as a suspect, but was never apprehended or tried.|$|E

Not long ago her effects were auctioned off at the Hotel Drouot.

25|$|Bourne {{was one of}} {{the most}} indefatigable {{students}} and workers of his day. He <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> ever without pen and paper, or book, in hand, even at his meals. In addition to the constant demand on him for matter for his paper, he was incessantly preparing articles, and preparing books for the press, for the Harpers, the Appletons, and other publishers. Very few men surpassed him in the variety and extent of his literary acquirements. To great mathematical knowledge he added large attainments in philological lore, and as a linguist he ranked high.|$|E

25|$|At once, Leven, Fairfax and Manchester {{broke up}} the siege of York and moved out to meet him. But the prince, moving still at high speed, rode round their right flank via Boroughbridge and Thornton Bridge, and entered York on the north side. Newcastle tried to dissuade Rupert from fighting, but his record as a general <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> convincing as {{to the value of}} his advice. Rupert curtly replied that he had orders to fight, and the Royalists moved out towards Marston Moor on the morning of 2 July 1644.|$|E
25|$|In former {{times the}} {{questions}} had {{been devoted to}} many departments of knowledge, both sacred and profane, being concerned with halakic and exegetic themes {{as well as with}} ethical and philosophical problems, so that there <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> a subject of human activity or thought on which the responsa might not expatiate. In this period, on the other hand, the responsa were restricted almost entirely to legal regulations. Since the pronouncement of judgment was regarded as a religious duty, and since in most countries the Jews were unwilling to submit to a non-Jewish court, legal questions formed {{a large part of the}} responsa.|$|E
25|$|Neutralist Bataillon d'Infanterie 15 {{refused to}} {{participate}} in the operation. That left the Hmong Bataillon Guerrier 206 alone in its advance from the north. The other Neutralist unit, Bataillon Commando 208, <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> any more aggressive. However, the other Hmong in Bataillon Guerrier 201 and the Royalist paratroopers advanced. On 5 July, as 30 sorties each of USAF and RLAF air struck the communists, Hmong guerrillas were only five kilometers from the airfield. However, at least two PAVN battalions still blocked them. Meanwhile, pilots and road watch reconnaissance teams reported a steady flow of reinforcement from North Vietnam; they had counted eight more tanks incoming, as well as 1,000 trucks.|$|E

25|$|The {{environment}} where dolphins live makes experiments {{much more expensive}} and complicated than for many other species; additionally, the fact that cetaceans can emit and hear sounds (which {{are believed to be}} their main means of communication) in a range of frequencies much wider than that of humans means that sophisticated equipment, which <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> available in the past, is needed to record and analyse them. For example, clicks can contain significant energy in frequencies greater than 110 kHz (for comparison, it is unusual for a human to be able to hear sounds above 20 kHz), requiring that equipment have a sampling rates of at least 220kHz; MHz-capable hardware is often used.|$|E
25|$|Jennings {{was elected}} to the {{assembly}} again in 1880 as member for the Bogan and from January to July 1883 was vice-president of the executive council in the Stuart ministry. He was Colonial Secretary from October to December 1885 in the Dibbs ministry, and in February 1886 became the first practising Catholic Premier and was also Treasurer. His administration lasted only 11 months and had a troubled career, having inherited a financial crisis. His attempts to balance the budget included a 5 per cent ad valorem tariff, which came {{to be seen as a}} violation of his free-trade platform. Jennings <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> a strong enough man to control a ministry which included Dibbs, Want and Lyne.|$|E
25|$|The first American Methodist bishops were Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury, whose boyhood home, Bishop Asbury Cottage, in West Bromwich, England, {{is now a}} museum. Upon the {{formation}} of the Methodist Episcopal Church in America at the Baltimore Christmas Conference in 1784, Coke (already ordained in the Church of England) ordained Asbury a deacon, elder, and bishop each on three successive days. Circuit riders, many of whom were laymen, traveled by horseback to preach the gospel and establish churches until there <b>was</b> <b>scarcely</b> any crossroad community in America without a Methodist expression of Christianity. One of the most famous circuit riders was Robert Strawbridge who lived in the vicinity of Carroll County, Maryland soon after arriving in the Colonies around 1760.|$|E
