5|$|In the Ashvamedhika Parva {{the tale}} is narrated with some variation. Uttanka is {{described}} as a brahmin who belonged to the Bhrigu race that lived in a hermitage in the Maru desert. Uttanka was the disciple of the sage Gautama, whom he served for a hundred years. Uttanka was very dear to Gautama, who did not let him go even after Uttanka had completed his education. Uttanka grew old over time. One day Uttanka collapsed while carrying a huge bundle of firewood. Gautama's daughter cried looking at the sight. When called by his guru, Uttanka accosted Gautama, and <b>with</b> <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> his eyes asked him why he alone had been retained in the hermitage when thousands of other disciples had been discharged after training. Gautama restored Uttanka's youth, gave his daughter in marriage to Uttanka and then permitted him to leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{first hint}} of his death to the Soviet people came at 7:15 p.m. Moscow Time, when the usual {{television}} programs were altered and a pop music concert {{was replaced by a}} documentary on Vladimir Lenin. On Vremya, the Soviet Union's state television newscast, the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally informal dress code. At first, Soviet citizens believed it was Andrei Kirilenko who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the October Revolution a few days earlier (he died in 1990). Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an ice hockey game on Channel Two with Tchaikovsky's Pathétique symphony. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television hosts. The television announcement was read by Igor Kirillov <b>with</b> <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> his eyes at 11 a.m. Moscow Time.|$|E

25|$|In January 2006, Paxman was {{the subject}} of an episode of the BBC {{genealogy}} series Who Do You Think You Are?. The documentary concluded that he was descended from Roger Packsman, a 14th-century politician from Suffolk who had changed his name to Paxman in order to impress the electorate (pax being Latin for 'peace'). Paxman's maternal grandmother was born in Glasgow, Scotland. The programme generated much publicity before its transmission by displaying him <b>with</b> <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> his eyes on camera when informed that his impoverished great-grandmother Mary McKay's poor relief had been revoked because she had a child out of wedlock.|$|E

25|$|Ahalyoddharaṇam (Sanskrit: अहल्योद्धरणम्). Janaka fixes {{the day of}} Sītā's Svayaṃvara after {{counseling}} {{with his}} ministers and priests. Meanwhile, in Ayodhyā, Daśaratha starts thinking about Rāma's marriage. The sage Viśvāmitra is interrupted {{again and again in}} his sacrifice by the female demon Tāṭakā. Viśvāmitra arrives in Daśaratha's court and asks for Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa for protecting his sacrifice from demons. Daśaratha is reluctant and desolate at the thought of Rāma leaving him, but Vasiṣṭha convinces him to relent. Viśvāmitra takes Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to his forest where Rāma kills Tāṭakā when she attacks the three by raining trees and rocks at them. Viśvāmitra grants the two Vidyās names Balā and Atibalā to Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, which will enable them to survive without drinking, eating or sleeping. Viśvāmitra also surrenders all his divine weapons to Rāma. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa protect the sacrifice of Viśvāmitra for six days and six nights. On the seventh day, the demon brothers Mārīca and Subāhu attack the sacrifice with a large army. Rāma uses the Mānavāstra to throw the elder brother Mārīca across the ocean, while he burns Subāhu to death by the Āgneyāstra. In the meantime Lakṣmaṇa kills the entire army of demons. Viśvāmitra is freed from the fear of demons and decides to take Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to Mithilā for the Svayaṃvara of Sītā. On the way, Rāma sights Ahalyā, who has been cursed by her husband Gautama for her adulterous transgression, {{in the form of a}} rock. Viśvāmitra narrates the history of Ahalyā to Rāma. Rāma touches Ahalyā by his foot and Ahalyā is freed of her curse and sin. Ahalyā praises Rāma <b>with</b> <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> her eyes and departs to the abode of Gautama.|$|E

[...] "I remember the dear plump figure of Prince Lobkowitz going up to my husband," [...] Zita later recounted, [...] "and, <b>with</b> <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> his eyes, making {{the sign of the cross}} on Charles's forehead.

500|$|Galerius {{arrived in}} the city later in March. According to Lactantius, he came armed with plans to {{reconstitute}} the tetrarchy, force Diocletian to step down, and fill the Imperial office with men compliant to his will. Through coercion and threats, he eventually convinced Diocletian to comply with his plan. Lactantius also claims {{that he had done}} the same to Maximian at Sirmium. On 1 May 305, Diocletian called an assembly of his generals, traditional companion troops, and representatives from distant legions. They met at the same hill, [...] out of Nicomedia, where Diocletian had been proclaimed emperor. In front of a statue of Jupiter, his patron deity, Diocletian addressed the crowd. <b>With</b> <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> his eyes, he told them of his weakness, his need for rest, and his will to resign.

500|$|During production, Menzel and Jonathan Groff, who portrays Kristoff, {{went to the}} {{animation}} studio {{to explain to the}} animators how they were approaching their characters. Animators asked Menzel questions about her singing, observed how she breathed as she sang live, and made videorecordings of her recording sessions; they then animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing, for further realism. [...] Her voice supplied inspiration for Elsa's most prominent song, [...] "Let It Go". According to composer Robert Lopez, Menzel's vocal range was able to clearly convey Elsa's [...] "low, vulnerable, fragile side" [...] as well as her power and self-realization. Menzel commented that it was [...] "an honor" [...] to have the song and that she enjoyed recording it. [...] "It's a collision of a bunch of forces that are all coming together in the right way," [...] she explained. [...] "The character, what she is singing and what she is experiencing; beautiful lyrics, beautiful melody {{and a little bit of}} me." [...] Buck and Lee were also surprised by how compatible Menzel and Kristen Bell's voices were. At one point during a table read, they sang a ballad (later revealed as [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings") back and forth to one another with so much sentiment that it reportedly left everyone who was present <b>with</b> <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> their eyes. Subsequently, Lee wanted Menzel and Bell to be in the same room when they were recording the important emotional scenes of the film.|$|E

[...] Subsequently, a personal message left by Carey is shown, reading [...] "After every storm, if you look hard enough, a rainbow appears..." [...] Five testimonials from fans are shown, each telling of their own personal problems and hardships. In her testimonial, the third girl says [...] "I am fourteen years old, I'm a high school student, there is not one day that goes by that people don't make fun of me about my race. Its is about self-confidence, don't be afraid to dream." [...] After the last girl reads her message, Carey is shown lying on a sofa in her living room, watching a television. As she sadly sings, she watched as different empowering messages and events are shown on the screen. Of them, one shows Lance Armstrong riding a bicycle on the Tour de France, reading [...] "Lance Armstrong overcame cancer and won the Tour de France in 1999." [...] After the next scene, Carey is shown sitting on the sofa, <b>with</b> <b>tears</b> <b>in</b> her eyes, as they slowly escape her. During the end of the bridge, where she sings, [...] "Certainly the Lord will guide me," [...] Carey stands from the floor, and exits onto a large balcony overlooking the city. Rain begins to fall while Carey waves her arms as she cries out. Her depression is resolved when the rain stops and a rainbow forms, prompting her to smile.|$|E

500|$|... "Kiss n Tell"'s lyrics {{depict a}} tale of the [...] ""slutty" [...] ex of [...] {{spreading}} his wild oats around the town". The writing of the song came about after Kesha discovered that her boyfriend was cheating on her with a famous pop starlet. [...] "Kiss n Tell" [...] is a dance-pop track that features standard elements of [...] "party pop" [...] music that is prominent on Animal. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Kiss n Tell" [...] is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate beat rate of 144 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of E Major and Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G3 to the note of B4. [...] "Stephen" [...] is opened in [...] "Kansas-style vocal harmonies" [...] as Kesha sings about an unattainable lover depicting their story. [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] combines heavy use of Auto-Tune with drum machines while infusing hints of R. Lyrically, [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] depicts a woman who would rather have sex than listen to a man speak. [...] "Dinosaur" [...] features a whistle-synth infused backing while the lyrics describe the story of older men hitting on younger girls. [...] "Party at a Rich Dude's House" [...] is reminiscent of music from the 1980s which according to Jeffries could have appeared on the soundtrack to the 1982 film Fast Times at Ridgemont High. [...] "Dancing <b>with</b> <b>Tears</b> <b>in</b> My Eyes" [...] is an upbeat pop-rock ballad; one of {{a small minority of}} tracks to incorporate Guitars in the instrumental, as Kesha tried to exclude the style from the album. [...] "Boots & Boys" [...] is a [...] "lusty" [...] song reminiscent of INXS's [...] "Suicide Blonde", but from a female point of view.|$|E
