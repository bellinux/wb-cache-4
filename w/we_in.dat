5|$|In late 2011 Madonna {{was busy}} {{with the release of}} her film W.E. and with {{recording}} her twelfth studio album, MDNA. The singer was reportedly signed by the NFL for the Super Bowl halftime show, and in December the league confirmed that Madonna would perform in the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The game was scheduled for February 5, 2012, and its organizers continued their practice of inviting global musicians to perform. Artists who had previously performed in the show included the Black Eyed Peas, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, U2, Paul McCartney and Prince. The show coincided with the release of <b>W.E.</b> <b>in</b> United States.|$|E

25|$|Why do <b>we</b> <b>in</b> this feast carry candles? Because the Gentiles {{dedicated}} {{the month}} of February to the infernal gods, and as {{at the beginning of}} it Pluto stole Proserpine, and her mother Ceres sought her in the night with lighted candles, so they, {{at the beginning of the}} month, walked about the city with lighted candles. Because the holy fathers could not extirpate the custom, they ordained that Christians should carry about candles in honor of the Blessed Virgin; and thus what was done before in the honor of Ceres is now done in honor of the Blessed Virgin.|$|E

We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang them and we danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us....

500|$|When Teddy Kollek, then {{mayor of}} Jerusalem, had learned of Kahn's plans {{to design the}} Hurva at a scale {{comparable}} to the Dome of the Rock and the Kotel, the mayor was unsupportive and stated: [...] "Should <b>we</b> <b>in</b> the Jewish Quarter have a building of major importance which 'competes' with the Mosque and the Holy Sepulcher and should <b>we</b> <b>in</b> general have any building which would compete in importance with the Western Wall of the Temple?" [...] Kollek was also concerned with the impact such a monumental temple may have in the Old City. Kahn's model was displayed in the Israel Museum, but his plan was shelved {{when he died in}} 1974. Kent Larson later referred to Kahn's proposal as [...] "the greatest of the unbuilt".|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of Labour's second defeat at the Scottish Parliament {{election}} of May 2011, which saw the Scottish National Party (SNP) form its first majority government, Gray announced his intention to step down {{as leader of the}} Labour MSPs later that year. A review chaired by Jim Murphy and Sarah Boyack into the party's structure in Scotland subsequently concluded that the next leader should lead the entire Scottish Labour Party rather than just its MSPs, as previous leaders had. Lamont declared her candidacy for the leadership election in September 2011 and launched her campaign on 7 November at Stirling University. She told delegates that Labour needed to reengage with the electorate if it wanted to govern again: [...] "We must listen and learn, show humility and seek again to talk for and to people's ambitions and concerns.
