The maintenance problems associated with <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> the WWW are examined.

40|$|A {{relevant}} {{consequence of}} {{the expansion of the}} web and e-commerce is the growth of the demand of new <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> <b>web</b> applications. As a result, <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> applications are usually developed without a formalized process, and web pages are directly coded in an incremental way, where new pages are obtained by duplicating existing ones. Duplicated web pages, having the same structure and just differing for the data they include, can be considered as clones. The identification of clones may reduce the effort devoted to test, maintain <b>and</b> evolve <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> applications. Moreover, clone detection among different <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> aims to detect cases of possible plagiarism. In this paper we propose an approach. based on similarity metrics, to detect duplicated pages in <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> applications, implemented with HTML language and ASP technology. The proposed approach has been assessed by analyzing several <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> <b>and</b> <b>Web</b> applications. The obtained results are reported in the paper with respect to some case studies...|$|R
