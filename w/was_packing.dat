5|$|Cameron {{was one of}} six {{candidates}} {{elected as}} aldermen to Edmonton's first town council in 1892; he received the fifth most votes of the fourteen candidates. He was defeated in his 1893 re-election bid, in which he finished seventh of nine candidates. He briefly returned to the council after being elected again in 1895, but did not seek re-election the following year and remained out of politics thereafter. During his first term on the council, {{he was involved in}} an altercation in which the dominion government had made a decision to Dominion Land Office from Edmonton to Strathcona, at the time a separate town, south of the North Saskatchewan River. When news of the decision and crews to execute it arrived in Edmonton, angry citizens descended on the office and tore to pieces the wagon that the officer <b>was</b> <b>packing</b> with records for transportation. Led by mayor Matthew McCauley, Cameron was {{part of a group of}} prominent citizens that headed the resistance, eventually leading to the dominion reversing its decision.|$|E
5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili <b>was</b> <b>packing</b> around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E
25|$|Elliott and Weatherston had {{a romantic}} {{relationship}} which lasted around six months and ended before her death. In court, witnesses described the relationship as troubled. Weatherston had been an economics lecturer at the University of Otago, and also taught Elliott, who completed an honours degree in economics. On the day she died, she <b>was</b> <b>packing</b> to relocate to Wellington the next day, and start {{a job at the}} New Zealand Treasury.|$|E

He wore the same type of clothing year round: a boiled white shirt, heavy woolen pants, riding boots and no socks. When he had business to conduct, he added a collar, tie and a French hat to his apparel.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{win over}} Chicago, Giants coach Bill Parcells {{mentioned}} travel arrangements {{in a team}} meeting during the week. Since the customary week off before the Super Bowl for this season {{was not on the}} schedule, Parcells told the team prior to leaving for Newark Airport that they had two packing options: either pack just for the trip to San Francisco, or pack for that trip and a second trip to Tampa. He then showed the team he <b>was</b> <b>packing</b> for both trips as a motivational tactic.|$|E
25|$|The label was {{originally}} known as The Shinoda Imprint, named after Mike Shinoda. Machine Shop {{was born in}} drummer Rob Bourdon's living room in 1999 when the band <b>was</b> <b>packing</b> CDs and stickers into boxes to send to their very first fans. The label only {{had the potential to}} release the extended plays for the bands fan club annually. Shinoda wanted to release albums of Linkin Park under the label, but the albums were already managed by the parent company Warner Bros. Records, and managing the albums on his alone basis was a difficult job. The first release under the label was for the fan club, LP Underground 2.0, which was released on November 18, 2002. The label also made available some enhanced features, such as T-shirts, sticker, key-chain, a band picture, guitar pick and membership card. The album was co produced by Don Gilmore with Shinoda. On November 17, 2003, the label released another extended play for the LPU fan club, entitled LP Underground 3.0, which featured the unreleased songs in the live album Live in Texas (which was released on November 18, 2003 through the record label).|$|E

50|$|De Bruijn's theorem states that, if a {{harmonic}} brick <b>is</b> <b>packed</b> into a box, {{then the}} box {{must be a}} multiple of the brick. For instance, the three-dimensional harmonic brick with side lengths 1, 2, and 6 can only <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> into boxes in {{which one of the}} three sides is a multiple of six and one of the remaining two sides is even. Packings of a harmonic brick into a box may involve copies of the brick that are rotated with respect to each other. Nevertheless, the theorem states that the only boxes that can <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> in this way are boxes that could also <b>be</b> <b>packed</b> by translates of the brick.|$|R

500|$|The {{neighbours}} {{noticed an}} unusual, unpleasant smell. Webster spoke later {{of how she}} was [...] "greatly overcome, both from the horrible sight before me and the smell". However, the activity at 2 Mayfield Cottages {{did not seem to}} be out of the ordinary, as it was customary in many households for the washing to begin early on Monday morning. Over the next couple of days, Webster continued to clean the house and Thomas' clothes and put on a show of normality for people who called for orders. Behind the scenes, she <b>was</b> <b>packing</b> Thomas' dismembered remains into a black Gladstone bag and a corded wooden bonnet-box. She was unable to fit the murdered woman's head and one of the feet into the containers and disposed of them separately, throwing the foot onto a rubbish heap in Twickenham. The head was buried under the Hole in the Wall pub's stables a short distance from Thomas' house, where it was found 131 years later.|$|E
500|$|Metropolis Records {{announced}} in mid-2006 it would reissue KMFDM's entire Wax Trax!-era studio album back catalog, {{which had been}} out of print since the early 2000s. The albums were released in chronological order in groups of two or three from September 2006 to May 2007. Konietzko said the remastering was done over concerns about losing the rights to the back catalog after TVT defaulted on a loan, explaining, [...] "The original agreement was that the catalog would have reverted back to me in 2008, anyway, but TVT and Rykodisc were thinking of just making a KMFDM compilation, which would have eliminated my catalog, and I didn't want that." [...] Konietzko commented in 2006 that the current line-up was the best he had worked with, and said in a separate interview that his former bandmates were [...] "looking at me for handouts". Konietzko {{announced in}} October 2007 that he <b>was</b> <b>packing</b> up and moving back to Germany in the next three months.|$|E
500|$|When Edmonton was {{incorporated}} as a town on January 9, 1892, it {{held its first}} election in 1892 with McCauley acclaimed as mayor as no other candidates had put their names forth. Among his concerns during his first term were to [...] "establish order" [...] among the scattered shacks near the trading post, and widening various streets around the town, in preparation for what he envisioned {{in the future of}} Edmonton becoming a [...] "busy metropolitan". He was re-acclaimed in 1893 and 1894 before stepping aside voluntarily after his third term, never having been contested in an election. During his term as mayor, the Canadian government decided to move the Dominion Land Office from Edmonton to Strathcona, which was then a separate community, {{on the south side of}} the North Saskatchewan River. Upon the arrival of government agents to carry out the move, citizens quickly set up a resistance. Headed by McCauley and a group of prominent citizens including councillor John Cameron, Angry Edmontonians descended on the office, cut horses loose and tore to pieces the wagon that the officer <b>was</b> <b>packing</b> with records for transportation. The situation escalated quickly, becoming heated, from which McCauley called on the people to relent as they would request reconsideration from Ottawa. Later that same day, the decision was reversed. In 1893, he went to Ottawa to enter negotiations with the federal government for a street railway system. McCauley was successful, and the system became the first in the west. He also advocated for federal government assistance in building a railway bridge over the North Saskatchewan River for the existing Edmonton-Calgary rail connection, which was completed in 1900. McCauley also saw Edmonton's need for a hospital, and consequently established what later became Grey Nuns Hospital, arranging for the Grey Nuns to establish at the town, along with a nurse.|$|E
