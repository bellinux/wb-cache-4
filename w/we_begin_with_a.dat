25|$|A more {{sophisticated}} method, described by Redelmeier, {{has been used}} by many authors as a way of not only counting polyominoes (without requiring that all polyominoes of order n be stored in order to enumerate those of order n+1), but also proving upper bounds on their number. The basic idea is that <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single square, and from there, recursively add squares. Depending on the details, it may count each n-omino n times, once from starting from each of its n squares, or may be arranged to count each once only.|$|E
