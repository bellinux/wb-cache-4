50|$|Now {{the real}} art work begins as he applies {{different}} colored glazes over the gold scene. The glaze {{is made from}} a mixture of oil paint diluted with paint thinner, and the glazes vary in consistency {{depending on how much}} of the gold Martin wants to expose. Martin also uses <b>water</b> <b>spotting</b> to create a natural age to his leaves and stems, which dulls down their pristine appearance. Each of these pieces is signed, numbered, and dated and forms part of a limited edition available through Martin Pierce, or through a design professional.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine some agronomical properties and fastnesses of dyeing (against light, abrasion and dry and wet <b>water</b> <b>spotting)</b> with Anthemis tinctoria, which is a perennial herb, used as traditional dyeing in many places of the world. The fi eld experiment was laid out in a randomised block design with three replications and four plant densities (20 x 10 (500. 000 plant/ha), 20 x 20 (250. 000 plant/ha), 40 x 10 (250. 000 plant/ha), 40 x 20 (125. 000 plant/ha), 60 x 10 (166. 600 plant/ha) and 60 x 20 cm (83. 300 plant/ha) were used, respectively. In the field trial, fl ower diameter length varied between 1. 53 - 1. 84 mm, fresh fl ower head yield varied between 2. 42 - 14. 19 kg. ha- 1 and dry fl ower head yield varied between 0. 9 - 3. 61 t. ha- 1. For dyeing, alum of aluminium, copper-sulphate, zincchloride, potassium-bichromate, sodium chloride, sodium sulphate, sodium sulphite and iron-sulphate were used as mordant. A total of 25 dyeing treatments were performed, and very different colours and their tons were obtained...|$|E

5000|$|A <b>water</b> <b>spot</b> {{is an area}} {{of dried}} mineral {{deposits}} left on a surface after being allowed to air dry. Water quality, specifically the amount and type of minerals in the local water supply as measured by the total suspended solids or TSS test and other mineral levels such as sodium level, has a big effect on how severe <b>water</b> <b>spots</b> can be, for example on an automobile or dishes. <b>Water</b> <b>spots</b> can be avoided by drying after washing using a [...] "shammy" [...] cloth or towel for a car and a good drying cycle in a dishwasher, or by manual drying or good drainage after manually washing dishes.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} on the art work entitled “Eksplorasi Gerak Air Dalam Visualisasi Fotografi Still Life” (The Exploration of Water Movement in Photography Visualization Still Life” aims to create a photography work with the object of <b>water</b> <b>spot</b> that quickly moves and forms a certain pattern that cannot be caught by eyes, that is then paused {{so that it can}} be enjoyed in detail by high speed technique. The research uses experimental approach. It is executed through two stages covering analysis and development. The analysis includes identification and studies on the research object including water movement or <b>water</b> <b>spot</b> and the material forming a certain pattern as an object of photography. The method of photography creating Still Life covers three stages: exploration, planning, and realization. The result shows that firstly, the beauty of the photograph Still Life with the object of <b>water</b> <b>spot</b> can be caught and seen by eyes with high speed technique. Secondly, the image of water movement that is freezed can produces visual element and aesthetic effect by adding the light of lamp in the background at the time the photograph is taken.
