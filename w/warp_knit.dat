40|$|Single-layered <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics were {{produced}} by the 60 D/ 36 F (containing 36 filaments) polyester yarn with differential shrinkage (DS) property in this study. Due to the differential shrinkage property, the fabric becomes curly and bulkier, simulating cotton fabric {{in terms of its}} appearance and fabric handle. The performance and appearance of these DS polyester <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics were evaluated objectively and subjectively. The testing results demonstrated that the DS polyester <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabric had better abrasion property, worse pilling resistance due to the mechanical property of polyester yarn when compared with 100 % cotton <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabric. Meanwhile, lower water vapour permeability and air resistance were found for DS polyester <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabric resulting from the dense structure of yarn shrinkage after heat-moisture treatment. Besides, the fabric handle was evaluated by Kawabata evaluation system and subject to trial under dry and wet fabric condition. DS polyester <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics provide better recovery under low stress mechanical pressure. The subjective evaluation result shows that the <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics made of DS polyester had similar handle against cotton <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabric in terms of prickle, smooth, comfort and dry feeling in both dry and wet testing conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Cotton fiber {{is a type}} {{of natural}} fibers. Using natural fibers to {{fabricate}} textile can not only decrease the consumption of synthetic fibers, but also reduce the environmental pollution. This study aims to fabricate elastic knitted fabrics and evaluate their properties. Polyester (PET) filaments and rubber threads serve as the warp while cotton yarn serves as the weft for <b>warp</b> <b>knitting.</b> A crochet machine makes the warp and weft into <b>warp</b> <b>knits</b> with desirable stretchability, during which the amount (single/double) and the ply number (1 -, 2 -, and 3 -ply) of the weft are further varied. The resulting <b>warp</b> <b>knits</b> are evaluated for water absorption, air permeability, and mechanical properties. As demonstrated by the experimental results, the <b>warp</b> <b>knits</b> with single 1 -ply weft (S 1) yield an optimal air permeability of 224. 6 cm 3 /cm 2 /s and stiffness along the warp direction of 4. 74 cm. The <b>warp</b> <b>knits</b> with single 2 -ply weft (S 2) display an optimal tearing strength of 86 N while the <b>warp</b> <b>knits</b> with double 3 -ply weft (D 3 / 3) has an optimal tensile strength of 708 N...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{varieties}} of knitting: weft <b>knitting</b> and <b>warp</b> <b>knitting.</b> In the more common weft knitting, the wales are perpendicular to {{the course of the}} yarn. In <b>warp</b> <b>knitting,</b> the wales and courses run roughly parallel. In weft knitting, the entire fabric may be produced from a single yarn, by adding stitches to each wale in turn, moving across the fabric as in a raster scan. By contrast, in <b>warp</b> <b>knitting,</b> one yarn is required for every wale. Since a typical piece of knitted fabric may have hundreds of wales, <b>warp</b> <b>knitting</b> is typically done by machine, whereas weft knitting is done by both hand and machine. [...] Warp-knitted fabrics such as tricot and milanese are resistant to runs, and are commonly used in lingerie.|$|R

In the present study, composites prepared from four types of directionally oriented <b>warp</b> <b>knit</b> glass preforms with three different thermoset resins have been considered for the tribological characterisation. The tribological tests have been conducted on a reciprocating sliding test rig with ball-on-plate configuration.

The crystallization of PP carried out in nonisothermal and isothermal regimes is facilitated in the presence of GF, and the additional effects of PET fibers are also shown. Better conditions for nucleation, resulting in lower energy for formation of a stable nucleus and lower critical dimensions, are proposed as a reason for this.

40|$|The loop {{configuration}} that {{is obtained}} in the knit depends on both qualitative and quantitative factors, {{the most important of}} which is the loop length.

40|$|Resin film {{infusion}} (RFI) is {{a cost-effective}} method for fabricating stiffened aircraft wing structures. The RFI process {{lends itself to}} the use of near net shape textile preforms manufactured through a variety of automated textile processes such as knitting and braiding. Often, these advanced fiber architecture preforms have through-the-thickness stitching for improved damage tolerance and delamination resistance. The challenge presently facing RFI is to refine the process to ensure complete infiltration and cure of a geometrically complex shape preform with the high fiber volume fraction needed for structural applications. An accurate measurement of preform permeability is critical for successful modeling of the RFI resin infiltration process. Small changes in the permeability can result in very different infiltration behavior and times. Therefore, it is important to accurately measure the permeabilities of the textile preforms used in the RFI process. The objective of this investigation was to develop test methods {{that can be used to}} measure the compaction behavior and permeabilities of high fiber volume fraction, advanced fiber architecture textile preforms. These preforms are often highly compacted due to through-the-thickness stitching used to improve damage tolerance. Test fixtures were designed and fabricated and used to measure both transverse and in-plane permeabilities. The fixtures were used to measure the permeabilities of multiaxial <b>warp</b> <b>knit</b> and triaxial braided preforms at fiber volume fractions from 55 % to 65 %.
