Earlier in November 2013, the authorities received criticism for the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> planned and handled the crackdown on illegal workers. Saudi authorities – in some cases {{with the help of}} citizens – rounded up many of illegal workers and physically abused them.|$|E

There have been donations to the Justgiving page every day since the campaign's launch, and by 9 January 2009 the total had surpassed £140,000. The BHA has reported a flood of interest in its activities and the Atheist Bus Campaign Facebook group has been growing rapidly since the launch. Many atheists feel the campaign has given them a voice and represented them in a <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> long hoped for.|$|E
25|$|In the Mark Millar penned Fantastic Four 566-569, Doom {{received}} a significant power upgrade. He was thrown {{back in time}} (perhaps about 50million years) by the Marquis of Death. Doom then fought through time and space {{to get back to}} the present to seek revenge on the Marquis of Death. Doom stated, as he killed the Marquis, he had rebuilt every molecule of his being and increased his power all to destroy the Marquis. In later issues, this seems to have been ignored, however, with writers treating Doctor Doom the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> always before in terms of power, the arc later retroactively being said to have been a dream had by Valeria Richards.|$|E

25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review for PopMatters, Chris Conaton expressed disappointment in the album's predictability, noting, [...] "At this point it’s {{pretty clear that}} the band is comfortably ensconced in their lifestyle and content to just keep doing things the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been for years." [...] In a lukewarm review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek observed, [...] "there is something here for virtually every fan -- or detractor -- to grab hold of." [...] Sputnikmusic criticized Mangini's drum parts, describing them as [...] "bland", {{as well as the}} decision to include three ballads, but ultimately gave the album an overall positive review.|$|E
500|$|After this point, {{the story}} {{continues}} differently {{depending on the}} Hero's alignment. If it is [...] "law", the Law Hero gets killed in a battle with the Chaos Hero, while the Hero and the Heroine go to the basement. On their <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to kill the Chaos Hero and fight Yuriko, who {{turns out to be}} the demon Lilith in disguise; she calls the Hero [...] "Adam", and says she wanted to create a new age and live with him forever, which is why she tried to execute the Heroine. After defeating her in battle, the Hero and the Heroine reach the basement and kill the demon Asura-ou; they then go to the cathedral's roof, where they are thanked by a messenger from God. If the Hero's alignment instead is [...] "chaos", he and the Heroine must go to the top floor and kill the archangel Michael, and on their way kill the Law Hero; the Chaos Hero dies, too, because of the magical ring he has been wearing. On the roof, they meet Lucifer, who says that a new era will begin, where both demons and humans are free; he also warns them that God still is alive. If the Hero's alignment instead is [...] "neutral", he and the Heroine must kill the Law Hero, the Chaos Hero, Asura-ou, and Michael, and fight Yuriko. On the roof, they meet Taishang Laojun, who thanks them and says that balance is needed to achieve happiness; he asks the Hero and the Heroine to lead humanity to a future that doesn't rely on gods or demons. The game ends with the Heroine saying that those who have died will be reborn, and that it is time for creation and rebuilding.|$|E

2500|$|The {{absence of}} any ICC ruling about matches played before 1947 (or before 1895 in Great Britain) is {{problematic}} for those cricket statisticians who wish to categorise earlier matches in the same <b>way.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> responded by compiling their own match lists and allocating a strictly unofficial first-class status to the matches they consider to have been of a high standard. It is therefore a matter of opinion only with no official support. Inevitable differences have arisen and there are variations in published cricket statistics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{importance}} of the story lies in any case {{not so much in}} its reconstruction of events than in its depiction of the Parsis - in the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> come to view themselves - and in their relationship to the dominant culture. As such, the text plays a crucial role in shaping Parsi identity. But, [...] "even if one comes {{to the conclusion that the}} chronicle based on verbal transmission is not more than a legend, it still remains without doubt an extremely informative document for Parsee historiography." ...|$|E

The tail has 12 feathers and may be deeply forked, somewhat indented, or square-ended. [...] A long tail increases maneuverability, and may also function as a sexual adornment, since the tail is frequently longer in males. [...] In barn swallows {{the tail of the}} male is 18% longer than those of the female, and females will select mates on the basis of tail length.|$|E

2500|$|A third {{controversy}} concerns persons (whether born Jews or {{converts to}} Judaism) who have converted to another religion. The traditional view is such persons remain Jewish. Reform Judaism regards such people as apostates, and states regarding Messianic Jews: [...] "'Messianic Jews' {{claim that they}} are Jews, but we must asked [...] ourselves whether we identify them as Jews. We can not do so as they consider Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah who has fulfilled the Messianic promises. In this <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> clearly placed themselves within Christianity. They may be somewhat different from other Christians as they follow various Jewish rites and ceremonials, {{but that does not}} make them Jews." [...] Regardless, such people do not count as Jewish {{for the purposes of the}} Israeli citizenship laws.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Entertainment Weekly {{listed the}} show at #19 in the [...] "25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25Years", saying, [...] "Supernatural began with a pretty {{straightforward}} premise – hot guys kill spooky things – but it didn't stay that way for long. The characters have literally been to hell and back, and along the <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> woven a complicated and compelling mythology filled with friends (angel Castiel), recurring foes (demon Crowley), and inside jokes (Wincest!). Supernatural has also, however, dedicated episodes to mocking the sillier aspects of its own existence, like its hypercritical fandom. This self-referential approach has rewarded longtime viewers and helped build a community so passionate, it's almost scary." [...] The show has a broad demographic base and is more popular in Russia than the US.|$|E
2500|$|The popular German musical group Rammstein has {{acknowledged}} influence {{by both the}} aesthetic approach and material of Laibach. When members of Laibach were asked by an interviewer about Rammstein [...] "stealing" [...] from them, they responded that [...] "Laibach {{does not believe in}} originality... Therefore, Rammstein could not 'steal' much from us. They simply let themselves get inspired by our work, which is absolutely a legitimate process. We are glad that they made it. In a <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> proven once again that a good 'copy' can make more money on the market than the 'original'. Anyhow, today we share the territory: Rammstein seem {{to be a kind of}} Laibach for adolescents and Laibach are Rammstein for grown-ups" [...] Laibach would later provide a remix for the Rammstein single Ohne Dich.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{been adopted}} into Japanese, a single kanji {{may be used}} to write one or more {{different}} words – or, in some cases, morphemes – and thus the same character may be pronounced in different ways. From {{the point of view of}} the reader, kanji are said to have one or more different [...] "readings". Although more than one reading may become activated in the brain, deciding which reading is appropriate depends on recognizing which word it represents, which can usually be determined from context, intended meaning, whether the character occurs as part of a compound word or an independent word, and sometimes location within the sentence. For example, [...] is usually read kyō, meaning [...] "today", but in formal writing is instead read konnichi, meaning [...] "nowadays"; this is understood from context. Nevertheless, some cases are ambiguous and require a furigana gloss, which are also used simply for difficult readings or to specify a non-standard reading.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Sanjan {{group are}} {{believed}} to have been the first permanent settlers, the precise date of their arrival is a matter of conjecture. All estimates are based on the Qissa, which is vague or contradictory with respect to some elapsed periods. Consequently, three possible dates – 936, 765 and 716 – have been proposed as the year of landing, and the disagreement has been the cause of [...] "many an intense battle ... amongst Parsis". Since dates are not specifically mentioned in Parsi texts prior to the 18th century, any date of arrival is perforce a matter of speculation. The importance of the Qissa lies in any case not so much in its reconstruction of events than in its depiction of the Parsis – in the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> come to view themselves – and in their relationship to the dominant culture. As such, the text plays a crucial role in shaping Parsi identity.

2500|$|In 2004, Hagen {{delivered}} {{a speech at}} a convention of the independent Christian organisation Levende Ord, where he stated that [...] "we Christians are very much concerned with children. Jesus said, let the small children come to me. I can't understand that Muhammad could have said the same. In the case {{that he could have}} said the same, it would have been: Let the small children come to me, so that I can exploit them in my struggle to Islamify the world." [...] He also said that if Israel lost the fight in the Middle East, Europe would [...] "bow under to Islam," [...] if Muslim fundamentalists get it as they want. [...] "They have, {{in the same manner as}} Hitler, long ago made it clear that the long-term plan is to Islamify the world. They have come a long <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> pierced deep into Africa, and have come a long way into Europe – and then we have to fight back." [...] He was because of the speech criticised by politicians and religious leaders within Norway. Some days later, the ambassadors of Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and Morocco, and chargé d'affaires of Tunisia made an unusually strong attack on Hagen in a letter in the newspaper Aftenposten.|$|E

It was as if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> dropped from the skies in the night upon that Cornish coast, and but for the mark of their swift, silent passage, but for the absence of Rosamund and Lionel Tressilian, the thing must have been accounted no more than a dream of those few who had witnessed it.|$|R

2500|$|On 5 October 2014, it was {{announced}} that West would be leaving the show in a [...] "dramatic" [...] storyline. Dominic Treadwell-Collins, executive producer, said of West's departure, [...] "When you have an actor of Tim's calibre joining your cast, you treasure every day that you have him - and we knew from the start that Stan's stay {{with the rest of the}} Carter family would be a finite one. But what a stay - and as we draw towards Stan's exit from the show, the audience should get ready as one of Britain's finest actors pulls out all the stops and gives his King Lear..." [...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. My old man is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - he wants me to smother him." [...] The prostate cancer began taking its effect on Stan's health on 23 January 2015 when Stan collapses in mid-commotion. Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly said I could have some time out and they would send me to South Africa or prison. But I suggested something finite like death so they decided it would be good for me to have a disease of which I would know about and one where it could be arranged for me to die in six months' time." ...|$|E
