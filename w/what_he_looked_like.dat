5|$|Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch, a {{linguist}} and cartographer at the Smithsonian who {{was recruited}} to decipher The Shepherd's Journal while directing {{an expedition to}} Atlantis. Kirk Wise, one of the directors, said that they chose Fox for the role because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made them more believable on screen. Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his past experience with live action {{because he did not}} have to worry about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> in front of a camera while delivering his lines. The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A.E.; he allowed his son to choose which film he would work on, and he chose Atlantis. Viewers have noted similarities between Milo and the film's language consultant, Marc Okrand, who developed the Atlantean language used in the film. Okrand stated that Milo's supervising animator, John Pomeroy, sketched him, claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted.|$|E
25|$|Gudea's {{appearance}} is recognizable today {{because he had}} numerous statues or idols, depicting him with unprecedented, lifelike realism, placed in temples throughout Sumer. Gudea took advantage of artistic development because he evidently wanted posterity to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> And in that he has succeeded—a feat available to him as royalty, {{but not to the}} common people who could not afford to have statues engraved of themselves.|$|E
500|$|King {{initially}} named Donald DeFreeze, lead kidnapper in the Patty Hearst case, as {{his inspiration}} for Randall Flagg. According to King, {{he remembered the}} Patty Hearst case {{when he began to}} write a description of DeFreeze: [...] "Donald DeFreeze is a dark man". He remembered that in photographs of the bank robbery in which Patty Hearst participated that DeFreeze was only partially visible, hidden under a large hat. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> was based on guesses made by people who only saw a portion of him. This inspired King, who then wrote [...] "A dark man with no face". After reading [...] "Once in every generation the plague will fall among them", King began writing The Stand and developing the character of Randall Flagg.|$|E

2500|$|The People's Republic of China, just {{ending a}} war with Vietnam, gave Hui {{permission}} to film on Hainan Island. [...] Boat People was the first Hong Kong movie filmed in Communist China. Hui saved a role for Chow Yun-Fat, but because at that time Hong Kong actors working in mainland China were banned in Taiwan, Chow Yun-Fat declined the role out of fear for being blacklisted. Six months before filming was set to start, and after the film crew were already on location in Hainan, a cameraman suggested that Hui give the role to Andy Lau. [...] At that time, Andy Lau was still a newcomer in the Hong Kong film industry. Hui gave Lau the role and flew him to Hainan before a proper audition or even seeing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E

50|$|Georg Hackl (born 9 September 1966) is a German former luger who {{was three}} time Olympic and World Champion.

60|$|He {{tried to}} tell them what he had seen; he could only make out that it must be the same boy, but now he had his clothes on: white linen pantaloons and roundabout, like what you had on May day, or the Fourth {{if you were going to}} the Sunday-school picnic. Dave wanted him to tell <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> but Jake could not say {{anything}} except that he was very smiling-looking, and seemed as if he would like to be with him; Jake said he was just going to hollo for him to come over when the rainbow began to go out; and then the fellow slipped back into the woods; it was more like melting into the woods.|$|E
50|$|Fuzzy22 {{has asked}} Jen {{to meet him}} in person, to which she reluctantly agrees, though Jen is very nervous - she and Fuzzy22 had agreed to not {{exchange}} any identifying information, so {{she has no idea}} how old <b>he</b> is, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> or if <b>he</b> is male or female.|$|R

40|$|It&# 039;s just {{basically}} {{some of my}} favourites that&# 039;s on here.

That&# 039;s why I&# 039;ve called my bear Sal because <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> him. And basically the rest of it I went to France in the World Cup, just the memorabilia, that which is round my neck there, because I write a lot I like to have a nice creative environment.

6000|$|... "Oh, yes; I did see him," [...] {{he started}} again, talking in that {{reasonable}} voice {{as though he}} were arguing a point. [...] "I did see him. I came upon him. Eyes sunk an inch into his head; nothing but skin on the bones of his face, a skeleton in dirty white clothes. That's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> How Freya [...] . But she never did--not really. He was sitting there, the only live thing for miles along that coast, on a drift-log washed up on the shore. They had clipped his hair in the hospital, and it had not grown again. He stared, holding his chin in his hand, and with nothing on the sea between him and the sky but that wreck. When I came up to him he just moved his head a bit. 'Is that you, old man?' says he--like that.|$|E
60|$|The {{fish had}} been hooked at eleven o'clock {{and it was}} now five. We had drifted or been pulled into the main channel, where strong {{currents}} and a choppy sea made the matter a pretty serious and uncomfortable one. Here I expended all I had left in a short and furious struggle to bring the fish up, if not to gaff, at least so we could see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> How strange and unfathomable a feeling this mystery of him gave rise to! If I could only see him once, then {{he could get away}} and welcome. Captain Dan, in anticipation of a need of much elbow room in that cockpit, ordered my brother and the ladies to go into the cabin or up on top. And they all scrambled up and lay flat on the deck-roof, with their heads over, watching me. They had to hold on some, too. In fact, they were having the time of their lives.|$|E
60|$|A long, long {{distance}} from the town, {{in the midst of}} dreadful wilds scarcely known to man, there dwelt the Griffin whose image had been put up over the church-door. In some way or other, the old-time sculptor had seen him, and afterward, to the best of his memory, had copied his figure in stone. The Griffin had never known this, until, hundreds of years afterward, he heard from a bird, from a wild animal, or in some manner which it is not now easy to find out, that there was a likeness of him on the old church in the distant town. Now, this Griffin had no idea how he looked. He had never seen a mirror, and the streams where he lived were so turbulent and violent that a quiet piece of water, which would reflect the image of any thing looking into it, could not be found. Being, as far as could be ascertained, the very last of his race, he had never seen another griffin. Therefore it was, that, when he heard of this stone image of himself, he became very anxious to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> and at last he determined to go to the old church, and see for himself what manner of being he was. So he started off from the dreadful wilds, and flew on and on until he came to the countries inhabited by men, where his appearance in the air created great consternation; but he alighted nowhere, keeping up a steady flight until he reached the suburbs of the town which had his image on its church. Here, late in the afternoon, he alighted in a green meadow by the side of a brook, and stretched himself on the grass to rest. His great wings were tired, for he had not made such a long flight in a century, or more.|$|E
50|$|Bob Neil is an enigma. Much {{is known}} about him, but few could tell you <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> or how to find him.

6000|$|... "My," [...] said Peter, [...] "I guess I'd better {{find out}} {{all about this}} other fellow before I have any trouble with him.

6000|$|... "Quoi faire, alors! Alvina, {{take him}} the {{rose to the}} gate, will you? Yes do! Their singing is horrible, I think. I can't go down to him.

Alvina also was smiling to herself.|$|R
60|$|One would wish, too, for {{a glimpse}} of what was passing through the mind of another man, who has been daily in that sick chamber, {{according}} to Olivarez' statement, since the first of the month: but he is one who has had, for some years past, even more reason than Alva for not speaking his mind. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> we know well, for Titian has painted him from the life--a tall, bold, well-dressed man, with a noble brain, square and yet lofty, short curling locks and beard, an eye which looks as though it feared neither man nor fiend--and it has had good reason to fear both--and features which would be exceeding handsome, but for the defiant snub-nose. That is Andreas Vesalius, of Brussels, dreaded and hated by the doctors of the old school--suspect, moreover, it would seem, to inquisitors and theologians, possibly to Alva himself; for he has dared to dissect human bodies; he has insulted the medievalists at Paris, Padua, Bologna, Pisa, Venice, in open theatre; he has turned the heads of all the young surgeons in Italy and France; he has written a great book, with prints in it, designed, some say, by Titian--they were actually done by another Netherlander, John of Calcar, near Cleves--in which he has dared to prove that Galen's anatomy was at fault throughout, and that he had been describing a monkey's inside when he had pretended to be describing a man's; and thus, by impudence and quackery, he has wormed himself--this Netherlander, a heretic at heart, as all Netherlanders are, to God as well as to Galen--into the confidence of the late Emperor Charles V., and gone campaigning with him as one of his physicians, anatomising human bodies even on the battle-field, and defacing the likeness of Deity; and worse than that, the most religious King Philip is deceived by him likewise, and keeps him in Madrid in wealth and honour; and now, in the prince's extreme danger, the king has actually sent for him, and bidden him try his skill--a man who knows nothing save about bones and muscles and the outside of the body, and is unworthy the name of a true physician.|$|E
60|$|Boys lingered {{talking to}} one another, and {{presently}} some who had hurried to change came out to play fives; others straggled out in twos and threes and {{went out of the}} gateway, Philip knew they were going up to the cricket ground; others again went into the precincts to bat at the nets. Philip stood among them a stranger; one or two gave him an indifferent glance; but visitors, attracted by the Norman staircase, were not rare and excited little attention. Philip looked at them curiously. He thought with melancholy of the distance that separated him from them, and he thought bitterly how much he had wanted to do and how little done. It seemed to him that all those years, vanished beyond recall, had been utterly wasted. The boys, fresh and buoyant, were doing the same things that he had done, it seemed that not a day had passed since he left the school, and yet in that place where at least by name he had known everybody now he knew not a soul. In a few years these too, others taking their place, would stand alien as he stood; but the reflection brought him no solace; it merely impressed upon him the futility of human existence. Each generation repeated the trivial round. He wondered what had become of the boys who were his companions: they were nearly thirty now; some would be dead, but others were married and had children; they were soldiers and parsons, doctors, lawyers; they were staid men who were beginning to put youth behind them. Had any of them made such a hash of life as he? He thought of the boy he had been devoted to; it was funny, he could not recall his name; he remembered exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> he had been his greatest friend; but his name would not come back to him. He looked back with amusement on the jealous emotions he had suffered on his account. It was irritating not to recollect his name. He longed to be a boy again, like those he saw sauntering through the quadrangle, so that, avoiding his mistakes, he might start fresh and make something more out of life. He felt an intolerable loneliness. He almost regretted the penury which he had suffered during the last two years, since the desperate struggle merely to keep body and soul together had deadened the pain of living. In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou earn thy daily bread: it was not a curse upon mankind, but the balm which reconciled it to existence.|$|E
