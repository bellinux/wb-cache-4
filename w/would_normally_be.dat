5|$|On May 20, 2012, Perl 5.16 was released. Notable new {{features}} include {{the ability to}} specify a given version of Perl that one wishes to emulate, allowing users to upgrade their version of Perl, but still run old scripts that <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> incompatible. Perl 5.16 also updates the core to support Unicode 6.1.|$|E
5|$|Several {{animal species}} have been {{introduced}} to Everglades waterways. Many tropical fish are released, the most detrimental being the blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus), which builds large nests in shallow waters. Tilapia also consume vegetation which <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> used by young native fishes for cover and protection.|$|E
5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> signed otherwise.|$|E

50|$|In January 1911, Laurier and President William Howard Taft of the United States {{announced}} that they signed an reciprocity agreement, which they decided to pass by concurrent legislation rather than a formal treaty, as <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>been</b> the case. As such, the reciprocity agreement had to be ratified by both houses of the US Congress rather just the Senate, which Laurier would later regret.|$|R
5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} way the world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after UDI, 46 {{academics}} {{working at}} University College, a racially non-segregated institution, in Rhodesia wrote to The Times in London, denouncing the move. Officers of the British South Africa Police visited {{many of those}} who had signed to search their houses. Shortly afterwards, the residence permit of one of the academics came up for renewal, which <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> automatic. In fact, it was revoked and the academic was deported. Van der Byl was the responsible minister and all but admitted that the reason was his opposition to UDI.|$|E
5|$|Velites {{were first}} used, and created, at {{the siege of}} Capua in 211 BC, and were made up of {{citizens}} who <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> too poor to join the hastati but were called up due a shortage of manpower. They were trained to ride on horseback with the equites and jump down at a given signal to fling javelins at the enemy. After the siege, they were adopted into the legions as a force of irregular light infantry for ambushing and harassing the enemy with javelins before the battle began in earnest.|$|E
500|$|Higher (av. 17.5m) and {{projecting}} {{corner and}} interval towers. These would enable enfilading fire on attackers. Towers <b>were</b> <b>normally</b> round or half-round, and only rarely square {{as the latter}} were less defensible. Towers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> spaced at [...] intervals on circuit walls.|$|R

5|$|Although Bellone <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> {{much faster}} than the large British warship, the light winds and Rattlesnakes {{determined}} pursuit prevented the privateer from escaping and at 17:00, Powerful {{was close enough to}} open fire. Despite the uneven nature of the combat, Bellone unexpectedly resisted the British attack for another hour and 45 minutes, causing more damage to Powerful than she received herself. The privateer was later taken into British service as a sixth rate frigate and prize money was paid for the captured vessels, but the action prompted questions in subsequent histories about the lack of efficiency in British gunnery.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{necklaces}} features lion-headed terminals, {{and another}} includes stylized dolphins. The other four are relatively plain loop-in-loop chains, although {{one has a}} Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on the clasp, the only Christian element in the jewellery. Necklaces of similar lengths <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> worn in the Roman period with a pendant, but no pendants {{were found in the}} hoard. The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones, or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, perhaps for reuse. The rings are of similar design, one with an oval bezel, one with a circular bezel, and one with a large oblong bezel.|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{is passing}} through an ice age {{known as the}} {{quaternary}} glaciation, and is presently in the Holocene interglacial period. This period <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> expected to end in about 25,000 years. However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere by humans may delay {{the onset of the}} next glacial period until at least 50,000–130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a global warming period of finite duration (based on the assumption that fossil fuel use will cease by the year 2200) will probably only impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming induced through a few centuries worth of greenhouse gas emission would only have a limited impact in the long term.|$|E

5|$|The {{only major}} {{measurement}} {{that could not}} be made automatically or before the mission was the determination of the windspeed and direction. These change over time, and also due to changes in location, altitude, or wind shear. This demanded an accurate determination of the wind in the general area of the target, and <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> highly inaccurate if dialled in at the mission start. Taking this measurement while nearing the target was an important procedure on the CSBS; its manual included several methods of determining the wind. In the case of the Mk. XIV, the manual described only one method of determining the wind, equivalent to the most complex of the procedures from the CSBS model.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that auxiliary infantry fought in a looser order than legionaries. It appears that in a set-piece battle-line, auxiliary infantry <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> stationed on the flanks, with legionary infantry holding the centre e.g. as in the Battle of Watling Street (AD 60), the final defeat of the rebel Britons under queen Boudicca. This was a tradition inherited from the Republic, when the precursors of auxiliary cohortes, the Latin alae, occupied the same position in the line. The flanks of the line required equal, if not greater, skill to hold as the centre.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} innovation of the 4th {{century was}} the corps of protectores, which contained cadet senior officers. Although protectores {{were supposed to be}} soldiers who had risen through the ranks by meritorious service, it became a widespread practice to admit to the corps young men from outside the army (often the sons of senior officers). The protectores formed a corps that was both an officer training-school and pool of staff officers available to carry out special tasks for the magistri militum or the emperor. Those attached to the emperor were known as protectores domestici and organised in four scholae under a comes domesticorum. After a few years' service in the corps, a protector <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> granted a commission by the emperor and placed in command of a military regiment.|$|E

5|$|College {{football}} {{maintained a}} tradition of postseason bowl games. Each bowl game {{would be associated with}} a particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way in 1997 to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).|$|E
5|$|Days {{after the}} storm, fears of food {{shortages}} began to arise as railways, in which food <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> {{able to be}} delivered, were washed out. To deal with {{the large number of}} bodies {{in the wake of the}} disaster, Mexican officials decided to cremate and mass bury victims. By mid-September, between 1,600 and 1,800 people were hired to repair and rebuild the devastated railways in Nuevo León. In 2009, the third edition of the book El Río Fiera Bramaba: 1909 by Oswaldo Sánchez, re-accounting reports form people who experienced the flood, was planned. According to the director of publications at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, the book was considered one of historical quality. In memory of those who perished during the flood, the book was released to the public on August27, 2009, the 100year anniversary of the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being an}} internationally {{successful}} film, Let the Right One In was not submitted by Sweden for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The details surrounding the film's eligibility for the award resulted in some confusion. Being released on 24 October 2008, the film <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> <b>be</b> eligible for submission for the 82nd Academy Awards. However, the producers decided {{to release it}} on 24 September as a seven-day limited run only in Luleå. This would be exactly enough to meet the criteria for the 81st Academy Awards instead. When the Swedish Film Institute on 16 September announced that Jan Troell's Everlasting Moments had been selected instead of Let the Right One In, the Luleå screenings were cancelled. Despite {{the fact that the}} film was released within the eligibility period for the 82nd Academy Awards, it wasn't among the films considered because the Swedish Film Institute doesn't allow a film to be considered twice.|$|E
