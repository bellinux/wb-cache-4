40|$|The frizzled signaling/signal {{transduction}} pathway controls planar cell polarity (PCP) in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Epistasis experiments {{argue that}} in the Drosophila epidermis multiple wing hairs (mwh) acts as a downstream component of the pathway. The PCP proteins accumulate asymmetrically in pupal <b>wing</b> <b>cells</b> where they are thought to form distinct protein complexes. One {{is located on the}} distal side of <b>wing</b> <b>cells</b> and a second on the proximal side. This asymmetric protein accumulation is thought to lead to the activation of the cytoskeleton on the distal side, which in turn leads to each cell forming a single distally pointing hair. We identified mwh as CG 13913, which encodes a novel G protein binding domain–formin homology 3 (GBD–FH 3) domain protein. The Mwh protein accumulated on the proximal side of <b>wing</b> <b>cells</b> prior to hair formation. Unlike planar polarity proteins such as Frizzled or Inturned, Mwh also accumulated in growing hairs. This suggested that mwh had two temporally separate functions in wing development. Evidence for these two functions also came from temperature-shift experiments with a temperature-sensitive allele. Overexpression of Mwh inhibited hair initiation, thus Mwh acts as a negative regulator of the cytoskeleton. Our data argued early proximal Mwh accumulation restricts hair initiation to the distal side of <b>wing</b> <b>cells</b> and the later hair accumulation of Mwh prevents the formation of ectopic secondary hairs. This later function appears to be a feedback mechanism that limits cytoskeleton activation to ensure a single hair is formed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPlanar cell {{polarity}} signaling in Drosophila requires the receptor Frizzled and the cytoplasmic proteins Dishevelled and Prickle. From initial, symmetric subcellular distributions in pupal <b>wing</b> <b>cells,</b> Frizzled and Dishevelled become highly enriched at the distal {{portion of the}} cell cortex. We describe a Prickle-dependent intercellular feedback loop that generates asymmetric Frizzled and Dishevelled localization. In the absence of Prickle, Frizzled and Dishevelled remain symmetrically distributed. Prickle localizes to the proximal side of pupal <b>wing</b> <b>cells</b> and binds the Dishevelled DEP domain, inhibiting Dishevelled membrane localization and antagonizing Frizzled accumulation. This activity is linked to Frizzled activity on the adjacent cell surface. Prickle therefore functions in a feedback loop that amplifies differences between Frizzled levels on adjacent cell surfaces...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe frizzled/starry night pathway regulates planar cell {{polarity}} in a {{wide variety}} of tissues in many types of animals. It was discovered and has been most intensively studied in the Drosophila wing where it controls the formation of the array of distally pointing hairs that cover the wing. The pathway does this by restricting the activation of the cytoskeleton to the distal edge of <b>wing</b> <b>cells.</b> This results in hairs initiating at the distal edge and growing in the distal direction. All of the proteins encoded by genes in the pathway accumulate asymmetrically in <b>wing</b> <b>cells.</b> The pathway is a hierarchy with the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) genes (aka the core genes) functioning as a group upstream of the Planar Polarity Effector (PPE) genes which in turn function as a group upstream of multiple wing hairs. Upstream proteins, such as Frizzled accumulate on either the distal and/or proximal edges of <b>wing</b> <b>cells.</b> Downstream PPE proteins accumulate on the proximal edge under the instruction of the upstream proteins. A variety of types of data support this hierarchy, however, we have found that when over expressed the PPE proteins can alter both the subcellular location and level of accumulation of the upstream proteins. Thus, the epistatic relationship is context dependent. We further show that the PPE proteins interact physically and can modulate the accumulation of each other in <b>wing</b> <b>cells.</b> We also find that over expression of Frtz results in a marked delay in hair initiation suggesting that it has a separate role/activity in regulating the cytoskeleton that is not shared by other members of the group...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPlanar {{polarity}} {{development in}} the Drosophila wing is {{under the control of}} the frizzled (fz) pathway [1 – 3]. Recent work has established that the planar polarity (PP) proteins become localized to either the distal, proximal, or both sides of <b>wing</b> <b>cells</b> [4 – 9]. Fz and Dsh distal accumulation is thought to locally activate the cytoskeleton to form a hair [4, 10, 11]. Planar polarity effector (PPE) genes such as inturned (in) are not required for the asymmetric accumulation of PP proteins, but they are required for this to influence hair polarity [1, 2, 8, 9, 12 – 14]. in mutations result in abnormal hair polarity and are epistatic to mutations in the PP genes [12 – 15]. We report that In localizes to the proximal side of <b>wing</b> <b>cells</b> in a PP-dependent and PP-instructive manner. We further show that the function of two other PPE genes (fuzzy and fritz) is essential for In protein localization, a finding consistent with previous genetic data that suggested these three genes function in a common process.

40|$|The planar {{coordination}} of cellular polarization is an important, yet not well-understood aspect of animal development. In a screen for genes regulating planar cell polarization in Drosophila, we identified Rab 23, encoding a putative vesicular trafficking protein. Mutations in the Drosophila Rab 23 ortholog result in abnormal trichome orientation {{and the formation}} of multiple hairs on the wing, leg, and abdomen. We show that Rab 23 is required for hexagonal packing of the <b>wing</b> <b>cells.</b> We found that Rab 23 is able to associate with the proximally accumulated Prickle protein, although Rab 23 itself does not seem to display a polarized subcellular distribution in <b>wing</b> <b>cells,</b> and it appears to play a relatively subtle role in cortical polarization of the polarity proteins. The absence of Rab 23 leads to increased actin accumulation in the subapical region of the pupal <b>wing</b> <b>cells</b> that fail to restrict prehair initiation to a single site. Rab 23 acts as a dominant enhancer of the weak multiple hair phenotype exhibited by the core polarity mutations, whereas the Rab 23 homozygous mutant phenotype is sensitive to the gene dose of the planar polarity effector genes.

40|$|The conserved frizzled (fz) pathway regulates planar cell {{polarity}} in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. This pathway {{has been}} most intensively studied in the wing of Drosophila, where the proteins encoded by pathway genes all accumulate asymmetrically. Upstream members of the pathway accumulate on the proximal, distal, or both cell edges {{in the vicinity of}} the adherens junction. More downstream components including Inturned and Multiple Wing Hairs accumulate on the proximal side of <b>wing</b> <b>cells</b> prior to hair initiation. The Mwh protein differs from other members of the pathway in also accumulating in growing hairs. Here we show that the two Mwh accumulation patterns are under different genetic control with the early proximal accumulation being regulated by the fz pathway and the latter hair accumulation being largely independent of the pathway. We also establish recruitment by proximally localized Inturned to be a putative mechanism for the localization of Mwh to the proximal side of <b>wing</b> <b>cells.</b> Genetically inturned (in) acts upstream of mwh (mwh) and is required for the proximal localization of Mwh.

40|$|Chemosensory {{cells in}} {{vertebrate}} taste organs have two obvious specializations: an apical membrane {{with access to}} the tastants occurring in food, and synapses with sensory axons. In many species, however, certain differentiated taste cells have access to the tastants but lack any synaptic contacts with axons, and a supportive rather than chemosensory function has been attributed to them. Until now, no functional data are available for these taste cells. To begin to understand their role in taste organ physiology, we have characterized with patch-clamp recording techniques the electrophysiological properties of a putative supporting cell-the so-called wing cell-isolated from frog taste disks. Wing cells were distinguished from chemosensory elements by the presence of a typical, sheet-like apical process. Their resting potential was approximately - 52 mV, and the average input resistance was 4. 8 G Omega. Wing cells possessed voltage-gated Na+ currents sensitive to TTX, and an inactivating, voltage-gated K+ current sensitive to TEA. Current injections elicited single action potentials but not repetitive firing. We found no evidence for voltage-gated Ca 2 + currents under various experimental conditions. Amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels, thought to be involved in Na+ chemotransduction, were present in <b>wing</b> <b>cells.</b> Many of the membrane properties of <b>wing</b> <b>cells</b> have been also reported for chemosensory taste cells. The presence of ion channels in <b>wing</b> <b>cells</b> might be suggestive of a role in controlling the microenvironment inside the taste organs or the functioning of chemosensory cells or both.
