The PMU system monitors the voltages and State-of-Charges (SoCs) of <b>whole</b> battery <b>module</b> & individual cells. PMU ensures reliable and safe battery operations. MAX 11068 is used in the project to meet the monitoring and/or balancing requirements of the BMS, and thus PMU. However, only using the MAX 11068 is not enough for designing a PMU. In addition to the MAX 11068, a microcontroller (Arduino Due) and a comprehensive Java program are used in the PMU project. The microcontroller is programmed so that it sends to and receives information from the Java program.

50|$|Performance:Traditional systems, {{because of}} their serial architecture, can suffer {{significant}} performance issues due to individual cell issues, module issues, or even light shading. One cell failure within a module will bring down the performance of that <b>whole</b> <b>module.</b> A module performance issue or outright failure will in turn bring down {{the performance of the}} whole string of modules. In a traditional serial system, the performance of the system depends on its worst performing component, and that will have a material cascading impact to the overall system. In tenK’s system, a cell issue will impact only that cell, and a module performance issue will impact only that module. The performance issue is isolated, and has an immaterial impact to the overall system. Likewise, shading has an impact only on the shaded component, and does not impact the rest of the system.|$|E
5000|$|There is {{at least}} one report of a <b>whole</b> <b>module</b> substitution, in which module 2 of DEBS was {{replaced}} with module 5 of the rapamycin PKS. [...] The activities of the two modules is identical, and the same erythromycin precursor (6-deoxyerythronolide B) was produced by the chimeric PKS; however, this shows the possibility of creating PKS with modules from two or even several different PKS in order to produce a multitude of new products. There is one problem with connecting heterologous modules though; there is recent evidence that the amino acid sequence between the ACP domain and the subsequent KS domain of downstream modules {{plays an important role in}} the transfer of the growing polyketide from one module to another. [...] These regions have been labeled as “linkers” and although they have no direct catalytic role, any substitution of a linker region that is not structurally compatible with the wild-type PKS may cause poor yields of the expected product.|$|E

40|$|When {{dealing with}} CPV {{manufacturing}} process, tolerances are critical {{in order to}} obtain a low cost massproduction system. Usually the efficiency attained by a <b>whole</b> <b>module</b> array is smaller than the average efficiency of every single module.

For this reason, we present a novel mathematical method to calculate photocurrent versus pointing angle curves for the single-cell modules, with the only information of photocurrent versus pointing angle measurements for the <b>whole</b> <b>module</b> array. In this way we can estimate the mismatch losses for a given array just by analyzing its full-array I-V curve. Thus, the great breakthrough about this method lies in no single-cell module measurement is needed. The application of this method allows the measurement of the real tolerances of any CPV system...|$|E

40|$|International audienceModular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are multidomain multienzymes {{responsible}} for the biosynthesis in bacteria {{of a wide range}} of polyketide secondary metabolites of clinical value. The stereochemistry of these molecules is an attractive target for genetic engineering in attempts to produce analogues exhibiting novel therapeutic properties. The exchange of ketoreductase (KR) domains in model PKSs has been shown in several cases to predictably alter the configuration of the -hydroxy functionalities but not of the -methyl groups. By systematic screening of a broad panel of KR domains, we have identified two donor KRs that afford modification of -methyl group stereochemistry. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first direct in vivo evidence of KR-catalyzed epimerization. However, none of the introduced KRs afforded simultaneous alteration of methyl and hydroxy configurations in high yield. Therefore, swapping of <b>whole</b> <b>modules</b> might be necessary to achieve such changes in stereochemistry...|$|R
40|$|The {{microscopic}} principles organizing dynamic {{units in}} complex networks—from proteins to power generators—can {{be understood in}} terms of network ‘motifs’: small interconnection patterns that appear much more frequently in real networks than expected in random networks. When considered as small subgraphs isolated from a large network, these motifs are more robust to parameter variations, easier to synchronize than other possible subgraphs, and can provide specific functionalities. But one can isolate these subgraphs only by assuming, for example, a significant separation of timescales, and the origin of network motifs and their functionalities when embedded in larger networks remain unclear. Here we show that most motifs emerge from interconnection patterns that best exploit the intrinsic stability characteristics at different scales of interconnection, from simple nodes to <b>whole</b> <b>modules.</b> This functionality suggests an efficient mechanism to stably build complex systems by recursively interconnecting nodes and modules as motifs. We present direct evidence of this mechanism in several biological networks...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{experimental}} implementation of single-frequency fiber-laser pumped mid-infrared (mid-IR) transmitter and receiver modules for free-space communications. These modules enable frequency upconversion and downconversion between the 1550 -nm telecom wavelength and the mid-IR, thus providing essential free-space transmission links with mid-IR single-frequency lasers in the 3. 6 mu m region. Specifically, based on difference frequency generation (DFG) in MgO-doped periodically poled LiNbO 3 (MgO: PPLN), the mid-IR transmitter produces 9. 3 -mW power at 3594 nm with 5 -W pump power at 1083 nm (< 10 kHz linewidth) and 3 -W signal power at 1550 nm (< 10 kHz linewidth), and the mid-IR receiver reproduces 12 -mu W power at 1550 nm with 4. 7 -W pump power at 1083 nm and 5 -mW laser at 3594 nm.
