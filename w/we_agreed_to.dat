This {{discrepancy}} was described by the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas as a negotiated concession in a September 2011 speech to the United Nations: [...] "... <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> establish the State of Palestine on only 22% of the territory of historical Palestine - on all the Palestinian Territory occupied by Israel in 1967." ...|$|E

[...] "We had never been involved romantically but I knew her well enough to know she would be a wonderful mother and so I said I would like to be the father of her children." [...] A daughter was born in 1990, and another in 1992. Then another friend said she'd like to have children: [...] "And <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> have a baby."

500|$|The Congressional inquiry {{triggered}} by MacArthur's relief ruled that Truman's actions violated both constitutional and statutory requirements. While presidents {{had in the}} past used extra-legal military force, this was in [...] "fights with pirates, landings of small naval contingents on barbarous or semi-barbarous coasts, the dispatch of small bodies of troops to chase bandits or cattle rustlers across the Mexican border, and the like." [...] Congressman Vito Marcantonio, who opposed the war in Korea, argued that [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> the United Nations Charter we never agreed to supplant our Constitution with the United Nations Charter. The power to declare and make war is vested in the representatives of the people, in the Congress of the United States." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1890 season, Dunlap engaged in {{protracted}} salary negotiations with President Nimick of the Alleghenies. In late March 1890, the Pittsburg Dispatch reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, [...] "and it now seems certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the Pittsburg league club." [...] Nimick said at the time: [...] "I had a long talk with Mr. Dunlap, and <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> terms for him to play with us this season. [...] Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play for much less than $5,000. [...] He did not sign a contract, for reasons that were quite satisfactory to me ... We know he is a good player and he is quite willing to remain with us." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Brooks and Groening were {{involved}} in a public dispute over the episode [...] "A Star Is Burns". Groening felt that the episode was a thirty-minute advertisement for Brooks' show The Critic (which had moved to Fox from ABC for its second season), and was created by former The Simpsons showrunners Al Jean and Mike Reiss, and whose lead character Jay Sherman appears in the episode. He hoped Brooks would pull the episode because [...] "articles began to appear in several newspapers around the country saying that [...] created The Critic", and removed his names from the credits. In response, Brooks said [...] "I am furious with Matt, he's been going to everybody who wears a suit at Fox and complaining about this. When he voiced his concerns about how to draw The Critic into the Simpsons' universe he was right and <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> his changes. Certainly he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far. [...] He is a gifted, adorable, cuddly ingrate. But his behavior right now is rotten." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1951, Kidder, {{in discussions}} with Thomas Stuart Ferguson and Gordon Willey of Harvard University, was {{instrumental}} in establishing a foundation dealing with the status of archaeology in Mexico and Central America. [...] In regard to those discussions, Ferguson wrote that the three scholars agreed “...it was unfortunate that so little work was being carried on in so important an area and that something {{should be done to}} increase explorations and excavations....Despite the amazing discoveries made between 1930 and 1950, work on the Pre-Classic was virtually at a standstill in 1951. The result of the discussion was that <b>we</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> set up a new organization to be devoted to the Pre-Classic civilizations of Mexico and Central America—the earliest known high cultures of the New World.” [...] The following year, the New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF) was incorporated in California, as a nonprofit, scientific, fact-finding body.|$|E
