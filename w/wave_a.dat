This led to the creation of the Sound <b>Wave,</b> <b>a</b> 53-member marching band consisting of brass and marching percussion. The band plays music from multiple genres, such as Latin, rock and pop, and sits on the north end of CenturyLink Field. The March to the Match, in which fans march from Occidental Park to CenturyLink Field before each home match, has been accompanied by the Sound Wave.|$|E
5|$|In a medium, light {{usually does}} not {{propagate}} {{at a speed}} equal to c; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a plane <b>wave</b> (<b>a</b> wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocityvp. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at the front velocityvf.|$|E

25|$|The {{units of}} the {{amplitude}} depend {{on the type of}} wave. Transverse mechanical <b>waves</b> (e.g., <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> on <b>a</b> string) have an amplitude expressed as a distance (e.g., meters), longitudinal mechanical waves (e.g., sound waves) use units of pressure (e.g., pascals), and electromagnetic <b>waves</b> (<b>a</b> form of transverse vacuum wave) express the amplitude in terms of its electric field (e.g., volts/meter).|$|R

5|$|It {{originated}} {{in an area}} of low pressure that developed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December10, downstream from an upper-level cyclone. The surface low tracked northward to Oklahoma before turning eastward as it gradually intensified. Simultaneously, a shortwave trough swung southeastward around the periphery of a large vortex over central and eastern Canada. As the upper low opened up into a negatively tilted trough and began to interact with the northern <b>wave,</b> <b>a</b> secondary surface cyclone developed along a frontal boundary over South Carolina late on December11. Almost immediately thereafter, the original low dissipated over West Virginia. Heading toward the northeast, the incipient storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, at 00:00UTC on December12.|$|E
5|$|Joust 2 is a 2D combat game {{taking place}} in the air and on landing platforms, like its predecessor. The player {{controls}} a yellow knight riding a flying ostrich and navigates the game world with a two-way joystick and a button. The joystick controls the horizontal direction that the knight travels, while pressing the button makes the ostrich flap its wings. The rate at which the player repeatedly presses the button causes the ostrich to fly upward, hover, or slowly descend. The objective is to defeat groups of enemy knights riding buzzards that populate each level, referred to as a wave. Upon completing a <b>wave,</b> <b>a</b> more challenging one will begin.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the battle}} at Stillman's Run, Black Hawk's grand vision of British support, and a Native American confederacy had collapsed. No parties aided him and his followers. The British Band started to weaken with hunger, and Black Hawk soon {{realized}} that the only option was to return across the Mississippi River. When he detected the U.S. militia camp eight miles (13km) away, Black Hawk sent out peace envoys in order to negotiate a truce. They were told to <b>wave</b> <b>a</b> white flag at the militia.|$|E

5|$|White Plume Mountain {{is set in}} the World of Greyhawk, a {{campaign}} setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The module is a dungeon crawl, precipitated by the theft of three magical, sentient weapons: a trident named <b>Wave,</b> <b>a</b> war hammer named Whelm, and a sword named Blackrazor (all three were introduced in this adventure). The weapons' former owners each received a copy of a taunting poem, instructing them that the weapons are located in White Plume Mountain. The poem is signed by the wizard Keraptis, who thirteen hundred years ago descended into the volcanic mountain with a company of gnomes and disappeared. The player characters goal is to follow the same path and retrieve the weapons from Keraptis' lair.|$|E
5|$|Captain Thomas Thompson on Leander {{initially}} {{tried to}} escape the much larger French ship, but it rapidly became clear that Généreux was faster than his vessel. At 09:00 the ships exchanged broadsides, the engagement continuing until 10:30, when Captain Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille made an unsuccessful attempt to board Leander, suffering heavy casualties in the attempt. For another five hours the battle continued, Thompson successfully raking Généreux at one stage but ultimately being outfought and outmanoeuvered by the larger warship. Eventually the wounded Thompson surrendered his dismasted ship by ordering his men to <b>wave</b> <b>a</b> French tricolour on a pike. As French sailors took possession of the British ship, Lejoille encouraged systematic looting of the sailors' personal possessions, even confiscating the surgeon's tools {{in the middle of}} an operation. Against the established conventions of warfare, he forced the captured crew to assist in bringing Leander safely into Corfu, and denied them food and medical treatment unless they co-operated with their captors.|$|E

25|$|Standup surfing {{begins when}} the surfer paddles toward shore {{in an attempt}} to match the speed of the wave (The same applies whether the surfer is standup paddling, bodysurfing, boogie-boarding or using some other type of watercraft, such as a waveski or kayak.). Once the wave begins to carry the surfer forward, the surfer stands up and {{proceeds}} to ride the wave. The basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (whitewash) of the <b>wave.</b> <b>A</b> common problem for beginners is being able to catch the wave at all.|$|E
25|$|Surfers' {{skills are}} tested by {{their ability to}} control their board in {{difficult}} conditions, riding challenging waves, and executing maneuvers such as strong turns and cutbacks (turning board back to the breaking wave) and carving (a series of strong back-to-back maneuvers). More advanced skills include the floater (riding {{on top of the}} breaking curl of the wave), and off the lip (banking off the breaking <b>wave).</b> <b>A</b> newer addition to surfing is the progression of the air whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely up into the air, and then successfully lands the board back on the wave.|$|E
