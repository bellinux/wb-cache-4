500|$|Back in Liverpool, {{the group}} played an {{engagement}} on 17 December 1960, at the Casbah Coffee Club, with Chas Newby substituting for Sutcliffe, playing bass {{with them for}} four shows. Newby was shocked at the vast improvement of their playing and singing after the residency in Hamburg, and <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> powerful Best's drumming now was, pushing the group to play harder and louder. (It was probably due to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style, as he would often tell Best in Hamburg to [...] "Crank it up" [...] = play as loud as possible).|$|E
500|$|In December 2007, Jones became romantically {{involved}} with mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins. They first met in 2005 when she appeared on Blue Peter and he <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> good {{she was with}} kids: [...] "You kind of think people like that {{are all going to}} be false, but she really wasn't at all, and I like that. She really is lovely, a typical Neath girl." [...] It was reported they met after Jenkins sang [...] "Time to Say Goodbye" [...] with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli on an episode of Strictly Come Dancing, broadcast on 21 October 2007. Jenkins's spokesman has said: [...] "They're old friends and they've been on several dates. But people shouldn't consider buying hats just yet." ...|$|E

He watched the bag for 10 minutes, saying later that it provoked an [...] "unexpected emotional response". In 1992, Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial. Discovering a comic book telling of the scandal, he <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> quickly it had become commercialized. He said he [...] "felt like there was a real story underneath [...] more fascinating and way more tragic" [...] than the story presented to the public, and attempted to turn the idea into a play. Ball produced around 40 pages, but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film. He felt that because of the visual themes, and because each character's story was [...] "intensely personal", it could not be done on a stage. All the main characters appeared in this version, but Carolyn did not feature strongly; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles.|$|E

500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know if I would be making movies or working in a restaurant, I {{had no idea what}} I would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E

They wouldn't say or {{originate}} anything, they seemed to have no purpose, they were just like sheep. There's no way 100 people could be evil horrid [...] and DM's the only [...] one. No way." [...] He had known and been friends with some of those in the Hole for decades and could not bear what he was seeing. As he put it, [...] "I can't stop it, but I can at least stop supporting it. So I left." [...] He left a note in his room for his colleagues to find: [...] "By now you've noticed I'm gone. I couldn't stand to see my Sea Org friends so mistreated. I won't support it anymore. Goodbye." ...|$|E

Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not sure what it would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided {{that he did not want}} planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. [...] "I didn't want it to be a war story, and I didn't want to write a story in which might made right – or in which might made anything." [...] On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> the [...] "past seemed very close at hand"; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell.

500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan Nakashima of Associated Press was {{generally}} {{impressed with the}} film's 4K resolution picture quality, though the visual-effects shots that comprised {{about a third of}} the movie were done in 2K resolution to save on cost and time. Nakashima commented [...] "I could see details I've never noticed before – the actors' tiny skin imperfections, or Smith's salt-and-pepper whiskers. In a distant shot of Smith's son Jaden running down a riverbed, I <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> many small rocks were defined clearly from such a distance. Yet other shots that included computer-generated cityscapes or otherworldly creatures looked less sharp." [...] The cinematographer Peter Suschitzky was apologetic about that, saying [...] "The movie is only half in true 4K. I'm sad about that. It still looks good.|$|E
2500|$|Bertrand Russell (1959) wrote, [...] "Beyond doubt [...] {{he was one}} of {{the most}} {{original}} minds of the later nineteenth century, and certainly the greatest American thinker ever." [...] (Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, published from 1910 to 1913, does not mention Peirce; Peirce's work was not widely known until later.) A. N. Whitehead, while reading some of Peirce's unpublished manuscripts soon after arriving at Harvard in 1924, <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> <b>by</b> <b>how</b> Peirce had anticipated his own [...] "process" [...] thinking. (On Peirce and process metaphysics, see Lowe 1964.) Karl Popper viewed Peirce as [...] "one of the greatest philosophers of all times". Yet Peirce's achievements were not immediately recognized. His imposing contemporaries William James and Josiah Royce admired him, and Cassius Jackson Keyser at Columbia and C. K. Ogden wrote about Peirce with respect, but to no immediate effect.|$|E

Some Lessons Learned:  A broad lesson from my career, beyond just valuing adventure, was that setbacks also are opportunities. Scholarly success does not come from having brilliant ideas.
