500|$|Sveriges Radio {{stipulated that}} the work had to include a Swedish element. Singer Russell Mael told The National, [...] "At first, <b>we</b> <b>obviously</b> thought of cars and Ikea. I'm joking. But the more profound, more lasting idea – being the film fans we are – was Ingmar Bergman. So we hit upon a fantasy {{situation}} of him going to Hollywood, which is obviously a lot more universal, too." [...] Before starting work on the musical, the Mael brothers decided to refresh their memories by looking at Bergman's films again. [...] "We were both really big film fans in university. At that time unless you only liked foreign film, and hated American ones, you weren't cool", Ron Mael told The Times. [...] "There was a real kind of seriousness to [...] He actually addressed big things {{and was able to}} frame those in really pure, cinematic ways. Now those things are seen as being kind of pretentious. Everyone wants to be seen as though they don't care about the big issues." [...] Commenting on the suitability of Bergman as the topic of a musical, Russell Mael told a Swedish newspaper, [...] "In a way, he is the least appropriate person for a musical. We like the absurdity of it all. He was such a deep, intense person {{and the vast majority of}} his films are about really deep topics. But we did not want to ridicule him, we wanted to do something respectful that Bergman would have been able to appreciate." ...|$|E

It was blowing, the seas were starting to smack {{against the side of}} the ship, it was pitch black. And pretty soon we could see little bobbing lights along the shoreline, little oil lanterns so <b>we</b> <b>obviously</b> stirred up the natives. As it got lighter we could see that we had ripped out the bottom almost clear back to the engine room. There was a lot of oil, and it oiled the sea and the beach. There was no backing off, so we had to get the passengers ashore. We lowered the lifeboats with people in them.|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Gamasutra, Twisted Pixel CEO Michael Wilford {{revealed}} that though the developers had plans for downloadable content from the beginning, decisions {{on what would}} be included in that content were not made until after the game was released. [...] " [...] didn't work on {{them in any way}} until after the main game was wrapped," [...] stated Wilford. [...] "Once the game was out of our hands, {{we went back to the}} drawing board to design everything from scratch, but <b>we</b> <b>obviously</b> had a lot of half-finished pieces on the cutting room floor that we could leverage." [...] Wilford further explained that due to the way The Maw ends extending past the ending would not be possible. [...] Therefore, plans were made for the downloadable content to be dubbed [...] "Deleted Scenes"; levels that take place inside the story of the main game. Wilford was quick to note that these levels were not simply unlock codes that provided the player with access to things already in the game. [...] "I think some people took it to mean that we intentionally stripped out levels that were 100 percent complete only to sell them as DLC," [...] he said, adding that it was [...] "not the case." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rothenberg {{said he and}} {{his crew}} do some {{research}} with regard to depicting societies, such as the Grounders, within the series, but most of what is shown is based on his personal tastes. He enjoys the world-building aspect the most. [...] "Getting to create this universe from the language to the wardrobe to the tattoos ... <b>we</b> <b>obviously</b> get pretty deep into what the grounder spirituality is and means," [...] he stated. [...] "All of that is pretty awesome. So yes, we do some research as to how societies have evolved in the past {{but for the most part}} it's fiction." [...] Rothenberg said there are more than just men writing the show; there are several women [...] "writing hardcore sci-fi." [...] In 2015, two commander jackets were described as being [...] "made out of leather, metal, and fur". Debnam-Carey felt that the Grounder culture—the language, wardrobe, makeup and [...] "all the symbolic meaning behind that"—was [...] "one of the highlights" [...] for her. [...] "We explored it as much as we could as actors to break down its meaning, but the best thing about this was finally finding out all this backstory and fully creating this world," [...] she stated, adding they [...] "had three sets built just for the Grounders".|$|E

[...] Although he was not present for the {{conversation}} between Gonzales and Ashcroft, FBI Director Bob Mueller testified, [...] "Ashcroft complained to Judge Gonzales about White House compartmentalization rules preventing Ashcroft from getting the advice he needed." [...] On July 24, 2007, Gonzales testified that he and Card were also concerned about Ashcroft's competency. [...] "Obviously there was concern about General Ashcroft's condition. [...] And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn't fully competent to make the decision." [...] In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Gonzales continued, [...] "Obviously we were concerned about the condition of General Ashcroft. [...] <b>We</b> <b>obviously</b> knew he had been ill and had surgery. [...] And we never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent. [...] When we got there, I will just say that Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking. [...] We were there maybe five minutes – five to six minutes.
