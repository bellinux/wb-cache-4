5|$|Homer is {{told that}} he has an overdue book from the library, which he checked out when Bart was a baby. He says that he had {{intended}} to read to Bart every day, but various things had gotten in his <b>way.</b> <b>Before</b> he returns it, he reads from the book, telling three stories.|$|E
5|$|According to American {{composer}} David Schiff, his compatriot Leonard Bernstein used {{to imply}} that he had single-handedly rescued Mahler from oblivion in 1960, after 50years of neglect. Schiff points out that such neglect was only relative—far less than the (incomplete) disregard of Bach {{in the years after}} his death. Although Bernstein gave the Mahler revival further impetus, it was well under <b>way</b> <b>before</b> 1960, sustained by conductors such as Stokowski, Dimitri Mitropoulos and John Barbirolli, and by the long-time Mahler advocate Aaron Copland.|$|E
5|$|In around 180, Clement reached Alexandria, {{where he}} met Pantaenus, who taught at the Catechetical School of Alexandria. Eusebius {{suggests}} that Pantaenus {{was the head of}} the school, but it is controversial whether the institutions of the school were formalized in this <b>way</b> <b>before</b> the time of Origen. Clement studied under Pantaenus, and was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Julian before 189. Otherwise, virtually nothing is known of Clement's life in Alexandria. He may have been married, a conjecture supported by his writings.|$|E

5|$|The 1996–97 {{campaign}} {{proved to}} be the most successful in the club's history. They finished second in the Second Division and reached the semi-final of the League Cup, knocking out three Premiership teams (Blackburn Rovers, Southampton and West Ham United) on the <b>way</b> <b>before</b> losing to Middlesbrough 2–1 on aggregate. Before the start of the 1997–98 season, Dave Jones left for Southampton. Gary Megson left Blackpool to take over as manager and in his first season Stockport finished eighth, just two places off the playoffs to reach the Premiership – the club's best ever league placing.|$|E
5|$|The Filipino guerrillas were {{successful}} in their resistance against the Japanese occupation. Of the 48 provinces in the Philippines, only 12 were in firm control of the Japanese. Many provinces in Mindanao were already liberated by the Moros <b>way</b> <b>before</b> the Americans came, as well as major islands in the Visayas such as Cebu, Panay and Negros. During the occupation, many Filipino soldiers and guerrillas never lost hope of the United States. Their objective was to both continue {{the fight against the}} Japanese and prepare for the return of the Americans. They were instrumental in helping the United States liberate the rest of the islands from the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process remained more encouraging, although it too had technical obstacles to overcome. By the end of 1943, Urey had over 700 people working for him on {{gaseous diffusion}}. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for the pumps, but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate diffusion barrier. Construction of the huge K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was well under <b>way</b> <b>before</b> a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944. As a backup, Urey championed thermal diffusion.|$|E

5|$|After exiting Wellington Corner, NY175 enters another hamlet called Cards Corners. There {{are a few}} {{businesses}} in this hamlet, with NY175 and nearby Cedarvale Road being the major roads. The highway then enters a large forested area, at times surrounded by trees. NY175 continues northeast, passing by several more businesses and soon crosses into the town of Onondaga. In Onondaga, the route passes by the Gen. Orrin Hutchinson House and the Onondaga Community College, intersecting with two consecutive county roads along the <b>way</b> <b>before</b> joining with NY173. The two roads are concurrent for about 0.2miles (0.32km), after which NY173 heads east towards Manlius while NY175 heads northeast towards the city of Syracuse.|$|E
5|$|For its part, the Polish army marched {{across the}} Dniester into Moldavia in August 1497. The Sultan sent 500 or 600 Janissaries to Moldavia at Stephen's request, joining the Moldavian forces {{gathered}} at Roman. Stephen sent his chancellor, Isaac, to John Albert, requesting {{the withdrawal of}} Polish forces from Moldavia, but John Albert had Isaac imprisoned. The Poles then laid siege to Suceava on 24 September. The campaign failed: Teutonic reinforcements never arrived, with Johann von Tiefen dying on the <b>way.</b> <b>Before</b> long, a plague {{broke out in the}} Polish camp, while Vladislaus of Hungary sent an army of 12,000 strong to Moldavia, forcing John Albert to lift the siege on 19 October.|$|E
5|$|However, the two western towers left of {{the church}} display an unusual detail in the painting. The uniformly proportioned, large, square windows {{depicted}} there {{are associated with the}} Italian Renaissance, which was introduced in Sweden in 1572 during reconstruction of Kalmar Castle. While the construction works of Gustav Vasa are poorly documented, the presence of these windows in Stockholm in 1535 is unlikely. It seems more credible that this part of the painting had been damaged before 1632, forcing the copyist to rely on another source. As the two square and crenellated towers in the painting are depicted much as they appear on a copperplate of Stockholm produced by Frantz Hogenberg around 1560–1570, the painting thus probably renders this part of the castle as it appeared while the reconstruction was still under <b>way,</b> <b>before</b> its completion in the 1580s.|$|E

Kentuckian departed the United States {{for the final}} time on 19 May and headed for Milford Haven. After arriving there on 3 June, the cargo ship arrived at Barry via Plymouth, Belfast Lough, and Falmouth, on 27 June. Departing Barry on 8 July {{as a part of}} Convoy EBC-35, Kentuckian arrived at Arromanches on 10 July and was scuttled there as part of a breakwater protecting the mulberry harbor constructed there in support of the Normandy invasion.|$|E
5|$|The Well-Manicured Man prefers subtlety to brute force, {{and will}} attempt to {{manipulate}} those in his <b>way</b> <b>before</b> using physical violence. Although the Syndicate's goals are opposed to those of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the Well-Manicured Man will, at times, aid them with clues or information, believing that letting out {{a certain amount of}} information would help to keep the two close, and consequently allow for them to be controlled. The Well-Manicured Man openly despises The Smoking Man, seeing him as impulsive and unprofessional. The two maintain a bitter relationship within the Syndicate throughout the series. The Well-Manicured Man is instrumental in the Syndicate's secondary agenda, to develop a vaccination against the black oil used by the aliens as a means of mind control. To this end, he works with Russian double agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) to develop a vaccine, eventually testing it—successfully—on a Syndicate mole, Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden).|$|E
5|$|The {{authorities}} {{responded to}} the chaos with emergency legislation; the Ordinance of Labourers was passed in 1349, and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, making {{it a crime to}} refuse work or to break an existing contract, imposing fines on those who transgressed. The system was initially enforced through special Justices of Labourers and then, from the 1360s onwards, through the normal Justices of the Peace, typically members of the local gentry. Although in theory these laws applied to both labourers seeking higher wages and to employers tempted to outbid their competitors for workers, they were in practice applied only to labourers, and then in a rather arbitrary fashion. The legislation was strengthened in 1361, with the penalties increased to include branding and imprisonment. The royal government had not intervened in this <b>way</b> <b>before,</b> nor allied itself with the local landowners in quite such an obvious or unpopular way.|$|E

5|$|The trail follows forest tracks, {{mountain}} paths, boreens {{and quiet}} country roads. Mountains, upland lakes and steep-sided glacial valleys {{make up the}} terrain of the initial northern sections of the <b>Way</b> <b>before</b> giving way to gentler rolling foothills in the latter southern sections. Much of the route follows the contact point between the igneous granite of {{the western side of}} Wicklow and the metamorphic schists and slates of the eastern side. The principal habitat of the upland sections is a mixture of broadleaf and coniferous woodland, heath and blanket bog while in the lowland sections the hedgerows marking the boundaries between fields support a variety of wildlife. The Way also passes the Monastic City at Glendalough, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left {{to pick up the}} pieces, Andy sells off family heirlooms, and is upset that he has to sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to get the first relapse out of the <b>way</b> <b>before</b> {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E
