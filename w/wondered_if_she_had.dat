500|$|When Stead {{was only}} halfway done, she hit a wall: she <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> focused the novel {{too much on}} her own {{personal}} life and problems. By her 40th birthday in January 2008, she had stopped writing. One week after her birthday celebration, Stead went to a writers' conference where the presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write. This speech worked {{as an antidote to}} Stead's writer's block; she started working on When You Reach Me again. After she had written two-thirds of the novel, Stead sent the draft to her editor Wendy Lamb at Random House. Perusing the script, Lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop the book. Unlike Stead's debut novel First Light, which Lamb heavily edited, Lamb modified nothing on the first draft of When You Reach Me. Throughout the process, Stead helped Lamb understand the complicated concepts in the book and had drafts read by others to make sure [...] "revision hadn't created any holes or contradictions in the plot".|$|E
2500|$|Jelinek {{said she}} felt very happy to receive the Nobel Prize, but felt [...] "despair for {{becoming}} a known, a person of the public". Known for her modesty and subtle self-irony, she – a reputed feminist writer – <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been awarded the prize mainly for [...] "being a woman", and suggested that among authors writing in German, Peter Handke, whom she praises as a [...] "living classic", {{would have been a}} more worthy recipient.|$|E
60|$|Phyllis's {{eyes had}} opened very wide; {{so that he}} <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> taken in his words.|$|E
50|$|The song is a {{dramatic}} ballad, with Wiesner <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> found paradise {{as a result of}} a romantic experience.|$|R
60|$|Curiosity {{soon became}} an obsession; he wandered {{down into the}} hall where the serving-wench was plying her duster. He searched her face, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> heard the news.|$|R
50|$|The {{book ends}} with the {{proposal}} of a peace pact, brokered by President Russell, among the Arab nations, while Leslie is left <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> gone a bit too far.|$|R
60|$|Later she <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been unkind to him. But it was done--and {{done for}} ever. Vogue la galère.|$|E
60|$|Evelyn {{noticed that}} Jessie laid some stress upon her {{acquaintance}} with Vane, and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> any motive for doing so.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right; good-by," [...] she replied as briefly, {{but with the}} faintest color. He <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> heard it too.|$|E
6000|$|... "By-the-bye, Lady Ferringhall," [...] he said, [...] "do {{you know}} that I am a very great admirer of your sister's? I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> ever spoken to you of me." ...|$|R
50|$|Renata's {{story is}} {{apparently}} confirmed when Jaffe's body washes {{up on the}} shore. But Renata's never does, leaving Kinsey <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> managed to fake her own death just like Wendell.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> deceived him in anything,' murmured Chickerel. 'I {{can hardly}} suppose it. But she is {{altogether}} beyond me. However, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> misled him on any point she will suffer for it.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} through New Mexico she {{followed}} magnificent ranges and valleys--so {{different from the}} country she had seen coming West--so supremely beautiful that she <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> only acquired the harvest of a seeing eye.|$|E
60|$|Jude <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> really {{left her}} {{handkerchief}} behind; {{or whether it}} were that she had miserably wished to tell him of a love that {{at the last moment}} she could not bring herself to express.|$|E
60|$|The maiden {{rubbed her}} eyes and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been dreaming. Next she thought, 'I will not stir from here till I see him come out, and {{discover}} who he is.' Accordingly she waited, and at dawn {{the next morning the}} rock moved to one side and a lion came out.|$|E
50|$|The song {{is in the}} key of A-flat major, with Bryan's vocals {{ranging from}} C4 to F5. In the song, the male narrator sees his lover in someone else's truck and <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> left him for someone else.|$|R
50|$|In 1802 Jane Austen {{receives}} a proposal of marriage, which she accepts. Her sister Cassandra is concerned and asks her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is sure of her choice. By {{the next morning}} Jane has changed her mind, although <b>she</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> made the right decision.|$|R
60|$|One evening, John, {{throwing}} out words, {{not as a}} sop to the necessity for talk, but as a bait to catch Anne's voice, mentions girdle-cakes, remembers that his old housekeeper used to be famous for the making of them, and <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> forgotten the art.|$|R
60|$|Marcia <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{not hurt}} Olive's feelings; {{but she would}} never have known how to excuse herself; and latterly she had been growing more and more like her father in certain traits. Perhaps her passion for Bartley had been the one spring of {{tenderness}} in her nature, and, if ever it were spent, she would stiffen into the old man's stern aridity.|$|E
6000|$|This devotion on {{the part}} of a rich and busy woman was deeply revealing. The youth was being educated swiftly into new conceptions of human nature. His mother was neither {{beautiful}} nor wise nor witty. Why should she attract and hold a lady like Mrs. Joyce? He <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been quite honest with him. Would her interest be the same if The Voices had not enriched her? ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{really been}} {{going to say that}} at first. They went back, and the subject was {{smoothed}} over, and her aunt took rather kindly to Sue, telling her that not many young women newly married would have come so far to see a sick old crone like her. In the afternoon Sue prepared to depart, Jude hiring a neighbour to drive her to Alfredston.|$|E
6000|$|... "'She seemed mighty {{careful about}} how she slipped out of those bushes,' thought Mr. Bob-cat. 'She acted as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> didn't want to be seen. I wonder why. I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a secret hidden in those bushes. I suppose the {{way to find out}} is to look.' ...|$|R
60|$|Therefore Louisa was {{not sure}} if her words would carry weight, or if they would produce the effect she desired. She gazed anxiously at Edie whilst she spoke, looking with hopeful yet fearful eyes in the poor girl's face, <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> succeeded in calming the hysterical outburst.|$|R
60|$|Josie {{lowered the}} revolver. Her face was red. She was {{beginning}} to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> bungled the case. A second thought, however--a thought of the papers <b>she</b> <b>had</b> found in the old desk--reassured her. <b>She</b> might <b>have</b> been wrong in some respects, but surely she {{was right in the}} main.|$|R
60|$|After the {{incident}} {{of the discussion}} of barbarians I thought that Victory's manner toward me changed perceptibly. She held aloof from me, and when Snider took his turn at the wheel, sat beside him, upon the pretext that she wished {{to learn how to}} steer the launch. I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> guessed the man's antipathy for me, and was seeking his company solely for the purpose of piquing me.|$|E
60|$|From {{where he}} sat, he looked {{straight}} up {{the garden to}} the house. The blind was not drawn in the middle kitchen, {{he could see the}} figures of his wife and one child. There was a light also in the upstairs window. His wife was gone upstairs again. He <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> the baby ill. He could see her figure vaguely behind the lace curtains of the bedroom. It was like looking at his home through the wrong end of a telescope. Now the little girls had gone from the middle room: only to return in a moment.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Davis {{did not say}} {{anything}} half so amiable as good afternoon, but she took her departure. As she swept past the minister a large, plump toad, which Carl had secreted under the lounge, hopped out almost under her feet. Mrs. Davis gave a shriek and in trying to avoid treading on the awful thing, lost her balance and her parasol. She did not exactly fall, but she staggered and reeled across the room in a very undignified fashion and brought up against the door with a thud that jarred her from head to foot. Mr. Meredith, who had not seen the toad, <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been attacked with some kind of apoplectic or paralytic seizure, and ran in alarm to her assistance. But Mrs. Davis, recovering her feet, waved him back furiously.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no, at a restaurant. Where has Jemima put my boots? I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> cleaned them. I {{can never}} tell by looking. Here they are. And my coat? Anything I {{can get you}} in town? Well, good-bye, dear, good-bye!' Maude {{had never seen him}} make so hurried an exit.|$|R
60|$|That {{question}} of grammar bore upon her history, {{and she fell}} into reverie, of a somewhat sad kind to all appearance. It might have been assumed that <b>she</b> was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done wisely in shaping her life as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> shaped it, to bring out such a result as this.|$|R
5000|$|Drew Grant of Salon {{said the}} {{response}} made him <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> intentionally {{responded to the}} review {{as a way to}} increase publicity for her book and make more money. Steve Burgess of the Calgary Herald said [...] "More than one author is probably trying to kick-start something similar right now." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{only person}} who had any feeling of pity or affection for them was old Miss Woolmer. She was the {{daughter}} of a former clergyman of Mycening, the little town which is almost at our park-gates. She was always confined to the house by rheumatic-gout. She had grown up with my brothers. I sometimes <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not had a little tenderness for one of them, but I believe it was almost elder-sisterly. She told me much in their excuse. My father had never been the fond, indulgent father to them that I remembered him, but a strict, stern authority when he was at home, and when he was absent leaving them far too much to their own devices; while Prometesky was a very attractive person, brilliant, accomplished, full of fire and of faith in his theories of universal benevolence and emancipation.|$|E
60|$|The game of {{hide and}} seek between Lightfoot the Deer and the {{beautiful}} stranger whose dainty footprints had first started Lightfoot to seeking her {{had been going on}} for several days and nights when Lightfoot found something which gave him a shock. He had stolen very softly clown to the Laughing Brook, hoping to surprise the beautiful stranger drinking there. She wasn't to be seen. Lightfoot <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been there, so looked in the mud at the edge of the Laughing Brook to see if there were any fresh prints of those dainty feet. Almost at once he discovered fresh footprints. They were not the prints he was looking for. No, Sir, they were not the dainty prints he had learned to know so well. They were prints very near the size of his own big ones, and they had been made only a short time before.|$|E
6000|$|... 'One day by {{accident}} Jack saw on {{a scrap of}} paper the handwriting of Harriet's new beloved. It was flowing like a stream, well spelt, the work of a man accustomed to the ink-bottle and the dictionary, of a man already called in the parish a good scholar. And then it struck all of a sudden into Jack's mind what a contrast the letters of this young man must make to his own miserable old letters, and how ridiculous they must make his lines appear. He groaned and wished he had never written to her, and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> ever kept his poor performances. Possibly she had kept them, for women are in the habit of doing that, he thought, and whilst they were in her hands there was always a chance of his honest, stupid love-assurances to her being joked over by Harriet with her present lover, or by anybody who should accidentally uncover them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sure I {{think there}} is at present,' {{returned}} Elizabeth; 'did you see Aunt Anne last night wasted upon Mrs. Dale, obliged {{to listen to the}} dullest stuff that ever was invented, and poor Mamma frightened out of her wits? I should not <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> dreamt of mad dogs all night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet {{the fellow}} may have her ear," [...] said Humfrey. [...] "I know {{him to be}} popishly inclined, {{and there is a}} web of those Romish priests all over the island, whereof this Queen holds the strands in her fingers, captive though she be. I should not <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> devised this fellow's suit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Charlotte," [...] {{continued}} Coggan--"not {{a word of}} {{the sort}} would Charlotte allow, nor the smallest item of taking in vain.... Ay, poor Charlotte, I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{the good fortune to}} get into Heaven when 'a died! But 'a was never much in luck's way, and perhaps 'a went downwards after all, poor soul." ...|$|R
