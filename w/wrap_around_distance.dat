40|$|Firstly 24 car-bicycle crash {{accident}} {{cases are}} chosen from traffic accident database built up by in-depth survey to conduct accident reconstruction based on multi-body dynamics model for car-bicycle crash. Then on this base the correlations {{of the dynamic}} response process and head impact conditions (speed, duration and angle of head impact) of cyclist with car impact speed under typical crash pattern are analyzed, and the injury distribution of different parts of cyclist body and the risks of head injury and lower limb fracture are further studied. The {{results indicate that the}} head <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> <b>distance,</b> the speed, duration and angle of impact of cyclist have a rather strong correlation with car impact speed. Car impact speed and throw out distance of cyclists has a great effect on cyclist's injury. The risks of head AIS 2 +, head AIS 3 + injury and lower limb fracture of cyclist have a significant correlation with car impact speed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to investigate the effects of pedestrian gait, vehicle-front geometry and impact velocity on the dynamic responses of the head. The multi-body dynamic (MBD) models were used to simulate the head responses in vehicle to pedestrian collisions with different vehicle types in terms of head-impact point measured with <b>Wrap</b> <b>Around</b> <b>Distance</b> (WAD), head relative velocity and impact angle. Furthermore, the distribution of the head contact point on the vehicle fronts is analysed for a comparison of the contact point with the testing areas in the EEVC headform impactor test procedures. A simulation matrix is established using five vehicle types, two mathematical models of the pedestrians represented a 50 th male adult and a 6 -year-old child as well as seven pedestrian gaits based on typical postures in pedestrian accidents. In order to simulate a large range of impact conditions, four vehicle velocities (30 km/h, 40 km/h, 50 km/h and 60 km/h) are considered for each pedestrian position and vehicle type. The results indicated that the pedestrian gait and vehicle-impact velocity strongly influence head-impact condition. It is obvious that due to different vehicle-front geometry, the head-impact velocity, impact angle and head-impact point could be varied as well. This study provides suggestions for different head-impact conditions of subsystem test to the front part of different passenger vehicles...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} a {{study of}} how vehicle features contribute to CRS installation errors. Thirty-two subjects were recruited based on their education level (low or high) and experience with installing CRS (none or experienced). Each subject was asked to perform four child restraint installations in three vehicles. Each subject first performed a CRS installation with a seatbelt in one vehicle, followed by three CRS installations using LATCH, one in each of three vehicles. One child restraint with a hook-on LATCH connector and one with a push-on LATCH connector were used. All installations were forward-facing, using an 18 -month-old CRABI anthropomorphic test device (ATD). Six vehicles were used in testing, with half of subjects testing with each vehicle. Conditions were selected to provide a range of LATCH locations (visible, above seating surface, buried in bight), buckle stalk types (webbing vs. rigid), and tether locations (package shelf vs. seatback). After each installation, the experimenter evaluated 28 factors for each installation (such as tightness of installation, tether tightness, and LATCH belt attached correctly). Analyses used linear mixed models to identify the CRS installation outcomes associated with vehicle features. For LATCH installations, vehicles requiring higher forces to attach connectors to lower anchorages {{were more likely to}} be attached incorrectly. Vehicle seats with a bightline waterfall (which places the lower anchorage above the seating surface) increased rates of tight CRS installation for both seatbelt and LATCH installs. Seatbelt installations were tight (and locked) more frequently when the buckle stalk was located close to the bight rather than further forward. Subjects used the tether correctly in 30 % of installations. Subjects used the tether more frequently during LATCH installations compared to seatbelt installations. The tether was used more frequently in sedans (with anchorage locations on the package shelf) than in vehicles with the tether anchorage located on the seatback. However, when the tether was used, it was routed correctly more often in vehicles with the tether anchorage on the seatback. A tether <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> <b>distance</b> of 210 mm was sufficient to allow tightening of the tether with the two CRS tested, but additional testing showed that 5 / 16 CRS could not be tightened sufficiently with this <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> <b>distance.</b> Installation time decreased with successive trials, but installation time was longer when subjects used the vehicle or CRS manuals. Subjects used the vehicle manual in 38 % of installations, and were more likely to do so when the tether anchorage was located on the vehicle seatback. Subjects used the CRS manual in 88 % of installations. In questionnaire responses, subjects indicated that the head restraints affected installations, and vehicle manuals varied in their ease of understanding. They also noted that tether anchorages on seatbacks were more difficult to locate than those on the package shelf. Results from this study do not fully support SAE and ISO recommendations for LATCH usability in vehicles. Recommendations ar...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} was to assess head injury risks and kinematics of adult pedestrians and bicyclists in primary impact to the passenger cars and secondary impact to the ground using real world accident data and computer reconstructions of the accidents. For this purpose, a subsample of 402 pedestrians and 940 bicyclists from the GIDAS database, Germany, {{was used for the}} statistical analysis, from which 22 pedestrian and 18 bicyclist accidents were further selected for reconstruction. PC-Crash was used to calculate impact conditions, such as vehicle impact velocity, vehicle kinematic sequence, and thrown distance. These conditions were employed to identify the initial conditions in reconstruction in MADYMO program. A comparable analysis was conducted based on the results from accident analysis and computer reconstructions for the impact configurations and the resulting injury patterns of pedestrians and bicyclists in view of head injury risks. Differences in HIC, head-relative impact velocity, linear acceleration, maximum angular velocity and acceleration, contact force, thrown distance, <b>Wrap</b> <b>Around</b> <b>Distance</b> (WAD), and head contact time were evaluated. Injury risk curves were generated by using a logistic regression model for vehicle impact velocity. The results indicate that bicyclists suffered less severe injuries compared with severity of pedestrian injuries. In the selected samples, the AIS 2 + and AIS 3 + head injury risks for pedestrians are 50 % probability at impact speed of 38. 87 km/h and 54. 39 km/h respectively, while for bicyclists at 53. 66 km/h and 58. 89 km/h respectively. The findings of high injury risks suggested that in the area with high frequency car-pedestrian accidents, the vehicle speed limit should be 40 km/h, while in the area with high frequency car-cyclist accidents the vehicle speed limit should be 50 km/h.

40|$|Physical {{tests were}} {{performed}} with a bicycle and a dummy {{in a controlled}} laboratory environment to reproduce cyclist accidents. The kinematics of 13 sled tests were used to identify the cyclist head impact location, understand {{the interaction between the}} cyclist and bicycle and to validate a mathematical model. The finite element software code LS-DYNA was used to simulate 70 cyclist and pedestrian accidents with motor vehicles with four different vehicle shapes which supplemented the physical testing. The study has shown that when cyclists and pedestrians were struck by any of the vehicles their whole body kinematics can be distinguished into two phases, initially a rotation followed by a sliding action. The Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) vehicle produced more of a rotation action rather than sliding, whereas the other vehicles produced a combination of the two. The current pedestrian legislation does not cover all head impact locations for cyclists and therefore needs to be extended to encompass the windscreen and A-Pillar regions of the vehicles. The <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> <b>distance</b> (WAD) for all the vehicles, apart from the SUV, should be extended to encompass a larger region. For the SUV the current WAD region is adequate in protecting cyclists and pedestrians and does not need to change. The predicted head impactor angle for cyclists is 40 degrees which is lower than the current legislative value of 65 degrees and the predicted pedestrian head impact angle is higher at a value of 80 degrees for the MPV, SM and LFC. For the SUV the proposed impactor angle increased to 100 degrees for cyclists and pedestrians. This research has demonstrated significant differences in terms of input variables and outcomes between cyclist and pedestrian accidents involving vehicles. It has used mathematical models to obtain injury data from a human mathematical model and physical testing to replicate real world cyclist accident scenarios. Recommendations have been proposed for future legislative testing techniques for cyclists, based on existing pedestrian legislation. These recommendations to alter legislation will improve vehicle design and make future vehicles more cyclist-friendly. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Head {{injury is}} the most common injury type in child {{pedestrian}} accidents and could lead to lifelong disability or even death. To protect child pedestrian from head injury, {{it is important to understand}} the head injury mechanisms and tolerance levels. However, due to the lack of biomechanical data of child pedestrian, little progress has been made in this area. This study thus aimed at investigating head injury mechanism in child pedestrian accident by in-depth accident analysis and accident reconstructions. In paper I, a child pedestrian accident case was reconstructed based on the detailed information about the occurrence of the accident, victim injuries, vehicle damage, and accident environment. Child headform impact tests were carried out to acquire the force-deformation characteristics at the head and hip impact locations of the accident car. A facet child pedestrian model was developed by using scaling method. This facet model and a multibody system (MBS) child pedestrian model were used for the accident reconstruction respectively. The reconstructed pedestrian kinematics corresponded well with the measured accident data in terms of <b>wrap</b> <b>around</b> <b>distance</b> and throw distance. The head impact conditions were identified which included head impact velocity, impact angle, and head contact timing. Head injury parameters including 3 ms acceleration, HIC 15 value, angular velocity and angular acceleration were calculated and correlated with injury outcomes in the accident. The results showed by correlating the calculated injury parameters with the injury outcomes in the accident, it is possible to evaluate the current injury criteria and threshold for child pedestrian, which is scaled down from adult data. Both MBS and facet child pedestrian models could replicate pedestrian kinematics in the accident although minor difference existed. In paper II, an in-depth accident analysis was carried out based on 23 child pedestrian accident cases from GIDAS database. These accident cases were reconstructed using MADYMO program with mathematical passenger car and child pedestrian models developed at Chalmers University. The EEVC pedestrian component test results were used to derive the corresponding stiffness corridor of the car front. The accident analysis proved that the head was the most frequently and severely injured body part. Most child pedestrian accidents occurred at impact speed lower than 40 km/h and 98 % of the child pedestrians were impacted from the lateral direction. The child initial posture at the moment of impact was identified. 47 % of children were running which is remarkable compared with the situation of adult pedestrians. From accident reconstructions it was found that the head impact conditions and injury severities were dependent on the shape and stiffness of the car front, impact velocity and the anthropometry of the children. The head injury criteria and tolerance levels were analyzed and discussed by correlating the calculated injury parameters with injury outcomes in the accidents. The results indicated that reducing the head injury should be set as a priority in the protection of child pedestrian. HIC is an important criterion of child pedestrian head injury and its injury tolerance could have a large variation due to personal differences. By limiting the vehicle speed and improving car front design, the head injury severity of child pedestrian could be reduced...|$|E
