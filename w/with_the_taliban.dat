5|$|Saleh on the BBC's Hard Talk {{explained}} and {{reiterated that}} Karzai in hoping {{to reach a}} deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> and Pakistan's ISI through appeasement policy had alienated his internal allies as well as Afghanistan's external allies and had undermined the morale of Afghan security forces.|$|E
5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be far easier to implement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E
5|$|In {{pursuing}} the Clinton administration's energy objectives through {{construction of the}} $4.5 billion Afghanistan Oil Pipeline, Raphel created ill will with Afghanistan's Northern Alliance, then {{under the command of}} Ahmad Shah Massoud. Massoud-controlled militias blocked the pipeline's northern access route due to the longstanding civil war with Taliban forces. After Massoud was killed September 9, 2001 in a Taliban bombing, Raphel's critics accused her of collaborating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> to advance American commercial interests even as the group gave refuge to Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and other senior al-Qaeda leaders in the time leading up to the September 11 attacks.|$|E

50|$|Qayum Karzai {{has also}} {{reportedly}} {{been involved in}} secret meetings to work out some sort of peace agreement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> former <b>Taliban</b> government. He has traveled to Saudi Arabia to enlist their help in bringing <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> to <b>the</b> negotiating table, and ending <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> insurgency against <b>the</b> Afghan government.|$|R
50|$|Ahmad Behzad {{was forced}} to leave Afghanistan and moved to Iran during <b>the</b> war <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Talibans.</b> During his stay in Iran, he worked {{illegally}} and in bad conditions. When he returned to Afghanistan, he started to work as a journalist for Radio Azadi. Ahmad Behzad was instrumental in the progress of the Personal Status Law for Shi’ite Muslims in Afghanistan, the Media Code, and the Law for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.|$|R
5|$|Peace {{negotiations}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> {{were announced}} by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after his election, although previous attempts to engage TTP in dialogue had failed. The first session of talks, between committees {{appointed by the}} Pakistani Government and the Taliban, was held on 26 March 2014 at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. The Taliban did not name representatives from their ranks, instead nominating pro-Taliban religious figures to present their views. The terrorists called {{for the implementation of}} Sharia in Pakistan; the Government of Pakistan demanded the cessation of hostilities, insisting that talks be held {{within the framework of the}} Pakistani constitution. A month-long ceasefire was reached on 1 March 2014.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} policy {{directive}} that Raphel advocated and developed during her tenure was engagement and cooperation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban.</b> Her positions raised equal measure of praise and scorn. U.S. energy {{policies in the}} mid-1990s sought to develop alternative supply routes to counter increasing tensions in the Middle East. The Clinton administration supported oil and gas pipelines to transport Turkmenistan's rich energy reserves through Afghanistan to an exit at Pakistan's Indian Ocean seaport of Gwadar. Raphel openly spoke {{in favor of a}} proposed pipeline project by Unocal Corporation, an American oil company, on trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan in April and August 1996. Overt Clinton administration support for the Unocal project, and the subsequent taking of Kabul in September 1996 by the Taliban, raised concerns in Russia and Iran that U.S. intelligence assets were behind the rise of Taliban control in Afghanistan to advance U.S. energy interests in the region.|$|E
5|$|Chinook {{helicopters}} {{have been}} relied upon heavily {{to support the}} British forces in Afghanistan continuously {{since the start of}} the war in Afghanistan in 2001; Operation Snipe saw the helicopters used to assist the 1,000 British Commandos sweeping a region of southeathern Afghanistan. Due to the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) scattered throughout the terrain by insurgents, transport helicopters have become highly valued and demanded units in this style of warfare. By April 2006 six Chinooks had been deployed by C-17 transport planes to Kandahar in Southern Afghanistan, in support of Operation Herrick. Two RAF Chinooks were lost in August 2009 during combat operations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban,</b> one of which was brought down by enemy fire, in spite of warnings months before of Taliban plans to attack the helicopters.|$|E
25|$|The East Turkestan Islamic Movement (Turkistan Islamic Party) is allied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pakistani <b>Taliban</b> (Tehreek i Taliban Pakistan) and Al-Qaeda.|$|R
50|$|Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence {{agency has}} been accused of working <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Afghan <b>Taliban</b> in Balochistan, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Taliban's {{leadership}} council, Quetta Shura, named after the provincial capital Quetta.|$|R
50|$|After the September 11 attacks, Saeed went to Kabul {{to fight}} against the United States {{invasion}} of Afghanistan <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Afghan <b>Taliban.</b> He remained in Kabul for two years.|$|R
5|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{programs have}} received resistance from {{some people in}} Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (the three countries with remaining polio cases). There is distrust surrounding vaccines in Pakistan as in 2011 the CIA organized a fake vaccination program {{in order to help}} find Osama Bin Laden. Additionally, some people believe that the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims. In 2015, the World Health Organization announced a deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control. However, on September 11, 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and says that the group will continue to keep doing these kinds of attacks. This resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the three remaining countries.|$|E

25|$|On 8 August 1998 the Taliban massacred 4,000 Shias in {{the town}} of Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan. It also {{attacked}} and killed 11 Iranian diplomats with an Iranian journalist among them. The rest of the diplomats were taken hostage. Ayatollah Khamanei ordered the amassing of troops near the Iran Afghanistan border to enter Afghanistan and fight the Taliban. Over 70,000 Iranian troops were placed along the borders of Afghanistan. Khatami halted the invasion and looked to the UN for help. Soon he was placed in talks. Later Iran entered negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban,</b> the diplomats were released. Khatami and his advisers had managed to keep Iran from entering war <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the U.N lifted {{sanctions}} on the Taliban, and requested that Taliban leaders and others {{be removed from}} terrorism watch lists. In 2010 the U.S. and Europe announced support for President Karzai's latest attempt to negotiate peace <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban.</b>|$|E
