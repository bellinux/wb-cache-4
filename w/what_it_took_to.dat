5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage of this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at {{the right place at the}} right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E

500|$|The result marked Manchester United's first Shield {{defeat in}} 13 years, {{and was the}} ninth time Arsenal had won the Charity Shield.

He was content with how his international players, {{who had been in}} the World Cup, coped with the game's physicality. Wenger believed the result gave Arsenal a psychological boost for the Champions League campaign, as the club planned to stage their home matches at Wembley Stadium. Bergkamp felt the result showed that Arsenal had <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> retain the Premier League title: [...] "We've still got the same mentality and that will be the basis for this year's challenge.

500|$|On July 25, 1967, Forrestal reached Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin {{and joined}} Operation Rolling Thunder, the 1965–1968 air interdiction and {{strategic}} bombing campaign against North Vietnam. [...] The alpha strikes flown from Forrestal were against specific, pre-selected targets such as arms depots, factories, and bridges. [...] They were quite dangerous, {{due to the}} strength of the North Vietnamese air defenses, which used Soviet-designed and -supplied surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery, and MiG jet interceptors. [...] McCain's first five attack missions over North Vietnam went without incident, and while still unconcerned with minor Navy regulations, McCain had garnered the reputation of a serious aviator. McCain and his fellow pilots were frustrated by the micromanagement of Rolling Thunder from Washington; he later wrote, [...] "The target list was so restricted that we had to go back and hit the same targets over and over again...

There's been nothing like it since the heyday of Hill Street Blues." [...] Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, who called Homicide [...] "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from NYPD Blue, and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in [...] "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "If [...] is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> get you to watch NYPD Blue and you decided to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that Homicide is so far superior to NYPD Blue in all those categories that if you're not , you're missing the best hour of episodic television since Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere left the air." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Two Ronnies, the BBC let Barker decide {{what he wanted to}} do. The Two Ronnies took up one third of a year to produce, {{allowing}} time for Barker and Corbett to do a solo project each. [...] Barker opted to produce some sitcom pilots shown as part of 1973's Seven of One. Two of these pilots, Open All Hours (written by Roy Clarke) and Prisoner and Escort (written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) became series. Prisoner and Escort became Porridge, airing from 1974–1977, with Barker starring as the cynical and cunning prisoner Norman Stanley Fletcher. Porridge was the first sitcom to take place in a prison; The Times said the show [...] "was about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> survive in prison, the little day-to-day triumphs over the system that kept the prisoners sane." [...] The opening sequence of the programme showed Fletcher being directed to his cell, as prison doors are locked behind him, all the while the judge can be heard pronouncing judgement and sentence. The judge's voice was performed by Barker. [...] The show became a huge success, attracting 15 million viewers and earning what the BBC described as [...] "a chorus of critical acclaim and public adoration for what {{remains one of the most}} classic British sitcoms ever produced." [...] The Times called Fletcher his [...] "finest creation". Barker privately regarded the series as the finest work of his career. He won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1975 for his performance.|$|E

2500|$|Campus {{concern over}} the university's {{research}} status grew throughout spring and summer 2013.

According to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, [...] "Some faculty members said privately that McCoy had given his life to MSU and they doubted he would have left if he hadn't felt frustrated." [...] There was also fear that the Board of Regents was too focused on expanding the system's two-year colleges {{at the expense of}} MSU.

2500|$|At Leeds United Hodgson {{showed that}} he still had <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>to</b> score goals at the top level, scoring 6 goals in 13 league {{appearances}} {{in the second half}} of the 1936–37 season, including a goal on his debut in a 7–1 defeat against his old Merseyside rivals Everton [...] at Goodison Park on 3 March 1937. Despite that defeat Hodgson's goals still proved enough to help Leeds avoid relegation. [...] The following season, 1937–38, Leeds secured a top half finish thanks in no small part to Hodgson who scored 26 goals in 38 appearances in all competitions, including all four Leeds goals in a 4–4 draw against Everton at Elland Road on 26 February 1938. [...] His form was all the more remarkable considering the strain he'd been playing under as a result of the illness and subsequent death of his wife on 8 March 1938, leaving him a widower with two children. [...] Hodgson continued to show admirable professionalism and was as prolific as ever during the 1938–39 season, scoring 21 goals in 34 appearances in all competitions, including a still Leeds club record five goals in their 8–2 thrashing of Leicester City at Elland Road on 1 October 1938. [...] In total Hodgson scored 53 goals in 85 appearances for Leeds in all competitions, not including one appearance in the 1939–40 season which was abandoned after three games due to the outbreak of World War II. [...] He was top scorer for Leeds in both of his two full seasons at Elland Road. [...] During the war Hodgson worked in a munitions factory whilst continuing to turn out for Leeds until 1941, making 34 war-time appearances for the Elland Road club, scoring 14 goals. He also guested for Hartlepools United (1 appearance, 1939–40) and York City (5 appearances, 2 goals, 1939–40).
