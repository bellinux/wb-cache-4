500|$|Collins {{decided to}} record {{it in the}} late 1960s amid an {{atmosphere}} of counterculture introspection; {{she was part of}} an encounter group that ended a contentious meeting by singing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] as it was the only song to which all the members knew the words. Her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her 1970 album Whales & Nightingales. Collins, who had a history of alcohol abuse, claimed that the song was able to [...] "pull her through" [...] to recovery. It was recorded in St. Paul's, the chapel at Columbia University, chosen for the acoustics. She chose an a cappella arrangement that was close to Edwin Othello Excell's, accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers. Collins connected it to the Vietnam War, to which she objected: [...] "I didn't know <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. There was nothing left to do, I thought... but sing 'Amazing Grace'." [...] Gradually and unexpectedly, the song began to be played on the radio, and then be requested. It rose to number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining on the charts for 15 weeks, as if, she wrote, her fans had been [...] "waiting to embrace it". In the UK, it charted 8 times between 1970 and 1972, peaking at number 5 and spending a total of 75 weeks on popular music charts. [...] Her rendition also reached number 5 in New Zealand and number 12 in Ireland in 1971.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some languid storytelling which gave me way too much time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't know <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do....</b> This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ellison did a {{teaching}} qualification at Exeter University, [...] "because I didn't know <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> – I never thought I'd use it ...

2500|$|Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, {{not knowing}} <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with such an}} unusual and {{unexpected}} [...] "army", quickly ferried all 30,000 [...] across the Bosporus by 6 August. It has since been debated whether he sent them away without Byzantine guides {{knowing full well that}} they could be slaughtered by the Turks, or whether they insisted on continuing into Asia Minor despite his warnings. In any case, it is known that Alexius warned Peter not to engage the Turks, whom he believed to be superior to Peter's motley army, and to wait for the main body of crusaders, which was still on the way.|$|E
2500|$|According to Donnelly, {{the band}} {{had been working}} {{together}} for five years, stating that if she didn't have the band, she wouldn't know <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her life. She described the band {{as a work of}} passion, citing sources of influences such as the bands Misfits, Blondie and Iron Maiden, and singer Courtney Love. The Misfits in particular were a large influence to the album; their horror themed and often purposely over-the-top style to making music were important in shaping the way the band presented themselves in image. Donelly expressed an interest with progressing the style of music on their sophomoric effort, stating that she wanted to have a tighter focus this time around, and specifically noting that the song titles on Fantastic Wounds were more direct and confident in nature. Speaking about the creation of the project, she mused: ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in [...] "Cheerio, Cheers" [...] (1985), Sam is told of Diane's {{plans to}} leave Boston with Frasier for London. At night in the bar, Sam and Diane try to have sex after their passionate embrace, but {{realize that they are}} not sure <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in their future together. Before she leaves, Sam advises her to call him if she wants to revive their {{relationship}} again. Diane arrives in London with Frasier and then calls Sam at the bar to tell him. [...] Despite her obvious misgivings about her relationship with Frasier, and Sam's pain at her choice, Diane stays in Europe with Frasier. She contacts Sam in two episodes before the season finale [...] "Rescue Me" [...] (1985), in which Frasier proposes to Diane in Italy; she accepts and tells Sam about it by telephone. Suddenly, Sam daydreams of stopping the wedding. Back in reality, Carla assures Sam that he is still a womanizer, regardless of his feelings about Diane. With the help of Cliff Clavin's (John Ratzenberger) travel reservation, Sam goes to Italy to stop Diane from marrying Frasier. Diane tries to call Sam but hears part of his answering machine message, and then hangs up. Frasier and Diane are set to be married immediately.|$|E

2500|$|The Kanalkampf {{comprised}} {{a series}} of running fights over convoys in the English Channel. It was launched partly because Kesselring and Sperrle were not sure about <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and partly because it gave German aircrews some training {{and a chance to}} probe the British defences. Dowding could provide only minimal shipping protection, and these battles off the coast tended to favour the Germans, whose bomber escorts had the advantage of altitude and outnumbered the RAF fighters. From 9 July reconnaissance probing by Dornier Do 17 bombers put a severe strain on RAF pilots and machines, with high RAF losses to Bf 109s. When nine 141 Squadron Defiants went into action on 19 July six were lost to Bf 109s before a squadron of Hurricanes intervened. On 25 July a coal convoy and escorting destroyers suffered such heavy losses to attacks by Stuka dive bombers that the Admiralty decided convoys should travel at night: the RAF shot down 16 raiders but lost 7 aircraft. [...] By 8 August 18 coal ships and 4 destroyers had been sunk, but the Navy was determined to send a convoy of 20 ships through rather than move the coal by railway. [...] After repeated Stuka attacks that day, six ships were badly damaged, four were sunk and only four reached their destination. [...] The RAF lost 19 fighters and shot down 31 German aircraft. The Navy now cancelled all further convoys through the Channel and sent the cargo by rail. [...] Even so, these early combat encounters provided both sides with experience.|$|E
