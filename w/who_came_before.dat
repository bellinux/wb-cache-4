5|$|Hammurabi was an Amorite First Dynasty {{king of the}} {{city-state}} of Babylon, and {{inherited the}} power from his father, Sin-Muballit, in c. 1792 BC. Babylon {{was one of the}} many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile agricultural land. Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the literate classes throughout the Middle East under Hammurabi. The kings <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>before</b> Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger and more powerful kingdoms such as Elam, Assyria, Isin, Eshnunna and Larsa for a century or so after its founding. However his father Sin-Muballit had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian hegemony and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of Borsippa, Kish, and Sippar.|$|E

Expressed in the principle of equality before the law it requires that those <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>before</b> the law are entitled {{to be treated as}} being of equal value and to be given ‘equal consideration’. In circumstances where those <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>before</b> the law are marked by their differences, giving of equal consideration requires that difference be understood and taken into account. This dissertation makes an argument for taking difference into account as a moral requirement – one that requires us to acknowledge the limitations of our capacity to understand the experience of ‘others’ within the criminal justice system and actively work to engage with these experiences...|$|R

25|$|In the {{controversial}} matter of interpreting prophecy {{such as that}} in the Book of Daniel, Calvin proposed a preterist view, {{which is to say}} that he believed that the prophecies in the book of Daniel apply only to the history between prophet Daniel (530 BC) and Jesus' first coming (30 AD).

25|$|The Chinese {{population}} in Thailand {{had risen to}} 792,000 by 1910. By 1932, approximately 12.2% {{of the population was}} ethnic Chinese. The corruption of the Qing dynasty and the massive {{population in}}crease in China, combined with very high taxes, caused many families to leave for Thailand in search of work and a better life. Those <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>before</b> the First World War came overland or by sailboats called sampams, while after World War II most arrived by steam ship. The earlier tradition of Chinese-Thai intermarriage declined once large numbers of Chinese women began immigrating in the early 20th century. Moreover, the new arrivals frequently came as families and resisted assimilation, retaining their Chinese culture and living in all Chinese areas.|$|E

In a 1993 interview for The New York Times, Wiggins elaborated on their direction for the album, stating [...] "We're paying homage to a lot of older artists who paved the way for us artists like the Temptations, Sly and the Family Stone, Earth, Wind and Fire. They're the people who inspired us when we were growing up, people like Aretha Franklin, James Brown. We feel we're the sons of everything and all those people <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>before</b> us." [...] He also explained the album's title as a declaration of them being descendants of those artists, [...] "not in a grandiose sense, but from the standpoint that we really are the musical offspring of all that's come before us... paying homage to our past, but creating in a contemporary environment." ...|$|E

500|$|D'Angelo was {{dissatisfied}} with the direction of R and soul music when conceiving the album. In an interview for Jet, he said that [...] "the term R doesn't mean {{what it used to}} mean.

It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>before.</b> In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. But I want to do it for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album. The natural progression of soul, the next step to soul is funk".|$|E
500|$|Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph {{discussed}} the episode's refreshing strong-women theme: [...] "Game of Thrones has been justly criticised for employing young actresses as wobbly-wobbly window dressing and, though the toplessness has been dialed back this season, it's {{still very much}} a calling card. However there are reasons for suspecting that the series is attempting to make amends – by arguing that Westeros would be far better off with women in charge. Even as Sansa was turning the tide at Winterfell, in Meereen, Daenerys and Yara Greyjoy were striking up a lady bromance – and seemingly rock-solid alliance – for the ages." [...] Laura Prudom of Variety agreed: [...] "After seasons of criticism over the show's misogyny (sometimes earned, sometimes not), it's thrilling to see an episode like 'Battle of the Bastards', where women like Dany, Sansa and Yara — and emasculated men (either figuratively or literally) like Tyrion and Theon — break the gears of war and the familiar patterns of violence by attempting to 'leave the world better than we found it', despite the examples set by the evil white cisgendered men <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>before</b> them." [...] According to Sarah Larson of The New Yorker, [...] "Sansa watches calmly, then smiles. You've come a long way, baby. Or she's become a monster, and so have I. The women of Westeros are on the warpath." ...|$|E
