In addition, the K-means clustering algorithm has very high efficiency and strong elasticity when dealing with {{a large number of}} data items. However, clustering effects of this algorithm are affected by clustering number and initial positions of clustering center.

AdaBoost is a {{practical}} method of real-time face detection, but abides by a crucial problem of overfitting for the big number of fea-tures used in a trained classifier due to the <b>weak</b> discriminative <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> these features. This paper proposes a theoretical approach to con-struct highly discriminative features, which is named composed features, from Haar-like features. Both of the composed and Haar-like features are employed to train a multi-view face detector.

It is shown that innate ability heterogeneity and idiosyncratic income shock variance have distinct effects on the emergence of earnings inequality through changes in learning speed and effort decisions. Given endogenous changes in individual perception, therefore, we are able to explain different patterns of labor earnings inequality evolution in differently endowed societies, observed in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and Japan. Finally, a structural model is estimated using data from Japan and the United States. It is found that wage (renumeration) is more directly linked with individual ability (productivity) in the United States than Japan. The <b>weak</b> link <b>of</b> individual <b>ability</b> and wage in Japan slows down the speed by which agents learn about ability, and it makes the evolution of cross-agent effort variability later in carrer in the country. ...|$|R

These two polymers have the same backbones and different side groups. Although these two polymers show similar optical band gaps (ca. 1. 5 eV), the polymer with alkylthienyl side groups, PBDFTT-CF-T, exhibits stronger absorption in long wavelength direction than the polymer with alkoxyl side groups, PBDFTT-CF-O. Meanwhile, PBDFTT-CF-T exhibits a HOMO level of − 5. 21 eV, which is 0. 23 eV {{lower than that of}} PBDFTT-CF-O due to <b>weaker</b> electron-donating <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> alkylthienyl side groups than that of aloxyl side groups. The hole mobility of the blend of PBDFTT-CF-T/PC 71 BM (1 : 1. 5, w/w) is 0. 128 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1, which is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the blend of PBDFTT-CF-O/PC 71 BM. Density functional theory (DFT) model shows thiophene pendants on dithienyl-BDF are more coplanar than it on dithienyl-BDT. These results indicate that the 2 D-conjugated structure is helpful for molecular structure design of the BDF-based polymers in enhancing the intermolecular π−π stacking and improving charge transport property. Furthermore, the photovoltaic devices based on these two polymers show similar short circuit density and fill factor values, while the open circuit voltage of the PBDFTT-CF-T-based device is 0. 78 V, which is 0. 15 V higher than that of the PBDFTT-CF-O-based device. Therefore, the efficiencies of the devices based PBDFTT-CF-T/PC 71 BM and PBDFTT-CF-O/ PC 71 BM are 6. 26 % and 5. 22 %, respectively. The results in this work demonstrate that the <b>weak</b> electron-donating <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> alkylthienyl side groups can be seen as an effective strategy to improve photovoltaic properties of the BDF-based polymers and the 2 D-conjugated molecular structure is favorable to improve hole mobility...|$|R

Experiment 1 tested whether ferrets spontaneously distinguish harmonic from inharmonic tones. In baseline sessions, ferrets detected a pure tone terminating a sequence of inharmonic tones.
