500|$|In {{the second}} all-school [...] of the 2009–2010 school year at Pacific Union College, Knight spoke on [...] "Integrating Faith and Learning: A Higher Education Imperative" [...] and her Adventist Advantage platform. She {{reported}} that {{institutions of higher}} learning are taking a fresh look at religion and spirituality and argued that it provides Adventist Education [...] "with multiple opportunities to showcase <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing so very well for so many years." [...] She introduced her theoretical framework to meet these opportunities, titled the Adventist Advantage. The framework consists of seven main points: meaning and purpose found by a connection with Christ as our personal savior; health, wellness, and a wholesome lifestyle; education, caring about {{the life of the mind}} and lifelong learning; ethics and morals; generous service; diversity; and stewardship of the earth, which is tied to the Sabbath.|$|E
500|$|In January 2006, nine tracks {{recorded}} for the album were {{leaked to the}} Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated [...] "I would say it {{did it in a}} good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." [...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I {{was under the impression that}} those songs had been wasted or something—that we had to go and write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to me without those tracks and probably will forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Well", she sighed, [...] "you see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reduced to. We {{are now in}} a {{time when}} a Szell is {{considered}} a master. How small he was next to Furtwängler." [...] Reeling this disbelief -- not at her verdict, with which I agreed, but from the unvarnished acuteness of it -- I stammered, [...] "But how do you know Furtwängler? You never sang with him." [...] "How do you think?" [...] she stared at me with equal disbelief. [...] "He started his career after the war in Italy [...] I heard dozens of his concerts there. To me, he was Beethoven." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "These fellows have {{a passion}} for shovelling which they inherit from their father," [...] he added, with a twinkle of the eye that told Mrs. Kate <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> talking about.|$|R
6000|$|... "Milly," [...] said Mrs Moss, severely, {{when they}} met {{a few minutes later}} in the drawing-room, [...] "what were you two and Mr Jackman {{laughing}} at so loudly? Surely you did not tell them <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> speaking about?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2010, Black {{addressed}} the Fit for Work Europe organisation, {{of which she}} is a co-president (the organisation focuses on the consequences of musculoskeletal disorders when they affect people of working age). In her address, {{she said that the}} government had appointed her to her national director role because [...] "...we had far too many people leaving the workforce with relatively mild musculoskeletal conditions, stress, anxiety, depression...and many of those people received no immediate help to keep them in the workplace...they were leaving the workplace to go into the benefits system". She also said: [...] "If I had to summarise <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> trying to do in the United Kingdom, it would be to say: get rid of the old system of the paper sick-note, put it in red because it's dangerous, it's not good advocacy for your patient".|$|E
2500|$|On September 11, 2009 the band's {{record label}} Interscope {{released}} the first video from the session; a stripped back version of [...] "Sowing Season" [...] from their previous album The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me which {{was accompanied by}} a short interview. Following the release, the band posted a blog to Myspace expressing their dissatisfaction of how the video was released, having hoped that the entire session would have been released [...] "as a set, with an explanation of what we did and how we did it. And it would give people insight into <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> up to", stating they were unsure when and where other tracks from the session would be released. The video for [...] "At the Bottom" [...] then premiered on Spinner.com on September 23, 2009, with producers ApK making the audio available separately through their blog.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2005, {{following}} {{the confirmation of}} asbestos fibres found on tree roots, the council asked developers to provide more detailed information relating to their contaminated land surveys, and placed the application on hold. They also announced that they were considering appointing their own environmental consultants to examine the site. Jason Addy said: [...] "This is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> asking for since day one. The information handed in with the planning application was inaccurate, misleading and avoided many issues. As this site begins to reveal more of its murky secrets people are realising just how contaminated it is. We {{are very concerned about}} the asbestos contamination on the site. We are very worried about the way this is going, if it wasn't so serious it would be a farce." [...] Rochdale councillor William Hobhouse said: [...] "With no government regulations specifying safe levels of asbestos in soil, it is clear the council, working with outside consultants, will have to formulate what percentage of asbestos in the soil is safe." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{they reached}} {{the edge of the}} wood Bathurst said, [...] "I will see that the road is clear before we go out. If anyone saw us issuing out of the wood they might wonder <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> after." ...|$|R
5000|$|Otto Maenchen-Helfen, who {{considered}} Gothic etymology, noted that Hunnic names were [...] "not the true {{names of the}} Hun princes and lords. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>are</b> Hunnic names in Germanic dress, modified to fit the Gothic tongue, or popular Gothic etymologies, or both".|$|R
5000|$|John Szarkowski: [...] "It {{seems to}} me that the subject of Bill Dane’s {{pictures}} is the discovery of lyric beauty in Oakland, or the discovery of surprise and delight in <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> told was a wasteland of boredom, the discovery of classical measure in the heart of God’s own junkyard, the discovery of a kind of optimism, still available at least to the eye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is," [...] rejoined Chauvelin complacently, [...] "just <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{saying to}} Sir Percy Blakeney {{for the past}} six days, madame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Clara," [...] she said. [...] "You {{had better}} think over <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> saying, in bed to-night. You {{will be more}} {{collected}} to-morrow morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it too late, now, Judith? I'm {{rough and}} a woodsman, {{but we all}} change under {{different}} treatment from <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Cambodian writer Soth Polin said: “There will {{be another}} {{generation}} of writers. But right now, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> lost <b>is</b> indescribable. Khun Srun, Hak Chhay Hok, Chou Thani, Kim Seth... They <b>are</b> gone... <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> lost <b>is</b> not reconstructable. An epoch is finished. So when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> literature again, {{it will be a}} new literature." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Saul would <b>have</b> asked {{concerning}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> doing {{during the}} day, {{and how we}} counted on making {{our way to the}} cabin, but I silenced him, promising that he should hear of all our movements when it should be possible for us to hold converse without danger of betraying ourselves.|$|R
5000|$|She {{therefore}} {{had a real}} [...] "scoop"! Together {{with her}} we agreed that if she <b>were</b> to publish <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> told by Gen Diya, the likelihood was that not only would the Nigerians deny the story, but this would also inevitably condemn Ken Saro-Wiwa and others and Generals Obasanjo and Yar’Adua to death.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was because}} of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> through, dear," [...] she said. [...] "There was a horrible moment, when I could not see you anywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{since that}} bright morning when we turned our backs upon {{it for the}} last time,' said Nell, 'only remember <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> since we have been free of all those miseries--what peaceful days and quiet nights we have had--what pleasant times we have known--what happiness we have enjoyed. If we have been tired or hungry, we have been soon refreshed, and slept the sounder for it. Think what beautiful things we have seen, and how contented we have felt. And why was this blessed change?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "To-day I cannot {{think of}} eating or drinking," [...] she replied. [...] "Bernadine and I <b>were</b> no longer <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> but {{the shock of}} his death seems none the less terrible. I feel like a traitor to him for coming here, yet I believe that I am doing what is right," [...] she added softly.|$|R
5000|$|Historical truth claims: [...] "I {{think we}} take it very literally. We don't {{deconstruct}} and feel that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> the figment of language or our imagination, or {{that there is some}} middle ground. I know that is very polarizing. In a sense, I think the hardest public relations sell <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to make <b>is</b> that this is the only true church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{is enough}} to find the cow, for that is {{probably}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> hearing, and {{we might as well}} be eating our breakfast while he is hunting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{that nobody}} can see whether they go to sleep or no. Oh, Mrs. Giles, you mustn't pull that down. That's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> putting up all day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As for that,' said Felix, still unsubmissively, 'it is only <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing, {{except for}} the name of the thing, {{for the last three years}} on the same means.' ...|$|E

50|$|The Santa Maria de Taüll {{ensemble}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} complete series of Romanesque pictures kept in the Museum. Originally, the church interior was totally decorated and despite not being preserved intact <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> enough for us to know with some certainty what themes were represented and how they were distributed inside the church and to distinguish the different artists.|$|R
5000|$|... "Basically, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> a {{page that}} deals with the misconceptions and {{challenges}} {{to the teaching of}} evolution, and we provided resources to teachers to answer them," [...] said Roy Caldwell. [...] "One of those questions is, 'Aren't religion and evolution incompatible?' and we say, 'no,' and point to a number of sites by clerics and others who make that point." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Mother!' said Barnaby, laying {{aside his}} hat and stick, and {{returning}} to the chair from which he had risen, 'I'll tell you where we have been to-day, and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing,--shall I?' ...|$|E

60|$|I suppose I <b>had</b> better tell <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{doing all}} this time.

6000|$|... "Oh yes; <b>we</b> <b>had</b> on our old blue checks; and Mary never minds {{anything}} when Armyn {{is there to}} take care of us. When they heard in the drawing-room <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> doing, they made Mary sing 'Auld Lang Syne,' because of 'We twa hae paidlit in the burn frae morning sun till dine;' and whenever in future times I meet Armyn, I mean to say, ...|$|R
