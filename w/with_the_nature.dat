5|$|Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, {{went to work}} at once on {{the task}} of reform. He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by {{establishing}} Benedictine monasticism at Glastonbury. The Rule of St. Benedict was the basis of his restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who {{had been a member of}} the community at Glastonbury. Their statements are also in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.|$|E

5|$|Many of Gibraltar's fortifications {{were already}} {{redundant}} {{well before the}} British garrison was withdrawn from the territory in the 1990s, and the rapid military rundown in the 1980s and the 1990s left the civilian authorities with {{a large amount of}} surplus military property. Many of the best-preserved fortifications are in the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, a conservation area that covers about 40% of the area of Gibraltar. A few of the Upper Rock batteries have been preserved intact; all three of the 5.25-inch guns at Princess Anne's Battery are still in place, making it {{the only place in the}} world where a complete 5.25-inch battery can still be seen. The 9.2 inch guns at Breakneck, Lord Airey's and O'Hara's Batteries are still in situ and can now be visited. Elsewhere, most of the ordnance has been removed. Two surviving 6-inch guns remain at Devil's Gap Battery, one of which is the gun that engaged a German U-boat in August 1917. At Napier of Magdala Battery one of the two 100-ton RML 17.72 inch guns is still in situ and has been restored, along with a 3.7 inch quick-firing anti-aircraft gun. The site is now run by the Gibraltar Tourist Board in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nature</b> Reserve.|$|E
5|$|The book {{discusses}} related legal {{practices of}} countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany. Israel {{was the first}} country to publicly acknowledge the practice—in November 2000. The author connects this policy initiative with Israel's ongoing conflict with Palestinian militants. Melzer argues that this policy was controversial—the issue came before the Israeli Supreme Court, where the matter was not decided for almost five years. The court's judgment was issued on 14 December 2006, but neither forbade nor endorsed the practice. Melzer asserts that it left multiple important legal conundra unresolved. Its significance was that it dealt not with a single incident, but rather <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the policy itself and set forth conditions for examining the legality of future episodes.|$|E
