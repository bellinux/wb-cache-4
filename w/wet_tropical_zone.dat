40|$|Abstract : On the Distinctive Character of the Saharan Mountains. In {{presenting}} the varied contributions {{which make up}} this book, the author attempts {{to bring out the}} distinctive character of the Saharan mountains. After showing that in spite of their topography they in fact have few aspects in common with other mountains (poorly developed morpho- climatic and biogeographical zoning), he identifies three distinctive features of the physical environment : first, the mountain- oases which have acted both as refuges for species driven out of the lowlands and as a bridge for the migrations of flora; they constitute a museum of fossil forms (slopes, quaternary terraces, etc.); second, the hybrid mountains, enjoying a wide variety of flora on account of their rather special situation in an area where the Mediterranean, Ethiopian and Sudanese regions come together; third, they constitute a break between the mountains of the <b>wet</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>zone</b> and those of the Mediterranean zone, the water deficit of the air and soils acting as the perfect limiting factor. The mountains also constitute, and have done since prehistoric times, poles of human activity on account of their water resources. Despite the decline in caravan traffic, the potential for development still exists from a pastoral and agricultural standpoint {{as well as in the}} field of tourism. However, increasing human populations are also putting fragile environments at a greater risk of degradation. From a physical as well as human point of view, the mountains of the Sahara constitute a sort of landmark along the meridional axes linking the Mediterranean and tropical worlds. Situated at the bridging point between these two areas, in the middle of vast expanses of plain and desert, they have played and continue to play a most distinctive role. Morel Alain. Prologue.

40|$|AbstractA {{green roof}} {{is an option}} for {{improving}} a building thermal comfort. The investigation is here performed within the specific climate context of Reunion Island in south hemisphere. This type of roof system involves choice difficulties for plant species that are more favorable to establish that comfort. The objective of this work is to simulate the dynamic behavior of this system towards external requests in <b>wet</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>zones</b> and vis-à-vis influences of certain number of physical parameters related to this system. As long as possible, authors used the electrical analogy method to establish a mathematical model associated to the studied system. Based on this model, a Matlab computing code was finalized. Weather data of Reunion Island were used for simulations; the green roof potential and benefit were highlighted by surveying the temperature gain and the heat flux crossing the roof {{as well as the}} energy saving performance. Furthermore, the energy consumption being surveyed while doing sensitivity analysis with Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test method, the most influential parameters of the model were identified. Full scale experimental results are provided and consisting in monitoring green roof {{on the top of a}} public building. According to the results, we can assert that the green roof decreases heat flux entering through the roof during the day and restrains the restoration of accumulated heat at night. Indeed, the support on which the plantation ground bases affects the building thermal insulation. The experimental data are also conducted to prove the effectiveness of thermal insulation by green roofs in reducing temperature in the building between 5 ̊C and 7 ̊C in relation to plants type and the canopy Leaf Area Index (LAI). A comparison of experimental values and model results is done. Among other uses, this code can be used as a tool for choosing the plants and the drain materials to be experimented on the green roof. The results offer hints to optimize the design and thermal performance of extensive green roofs...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the uncertainty in ocean-surface (OS) freshwater budgets and variability using evaporation (E) and precipitation (P) from 10 atmospheric reanalyses, 2 combined satellite-based E-P products, and 2 observation-based salinity products. Three issues are examined: the uncertainty level in the OS freshwater budget in atmospheric reanalyses, the uncertainty structure and association with the global ocean wet/dry zones, and the potential of salinity in ascribing the uncertainty in E-P. The products agree on the global mean pattern but differ considerably in magnitude. The OS freshwater budgets are 129 ± 10 (8 %) cm yr- 1 for E, 118 ± 11 (9 %) cm yr- 1 for P, and 11 ± 4 (36 %) cm yr- 1 for E-P, where the mean and error represent the ensemble mean and one standard deviation of the ensemble spread. The E-P uncertainty exceeds the uncertainty in E and P by a factor of four or more. The large uncertainty is attributed to P in the <b>tropical</b> <b>wet</b> <b>zone.</b> Most reanalyses tend to produce a wider tropical rain band when compared to satellite products, with the exception of two recent reanalyses that implement an observation-based correction for the model-generated P over land. The disparity in the width and the extent of seasonal migrations of the <b>tropical</b> <b>wet</b> <b>zone</b> causes large spread in P, implying that the tropical moist physics and the realism of tropical rainfall remain a key challenge. Satellite salinity appears feasible to evaluate the fidelity of E-P variability in three tropical areas, where the uncertainty diagnosis has a global indication...|$|R
40|$|LATE QUATERNARY HISTORY OF VEGETATION AND CLIMATE OF TROPICAL NORTH AFRICA The {{critical}} examination o f available pollen {{data from}} the vegetation of the Sahara allows one to conclude that this vegetation has gone through but few qualitative changes during the last twenty thousand years. In particular, one notices an extension in the Sahara of tropical Sahel taxa about the middle of Holocene. Quantitatively, some pollen and geological data converge to Show that the Saharian plains were extremely arid between about 20 000 and 15 000 years BP and that on the mountains the vegetation became very sparse. A new colonization began on the mountains about 15 000 years ago. The pollen study of Holocene sediments from the central part o f the Chad basin {{was done in the}} Tjéri station. The results of this study exhibit a major change near 7 000 years BP, characterized in the Sahel zone by a dramatic extension o f arboreal taxa until about 5 000 years BP, probably corresponding to northward extension of the sahel savanna. One important change took place also {{at the same time in}} the <b>wet</b> north <b>tropical</b> <b>zone</b> where, between about 7 000 and 4 000 years BP, there occurred an extension of taxa growing presently on the well-leached soils of interfluves. Such a change near 7 000 years BP also appears in the available stratigraphical, sedimentological and pedological data from tropical north Africa. One observes particularly that, between 15 000 and 7 000 years BP, the</em...|$|R
40|$|In Central Africa, non-timber forest {{products}} (NTFP) are traded between Cameroon and neighbouring countries. kola nut (Cola acuminata) is traded between Cameroon, Nigeria and the Central African Republic. Wild mango (Irvingia gabonensis) is traded between Cameroon, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. Okok (Gnetum africanum) is traded between Cameroon and Nigeria. As for bush butter tree (Dacryodes edulis), there is some trade between Cameroon, Gabon and Congo. Transborder trade of NTFP is based on linguistic, cultural, environmental and monetary complementarities of the countries involved. This survey shows that the quantity of NTFP sold on export markets in the <b>wet</b> <b>tropical</b> forest <b>zone</b> of Cameroon is quite significant, and their value is assessed at 3. 099 million French francs in 1995 and 5. 033 million in 1996. This gives {{an indication of the}} importance of transborder trade between Cameroon and its neighbour countries, and the need to better assess the role of NTFP in diversification of exports. Profit margins of traders are higher for bush butter than for other NTFP. Main markets for bush butter fruit are New-Bell (Douala) and Mfoundi (Yaounde), where traders' margins are higher than the SMIG (guaranteed minimum wage). In addition, the survey shows that the merchants selling wild mango kernels in Abang-Minko border market (Gabon border) in 1995 and 1996 and in Kye-Ossi border market (Equatorial Guinea border) in 1996 also earned margins higher than the SMIG. Transportation is the highest cost in NTFP marketing, especially for markets close to borders. A better harmonisation of economic policies and improvement of infrastructure could increase mobility of goods and people, and foster regional integration in Central Africa...|$|R
