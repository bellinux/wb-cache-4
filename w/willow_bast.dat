50|$|First {{indications}} of human settlement in Karelia {{are from the}} Mesolithic period. The oldest find from the area is the over 9000 years old Antrea Net which is a fishing net of <b>willow</b> <b>bast.</b> The number of finds from the area is lower {{towards the end of}} the Stone Age. Archeological finds from Karelia are relatively rare between the years 400-800. From the Merovingian period onwards finds from Karelia display a distinct features of West Finnish influences which has been interpreted to result at least partly from a colonisation.|$|E
40|$|Studies of the Mesolithic-Neolithic {{transition}} in Europe {{have focused on}} plants and animals exploited for food. However, the exploitation of plants for fibres underwent a significant change {{with the addition of}} domestic flax as a fibre crop. While the technology of flax fibre processing is increasingly understood by archaeologists, its material value as a fibre crop in comparison to indigenous fibre is less well explored. We examine the mechanical properties of flax and two indigenous fibres (lime bast, <b>willow</b> <b>bast),</b> by testing fibre strips for tensile properties and discuss the results in the light of material choices in these periods...|$|E
40|$|Flax (Linum sp.) {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{domestic}} plants in Neolithic Europe, providing a potential cultivable source of fibres for the first farmers. As the plant provides both oil and fibre, it is a matter of enquiry as to whether the plant was first domesticated for its seeds or stem. Through examining new data collected by the EUROEVOL Project, UCL it is possible to chart the earliest archaeobotanical evidence for flax species in Europe. This provides the basis on which to consider the origin of fibres from the flax plant (linen) as a basis for change and innovation in the fibre resources used for textiles. These are then explored from a technological and material perspective. From a technological perspective I compare the chaîne opératoire of linen with contemporary sources of fibre, namely tree bast fibres and other wild resources in central and northern Europe. From a material perspective I compare the physical properties of linen, <b>willow</b> and lime <b>bast</b> fibres together with observations from experimental archaeology to consider the material qualities of the linen in relation to other available fibres resources. Through these approaches this paper suggests that flax had a special role as a fibre domesticate in Europe, providing a versatile, valuable resource for the production and use of textiles during the Neolithic period...|$|R
