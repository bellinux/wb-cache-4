She gained {{recognition}} with her Indiana Chronicle trilogy, {{which consists of}} Blues (2004), Lipstick (2005) and Bridesmaid (2005). These works were classified as pop literature, but readers identified with the main characters— urban <b>working</b> <b>women.</b> Tempo magazine notes that the trilogy pioneered the metropop genre in Indonesia. Between Lipstik and Bridesmaid, another novel, The (Un)Reality Show, was released in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Representation of the People Act {{was passed}} in 1918 which gave women {{over the age of}} 30, who met a {{property}} qualification, the right to vote. Several factors led to the passing of the Act, including the efforts of <b>working</b> <b>women,</b> the dilution of anti-suffrage rhetoric and political change in London, where Asquith had been replaced as Prime Minister by Lloyd George. The government believed that six million voters would be added by the 1918 Act, in Wales the electorate rose from 430,000 to 1,172,000.|$|E
5|$|The main {{benefit of}} breast {{brachytherapy}} compared to whole breast irradiation {{is that a}} high dose of radiation can be precisely applied to the tumour while sparing radiation to healthy breast tissues and underlying structures such as the ribs and lungs.

The option of brachytherapy may be particularly important in ensuring that <b>working</b> <b>women,</b> the elderly or women without easy access to a treatment centre, are able to benefit from breast-conserving therapy due to the short treatment course compared with WBI (which often requires more visits over the course of 1–2 months).|$|E

5|$|World War II had a {{significant}} impact on changing family roles. Because of the draft, workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women, mainly in nontraditional positions. This increase in <b>working</b> <b>women</b> became one of the few times in history where women were praised for work outside the home. Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period. Not only had many women found a new sense of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of birth control. Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Fraser {{returned}} to Toronto {{and took up}} her research post, simultaneously working as a demonstrator with the Department of Hygiene and Preventative Medicine. She {{was one of the}} founding faculty of the School of Hygiene at U of T. She made her home with her brother Donald; Williams, who had also returned from England, moved in with her own mother. Though the two women wanted to live together, raise children and continue their careers, they were unwilling to displease or fail in their obligations to their mothers. They also realized that though they were middle-class, <b>working</b> <b>women,</b> economic inequalities in their pay compromised their ability to support themselves and their need to remain in the good graces of their families for support. When Williams was bequeathed a farm near Aurora, Ontario, the couple believed it might become their haven, but when Williams applied for courses at the Ontario School of Agriculture, she was advised the courses were full. For the next several years, they lived apart but within a 30-minute walk from each other at various residences.|$|E
5|$|The {{stress of}} {{maintaining}} a career and a household {{can also lead to}} a loss of sleep. In traditional gender roles it is usually the mother who is the one to get the family going in the morning as she fixes breakfast and takes the children to school before she goes to her own job. At night the mother cooks and does various other activities around the house that cause her to be the last person to retire for the night as well. Although this is merely just a few gender roles that are not set in stone, they may hold to be true. It was found that <b>working</b> <b>women</b> sleep twenty-five minutes less a night due solely to their responsibility for domestic work. Applying this statistic in larger scale leads to the assumption that women on average lose up to thirteen hours of sleep per month due to domestic duties. It can be assumed that it is possible for an average woman to lose up to one hundred and fifty-six hours of sleep during a year because of domestic work and motherly duties.|$|E

Women never have the opportunities to get a better quality of life, such as education or career. Nowadays, women have more chance to free themselves from that social construction. The movie entitled I Don 2 ̆ 7 t Know How She Does It reveals <b>working</b> <b>woman</b> 2 ̆ 7 s life surrounded by patriarchal society and her effort to prove that woman can live the life she wants to. Sociological approach is used because this research relates to society and its phenomenon.

The result reveals that Kate Reddy can free herself from society 2 ̆ 7 s construction by being a successful <b>working</b> <b>woman</b> who can balance her workinglife and motherhood. The next researcher can use phychoanalysis to find out Kate Reddy 2 ̆ 7 s psychology as <b>working</b> <b>woman</b> who lives in patriarchal society...|$|R
5|$|The subject came {{up again}} in 1930, during the Conference on Codification of International Law, held in The Hague. A strong {{contingent}} of women from America joined international women's groups to change the existing nationality laws, but the women were unable to agree on wording. Intense lobbying by women, and a massive parade demonstration, failed to influence the conferees, and the international law continued to hold that a woman's nationality followed her husband's. In response, Macmillan organised an International Committee for Action on the Nationality of Married Women early the next year. Six {{of the most influential}} international women's groups sought a broad base of support from <b>working</b> <b>women.</b> Macmillan's stated goal was to delay ratification of the Hague Convention, and to make certain that a woman's nationality would not change without her consent, and that the nationality of a couple's children would not be more influenced by the father's nationality. The new committee was successful in lobbying the League of Nations to address the problem, but when the League constituted a study group, that group was split between two intractable factions. On one side were those who wanted a married couple to have exactly one nationality, based on that of the husband, {{and on the other side}} were those like Macmillan who favoured independent citizenship between spouses, with the possibility of wives having different citizenship than their husbands, and children to be allowed dual citizenship. In 1932, the women's group, at an impasse, were pushed aside as ineffectual by the League of Nations, who decided in favour of ratifying the Hague Convention. The women's group disbanded, and the Hague convention was ratified in 1937.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} attitudes of <b>working</b> class <b>women</b> towards the women's {{movement}} {{in order to discuss}} their lack of participation. Since so many have claimed that <b>working</b> class <b>women</b> are more traditional, the concept of traditional <b>working</b> class <b>women</b> is explored. What {{does it mean to be}} more traditional? The effects class location has on participation in the women's movement will be discussed as an alternative to the idea that <b>working</b> class <b>women</b> are more traditional than middle class women. In doing so, the ways in which class location affects the ideology of its members and how those ideologies differ between middle class feminists and politically active <b>working</b> class <b>women</b> will be explored. In addition, it is hypothesized that there is a structural difference in the level of activity between the working class and the middle class, which ultimately leads to non-participation in the women's movement by <b>working</b> class <b>women.</b> Methodology includes interviews with <b>working</b> class <b>women</b> in the Fall of 1984.
