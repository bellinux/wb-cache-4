40|$|AbstractThere is {{controversy}} in the literature regarding the association between papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and as to {{what would be the}} etiological relationship between them. ObjectiveTo establish the proportion of cases among patients with TH and CPT, correlating it with histomorphological aspects. MethodA retrospective study of patients undergoing partial or total thyroidectomy for PTC between 2007 and 2009, a total of 41 cases. ResultsRegarding the association of HT and CPT, we found 11 cases (26. 8 %), all females, but without statistical significance. The mean age was 44. 9 years among the patients with coexistent TH and CPT, whereas it was 49. 1 years without that association. The average size of tumors in those <b>without</b> <b>TH</b> was 20. 53 mm and for those with TH it was 12. 72 mm (p = 0. 4). Regarding pathology staging, the ratiosbetween those with and those <b>without</b> <b>TH</b> were kept in T 1 a, T 1 b and T 3. In T 2, there were no cases of coexistence of HT and PTC. ConclusionThere is a rate of 26. 8 % of patients with association between TH and CPT, but without differences in relation to tumor size...|$|E

Distributed object systems require objects to remotely communicate and perform coordinated computations. Migration of objects is an important aspect of distributed object computation as it can help to alleviate the effect of object or node failures and communications latency [1]. However, migrating a running object and associated thread proves to be a tedious and difficult job. This paper discusses a technique to migrate Java objects across a distributed computing environment called AdJava [2, 3] with the help of software agents and <b>without</b> changing <b>th...</b>|$|R
