5|$|Between Operations Trident and Python, and the Indian Air Force {{attacks on}} Karachi's fuel and {{ammunition}} depots, {{more than fifty}} percent of the total fuel requirement of the Karachi zone was reported to have been destroyed. The result was a crippling economic blow to Pakistan. The damage was estimated to be worth $3billion, with most of the oil reserves and ammunition <b>warehouses</b> <b>and</b> workshops destroyed. The Pakistan Air Force was also affected by the loss of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, <b>warehouses</b> <b>and</b> museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In <b>warehouses</b> <b>and</b> museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} the value of integrating tactical <b>warehouse</b> <b>and</b> inventory decisions. Therefore, a global <b>warehouse</b> <b>and</b> inventory model is presented and solved. In order to solve this mathematical model, two solution methodologies are developed which offer different level of integration of <b>warehouse</b> <b>and</b> inventory decisions. Computational tests are performed on a real world database using multiple scenarios differing by the <b>warehouse</b> capacity limits <b>and</b> the <b>warehouse</b> <b>and</b> inventory costs. Our observation is that the total cost of the inventory <b>and</b> <b>warehouse</b> systems can be reduced drastically by taking into account the warehouse capacity restrictions in the inventory planning decisions, in an aggregate way. Moreover additional inventory <b>and</b> <b>warehouse</b> savings can be achieved by using more sophisticated integration methods for inventory <b>and</b> <b>warehouse</b> decisions. © 2009 Elsevier B.

5|$|Ice had to {{be stored}} at {{multiple}} points between harvesting and its final use by a customer. One method for doing this was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at regional depots after it had been shipped out. Early ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large <b>warehouses</b> <b>and</b> contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|E

Lots there, at the time, ran {{all the way to}} the river's waterline, giving their owners the unusual advantage of river and street frontage. The sloping bluff also allowed them to build multi-story <b>warehouses</b> <b>and</b> granaries closer to the unloading points along the river.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bristol's {{architecture}} is the Bristol Byzantine style. Characterised by complicated polychrome brick and decorative arches, this style {{was used in}} the construction of factories, <b>warehouses</b> <b>and</b> municipal buildings built in the Victorian era. Surviving examples include the Colston Hall, the Granary on Welsh Back, and the Gloucester Road Carriage Works, along with some of the buildings around Victoria Street. Several of the warehouses around the harbour have also survived, including the Arnolfini, which now houses an art gallery. Clarks Wood Company warehouse, the St Vincent's Works in Silverthorne Lane, and the Wool Hall in St Thomas Street, are other survivors from the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|By 1911, <b>warehouses</b> <b>and</b> {{factories}} cramped the Prairie Avenue District. Large industry overtook {{the district}} by 1950. Early 21st century deindustrialisation, urban congestion, and historic preservation {{have brought the}} return of trendy buildings, and restored as well as renovated structures. Simultaneously new infill housing is resuscitating the district. Now, the historic northern section of the street {{is part of the}} Chicago Landmark Prairie Avenue District that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was declared a Chicago Landmark on December 27, 1979, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 1972. The historic district includes the 1800 and 1900-blocks of South Prairie, the 1800 block of South Indiana and 211 through 217 East Cullerton.|$|E
5|$|Hughes disliked loans, so he {{financed the}} {{purchase}} {{and development of}} new properties primarily through real estate limited partnerships (RELPs). At first, Public Storage built <b>warehouses</b> <b>and</b> sold them to independent RELPs for a development fee. The company's own RELP, called Public Storage Partners Ltd, was formed in 1975 and closed its first deal for $3 million in investments two years later. Public Storage paid cash to acquire property and build a self-storage facility, then used the property's income to pay investors back and earn a portion as profit. Public Storage Inc. also earned revenues from a portion of each deal that was made.|$|E

5|$|In Cuba, {{slightly}} over 228,000 residents were evacuated from low-lying areas before the storm. Around 10% stayed in temporary shelters, {{while the rest}} stayed with family or friends. Included in the evacuation total were 6,000 tourists and over 1,000 residents in rickety houses. Workers protected tobacco leaves by moving them to sealed <b>warehouses,</b> <b>and</b> transported cattle and livestock to higher ground. The hurricane forced the closure of schools and the cancellation of some flights. The Cuban government issued a Hurricane Watch for Pinar del Río Province, Havana, Havana Province, and Isla de la Juventud 21hours before Irene hit. These areas, along with Matanzas Province, were upgraded to a Hurricane Warning 15hours before Irene hit the area.|$|E
5|$|In December 1941 {{there were}} two raids. The first was Operation Anklet, a raid on the Lofoten Islands by No. 12 Commando on 26 December. The German {{garrison}} {{was in the midst}} of their Christmas celebrations and was easily overcome; the Commandos re-embarked after two days. Operation Archery was a larger raid at Vågsøy Island. This raid involved men from Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 6 Commandos, a Royal Navy flotilla, and limited air support. The raid caused significant damage to factories, <b>warehouses,</b> <b>and</b> the German garrison, and sank eight ships. After this the Germans increased the garrison in Norway by an extra 30,000 troops, upgraded coastal and inland defences, and sent a number of capital ships to the area.|$|E

The highway continues on, curving northward to cross the Raquette River. It curves back to the northwest on the northern riverbank and passes by a mixture of homes and commercial establishments before intersecting NY37 south of the village center. NY420 ends here; however, the road continues north {{into the heart of}} the village as Main Street.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{priorities}} of the regeneration was {{the restoration of the}} dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock's vast <b>warehouses</b> <b>and</b> repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.|$|E
5|$|Prior to World War II Degesch derived {{most of its}} Zyklon B {{profits from}} {{overseas}} sales, particularly in the United States, where it was produced under license by Roessler & Hasslacher prior to 1931 and by American Cyanamid from 1931 to 1943. From 1929, the United States Public Health Service used Zyklon B to disinfest freight trains and clothes of Mexican immigrants entering the United States. Uses in Germany included delousing clothing (often using a portable sealed chamber invented by Degesch in the 1930s) and disinfesting ships, <b>warehouses,</b> <b>and</b> trains. By 1943, sales of Zyklon B accounted for 65 per cent of Degesch's sales revenue and 70 per cent of its gross profits.|$|E
5|$|The area east of Michigan Avenue {{and north}} of the Chicago River had a split {{personality}} {{for much of the}} 20th century - the northern portion upscale residential, retail, and university uses and the area near the Chicago River and Navy Pier dedicated to shipping and factories.
