5|$|In Commonwealth realms {{other than}} the UK, royal assent is granted or <b>withheld</b> either by the realm's {{sovereign}} or, more frequently, by {{the representative of the}} sovereign, the governor-general. In federated realms, assent in each state, province, or territory is granted or <b>withheld</b> by the representatives of the sovereign. In Australia, this is the governors of the states, administrators of the territories, or the governor-general in the Australian Capital Territory. For Canada, this is the lieutenant governors of the provinces. A lieutenant governor may defer assent to the governor general, and the governor general may defer assent to federal bills to the sovereign.|$|E
5|$|In mid-November 2008, Zardari's {{government}} officially sent {{a letter}} of intent to the IMF regarding a bailout to help increase its foreign exchange reserves. In a $11.3 billion multi-year loan package, Pakistan received a $7.4 billion loan for 2008–10. The IMF stipulated stringent reform conditions, which included rebuilding the tax structure and privatising state enterprises. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank <b>withheld</b> a combined $3 billion aid in the 2010–11 fiscal year and the IMF <b>withheld</b> since May 2010 the last segment of its aid package.|$|E
5|$|The European {{powers were}} locked in {{internal}} conflicts: e.g. the war in Lombardy. Skanderbeg believed {{that the threat of}} Mehmed launching his <b>withheld</b> European campaigns was at its highest. He sent urgent requests to Venice to prepare for a new Ottoman offensive, thus attempting to develop an Albanian-Venetian alliance. While recognizing the threat and Skanderbeg's sovereignty over Albania, Venice <b>withheld</b> an establishment of an alliance. Alfonso promised to send men and an annual pension of 1500 ducats to Skanderbeg, whereas Pope Nicholas V sent 5,000 florins. Albania, Ragusa, Serbia, and Hungary then made a loose anti-Ottoman coalition to halt any future Turkish expansions.|$|E
5|$|The {{injunction}} {{was granted}} by default on 19 March 1954. The judge ordered that all accumulators, parts and instructions be destroyed, and {{that several of}} Reich's books that mentioned orgone be <b>withheld.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before a {{bill passed}} by the {{legislative}} Houses can become law, the royal assent (the monarch's approval) is required. In theory, assent can either be granted (making the bill law) or <b>withheld</b> (vetoing the bill), but since 1707 assent has always been granted.|$|E
5|$|Deposit {{funds are}} similar to the agency funds used by state and local governments for assets {{belonging}} to individuals and other entities, held temporarily by the government. State income taxes <b>withheld</b> from a federal government employee's pay, not yet paid to the state, are an example of deposit funds.|$|E
5|$|On 29 March 2008, Zimbabwe held {{a presidential}} {{election}} along with a parliamentary election. The results of this election were <b>withheld</b> for two weeks, after which it was generally acknowledged that the Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai (MDC-T) had achieved a majority of one seat in the lower house of parliament.|$|E
5|$|The Court further {{determined}} that states {{could not be}} forced to participate in the Medicaid expansion. ACA <b>withheld</b> all Medicaid funding from states declining to participate in the expansion. The Court ruled that this withdrawal of funding was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual states had the right to opt out without losing preexisting Medicaid funding.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the trial}} judge had criticized the police investigation, Essex Police held an {{internal}} inquiry, conducted by Detective Chief Superintendent Dickinson. Bamber alleged this report confirmed that evidence had been <b>withheld</b> by the police, so he made a formal complaint, which was investigated in 1991 by the City of London Police. This process uncovered more documentation, which Bamber used to petition the Home Secretary in September 1993 for a referral back to the Court of Appeal, refused in July 1994.|$|E
5|$|In December 2012, Hopsin hinted on his Facebook and Twitter {{pages that}} him and Travis Barker {{were working on}} a project together, though further details were <b>withheld</b> at the time. Then, in late December, Travis Barker {{revealed}} that a collaboration EP would be released in 2013. Then, on February 5, 2013, Hopsin announced that production for the EP had been finished.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the McCanns' legal efforts against Gonçalo Amaral and his publisher, the McCanns and Tapas Seven brought libel actions against several newspapers. The Daily Express, Daily Star and their sister Sunday papers, owned by Northern & Shell, published front-page apologies in 2008 and donated £550,000 to Madeleine's Fund. The Tapas Seven were awarded £375,000 against the Express group, also donated to Madeleine's Fund, along with an apology in the Daily Express. The McCanns received £55,000 from The Sunday Times in 2013 when the newspaper implied that they had <b>withheld</b> e-fits from the police.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Sir Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) is {{determined}} {{to carry out his}} revenge on London's FSB head of operations Arkady Kachimov (Stuart Wilson), who in the previous episode purposely <b>withheld</b> intelligence that caused the death of Adam Carter. However, the MI5 team discover he is overseeing a cyber attack in progress, and returned officer Lucas North (Richard Armitage) may be involved. In the end, MI5 stop the attack, and Harry kills Kachimov.|$|E
5|$|It was {{intended}} to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that <b>withheld</b> the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so—something that it was thought the states would not accept.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{suggests}} thatunlike Wagner, Alkan did {{not seek}} to refashion the world through opera; nor, like Berlioz, to dazzle the crowds by putting orchestral music {{at the service of}} literary expression; nor even, as with Chopin or Liszt, to extend the field of harmonic idiom. Armed with his key instrument, the piano, he sought incessantly to transcend its inherent technical limits, remaining apparently insensible to the restrictions which had <b>withheld</b> more restrained composers.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{would become}} the first inmate to be {{executed}} in a new chamber that was built in 1998 at Utah State Prison for use in either firing squads or lethal injections. Two people, whose identities were <b>withheld,</b> were selected to administer individual injections, of which only one was lethal so that neither would know with certainty who executed the prisoner. The prison selected among paramedics or nurses because the American Medical Association prohibits licensed physicians from participating in executions. A mild sedative was delivered intravenously to calm Parsons before the deadly drugs were administered.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard {{released}} the e-fits in 2013 for a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction. After it had aired, The Sunday Times published that the McCanns {{had had the}} e-fits since 2008. In response the couple sued the newspaper for having implied (wrongly) {{that they had not}} only failed to publish them but had <b>withheld</b> them from the police. The newspaper apologized and paid £55,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|Star Trek: Enterprise {{follows the}} adventures of {{the crew of the}} {{starship}} Enterprise, designation NX-01. They are the first deep space explorers in Starfleet, using the first Warp 5 equipped vessel. At the start of the series, it is revealed that the Vulcans have <b>withheld</b> advanced technology from humanity since their first contact, concerned that humans were not ready for it. This has delayed human space exploration and caused resentment in Captain Jonathan Archer, whose father developed the Warp 5 engine but did not live to see it used.|$|E
5|$|Testimony {{was also}} heard before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence {{and can be}} found in the Congressional Record for those bodies. The Senate Intelligence Committee {{produced}} two reports: Preliminary Inquiry into the Sale of Arms to Iran and Possible Diversion of Funds to the Nicaraguan Resistance (February 2, 1987) and Were Relevant Documents <b>Withheld</b> from the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair? (June 1989).|$|E
5|$|The Ineligibility Clause has {{interfered}} with appointments {{as far back}} as 1793. President George Washington attempted to appoint William Paterson to the Supreme Court on February 27, 1793, after the resignation of Associate Justice Thomas Johnson. However, Paterson, who was serving as Governor of New Jersey, had previously been elected to serve a Senate term that would expire at noon on March 4, 1793. Washington withdrew the nomination and <b>withheld</b> it until the afternoon of March 4, when the term for the disqualifying office had expired.|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) is {{responsible}} for developing and enforcing regulations for pipeline operation transportation having been created in 2004 within the United States Department of Transportation. In the months following the spill, {{they found that the}} in-line inspection tool used by Plains in Line 901 and Line 903 had miscalculated the degree of corrosion. The company also <b>withheld</b> in-line inspection data so “it could enhance its interpretation of the data,” according to a corrective order issued by PHMSA. In October, PHMSA proposed new rules to assist in preventing such inspection discrepancies.|$|E
5|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{not being}} a corporation, and having no such corporate name, could not at common law maintain an action. This right, however, was more than 40 years ago conferred by statute, which, among other things, provides that the Seneca Nation of Indians may maintain any action of ejectment to recover the possession of {{any part of the}} Allegany and Cattaraugus reservations unlawfully <b>withheld</b> from them.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been cases of {{available}} treatment being <b>withheld</b> during clinical trials. In 1996 in Kano, Nigeria, the drug company Pfizer compared a new antibiotic during a meningitis outbreak to a competing antibiotic that {{was known to be}} effective at a higher dose than was used during the trial. Goldacre writes that 11 children died, divided almost equally between the two groups. The families taking part in the trial were apparently not told that the competing antibiotic at the effective dose was available from Médecins Sans Frontières in the next-door building.|$|E
5|$|After {{approximately}} three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening meal was <b>withheld.</b> That caused the prisoners to riot, breaking fittings; during the commotion, three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries. Additional police and wardens arrived at 5 pm, but took seven hours to subdue the prisoners, {{with the last}} of them locked in their cells just after midnight. The extent of the damage was in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, Karnet, and Barton's Mill. However, other improvements could not be undertaken without funding from the state government, which did not consider prison reform a priority.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing out}} on a UEFA berth for 1971–72, Manchester City were invited {{to play in the}} Texaco Cup, a {{competition}} for English, Scottish and Irish teams. City fielded a weakened side for the second leg of their tie against Airdrieonians. As punishment Manchester City had their £1,000 prize money <b>withheld</b> and were banned from the competition for two years. Upon the expiry of the suspension in 1974, the club entered the competition again, but exited in the group stage. The tournament saw Denis Law play his final matches as a professional. The withdrawal of Irish teams saw the competition renamed the Anglo-Scottish Cup the following year. Again, City failed to progress beyond the group stage.|$|E
5|$|After {{the club}} <b>withheld</b> payment to Swan, the PFA put an embargo on new manager Neil Warnock, though only after Swan began to disrupt {{training}} sessions did Warnock arrange {{a move to}} Second Division Burnley for £200,000. Swan stalled the move in anticipation for his missing wages from Plymouth, and continued to disrupt pre-season friendlies when Warnock called him up due to a developing injury crisis; eventually he negotiated a settlement of £25,000. Burnley manager Jimmy Mullen got the sack after a poor start to 1995–96, and his replacement Adrian Heath was appointed in March 1996.|$|E
5|$|After the fight, the purses {{for both}} fighters were <b>withheld</b> until {{video of the}} fight could be reviewed. Don King argued that Mayweather should have been disqualified because his uncle {{was the first person}} to enter the ring. At an April 13 hearing, the Nevada State Athletic Commission fined Roger Mayweather $200,000 and revoked his boxing license for one year. At a hearing on May 8, the Commission disciplined the other {{offenders}} in the melee. It fined Yoel Judah $100,000 and revoked his license for one year, fined Mayweather cornerman Leonard Ellerbe $50,000 and suspended his license for four months, and fined Zab Judah $350,000 and revoked his license for one year.|$|E
5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were <b>withheld</b> by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|As a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Rudolphine Tables {{and the related}} Ephemerides, Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was <b>withheld.</b> In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather {{as well as political}} events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions. By 1624, however, the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.|$|E
5|$|Attendances {{continued}} to increase during {{the remainder of the}} 1900s, as 121,452 saw the 1908 Scotland v England match. The two Old Firm matches played for the 1909 Scottish Cup Final attracted a total of 131,000. After the second match there was a riot because there was confusion over what would happen next when the second match also ended in a draw. The fans believed that the replay would be played to a conclusion and demanded that a period of extra time be played. The Scottish Cup trophy was <b>withheld</b> as Hampden was not in a fit condition to host a second replay. In response to the riot, the Scottish Football Association decided not to use Hampden as the Scottish Cup Final venue until after the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Britain, {{with its}} {{commitment}} to South Arabia and its base in Aden, considered the Egyptian invasion a real threat. Recognition of the republic posed a problem to several treaties Britain had signed with the sheiks and sultans of the South Arabian Federation. Saudi Arabia urged the British to identify themselves with the royalists. On the other hand, there were some in the British Foreign Office who believed Britain could buy security for Aden by recognizing the republic. However, Britain eventually decided not to recognize. Iran, Turkey and most of western Europe also <b>withheld</b> recognition. The republic did receive the recognition of West Germany, Italy, Canada and Australia, {{as well as the}} remaining Arab governments, Ethiopia and the entire communist bloc.|$|E
5|$|Cooley {{maintained}} friendly {{relations and}} {{trade with the}} Seminole Indians in the area. In the early nineteenth century, Creek Indians had moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to insufficient evidence after a hearing at the Monroe County Court in Key West. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he <b>withheld</b> evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.|$|E
5|$|Dato Mogol died in 1620 and was {{succeeded by}} his eldest son, Sulaiman. A period of turmoil erupted {{ten years later}} when the Queen of Pattani branded the new ruler of Siam, King Prasat Thong, a usurper and tyrant. The queen <b>withheld</b> tribute and ordered attacks on Ligor (present-day Nakhon Si Thammarat) and Bordelongh (present-day Phatthalung); Ayuthaya responded by blockading Pattani with an army of 60,000 men, as well as enlisting {{the help of the}} Dutch people in {{capturing}} the City. Singora became involved in the dispute and in 1633 sent an envoy to Ayuthaya requesting help. The outcome of this request is not known, but Dutch records show that Singora was severely damaged and the pepper crop destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Distributed in most territories by 20th Century Fox, The Great Silence was theatrically {{released}} to a mediocre commercial reception in Italy, but it fared better in other countries. The film was <b>withheld</b> from release in the United States until 2001, {{when it was}} made available on DVD by Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment. Controversial for its bleak and dark tone, the film's reputation grew, and it gained a cult following {{in the wake of}} its release. The Great Silence is now widely regarded by fans and authorities on Spaghetti Westerns {{as one of the greatest}} films of the genre, and is acknowledged as Corbucci's masterpiece. Praise has gone to the acting, the utilization of snowbound landscapes, Ennio Morricone's score, and the film's subversion of several conventions of the Western film genre.|$|E
5|$|Downey {{was able}} to return to the big screen only after Mel Gibson, who had been a close friend to Downey since both had co-starred in Air America, paid Downey's {{insurance}} bond for the 2003 film The Singing Detective. Gibson's gamble paved the way for Downey's comeback and Downey returned to mainstream films in the mid-2000s with Gothika, for which producer Joel Silver <b>withheld</b> 40 percent of his salary until after production wrapped as insurance against his addictive behavior. Similar clauses have become standard in his contracts since then. Silver, who was getting closer to Downey as he dated his assistant Susan Levin, also got the actor the leading role in the comedy thriller Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the directorial debut of screenwriter Shane Black.|$|E
5|$|During his {{lifetime}} Bruce received many awards: the Gold Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 1904; the Patron's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1910; the Neill prize and Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1913, and the Livingstone Medal of the American Geographical Society in 1920. He also received an honorary LLD {{degree from the}} University of Aberdeen. The honour that eluded him, however, was the Polar Medal, awarded by the Sovereign {{on the recommendation of}} the Royal Geographical Society. Although the Medal was awarded to the members of every other British or Commonwealth Antarctic expedition during the early 20th century, the SNAE was the exception; the medal was <b>withheld.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ford's {{first step}} into {{organised}} team football came with local Swansea based side Tower United, joining the club {{at the age}} of 15 as a full-back. Despite his young age, he played for the senior men's side in local amateur leagues where he attracted scouts from several clubs. The scouts included Albert Lindon of Arsenal, who invited Ford and teammate Frank Davies to attend a trial in Cardiff. Ford impressed enough to be offered an amateur contract with the London-based side, which was initially to be <b>withheld</b> until the end of hostilities in the Second World War. However, Ford himself rejected the contract as he felt he was too young too move away from his home and family.|$|E
