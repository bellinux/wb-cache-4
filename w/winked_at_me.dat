60|$|Mother {{took it out}} on me with {{a lecture}} on disobedience. She must have known, after what I had done, that father wouldn't let her smack me; for, while she was lecturing, father <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> across her shoulder. It {{was the first time}} he had ever <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{shook with}} laughter, and then <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> very roguishly.|$|E
60|$|He {{nodded and}} <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> A wicked-looking old fellow; just the man I wanted.|$|E
60|$|Here the Prince {{made his}} eyes first flash and then <b>wink</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
5000|$|I {{like the}} way she <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> but I leave her with the highwayman ...|$|R
5000|$|Porsche {{with a side}} <b>wink</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> replied: [...] "The {{last two}} {{cylinders}} are reserves." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe {{once more}} <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> solemnly {{over the head}} of my {{stricken}} connection.|$|E
60|$|I caught Filby's eye {{over the}} {{shoulder}} of the Medical Man, and he <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> solemnly.|$|E
60|$|I got him the ale before I {{announced}} him. He <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as he put}} it to his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} only have seen him <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> all the time, pretending to be so rough to escape thanking," [...] exclaimed Caleb, when the door was shut.|$|R
6000|$|... "So long as I can see great round, red Mr. Sun and he <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> I can't be lost," [...] thought Johnny Chuck, {{and trotted}} on looking for clover.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm blessed!" [...] cried Hilary Joyce. [...] "Of all the impudent scoundrels! He {{keeps on}} <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Who are you, you rascal? Give {{an account of}} yourself! D'ye hear?" ...|$|R
60|$|At this stage, Mr. Bundercombe, who {{was quite}} irrepressible, <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> slowly. I took no notice of him whatever.|$|E
60|$|As I led {{him along}} the {{passage to the}} library Josephine passed us. Mr. Dark <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again, and made her a low bow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never!" [...] {{she almost}} shrieked, and he <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{as if it}} were the best joke in the world. [...] "Never, as long as houses have stairs!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{never did}} in my days behold {{anything}} like Mowcher {{as she stood}} upon the dining table, intensely enjoying this refreshment, rubbing busily at Steerforth's head, and <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> over it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have got}} to the {{deductions}} and the inferences," [...] said Lestrade, <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I won't; I don't like him. He <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and growls when I touch him," [...] muttered naughty Cy, {{remembering how}} much reason poor Sanch had to {{distrust}} his tormentor.|$|R
60|$|My neighbour, a fat, jolly man, told me {{all about}} it. His neighbour, a {{handsome}} tipsy man, kept contradicting and saying it wasn't so. But my fat neighbour <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> not to take offence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right y'are, Sir," [...] he said briskly. [...] "Ye'll excoose me, I know, for a-chaffin' of ye, but the {{old woman}} here <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> which was as much as telling me to go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don’t make it worse," [...] said Rosa kindly. [...] "I {{suppose you}} can’t help it, {{and ought to}} be pitied for it really. Now I know why it was you <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> when you came to the house the other day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear,' said Mr. Omer, 'I don't say it's {{the case}} with you,' <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> 'but I say that half the women in Yarmouth--ah! and in five mile round--are mad against that girl.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found myself}} {{looking into a}} bright brown eye that gleamed with genial triumph. The other was closed. In the {{exuberance}} of the moment, Smooth Sam had had the bad taste to <b>wink</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a chance}} for some waggish baboon to drop a nut or a berry in!" [...] said Peterkin, <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with one eye as he lay down in the spot from which I had just risen.|$|R
60|$|Not improbably my strong {{impression}} that the spider on my knee deliberately <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{was the result of}} memory, enlivening imagination. But it sufficed to bring to mind, in one rapid, consoling flash, the irrevocable law of destiny--that the deeds of the wicked return unto them again.|$|E
60|$|He {{was very}} sleepy, poor fellow, and could hardly smile {{at his own}} absurd fancy. He was asleep almost instantly. In fact, I {{do not believe that}} he again opened the eye with which he had <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> but that he merely shut the other and began to slumber forthwith.|$|E
60|$|I did so and {{promptly}} produced the brooch. Lord Porthoning's eyes seemed almost {{to start from}} his head. I {{could see that he}} suddenly became limp in Mr. Bundercombe's grasp. His eyes were fixed on the jewels and his amazement was undeniable. Mr. Bundercombe <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> over his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said her}} husband, with a <b>wink</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "I {{thought it was}} to be {{continued}} in our next," [...] and he nodded towards the door that opened from his wife's bower into the room adjoining.|$|R
5000|$|Borislav [...] "Boro" [...] Drljača (born August 29, 1941) is a Serbian folk singer {{popular in}} former Yugoslavia. His biggest hits are Stari vuk ("Old wolf"), Ne namiguj na me tuđa ženo ("Don't <b>wink</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> you other person's woman"), and Plači, mala, plači ("Cry, baby, cry"), written by Baja Mali Knindža.|$|R
60|$|He was not fond of petting, but {{allowed one}} or two honored beings to cuddle him. My work-basket was his {{favorite}} bed, for a certain fat cushion suited him for a pillow, and, having coolly pulled out all the pins, the rascal would lay his handsome head on the red mound, and <b>wink</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with an irresistibly saucy expression that {{made it impossible to}} scold.|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} {{by this time}} that no ale could do that, and I told him so. He chuckled, <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and, taking another pinch of snuff, said he would now turn the whole case over in his mind again, {{and make sure that}} he had got all the {{bearings}} of it quite clear.|$|E
60|$|This {{question}} I concluded not to hear, {{and demanded}} {{if he had}} any idea of Artesian wells; but he simply raised his eyebrows; while Mr. Gliddon <b>winked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> very hard and said, in a low tone, that one had been recently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the Great Oasis.|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean he {{contents}} {{himself with}} winking at her? My dear fellow, that wasn't {{enough for you}} yesterday, and it wouldn't have been enough for you this morning, among the impressions that led to our last talk. It was {{just the fact that}} you did wink, that you had <b>winked,</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> that wound me up." ...|$|E
5000|$|Watkins was a {{lover of}} outdoor {{recreation}} and an [...] "ardent trout fisherman" [...] who [...] "never lost an opportunity, when practice would permit, {{to get into the}} river." [...] He spent much time fishing in the Boulder River and often joked that [...] "there's a fish up there I've been trying to catch for a long time. It always comes up and <b>winks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> but will never bite my line." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Jarndyce, sir," [...] Mr. Guppy, after a moment's consideration, began, to {{the great}} {{diversion}} of his mother, which she displayed by nudging Mr. Jobling with her elbow and <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in a most remarkable manner, [...] "I had an idea that I should see Miss Summerson by herself and was not quite prepared for your esteemed presence. But Miss Summerson has mentioned to you, perhaps, that something has passed between us on former occasions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The same anxiety to {{get them}} by {{themselves}} was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, [...] "What is the matter mamma? What do you keep <b>winking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for? What am I to do?" ...|$|R
