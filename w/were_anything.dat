Among the most notable of these endorsements came from Andrew Sullivan and Paul Craig Roberts, while a series of editorials in Pat Buchanan's The American Conservative magazine made a conservative case for several candidates, with Scott McConnell formally endorsing Kerry, and Justin Raimondo giving the nod to independent Ralph Nader.|$|E
25|$|However, in a {{surprise}} move, Sikorsky then {{withdrew from the}} contest, because the SeaHawk was seen by the CF as too small, and furthermore the Sikorsky was competing with its own interests, having bought part of troubled Westland Helicopters, which was offering the EH-101. Aérospatiale {{in the middle of}} the contest then tipped its hand by suddenly redubbing its offering as the AS532 Cougar.

25|$|Despite (or {{perhaps because}} of) {{the fact that}} Wonder Woman {{had fallen in love}} with the first Steve Trevor, the {{producers}} chose to drop any suggestion that Steve Jr. and Wonder Woman <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> more than good friends. Indeed, when an impostor posing as Steve Jr. attempted to seduce Diana, she made it quite clear that she had no sexual interest in him. Executive producer Douglas S.

The video features Carey being held hostage in a mansion, which she escapes in a James Bond-themed plot. Subsequent scenes see Carey escaping her assailants on a watercraft, dancing aboard a ship with sailors, and frolicking on a beautiful island with her lover. The video garnered much coverage, as many comparisons were made between the video and the rumors of Carey's failing marriage. While Carey denied the comparisons <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> more than coincidence, many close friends including Walter Afanasieff, Carey's writing partner, felt they were more than obvious.|$|E
500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, {{evidence}} for the existence of viruses was obtained from experiments with filters that had pores too small for bacteria to pass through; the term [...] "filterable virus" [...] was coined to describe them. Until the 1930s most scientists believed that viruses were small bacteria, but following the invention of the electron microscope in 1931 they were shown to be completely different, to a degree that not all scientists were convinced they <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> other than accumulations of toxic proteins. The situation changed radically when it was discovered that viruses contain genetic material in the form of DNA or RNA. Once they were recognised as distinct biological entities they were soon shown to be the cause of numerous infections of plants, animals and even bacteria.|$|E
500|$|A few critics {{disagree}} with the speculation over Giraud's and Byron's relationship. The early 20th-century biographer Ethel Mayne points out both the frequency of such relationships in Byron's life and their inherent ambiguity when she says, [...] "His stay was also marked by one of those ambiguous friendships with a youth infinitely below him in rank which have already been seen to recur in his life... The patron {{was supposed to be}} learning Italian from this made a pretext for giving him, on their parting at Malta in 1811... a considerable sum of money". Elizabeth Longford, in her 1976 biography, disagrees with the claims that there was a physical relationship between the two and argues, [...] "Byron's especial favourite among the 'ragazzi' was Nicolo Giraud. He had first taken up with Nicolo while Hobhouse was away in Euboea the year before, but {{there is no evidence that}} his feelings for Nicolo <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> but romantic and protective." [...] Jerome Christensen followed this view in 1993 and adds, [...] "we know little more than what Byron tells us".|$|E

[...] This quote, written by the Sicilian philosopher Gorgias, was used to show his theory that ‘there is nothing’, ‘if there <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> {{no one would know}} it’, ‘and if anyone did know it, no one could communicate it’. This theory, thought of in the late 5th century BC, is still being contemplated by many philosophers throughout the world. This argument has led some to label Gorgias a nihilist (one who believes nothing exists, or that the world is incomprehensible, and that the concept of truth is fictitious).|$|E
2500|$|Milton wrote {{during a}} period when {{thoughts}} about divorce <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> but simplistic; rather, there was active debate among thinkers and intellectuals at the time. However, Milton's basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals, particularly the Westminster divines. Milton addressed the Assembly {{on the matter of}} divorce in August 1643, at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter. In the , Milton argued that divorce was a private matter, not a legal or ecclesiastical one. Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas. In fact, when the Westminster Assembly wrote the [...] they allowed for divorce (...) in cases of infidelity or abandonment. Thus, the Christian community, at least a majority within the 'Puritan' sub-set, approved of Milton's views.|$|E

With the success of Wavelength Morrison assembled a band to promote it, which was similar in many ways to the abandoned Caledonia Soul Orchestra of It's Too Late to Stop Now fame. During the Wavelength tour, Morrison performed in his native Belfast [...] {{for the first time since}} leaving for the US to record [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] for Bang Records. Morrison's first video, Van Morrison in Ireland, released in 1981, resulted from these performances and featured two songs from the album: [...] "Wavelength" [...] and [...] "Checkin' It Out".|$|E

2500|$|... {{collection}} The Woman at the Washington Zoo was published. [...] Starting {{with this}} book, Jarrell broke free of Auden's influence {{and the influence}} of the New Critics and developed a style that mixed Modernist and Romantic influences, incorporating the aesthetics of William Wordsworth in order to create more sympathetic character sketches and dramatic monologues. The scholar Stephen Burt notes, [...] "Jarrell took from Wordsworth the idea that poems had to be 'convincing as speech' before they <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> else." [...] His final volume, The Lost World, published in 1965, continued in the same style and cemented Jarrell's reputation as a poet; many critics consider it to be his best work. Stephen Burt states that [...] "in the 'Lost World' poems and throughout Jarrell's oeuvre[...] [...]he took care to define and defend the self [...] [...] [...]his lonely personae seek intersubjective confirmation and [...] [...] [...]his alienated characters resist the so-called social world." [...] Burt identifies the chief influences on Jarrell's poetry to be [...] "Proust, Wordsworth, Rilke, Freud, and the poets and thinkers of Jarrell's era [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|But despite {{continuing}} technological advances, {{from the}} 1870s onward, {{the idea that}} history and civilization were inherently progressive, and that progress was always good, came under increasing attack. Arguments arose that {{the values of the}} artist and those of society were not merely different, but that Society was antithetical to Progress, and could not move forward in its present form. The philosopher Schopenhauer (1788–1860) (The World as Will and Representation, 1819) called into question the previous optimism, and his ideas had an important influence on later thinkers, including Nietzsche. Two of the most significant thinkers of the period were biologist Charles Darwin (1809–82), author of On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859), and political scientist Karl Marx (1818–83), author of Das Kapital (1867). Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection undermined religious certainty and the idea of human uniqueness. In particular, the notion that human beings were driven by the same impulses as [...] "lower animals" [...] proved to be difficult to reconcile with the idea of an ennobling spirituality. Karl Marx argued that there were fundamental contradictions within the capitalist system, and that the workers <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> but free.|$|E

[...] In 1958 de Ovies began writing a column for the Metropolitan Herald, an Atlanta weekly newspaper. [...] De Ovies was {{on the cutting edge of}} treating alcoholism as a treatable illness and his book Dear Drunks published in 1958 was an outgrowth of his sessions treating alcoholics and an effort to de-stigmatize alcoholism and its treatment in an era when most people saw alcoholism as a person failing or a lack of self-control or discipline. [...] That same April the magazine Pastoral Psychology named de Ovies it's [...] "Man of the Month" [...] for his work as chaplain of the Peachtree Sanitarium and at the Georgian Clinic.|$|E
