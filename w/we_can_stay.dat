6000|$|... "No; that's just it. I do wish I {{had some}} money now. You won't mind if I am not home quite early? We all mean to dine {{there at the}} kitchen. The girls will bring something, and then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> out the whole afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Were ever two men-at-arms so tyrannised over by {{a little}} dolly such as this!' said I, laughing. 'Nay, little one, we shall {{compound}} with you by paying you this shilling, which will buy all your milk. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> here and drink it at our ease.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not want}} to do that, as long as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{possibly}} <b>stay</b> here. I think that, when night comes, we ought to make a sortie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, mamma! The Gores can do {{very well}} without us. That was only to be a week and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> still <b>stay</b> out our time. Of course this has only been sent because we are here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would like}} to ride--a long way away," [...] she declared, breathlessly. [...] "Or the motor-car--I shouldn't mind that. I should like {{to go as far}} away as ever <b>we</b> <b>can,</b> and <b>stay</b> away until it is dark. Could we start {{directly}} after breakfast?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For Heaven's sake! don't talk any more," [...] {{said the}} editor, wiping his eyes, [...] "but try to {{remember}} if you ever had any neighbors about here where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> tonight. We can't walk to Summit Springs, and we can't camp out on these ruins." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh clean," [...] I answered, [...] "clean as Eve in the garden. But can we keep clean? Won't {{the shadow}} of our falsehoods darken at all? Come out of it while we are still clean. Come with me. Justin will divorce you. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> abroad and marry and come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{played the}} whole day, and Sigurd taught Helga {{all sorts of}} games she had never even heard of. As they walked home in the evening she said: 'We shall {{be able to play}} better still to-morrow, for my father will {{have to go to the}} town, so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> at home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's getting trickier every minute," [...] said Ellerby. [...] "The {{only thing}} is, if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>stay</b> in, <b>we</b> {{might have a}} chance. The wicket'll get better, and I don't believe they've any bowling at all bar de Freece. By George, Bob's out!... No, he isn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O {{flower of}} the law! robbers have {{exercised}} great tyranny upon us, so great indeed that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> no longer <b>stay</b> in this city." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, lad, you are forgiven. God forbid that I should judge you or any man! Sir John shall come up {{and marry}} you; and then, if it still be your will to stay, the Lord forgive you, if you be wrong; in the meanwhile, we will leave with you all that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> spare. <b>Stay</b> here and pray to God to make you, and me too, wiser men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not expect}} {{anything}} of the sort!" [...] exclaimed Edna. [...] "With Ralph and two men to defend us, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> here a long time. As for the captain's being lost, I do not think of it for a moment. He knows how to manage a boat too well for that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If--yes; but Travis MAY so arrange that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay,</b> or I {{make only}} one voyage out to settle matters {{and then come}} home for good. If you are still bent on Carrigaboola you might come as far as Frisco with me. I {{may have to go}} there about the Californian affairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} busy writing," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "nearly all the morning. It {{is such a}} still and quiet place here that I think I had better stay and finish up my writing. Besides, it must be an {{economical}} place, I think, and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> here a day cheaper than we can farther up the river, at the large towns." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you bother Polly. She 'd rather go, and I don't wonder. Let 's {{be just as}} jolly as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{while she}} <b>stays,</b> and finish up with your party, Fan," [...] said Tom, {{in a tone that}} settled the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Directly, my dear; your papa wishes it done at once. We're {{to have a}} dinner-party {{this day}} week--that'll be Thursday; and we'll get {{as many of the}} people as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to <b>stay</b> afterwards; and we'll get the O'Joscelyns to come on Wednesday, just to make the table look not quite so bare, and I want you to write the notes at once. There'll be a great many things to be got from Dublin too." ...|$|R
40|$|Universities {{all over}} the United States are wrestling with budget {{challenges}} unequaled since the early eighties. There is a tendency in times like these to say, ‘What <b>can</b> <b>we</b> do differently?” or “How <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> afloat?” Answers outside the response, “Focus on fundamental mission” are wrong, misguided, and short- sighted...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll stop at {{the first}} house that {{looks as if the}} folks who live in it might be willin' to help two fellers like us along, an' ask if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> all night," [...] he said to Snip, {{speaking}} in a more cheery tone than he had indulged in since the fear-inspiring advertisement had been brought to his attention.|$|E
6000|$|Simcoe made no answer; he {{knew that}} it was so, and could hardly hope that there would be an {{exception}} in their case. After thinking for a minute he said, [...] "Well, Bill, in that case I think the safest plan will be to take to the canoe at once. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> away a few weeks and then come back here and see how matters stand." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, ah fare you well; <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> no {{more with}} you, my love-- [...] Down, set down your liquor and your girl from off your knee; [...] For {{the wind has}} come to say: [...] "You must take me while you may, [...] If you'd go to Mother Carey, [...] (Walk her down to Mother Carey!)

"If {{nobody can}} be safe, do we still want this speed? <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> drink {{a glass of}} milk that's safe? <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> in an {{apartment}} that will not fall apart? <b>Can</b> the roads <b>we</b> travel on in our cities not collapse? <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> travel in safe trains?

2500|$|There was a mass {{of steroids}} used in the Tour, {{everyone}} will admit that. How <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> at the top otherwise? Even at Munich [...] it was used a lot. I hope the riders will get together next season and take action. Who can ride classics and long-distance Tours the whole year through without strengtheners? ...|$|R
50|$|During the 2008 recession, {{the owners}} had to {{liquidate}} their savings {{to keep the}} doors open at their Redondo Beach company, Cornerstone Construction Group. They laid off 15 workers, dropping to just nine employees by 2011. Sales dropped from $10 million to $2 million in one year.In 2012, and Braden was able to rehire four {{of the people he}} let go and brought on six new workers, including electricians, a framer, and a foreman. One reason the company has done well: It remodels and renovates hospitals.“That industry has been growing tremendously, leaps and bounds, and we are doing everything <b>we</b> <b>can</b> to <b>stay</b> abreast of the changes,” Braden said.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{probably}} {{hopes to}} find some place where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> in hiding for awhile. In {{this section of the}} country there are many large caverns in which streams of water are invariably found, thus causing the belief that a subterranean river flows from the valley to the sea. If we stop at one of them until it is decided we have succeeded in escaping, you {{will not be able to}} take the steamer as intended." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, then, we have night-time selves. And the night-self is {{the very}} basis of the dynamic self. The blood-consciousness and the blood-passion {{is the very}} source and origin of us. Not that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> at the source. Nor even make a goal of the source, as Freud does. The {{business}} of living is to travel away from the source. But you must start every single day fresh from the source. You must rise every day afresh {{out of the dark}} sea of the blood.|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{not so bad}} {{off here}} as we might be," [...] {{the old man said}} in a tone of content as he whittled away at the small remnant of ham, while we lads were {{stretched}} at full length on the hay. [...] "I'm allowin' that whatever happens, the Britishers won't look in a smoke-house for American soldiers or sailors, an' <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> here snug as bugs in a rug, barrin' bein a little hungry, till Amos' father is in better condition to travel." ...|$|E
40|$|Currently the {{development}} of Information Technology and Communication has made significant progress, which has largely changed the life of being human.

[...] "In fact it couldn't {{look much}} worse; {{but here we}} are, and while our ammunition holds out about all <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do is <b>stay</b> here and use it. Will you men stand by us?"

5000|$|Similarly, Qiu Qiming of CCTV program 24-Hours {{launched}} into an on-air tirade about Chinese society: [...] "If nobody can be safe, do we still want this speed? <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> drink {{a glass of}} milk that's safe? <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> <b>stay</b> in an apartment that will not fall apart? <b>Can</b> the roads <b>we</b> travel on in our cities not collapse? <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> travel in safe trains?

If they are at present {{confining}} their search to the northern range <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> where we are with confidence. I should be sorry to move, for we are well placed here; there is good water and game is abundant. We certainly shall soon lack wine, but for everything else we can manage. We have meat in abundance, and have flour to last for some time, for both we and the Gauls eat but little bread; besides, if pushed, we can do as the peasants do, pound up acorns and beechnuts and make a sort of bread of them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kyle Busch {{scored the}} pole {{for the race}} {{with a time of}} 22.648 and a speed of 158.954 mph. He said {{afterwards}} that it means [...] "a little bit for us (his team)" [...] to go [...] "sit on the pole here" [...] because it grants [...] "a really good pit selection for Sunday" [...] and to boot, [...] "gives us the track position. We know the 78 car (Truex said) is going to be fast - they always are - and one of the guys we’re going to have to race against," [...] Busch added. [...] "There’s going to be many others that are starting farther back that we’ll be racing against, too, {{before the end of the}} day, but we’ll work on our Dogs Rule Pedigree Camry tomorrow in practice and make sure we get a good race setup underneath us, so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> hopefully <b>stay</b> up front.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Keith {{had been}} greatly shocked, but not overpowered, {{he had spoken}} calmly, and made minute inquiries, and Mr. Clare was evidently a little disappointed, repeating that age and health made a difference, and that people showed their {{feelings}} in various ways.

Rachel begged to stop the bell, representing that the assembled congregation included no male person capable of reading the lessons; but Mr. Clare answered, [...] "No, my dear, this is not a day to do without such a beginning.
