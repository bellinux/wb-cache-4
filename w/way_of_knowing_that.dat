5|$|Over Romney Marsh Nos. 41, 92 and 222 Squadrons engaged JG 26, {{losing one}} of their number to the Bf 109s. The second wave of RAF fighters arrived on the scene, {{comprising}} 607 and 213 Squadrons with 23 Hurricanes. They initiated a head-on attack against the Do 17s of KG 3. A Hurricane and a Dornier collided, both going down. The Bf 109s {{did their best to}} break up attacks and the bombers held a tight formation, putting up withering cross-fire. The Bf 109s were not permitted to leave the bombers and chase enemy fighters. Time and again, they were forced to break off and return to the bomber stream, allowing the RAF fighters to return and repeat the process. Soon after, No. 605 and No. 501 Squadron arrived with 14 Hurricanes. One fighter was hit by return fire, but the pilot aimed his aircraft at a Dornier and bailed out. The fighter collided and destroyed the bomber. The German bomber crews had no <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> the crashes were not premeditated. It seemed as if the British were desperate. Nevertheless, they thought the 'tactic' was devastatingly effective. Chastened by losses, the Dorniers closed ranks to snuff out the gaps and continued to their target.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, NASA {{released}} a detailed report on survivability {{aspects of the}} Columbia reentry. The crew would have had {{less than a minute}} between the beginning of orbiter disintegration and depressurization. The structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin, although they had no <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin. All evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of Columbia as it began to spin out of control, but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right, exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration. The crew cabin separated {{from the rest of the}} orbiter and rapidly depressurized, which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds. Afterwards, the cabin spun around at high RPM, which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail. They were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and falling objects from the disintegrating cabin, along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets, which were not designed to provide any head protection. Even if the cabin had remained structurally intact and reached a lower altitude where air could refill it, the high altitude depressurization would have been fatal to the astronauts unless they received medical attention within 5 minutes, approximately the amount of time it would take between cerebral hypoxia and brain death.|$|E

Hotel keeper Albert [...] "Chris" [...] Billickie, whose father Charles owned the Cosmopolitan Hotel, saw Tom McLaury enter Bauer's butcher shop about 2:00p.m. He testified that Tom's right-hand pants pocket was flat when he went in but protruded, as if it contained a pistol (so he thought), when he emerged. Retired army surgeon Dr. J. W. Gardiner also testified that he saw the bulge in Tom's pants. However, the bulge in Tom's pants pocket {{may have been the}} nearly $3,300 in cash and receipts found on his body, perhaps in payment for stolen Mexican beef purchased by the butcher.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Risk, risk analysis, risk {{management}} and risk-based decision-making are ubiquitous {{ideas in the}} modern world. Consequently, risk education is emerging as a new field of research. However, just as the defining of risk and what it entails is a contested topic, so too is the field of risk education research open to many possible approaches. In this paper notions of risk, particularly as they play out in research on risk education, are analyzed (within an ethical space) using a theoretical framework based on the Traditional Western and an Indigenous worldview. Through this analysis, along with {{the identification of the}} kinds <b>of</b> knowledge and <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> currently being valued in the research, other kinds <b>of</b> knowledge and <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>that</b> may prove just as important emerge...|$|R
