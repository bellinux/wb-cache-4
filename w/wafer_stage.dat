40|$|Topology {{optimization}} is {{a strong}} approach for generating optimal designs which cannot be obtained using conventional optimization methods. Improving structural characteristics by changing the internal topology of a design domain has been fascinating scientists and engineers for years. Topology optimization {{can be described as}} a distribution of a given amount of material in a specified design domain, which is subjected to certain loading and boundary conditions. This domain can then be optimized to minimize specified objectives, for example compliance. For static problems, topology optimization is extensively used. The distribution of material, void and solid regions, can be used to solve several problems within the mechanical domain. However, this method of optimization is also used to optimize structures with respect to their resonant dynamics. Design of actuator placement is used to determine the most optimal actuator layout for a given objective, for example reducing responses. Combined with topology optimization, both design variables can influence each other, and be optimized towards the wanted behavior. This is done in a static domain. When material is removed, the force layout is updated, which influences the material distribution again. It is shown that the combination of these design variables in the optimization process, contributes to a better result; weight reduction can be achieved, while large deformations are preserved. Design of actuator placement, combined with topology optimization is also implemented in a dynamic domain. Since topology changes result in frequency response changes, the force placement is more sensitive. On the other hand, forces can be placed in a smart way, to ensure some mode shapes are not excited, whereas others are. By enabling positive and negative forces these forces can even be used to counteract or minimize certain modal responses. When implementing for example a harmonic excitation, the weight and total force can be linked together, to ensure accelerations are feasible. A weight reduction can thus lead to force reduction, which on its turn leads to less deformations. Especially in the high-precision industry, smart placement of actuators, including weight reduction can be very helpful. The combination of these phenomena could provide a new insight in creating accurate <b>wafer</b> <b>stages.</b> PME / PME-E...|$|R
40|$|The {{topography}} of a back-end wafer contains high-aspect vias that are unevenly distributed on a wafer with pitches ranging from 1 : 1 dense to isolated. The difference in via density causes thickness bias across the wafer, which causes {{the shift of}} resist depth of focus and critical dimension swing. The bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC) topography is formed basically after spin coating and reshaped through thermal reflowing when the coating is baked at high temperature to cure the film. In this paper, we discuss the thicknesess at isolated and dense via patterned areas in the spin- coating process and the baking process. Spin coating is a method commonly used to cast BARC and gap-fill materials on silicon <b>wafers.</b> The first <b>stage</b> of spin coating is the deposition of the coating liquid onto the <b>wafer.</b> The second <b>stage</b> is when the substrate is accelerated up to its final, desired rotation speed.

The fourth stage is when the substrate is spinning at a constant rate and solvent evaporation dominates the coating thinning behavior. Viscous flow and solvent evaporation occur throughout all stages. After spin coating, high-temperature baking cures the film and makes it insoluble in organic solvents {{that are used in}} the next spin-coating step.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an iterative learning con-troller (ILC) design technique for synchronization in wafer scanning systems. In wafer scanners, synchronization of the wafer and reticle stages {{is critical for}} accurate pattern transfer. For synchronization, a master-slave configuration is used, with the <b>wafer</b> <b>stage</b> acting as the master, and the reticle stage as the slave. Since the scanning process is repetitive, ILC is used to improve tracking performance. However, the coupling between the reticle stage and <b>wafer</b> <b>stage</b> is unidirectional. Hence we propose an ILC scheme {{that takes into account}} this structural property of the overall system. A simple design procedure is presented which allows design of the ILC system for the wafer and reticle stages independently. This is done by first designing an ILC controller for the wafer (master) stage, and then using the synchronization error for ILC update for the reticle (slave) stage. Analytic conditions for stability and monotonic error convergence are then discussed. Finally, design and performance of the algorithm is illustrated by implementation on a single degree of freedom <b>wafer</b> <b>stage,</b> and a virtual (computer-simulated) reticle stage. I...|$|E

For other setpoints and start positions, the learned feedforward signal will not be perfect, because the learned deterministic dynamics are setpoint- and position-dependent (e. g. cogging). This means that the learning procedure needs to be performed for every change in setpoint and start position, which costs time that is valuable in a <b>wafer</b> <b>stage.</b> In this paper Cogging Compensating Piecewise ILC (CCPILC) is proposed to use one learned feedforward signal for different setpoints and start positions without losing performance.

The fabrication methodology originates from a technique previously used for fabricating suspended or hollow microstructures.

40|$|In extreme {{ultraviolet}} lithography, imaging errors due to thermal deformation of reticles are becoming progressively intolerable {{as the source}} power increases. Despite this trend, such errors can be mitigated by adjusting the <b>wafer</b> and reticle <b>stages</b> based {{on a set of}} predicted deformation-induced displacements. Since this control scheme operates online, an accurate low-order model is necessary. However, finite element modeling of the reticle and its adjacent components leads to a large-scale thermo-mechanical model that should be simplified. First, parameters of the model's initial thermal condition are reduced to only a few from which numerous initial conditions can be accurately reconstructed. This entails placement of temperature sensors at the corresponding locations, and for this purpose, the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) is utilized. Then, linear and nonlinear model reductions are performed via the proper orthogonal decomposition method and DEIM, respectively. The resultant model is employed in the Kalman filter to estimate the parameters of the reticle's temperature-dependent coefficient of thermal expansion from several displacement measurements and to subsequently predict the displacements that are used for control. By processing the outputs from the simulated large-scale model, this filter is shown to perform successfully, even in the presence of an unexpected initial condition...|$|R
40|$|During {{the chuck}} swap process of a wafer scanner, i. e. the {{exchange}} of the measured chuck with the exposed chuck, a control mode switch occurs between two measurement systems. As {{a result of this}} switch, unwanted transients occur in the <b>wafer</b> <b>stage</b> system: the long-stroke (LoS) and the short-stroke (SS) <b>wafer</b> <b>stage</b> modules. By means of initial value compensation, an impulsive force is used to counteract these transients. But in view of actuator limitations, this appears insufficient and the following solution is proposed. Upon occurrence of a mode switch, the setpoint is adjusted with a third-order profile that limits the required actuator forces by limiting the jerk levels. The profile is scaled with the velocity difference measured over the mode switch. As a result, a continuous and smooth transition of the position signals is obtained. In addition, the SS feedforward controller is replaced by a feedback term in the multivariable and synchronized <b>wafer</b> <b>stage</b> system.

However, it has been demonstrated that metastable crystalline Ge 1 -xCx thin films can be produced with limited success. These materials are of great interest because they can potentially offer the superior mobility and optical characteristics of Ge as compared to those of Si, while the addition of C can raise the bandgap and reduce the lattice constant of the material to be comparable to those of Si.

40|$|ASML {{is a world}} leading {{supplier}} of complex lithography machines for the semiconductor industry. A lithography machine consists of many subsystems, e. g., Light Source, Lens, Reticle handler, Reticle stage, Wafer handler and <b>Wafer</b> <b>stage,</b> which synchronize together to make the machine work. The Reticle stage holds the circuit pattern, also known as reticle and the <b>Wafer</b> <b>stage</b> module holds the wafer. The UV light from the light source is projected on the circuit pattern, which is then passed through the lens to imprint the pattern on the wafer. Since the circuit pattern has to be imprinted on the wafer, {{the movement of the}} modules; Reticle stage and <b>Wafer</b> <b>stage</b> should be synchronized in six degrees of freedom (DoF) with nanometer accuracy. To employ the movement of the subsystems, motion controllers are used in ASML, and Long Stroke and Short Stroke controllers are responsible for the movement of a part of the <b>Wafer</b> <b>stage</b> subsystem. It has been envisioned that future lithography machines, because of its high precision mechatronic requirements, will need motion control algorithms, that run at higher sampling frequencies with a severely reduced IO latency budget. Current hardware architectures {{will not be able to}} meet the demands of these future motion control algorithms. In this thesis, we propose an architecture, that uses a multi-ASIP in FPGA as an accelerator in conjunction with a CPU, which acts as a master to run the motion control applications. The proposal of using multi-ASIP FPGA in conjunction with CPU is based on the analysis carried out previously in ASML. It was observed that a sampling frequency exceeding 100 KHz can be obtained after deploying the Long Stroke controller and Short Stroke controller on a multi-ASIP platform in FPGA. However, this work considered only the data flow and not the supervisory control. After carrying out detailed analysis, we could predict that a sampling frequency of 40 KHz could be achieved by offloading the compute intensive blocks present in the Long Stroke and Short Stroke controller from the CPU to FPGA. The sampling frequency of 40 KHz can be achieved by considering, both the data flow and supervisory control, and the communication between the CPU and FPGA. Finally, after offloading the compute intensive blocks from the CPU on the multi-ASIP FPGA, and after implementing the data flow and supervisory control and communication mechanism between the CPU and FPGA, we can justify that the sampling frequency of 40 KHz can be achieved.

40|$|Next-generation {{precision}} motion {{systems are}} lightweight to meet stringent requirements regarding throughput and accuracy. Such lightweight systems typically exhibit lightly damped flexible dynamics in the controller cross-over region. State-of-the-art modeling and motion control design procedures do not deliver the required model fidelity {{to control the}} flexible dynamical behavior. In this paper, identification and control challenges are investigated and a novel approach for next-generation motion control is presented. The procedure is applied to a multivariable <b>wafer</b> <b>stage,</b> confirming a significant performance improvement...|$|E
40|$|The Laser Step Alignment (LSA) is a through- the-lens, field-by-field {{alignment}} system {{developed for}} an optical step- and- repeat {{system with a}} reduction projection lens (wafer stepper) intended for one micron or submicron lithography. The laser beam used for LSA is focused on a wafer through the projection lens. The alignment marks on the wafer are {{in the shape of}} diffraction gratings. The mark detection is performed by moving the <b>wafer</b> <b>stage</b> so that the alignment mark travels across the laser beam. The passage of the align-ment mark produces diffracted and scattered light, which is photo- electrically detected as the alignment signal. The position of the alignment mark is accurately measured by the laser interferomter attached to the <b>wafer</b> <b>stage.</b> The LSA system achieves overlay accuracy (2 aa) less than 0. 15 um for processed wafers. LSA uses a 633 nm He-Ne laser, so the photoresist is not sensitive to it, and LSA is well applicable to multilayer resist processes. The alignment time is about 0 - 6 seconds per shot in field-by-field mode. This LSA is attached to the Nikon wafer stepper (NSR), so field-by- field alignment, several types of alignment, and other measurement for compensa-tion are performed. An appropriate alignment may be selected to meet the accuracy and throughput required in each case...|$|E
