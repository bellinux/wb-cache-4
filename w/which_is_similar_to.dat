5|$|Another known form {{of solid}} {{tetravalent}} americium chloride is KAmF5. Tetravalent americium {{has also been}} observed in the aqueous phase. For this purpose, black Am(OH)4 was dissolved in 15-M NH3F with the americium concentration of 0.01 M. The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that of AmF4 but differed from other oxidation states of americium.

5|$|Before the {{widespread}} application of technetium-99m in nuclear medicine, the radioactive isotope thallium-201, with a half-life of 73 hours, {{was the main}} substance for nuclear cardiography. The nuclide is still used for stress tests for risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable generator <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the technetium-99m generator. The generator contains lead-201 (half-life 9.33 hours) which decays by electron capture to the thallium-201. The lead-201 can be produced in a cyclotron by the bombardment of thallium with protons or deuterons by the (p,3n) and (d,4n) reactions.|$|E

It has a prominent browguard, the shape of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that of the 3rd-century Guisborough Helmet, discovered in 1864 near Guisborough in Redcar and Cleveland. The rear of the helmet bowl descended to form a neckguard.|$|E
5|$|Koalas can {{be subject}} to {{pathogens}} such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria, which can cause keratoconjunctivitis, urinary tract infection, and reproductive tract infection. Such infections are widespread on the mainland, but absent in some island populations. The koala retrovirus (KoRV) may cause koala immune deficiency syndrome (KIDS) <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> AIDS in humans. Prevalence of KoRV in koala populations suggests a trend spreading from the north {{to the south of}} Australia. Northern populations are completely infected, while some southern populations (including Kangaroo Island) are free.|$|E

5|$|The Seal of the State of Indiana {{is used by}} the Governor of Indiana {{to certify}} {{official}} documents. The seal has gone through several revisions since the region {{was a part of the}} Northwest Territory. It is likely the original seal, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the current one, was created by William Henry Harrison during his administration of the Indiana Territory. The current design of the seal was standardized by the Indiana General Assembly in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees {{relative}} to its orbital plane, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars, they are {{nearly twice as}} long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, {{the orientation of the}} north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb. Mars passed an aphelion in March 2010 and its perihelion in March 2011. The next aphelion came in February 2012 and the next perihelion came in January 2013.|$|E

5|$|The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars (25°). As a result, Neptune {{experiences}} similar seasonal {{changes to}} Earth. The long orbital period of Neptune {{means that the}} seasons last for forty Earth years. Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11hours. Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day {{over the course of}} its long year is not any more extreme.|$|E
5|$|The city of Gifu is {{currently}} promoting the Slow Life City Initiative, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to,</b> but more comprehensive than, the slow food initiative. It {{is designed to}} encourage residents to lead a slower lifestyles and provide {{an alternative to the}} fast-paced life of the modern world. Major elements of this campaign include more dependence on locally grown food; traditional culture and arts; and activities to increase citizens’ participation in their community. In addition to slow food, Gifu also hopes to include slow industry (traditional crafts), slow education (studying quality of life), and slow tourism (represented by cormorant fishing).|$|E

5|$|Although cadmium {{usually has}} an {{oxidation}} state of +2, it also {{exists in the}} +1 state. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in {{that they do not}} have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous cadmium oxide (CdO); the crystalline form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to zinc oxide. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride (CdCl2), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4), or cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2). The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminium chloride, forming the Cd22+ cation, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the Hg22+ cation in mercury(I) chloride.|$|E
5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.|$|E
