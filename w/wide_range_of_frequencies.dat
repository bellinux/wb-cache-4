5|$|In the free-electron laser (FEL), a {{relativistic}} {{electron beam}} passes through a pair of undulators that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose fields point in alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the resonance frequency. FEL can emit a coherent high-brilliance electromagnetic radiation with a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies,</b> from microwaves to soft X-rays. These devices are used in manufacturing, communication, and in medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.|$|E
5|$|The {{pinniped}} ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While {{they are capable of}} hearing a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> (e.g. 500 to 32,000Hz in the northern fur seal, compared to 20 to 20,000Hz in humans), their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater hearing. Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it is useless underwater as their nostrils are closed.|$|E

25|$|Horn {{loudspeakers}} {{are used}} in many audio applications. The drivers in horn loudspeakers can be very small, even for bass frequencies where conventional loudspeakers {{would need to be}} very large for equivalent performance. Horn loudspeakers can be designed to reproduce a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> using a single, small driver; to some extent these can be designed without requiring a crossover. Lowther, Fostex, and Goodmans are firms which have produced such designs.|$|E
25|$|In most administrations, {{unlike other}} RF {{spectrum}} users, radio amateurs may build or modify transmitting equipment {{for their own}} use within the amateur spectrum without the need to obtain government certification of the equipment. Licensed amateurs can also use any frequency in their bands (rather than being allocated fixed frequencies or channels) and can operate medium to high-powered equipment on a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{so long as they}} meet certain technical parameters including occupied bandwidth, power, and prevention of spurious emission.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of parabolic antennas {{is that most}} of the structure of the antenna (all of it except the feed antenna) is nonresonant, so it can function over a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies,</b> that is a wide bandwidth. All that is necessary to change the frequency of operation is to replace the feed antenna with one that works at the new frequency. Some parabolic antennas transmit or receive at multiple frequencies by having several feed antennas mounted at the focal point, close together.|$|E

25|$|Crystallographic defects {{strongly}} {{affect the}} tube's thermal properties. Such defects lead to phonon scattering, {{which in turn}} increases the relaxation rate of the phonons. This reduces the mean free path and reduces the thermal conductivity of nanotube structures. Phonon transport simulations indicate that substitutional defects such as nitrogen or boron will primarily lead to scattering of high-frequency optical phonons. However, larger-scale defects such as Stone Wales defects cause phonon scattering over a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies,</b> leading to a greater reduction in thermal conductivity.|$|E
25|$|The {{dielectric}} constant of a material {{can be found}} {{by a variety of}} static electrical measurements. The complex permittivity is evaluated over a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> by using different variants of dielectric spectroscopy, covering nearly 21 orders of magnitude from 10−6 to 1015 hertz. Also, by using cryostats and ovens, the dielectric properties of a medium can be characterized over an array of temperatures. In order to study systems for such diverse excitation fields, a number of measurement setups are used, each adequate for a special frequency range.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} {{this type of}} frequency synthesizer cannot operate over a very <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies,</b> because the comparator will have a limited bandwidth and may suffer from aliasing problems. This would lead to false locking situations, or an inability to lock at all. In addition, {{it is hard to}} make a high frequency VCO that operates over a very wide range. This is due to several factors, but the primary restriction is the limited capacitance range of varactor diodes. However, in most systems where a synthesizer is used, we are not after a huge range, but rather a finite number over some defined range, such as a number of radio channels in a specific band.|$|E

25|$|A more {{sensitive}} class of detector uses laser interferometry to measure gravitational-wave induced motion between separated 'free' masses. This allows the masses {{to be separated}} by large distances (increasing the signal size); a further advantage {{is that it is}} sensitive to a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> (not just those near a resonance as is the case for Weber bars). After years of development the first ground-based interferometers became operational in 2015. Currently, the most sensitive is LIGO — the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. LIGO has three detectors: one in Livingston, Louisiana, one at the Hanford site in Richland, Washington and a third (formerly installed as a second detector at Hanford) that is planned to be moved to India. Each observatory has two light storage arms that are 4kilometers in length. These are at 90degree angles to each other, with the light passing through 1m diameter vacuum tubes running the entire 4kilometers. A passing gravitational wave will slightly stretch one arm as it shortens the other. This is precisely the motion to which an interferometer is most sensitive.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{instruments}} use electronic sensors, amplifiers, {{and recording}} devices. Most are broadband covering a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Some seismometers can measure motions with frequencies from 500Hz to 0.00118Hz (1/500 = 0.002 seconds per cycle, to 1/0.00118 = 850 seconds per cycle). [...] The mechanical suspension for horizontal instruments remains the garden-gate described above. Vertical instruments use {{some kind of}} constant-force suspension, such as the LaCoste suspension. The LaCoste suspension uses a zero-length spring to provide a long period (high sensitivity). Some modern instruments use a [...] "triaxial" [...] design, in which three identical motion sensors are set at the same angle to the vertical but 120 degrees apart on the horizontal. Vertical and horizontal motions can be computed from the outputs of the three sensors.|$|E
2500|$|To {{adequately}} reproduce a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{with even}} coverage, most loudspeaker systems employ {{more than one}} driver, particularly for higher sound pressure level or maximum accuracy. Individual drivers are used to reproduce different frequency ranges. The drivers are named subwoofers (for very low frequencies); woofers (low frequencies); mid-range speakers (middle frequencies); tweeters (high frequencies); and sometimes supertweeters, optimized for the highest audible frequencies. The terms for different speaker drivers differ, depending on the application. In two-way systems there is no mid-range driver, so the task of reproducing the mid-range sounds falls upon the woofer and tweeter. Home stereos use the designation [...] "tweeter" [...] for the high frequency driver, while professional concert systems may designate them as [...] "HF" [...] or [...] "highs". When multiple drivers are used in a system, a [...] "filter network", called a crossover, separates the incoming signal into different frequency ranges and routes them to the appropriate driver. A loudspeaker system with n separate frequency bands is described as [...] "n-way speakers": a two-way system will have a woofer and a tweeter; a three-way system employs a woofer, a mid-range, and a tweeter. Loudspeaker driver of the type pictured are termed [...] "dynamic" [...] (short for electrodynamic) to distinguish them from earlier drivers (i.e., moving iron speaker), or speakers using piezoelectric or electrostatic systems, or any of several other sorts.|$|E
