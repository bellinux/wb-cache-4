The extension R G ⊆ R satisfies GD (the going-down property). As a result, the following are among the classes of integral domains that are stable under the operation R ↦ → R G: integrally closed domains, seminormal domains, completely integrally closed domains, Krull domains, Prüfer domains, goingdown domains, locally divided domains, divided domains, locally pseudovaluation domains, pseudo-valuation domains, and almost pseudo-valuation domains. 1...|$|R

5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E

In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming. The UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.|$|E

The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at 266mm (10.67inches), which caused flooding and one drowning death. About 7,500people were affected, and damage totaled over 100million pesos (2005MXN, $9.3million 2005USD, $10.3million 2008USD).|$|E
