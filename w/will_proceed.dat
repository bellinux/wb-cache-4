Afterwards, Juliet brings to Jack's cell a movie, which consists of Juliet speaking through cue cards. As Juliet discusses how the surgery <b>will</b> <b>proceed,</b> on the tape she tells Jack that Ben is a liar and very dangerous, and thus the surgery should be intentionally botched to kill Ben, and that she will protect Jack if he does so.|$|E
5|$|At the Simpson residence, Marge disapproves of the plan, but {{decides to}} do it for Apu's sake. While the plan is under way Homer decides to stay in the Springfield Retirement Castle with his father, posing as {{resident}} Cornelius Talmidge. Homer enjoys his stay at the home immensely, until the real Cornelius returns, at which point he flees. He returns home and gets into bed with Marge. Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilon enters to say goodbye, but is shocked to see Marge in bed with another man, and Apu on the floor. Tired of the whole charade, Marge forces Apu to tell his mother the truth, who declares that the arranged marriage <b>will</b> <b>proceed</b> as planned.|$|E
5|$|Cyclotorna monocentra moths feed on meat ant broods. The larvae {{of these}} moths are parasites to leafhoppers and {{will move to}} meat ant colonies to {{complete}} their development, where they <b>will</b> <b>proceed</b> to consume the brood; the females lay many eggs near ant trails which {{are close to the}} leafhoppers tended by ants. Other observations show that the Iphierga macarista larvae are scavengers in meat ant nests, while Sphallomorpha beetles live in burrows near nests of meat ants, where the larvae capture and prey on workers passing by. The larvae of the spitfire sawfly and Pseudoperga guerini are able to regurgitate a fluid against the meat ant if they are getting attacked by them; depending on how much is regurgitated, an ant will either walk away and clean itself or become fatally affected by it. Lizards such as the thorny dragon, which is a sit and wait predator, consume meat ants, but other lizards which eat Iridomyrmex ants usually reject this species.|$|E

5|$|In 2016 {{there were}} 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were {{operated}} {{by the government and}} 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect {{from the end of the}} school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools <b>will</b> <b>proceed</b> over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available. Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) school students in Australia, accounting for 40.6percent of ACT enrollments.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, <b>will</b> <b>proceed</b> amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
5|$|The host {{city for}} an Olympic Games is usually chosen {{seven to eight}} years ahead of their celebration. The process of {{selection}} is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can {{be presented to the}} International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organisation of the Olympic Games. In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that <b>will</b> <b>proceed</b> to the candidature stage.|$|E

50|$|Earliest {{reference}} to panentheistic thought in Hindu philosophy is in a creation myth {{contained in the}} later section of Rig Veda called the Purusha Sukta, which was compiled before 1100 BCE.

It presents the nature of Purusha or the cosmic being as both immanent in the manifested world and yet transcendent to it.
