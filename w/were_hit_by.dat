5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Mongol wings closed around the {{shattered}} Rus' army, cutting off its retreat. The surrounded Rus' <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> volley after volley, accompanied by cavalry charges at any {{weakness in the}} formation. As the Mongols were carrying this annihilation out, some of the army – led by Mstislav the Bold – managed to cut {{their way through the}} Mongol ring and escape.* Gabriel, Subotai The Valiant: Genghis Khan's Greatest General p. 100.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, several {{properties}} on Park Lane <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> bombs. Dudley House, at No.100, suffered major structural damage, {{including the}} destruction of the ballroom and gallery, though the building was partially restored. However, the strength of construction of the Dorchester Hotel gave it the reputation of being one of London's safest buildings, and it was a safe haven for numerous luminaries. General Dwight D. Eisenhower took a suite on the first floor in 1942, and later made it his headquarters.|$|E
5|$|On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was {{tasked with}} linking {{up with the}} 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword and {{securing}} the high ground near La Plein. No. 3 Commando landed at La Breche, west of Ouistreham at 09:05 coming ashore in the second wave. They were engaged before they hit the beach, {{and three of the}} landing craft that the Commandos were travelling in <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> high-velocity shells. Casualties were high, with No. 6 Troop suffering at least 20 wounded, but in the end they were lower than had been expected.|$|E
5|$|Previously, {{portions}} of the Great Lakes <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a significant lake effect snow event which dumped incredible amounts of snow over {{portions of}} central New York. Several areas received over 115inches (over 2.5m) of snow in a ten-day period just before the large winter storm as northwesterly winds and unfrozen lake surfaces due to the early winter warm weather favored the heavy snowfall. Several areas across Michigan and Ontario also received significant amounts of snow with locally 1meter (3.3ft) of snow east of Georgian Bay in Ontario.|$|E
50|$|The fiery Jennings {{was also}} {{known as one of}} the most fearless players of his time, {{allowing}} himself to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> pitches more than any other player. In one game, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a pitch three times. In 1896, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> pitches 51 times—a Major League record that still stands. In just five seasons with the Orioles from 1894 to 1898, Jennings <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> pitches an unprecedented 202 times. During one game, Jennings <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> in the head by a pitch from Amos Rusie in the 3rd inning, but managed to finish the game. As soon as the game ended, Jennings collapsed and was unconscious for three days.|$|R

50|$|Further {{showing his}} {{toughness}} as a ballplayer, Elberfeld {{was not afraid}} of being <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a pitch. He led the American League in being <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a pitch in 1903 and 1911 and was among the league leaders in the category nine times. In 1911, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a pitch 25 times, setting an American League record that was not broken until 1986 when Don Baylor <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a pitch 35 times.

5|$|The Blitz was {{a period}} of {{sustained}} strategic bombing of the United Kingdom by Germany during the Second World War. Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941, sixteen British cities <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> major aerial raids. Beginning on 7 September 1940, London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights. Overall, more than one million London houses were destroyed or damaged during the Blitz, and more than 40,000 civilians were killed, almost half of them in London.|$|E
5|$|A third raid, {{consisting}} of six unescorted Hudsons of No. 62 Squadron RAF, flying from Palembang, Sumatra, attacked shortly afterwards, losing {{two of their}} number, with their entire crews, to six Ki-27s. A fourth raid, made up of five Bristol Blenheims of No. 27 Squadron RAF, set off from Palembang later in the day, but had only {{got as far as}} Singapore by sunset, so aborted the mission. Despite claims to have scored multiple hits on both transports and a cruiser, neither the transports, nor any of their escorts were damaged; the former <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> splinters that killed 8 and wounded 18, but Sendai and the smaller ships were untouched.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the growing threat to the Australian base, the {{decision}} was made to reinforce FSB Andersen, with C Company, 3 RAR flown in by the time of the second attack two nights later. The APCs had also been redeployed to cover the south-east ridge and the southern approach from Trang Bom. The communist assault commenced just before midnight on 19 February, this time focussing on the south-east, and was preceded by heavy machine-gun fire. The attack was stopped short of the wire, regardless the forward pits <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> rifle grenades, while the Assault Pioneer positions were attacked with satchel charges. The only casualties were four Viet Cong killed.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of World War Two the British Government created the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, and {{appointed}} Kenneth Clark as its Chairman. Despite the public hostility between Clarke and himself, Nevinson was disappointed not to be offered a commission by WAAC. He submitted three paintings to WAAC in December 1940 which were also rejected. He worked as a stretcher-bearer in London throughout the Blitz, during which his own studio and the family home in Hampstead <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> bombs. WAAC eventually purchased two pictures from him, Anti-aircraft Defences and a depiction of a fire-bomb attack, The Fire of London, December 29th – An Historic Record.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, the Boddington family {{shareholding}} had {{dwindled to}} around 40 per cent. On the 22 December 1940, the brewery water tanks <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> bombs during the Manchester Blitz, and the brewery {{had to be}} closed down for several months, with production moved temporarily to the nearby Hydes Brewery. The brewery was rebuilt with the most up-to-date and modern equipment of the time, {{and was the first}} in Europe to install stainless steel brewing vats. In 1961, the brewer Whitbread took a 13 per cent stake in the company. In 1962 the company purchased Richard Clarke & Co of Reddish, Stockport, adding 60 public houses to the firm.|$|E
5|$|His {{first season}} with Blackburn was mixed – he missed half of it through injury after {{snapping}} his right anterior cruciate ligament in a match against Leeds United in December 1992, but scored a prolific 16 goals in the 21 games in which he did feature. Shearer also became a regular in the England team this season and scored his second international goal; it came in a 4–0 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier win over Turkey in November. The season ended sourly, however, as Shearer was forced to miss January through to May due to injury and England's World Cup qualification chances <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a run of poor form.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{development}} {{and the rise of}} manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century. Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hard-hit by the Great Depression, resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> drought from 1931 to 1935. New Deal programs provided some economic turnaround. The Civilian Conservation Corps and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government. This provided natives a greater voice within the state, and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and native languages were no longer suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Many Croatian {{cities were}} {{attacked}} by artillery, missiles, and aircraft bombs by RSK or JNA forces from RSK or Serb-controlled areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as Montenegro and Serbia.

5|$|On Hill 69 and {{the coastal}} road, the 53rd Battalion intercepted and engaged a {{contingent}} of Egyptian reinforcements from Majdal. After the battles, the 53rd Battalion reported that at 03:00, they had been ready to ambush possible reinforcements, and at 06:00, an Egyptian convoy of two armored vehicles and 4 other vehicles {{made their way to}} Isdud. They <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> Israeli mines, operated by Avraham Schwarzstein's platoon (see Battle of Nitzanim), and only two vehicles made it out and back to Majdal. At 09:00 the general retreat order was given, and after reaching Nitzanim, Schwarzstein's platoon set out to assist the Negev forces' retreat, helping carry the 20-so casualties. The forces on Hill 69 retreated only at noon to Be'er Tuvia.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days after}} {{the start of the war}} in September 1939, Z1 Leberecht Maass and another {{destroyer}} unsuccessfully attacked Polish ships in the naval base on the Hel Peninsula. She was lightly damaged during the action. In mid-February 1940, while proceeding into the North Sea to attack British fishing trawlers (Operation Wikinger), the ship was bombed by a patrolling German bomber that damaged her steering. A court of inquiry convened during the war determined that she and a sister ship <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> bombs, but a post-war investigation determined that she had drifted into a newly laid British minefield. Z1 Leberecht Maass broke in half with the loss of the most of her crew.|$|E
5|$|The Katangese Gendamerie {{conducted}} a disorganised withdrawal to two camps southeast of Kamina. Shortly after the 09:00 the Swedish battalion reached the city center. Patrols slowly mopped up resistance and took several prisoners. J-29 jets flew {{low to the}} ground to intimidate the remaining gendarmes and <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> small arms fire in return. At 09:55 the Swedish troops attacked the nearest gendarmerie camp, encountering only sporadic resistance. At 13:00 they secured the second camp unopposed, as the remaining Katangese had fled. The Swedes commandeered it and began working with municipal authorities to stabilize the local situation. The Swedish battalion had sustained no casualties and had seized about 40 vehicles, two armoured cars, a Bofors 40 mm gun, a recoilless rifle, several heavy machine guns, tons of ammunition, and a large amount of supplies.|$|E
5|$|XXIBomber Command also {{conducted}} an intensive propaganda campaign alongside its firebombing raids. It {{has been estimated}} that B-29s dropped 10 million propaganda leaflets in May, 20 million in June and 30 million in July. The Japanese government implemented harsh penalties against civilians who kept copies of these leaflets. On the night of 27/28July, six B-29s dropped leaflets over 11 Japanese cities warning that they would be attacked in the future; this was intended to lower the morale of Japanese civilians and convince them that the United States was seeking to minimize civilian casualties. Six of these cities (Aomori, Ichinomiya, Tsu, Uji-Yamada Ōgaki and Uwajima) were attacked on 28July. No B-29s were lost in the raids on these cities, though six were damaged by attacks from between 40 and 50 fighters and another five <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
