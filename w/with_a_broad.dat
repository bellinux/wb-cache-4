5|$|As Josephine {{continued}} east-northeastward, it had weakened {{back into}} a tropical storm. Under the influence of an area of high pressure {{to the north and}} a nearby area of low pressure, Josephine began executing a cyclonic loop to the north while approaching Atlantic Canada. During the cyclonic loop, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October18. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of Josephine merged <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> mid-latitude trough. The remnants of Josephine tracked southward and completed the cyclonic loop on October19. The system eventually curved to the east-northeastward and moved in that direction until it became unidentifiable on October21.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the month, an area of convection persisted in association <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> low-level circulation about 565km (350mi) west-southwest of Diego Garcia. The disturbance tracked west-southwestward, and on March 2 the Météo-France (MFR) declared it as a weak depression. Initially in an area of moderate wind shear, the system at first failed to maintain deep convection. Early on March 4, convection increased and organized around the center of circulation, and the MFR classified it as Tropical Depression Twelve, about 270km (170mi) southwest of the Agaléga Islands. Initially the MFR forecast that the depression would intensify further before striking Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Tatuidris, or {{armadillo}} ant, {{is a rare}} genus of ants {{consisting of}} a single species, Tatuidris tatusia. The ants are small in size and inhabit the leaf litter of Neotropical forests in Central and South America, from Mexico to Brazil. Workers are ferruginous-colored to dark red and present a distinctive morphology, consisting of a shield-like head <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> vertex, ventrally-turned heavy mandibles which do not overlap at full closure, and unique among ants– an antenna socket apparatus sitting upside-down.

5|$|The Charolais breed was small, {{and most}} closely {{physically}} resembled the Morvan horse, another now-extinct French type.

They were strong, robust and hardy, the last of these traits especially so before the breeding changes of the 19th century, and were known for their pulling power.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of a photon {{is proportional to}} its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> spectrum, distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen spectral series. Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Arthur are {{believed}} to have been from a decaying cold front in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in July 2002.

Across the region, surface pressures were high, while upper level wind shear was marginally favorable for slow tropical development. The system tracked slowly north-northwestward, gradually becoming better defined, although thunderstorm activity remained limited and disorganized.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} was located {{north of the}} Bahamas on August26, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> area of {{cyclonic}} turning located east of northern Florida. Atmospheric pressures were falling in the region, and gale force winds were recorded by 12:00UTC on August27. Based on the structure, {{it is estimated that}} the frontal low developed into a tropical storm by 18:00UTC that day. Ship reports in the region suggested peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). There was very dry air {{on the west side of}} the system, unusual for August, and the radius of maximum winds was around 115mi (185km), suggesting that the structure could have been akin to a subtropical cyclone. The storm continued to the northwest, making landfall very near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina at 02:00UTC on August28. It spread rainfall across the Carolinas, later enhanced by Hurricane Able just days later, while cities reported winds of around 35mph (55km/h). The storm weakened over land and dissipated late on August28 over eastern Kentucky.|$|E
