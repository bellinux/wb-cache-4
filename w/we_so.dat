500|$|The Christmas period {{began with}} a 1–1 draw against local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. A 4–0 defeat away to Liverpool {{concerned}} Wenger, who noted a lack of goals being problematic: “It has been our problem all season. <b>We</b> <b>so</b> very rarely score two in a match, and that makes life very difficult." [...] Henry scored a hat-trick in a 6–1 win at home to Leicester City on Boxing Day. A draw against Sunderland, having been 2–0 up at half time meant Arsenal ended the calendar year in second place, eight points behind Manchester United.|$|E

500|$|Fleming {{planned to}} drive {{most of his}} second tour of cities, which {{concentrated}} on places he wanted to visit in Europe. For the trip he took his own car, a Ford Thunderbird convertible, crossing the channel and journeying through Ostend, Antwerp and Bremen before arriving at his first destination: Hamburg. He stayed only briefly in the city, praising the sex industry by writing [...] "how {{very different from the}} prudish and hypocritical manner in which <b>we</b> <b>so</b> disgracefully mismanage these things in England". Fleming moved on to Berlin, where he was shown round the city by The Sunday Times correspondent Anthony Terry and his wife Rachel. Terry took Fleming into East Berlin and told him many of the details about Operation Stopwatch, the Anglo-American attempt to tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters. In comparison to Hamburg, Fleming thought Berlin was [...] "sinister".|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall {{thought the}} episode {{was similar to}} Flowers for Algernon, but was skeptical of the premise that Milo could predict every event before they happened. She criticized the decision to make Milo [...] "coldly calculating", writing [...] "This is but another version of the tired cliché of the stoic intellectual, the intelligent person who has no heart or emotions. Why are <b>we</b> <b>so</b> afraid of smart people?... It always annoys me when science fiction writers, of all people, diss their own audience {{with the idea that}} intellectuals are dangerous." [...] Stegall was pleased to have the first [...] "standalone" [...] episode of the season, explaining that it was the first where she could [...] "relax and enjoy... the tying together of a standalone with a mythology theme was absolutely brilliant." [...] Fearnet contributor Alyse Wax enjoyed the episode, but also thought [...] "the idea that [...] could turn someone into a cartoonish evil genius is pretty farfetched." ...|$|E
500|$|... "She dwelt {{among the}} untrodden ways" [...] {{presents}} Lucy as having lived in solitude near {{the source of}} the River Dove. According to literary critic Geoffrey Durrant, the poem charts her [...] "growth, perfection, and death". To convey the dignified, unaffected naturalness of his subject, Wordsworth uses simple language, mostly words of one syllable. In the opening quatrain, he describes the isolated and untouched area where Lucy lived, as well as her innocence and beauty, which he compares to that of a hidden flower in the second. The poem begins in a descriptive rather than narrative manner, and it is not until the line [...] "When Lucy ceased to be" [...] that the reader is made aware that the subject of the verse has died. Literary scholar Mark Jones describes this effect as finding the poem is [...] "over before it has begun", while according to writer Margaret Oliphant (1828–1897), Lucy [...] "is dead before <b>we</b> <b>so</b> much as heard of her".|$|E

500|$|The first {{critical}} review of Very's book {{was written by}} Margaret Fuller and published in Orestes Brownson's Boston Quarterly Review; it said Very's poems had [...] "an elasticity of spirit, a genuine flow of thought, and unsought nobleness and purity", though she admitted she preferred the prose in the collection over the poetry. She mocked the [...] "sing song" [...] style of the poems and questioned his religious mission. She concluded: [...] "I am... greatly interested in Mr Very. He seems worthy to be well known." [...] James Freeman Clarke admired Very's poetry enough to have several published in his journal, the Western Messenger, between 1838 and 1840. William Ellery Channing admired Very's poetry as well, writing that his insanity [...] "is only superficial". Richard Henry Dana Sr. also commented positively on Very's poetry: [...] "The thought is deeply spiritual; and {{while there is a}} certain character of peculiarity which <b>we</b> <b>so</b> often find in like things from our old writers, there is a freedom from quaintness... Indeed, I know not where you would... find any thing in this country to compare with these Sonnets." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool {{dominated}} the opening exchanges, but struggled to create clear-cut chances. They almost went a goal behind when Frank Stapleton's header forced goalkeeper Ray Clemence into action. Seven {{minutes before the}} interval, Terry McDermott scored for Liverpool. The midfielder collected a pass from Ray Kennedy who surged through the centre, turned left and from outside the penalty area struck the ball low into the bottom left-hand corner. Arsenal began the second half with more vigour, but struggled to suppress Liverpool's attacks. Alan Kennedy found space to shoot after a one-two with Ray, but his effort went over the post. Arsenal were forced to make a substitution around the hour mark after Sammy Nelson collided with McDermott and was concussed; Willie Young replaced him. Liverpool extended their lead minutes later. Alan Hansen intercepted an Arsenal attack, strode forward and passed the ball to Dalglish. The striker approached the penalty area, cut inside Steve Walford and curled {{the ball into the}} right-hand corner. John Hollins came on for David Price, at which point Liverpool scored their third. Dalglish dispossessed Liam Brady, but tripped himself in the process. Johnson collected the ball and played it back to Dalglish, who charged forward and sprayed a pass towards McDermott, the furthest forward player on the right. The midfielder's shot went under the legs of Pat Jennings and into the goal. Alan Sunderland scored a late goal for Arsenal having combined well with Stapleton. This did not dampen the spirits of the Liverpool spectators, who chanted, [...] "What's it like to be outclassed?" [...] and, [...] "Why are <b>we</b> <b>so</b> great?" [...] {{during the course of the}} 90 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Feed Us A Fetus, the 1986 LP by Canadian thrash band Dayglo Abortions, adapted a {{photograph}} of Mr. and Mrs. Reagan [...] with the U.S. Presidential Seal in the background, adding to it is a fetus being served to the president on a plate. Earlier in his political career, Ronald Reagan had signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act six weeks into his first gubernatorial term, bringing California's statewide total of legal abortion procedures from 518 in 1967 {{to an average of}} around 100,000 annually throughout his two terms as governor—more than any other state prior to Roe vs. Wade. In 1972 Nancy Reagan make a public statement regarding her husband's decision, saying, [...] "If we accept the right to take life before birth are <b>we</b> <b>so</b> far from making the decision after birth?" [...] She went on to say, [...] "I agree with the California abortion law passed under my husband, however, I believe it has been terribly abused". By the end of the Reagans' first term in the White House, they had changed their position on abortion, and in 1986 the president addressed a joint session of Congress, saying, [...] "Today there is a wound in our national conscience. America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our Creator is denied to the unborn". By the 1990s, Nancy Reagan reasserted her public opinion of being [...] "somewhere in the middle" [...] in not supporting abortion while believing in women's right to choose. The Dayglo Abortions's name caused the band problems in both the United States and Canada, and the cover of Feed Us A Fetus resulted in an obscenity charge that was ultimately brought before and overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E

2500|$|Marie Roberts {{wrote an}} open letter to her Amish neighbors thanking them for their forgiveness, grace, and mercy.

Your {{compassion}} has reached beyond our family, beyond our community, and is changing our world, and for this we sincerely thank you." [...] The Amish do not normally accept charity, but because of the extreme nature of the tragedy, donations were accepted. Richie Lauer, director of the Anabaptist Foundation, said the Amish community, whose religious beliefs prohibit them from having health insurance, will likely use the donations to help pay the medical costs of the hospitalized children.|$|E

2500|$|After his brigade {{endured a}} {{three or four}} mile double-time march in 45 minutes, Weedon {{arranged}} his troops on a reverse slope behind a fence. He swung the right flank forward behind a fence and some woods so as to take any attackers in enfilade. Henry Monckton's 2nd Grenadier Battalion blundered into Weedon's trap as dusk fell. As his men came under heavy fire, Monckton asked Hessian Captain Johann von Ewald to ride and get help. The Hessian found James Agnew who brought up his 4th Brigade on Monckton's left. One of Agnew's regiments, the 64th Foot was roughly treated, losing 47 of its 420 men in the vicious firefight that followed. The Pennsylvania State Regiment was evidently part of the thrown-forward right flank. One witness recalled the unit's colonel, [...] "Stewart on foot, in its rear, animating his men." [...] An officer in the regiment wrote that, [...] "Our regiment fought at one stand about an hour under incessant fire, and yet the loss was less than at Long Island; neither were <b>we</b> <b>so</b> near each other as at Princeton, our common distance being about 50 yards." [...] With the assistance of some artillery, the British finally forced the Americans back, but the exhausted victors did not pursue in the dark.|$|E
2500|$|Opinions {{differed}} about Fancourt's melodramatic {{style in}} his roles, especially {{his interpretation of}} his best-known role, that of the Mikado of Japan, and his famous Mikado laugh. Frederic Lloyd, who joined the D'Oyly Carte in 1951 and had studied the company's history, told an interviewer that Fancourt invented his interpretation, concerned that the earlier movements used during the Mikado's song could {{be taken as a}} Fagin-like caricature. [...] According to Lloyd, Fancourt had said that, because of his Jewish background, [...] "I just couldn't go through those movements, it would bother me", and Lloyd reported that, when Fancourt showed Rupert D'Oyly Carte and his stage director J. M. Gordon his new business for the song, they were delighted. Jessie Bond, who had played Pitti-Sing in the 1885 première, was unimpressed: [...] "Who, I want to know, intended that the Mikado should prance about like a madman, hissing out his lines like a serpent? ... The raving monster <b>we</b> <b>so</b> often see now is not one bit like the suave and oily Mikado created [...] at the Savoy." [...] The Times thought that he [...] "undoubtedly loses {{a good deal of the}} Mikado's humour... his 'humane Mikado' scene is the one which seems to have travelled farthest from the 'Savoy tradition'." [...] A later Times review commented more favourably: [...] "Mr Darrell Fancourt... can (and did) add a terrifying aspect to the benignity of his humaner punishment manifesto, and left us wondering how his vocal cords ever managed to function normally after those expressions of emphasis with which he punctuated its paragraphs." [...] The Manchester Guardian praised Fancourt's fresh approach and added, [...] "He makes more of the punishment-fitting-the-crime song than we can remember having seen from any other actor." [...] The Pall Mall Gazette said, [...] "Mr Fancourt has recognised that people can do with a 'thrill' in these Grand Guignol days. So he has given us a Mikado who really does curdle the blood, with a voice like a steam hammer slowly crushing a ton of Brazil nuts, and a make up of ghastly villainy, and a fiendish, gurgling laugh, which must be heard to be appreciated." [...] Another critic described the sound of Fancourt's laugh as [...] "a dragon getting up steam". With respect to Fancourt's portrayal of the Pirate King, fellow actor Henry Lytton told an interviewer, [...] "The King should be a story book pirate, not a real one and blood thirsty to boot. But that's the way Mr. Fancourt plays it".|$|E
