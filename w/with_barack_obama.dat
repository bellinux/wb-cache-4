However, in November 2007 he slightly moved up in polling, reaching the 2% mark and coming out ahead of his closest rival, Congressman Duncan Hunter of California. In a November 16 Gallup poll, Tancredo stood in seventh place at 2%, trailing Congressman Ron Paul of Texas by 3%. In a head-to-head matchup done by Rasmussen Reports on August 29, 2007, Tancredo trailed New York Senator Hillary Clinton by 13% finishing with 37% to Clinton's 50%.

25|$|The 14th Dalai Lama {{was born}} on a straw mat in a cowshed to a farmer's family in a remote part of Tibet.

25|$|Hillary Clinton was {{the winner}} of the popular vote in the primary, <b>with</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama</b> {{trailing}} in second. Clinton's win was the first time a woman had ever won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. (Shirley Chisholm's prior win in New Jersey in 1972 was in a no-delegate-awarding, presidential preference ballot that the major candidates were not listed in and that the only other candidate who was listed had already withdrawn from; the actual delegate selection vote went to George McGovern.) However, Clinton and Obama received an equal number of delegates to the National Convention since the percentages of their votes were close.|$|E
25|$|The Hispanic population, {{particularly}} the large Mexican American {{population in the}} Southwest and the large Puerto Rican and Dominican populations in the Northeast, have been strong supporters of the Democratic Party. In the 1996 presidential election, Democratic President Bill Clinton received 72% of the Hispanic vote. In following years, however, the Republican Party gained increasing support from the Hispanic community, especially among Hispanic Protestants and Pentecostals. With his much more liberal views on immigration, President Bush was the first Republican president to gain 40% of the Hispanic vote (he did so in the 2004 presidential election). Yet the Republican Party's support among Hispanics eroded in the 2006 midterm elections, dropping from 44% to 30%, with the Democrats gaining in the Hispanic vote from 55% in 2004 to 69% in 2006. Democrats increased {{their share of the}} Hispanic vote in the 2008 presidential election, <b>with</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama</b> receiving 67%. According to exit polls by Edison Research, Obama increased his support again in 2012, winning 71% of Hispanic voters.|$|E

25|$|Born Ruth Beatrice Baker in the United States around 1937, the {{daughter}} of Maurice Joseph Baker and Ida Baker of Newton, Massachusetts, who are of Lithuanian Jewish descent. Ruth Baker was a 1954 graduate of Brookline High School in Brookline, Massachusetts, and a 1958 graduate of Simmons College in Boston {{with a degree in}} business. She was a suburban elementary school teacher when she met and began dating Barack Sr. in Cambridge in June 1964, a month before his return to Kenya in August 1964. She followed Obama Sr. back to Kenya five weeks later, and married him in Kenya in a civil ceremony on December 24, 1964. She later became a private kindergarten director in Kenya. She had two sons <b>with</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama</b> Sr.: Mark and David. She and Barack Sr. separated in 1971 and divorced about 1973. Since she remarried when her sons were young, they took their stepfather's surname, Ndesandjo, as their own. Her third son, Joseph Ndesandjo, was born c. 1980 in her second marriage.|$|E
500|$|Barr's {{campaign}} manager Russ Verney sent a fundraising memorandum on May 19 that included his projections for the campaign, and compared Barr favorably to Ross Perot. His predictions included {{participation in the}} nationally televised debates in October 2008 and a popular vote total of 19%. The manager commented that this was [...] "no ordinary presidential campaign" [...] and that Barr would do well because [...] "America is swamped in Libertarian information." [...] May 18, 2008 Rasmussen polling reports showed Barr at 6% nationally in a four-way race <b>with</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama,</b> John McCain, Ralph Nader. He led Nader by 2%. A breakdown of Barr's support showed that 7% of Republicans, 5% of Democrats and 5% of unaffiliated voters supported his campaign.

500|$|Blair {{recorded}} {{a series of}} promotional interviews for radio and television for, among others, the Arabic television network Al Jazeera, the ITV1 daytime magazine programme This Morning, and BBC Two, which aired an hour-long interview with the journalist and political commentator Andrew Marr. He was in Washington, D.C. {{on the day of}} the UK launch to participate in peace talks with Middle East leaders and attend a White House dinner <b>with</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama,</b> Hillary Clinton, and Israeli and Palestinian leaders. The British newspaper The Independent reported that Blair's visit to the United States was a coincidence, and not an attempt to be out of the United Kingdom when the book was published. When Blair arrived for his first book signing at a leading bookshop on O'Connell Street, Dublin on 4 September, demonstrators heckled, jeered and threw eggs and shoes at him. One activist posed as a purchaser to attempt a citizen's arrest of Blair for war crimes. Protestors clashed with Irish police and tried to push over a security barrier outside the shop. The demonstrators—anti-war protestors and Irish republicans opposed to the peace process—called queuing customers [...] "traitors" [...] and [...] "West Brits". Four people were arrested during the incident.|$|E

500|$|Kennedy {{made his}} first post-illness public {{appearance}} on July 9, when he surprised the Senate by showing up to supply the added vote to break a Republican filibuster against a bill to preserve Medicare fees for doctors. Though additionally ill from an attack of kidney stones and {{against the advice of}} some associates, Kennedy insisted on appearing during the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008, where a video tribute to him was played. Introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy, the senator said, [...] "It is so wonderful to be here. Nothing– nothing– is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight." [...] He then delivered a speech to the delegates (which he had to memorize, as his impaired vision left him unable to read a teleprompter) in which, reminiscent of his speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he said, [...] "this November, the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans. So, <b>with</b> <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama</b> and for you and for me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on." [...] The dramatic appearance and speech electrified the convention audience, as Kennedy vowed that he would be present to see Obama inaugurated.|$|E

The performance of [...] "1+1" [...] saw Beyoncé in a blue cat-suit kneeling and laying atop a grand piano.

[...] "Irreplaceable" [...] was performed after that with an audience sing-along. [...] "Love on Top" [...] and an abbreviated version of Destiny's Child's [...] "Survivor" [...] followed; Beyoncé dedicated the latter song {{to the members of the}} aforementioned girl group, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. Beyoncé was taken back to the main stage being transferred with the same wire. [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] was the first song performed on the main stage with a new brassy arrangement, different from Beyoncé's other live performances of the song. During [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", she integrated a snippet from the song [...] "Movin' on Up".
