40|$|During the Peninsular Wars many napoleonic prisioners were token as captives to France. The non-commissioned officers, {{specially}} military engineers (lieutenants), {{were treated}} as elite prisoners. Then, they had {{a different way of}} life in prison as <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> imagine nowadays, even within the academic field, where there is a big gap on the subject. Normally those prisoners could move around the cities they were send and could go to the libraries and universities. So, sometimes the ways they lived that prison period was different as how it was spread in the common mentalities: First, after the conflict (1814); second, within the commemorations (1914), and third, one century later (2012), when it was assumed in the collective mentalities the traumatic experience of the concentration camps and the brutality of world war period (1930 ´s 1950 ´s).

[...] As a junior, Paine was a talented Australian rules player—considered good enough to make the Australian Football League (AFL)—and his brother Nick, one of four siblings, plays in the Tasmanian Football League with the Clarence Football Club. Paine's uncle, Robert Shaw, was an AFL player and coach.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{development}} and advancement in technology has significantly improved our lifestyle. Technology {{has made its}} impact on nearly all the dimensions of life including ways of communication. Advancement {{in the field of}} communication has made remarkable improvement, starting from the symbol style of communication to the latest digital mobile equipments and computers. Communication itself has not changed, rather the means, which <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> communicate <b>have</b> changed. The manners associated with the ways we communicate with each other continue to be the key to how we understand each other. As new technology emerges, there are new manners associated with the new method of communication. Present study has descriptively analyzed and discussed the historical development, changing paradigms, latest issues and challenges of organizational communication...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we want to}} develop some {{conceptual}} reflections of the processes of virtualization procedures with the aim to indicate a series of misfits and mutations as byproducts of the “digital-graphic culture” (DGC) when {{we are dealing with}} the perception of the “digital space”. Considering the present situation, a bit chaotic from a pedagogical point of view, we also want to propose a set of “virtual space parametersi in order to organize in a systemic way the teaching procedures of architectural design when using digital technology. Nowadays there is a great variety of computer graphics applications comprising practically all the fields of “science & technology”, “architecture, design & urbanism”, “video & film”, “sound” and the massive amount of information technology protocols. This fact obliges us <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an overall view about the meaning of “the new reality through virtualityi. The paper is divided in two sections and one appendix. In the first section we recognise the relationships among the sensory apparatus, the cognitive structures of perception and the cultural models involved in the process of understanding the reality. In the second section, as architects, <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> “a global set of social and technical responsabilities” to organize the physical space, but now we must also be able to organize the “virtual space” obtained from a multidimensional set of computer simulations. There are certain features that can be used as “sensory parametersi when we are dealing with architectural design in the “virtual worldi,  taking into consideration the differences between “immersive virtual reality” and “non inmersive virtual reality”. In the appendix we present a summary of some conclusions based on a set of pedagogical applications analysing the positive and the negative consequences of working exclusively in a “virtual world”. ...|$|R
