There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight <b>we</b> <b>eventually</b> came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E

The state security specialist reported the book posed no threat to the security of South Africa, and the literary experts had accused the censorship board [...] "of bias, prejudice, and literary incompetence", and that [...] "t has not read accurately, it has severely distorted by quoting extensively out of context, it has not considered the work as a literary work deserves to be considered, and it has directly, and by implication, smeared the authoress [...]" [...] Notwithstanding the unbanning, the chairman of the Appeal Board told a press reporter, [...] "Don't buy —it is not worth buying. Very badly written... This is also why <b>we</b> <b>eventually</b> passed it."

Inon Zur worked with Jeremy Soule, the composer for Icewind Dale, to maintain {{the tone of the}} music. Inon Zur also worked closely with Interplay audio director Adam Levenson while composing the music; Zur and Levenson had worked together on several previous titles. Inon Zur said that while composing the theme for the game, [...] "I wrote and rewrote the main theme several times", and [...] "we tried to create a piece that would preserve the sound of the first Icewind Dalewe made great efforts to convey the new elements also. Capturing all of this in 30-45 seconds was not easy however I believe that <b>we</b> <b>eventually</b> found the right path for this game's soundtrack." [...] Zur described the composing process, [...] "After learning the storyboard and getting additional insight from the producers/music supervisor I'll start to compose. The thematic idea (main melody or rhythmical groove) comes first. Then comes the accompaniment followed by the orchestration," [...] and that, [...] "each piece should have its own unique flavour so every step is carefully examined. I {{have to make sure that}} the main idea of the piece is reflected in all these steps." [...] He called the composing experience [...] "very pleasant and rewarding." ...|$|E

They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background. At the time, Marvel did not confirm his involvement in Civil War, due to being contractually obligated not to talk about his inclusion publicly. The Russos discussed this, saying that the various business deals and agreements stemming from the sharing of the character rights, such as on a promotional and commercial level, [...] "were always lagging slightly behind how we were using the character. We were always in danger of upsetting the deal—there were still sensitive issues going on between the two studios that they needed to agree on." [...] Holland was confirmed to appear in the film in July 2015, by Jonathan M. Goldstein, one of the writers of the solo Spider-Man film, and later by Entertainment Weekly from a set visit. Jon Watts, director of Spider-Man: Homecoming, was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes, in order to [...] "see what they were doing with it, and that informed where <b>we</b> <b>eventually</b> took it," [...] and provide [...] "ideas about this and that", such as what Parker's wardrobe and bedroom should look like, [...] "to make sure we were all on the same page so that [...] transitions seamlessly with theirs." [...] Anthony Russo stated that, despite Marvel telling them to have a [...] "plan B" [...] should the deal with Sony fail, the Russos never created one because [...] "it was very important to us to reintroduce" [...] Spider-Man in the film, adding, [...] "We only have envisioned the movie with Spider-Man." ...|$|E

2500|$|These {{two sets}} {{intersect}} at exactly one point. [...] There {{is only one}} possible signal field that both has the correct intensity to match the data trace and fits the mathematical form dictated by the nonlinear interaction. [...] To find that point, which will give the pulse {{we are trying to}} measure, generalized projections is used. [...] The generalized projections algorithm operates in this electric field space. [...] At each step, we find the closest point to the current guess point that will satisfy the constraint for the other set. [...] That is, the current guess is “projected” onto the other set. [...] This closest point becomes the new current guess, and the closest point on the first set is found.

2500|$|Unlike the {{founding}} farther of criminology, Cesare Lombroso, {{who thought that}} crime was fundamentally biological in its origin and criminals lacked free will altogether, contemporary neurocriminologists seem to take the middle ground approach. They do not argue that biological factors alone cause behavioral problems, but recognize that behavior results from interaction between biology and environment. Some authors, however, are more determinist in their views. As one author writes: [...] "Free will may exist (it may simply be beyond our current science), but one thing seems clear: if free will does exist, it has little room in which to operate. It can at best be a small factor riding on top of vast neural networks shaped by genes and environment. In fact, free will may end up being so small that <b>we</b> <b>eventually</b> think about bad decision-making {{in the same way}} we think about any physical process, such as diabetes or lung disease." ...|$|E
