5000|$|JVC would counter 1985's SuperBeta with VHS HQ, or High Quality. The {{frequency}} modulation of the VHS luminance signal {{is limited to}} 3 megahertz, which makes higher resolutions technically impossible even with the highest-quality recording heads and tape materials, but an HQ branded deck includes luminance noise reduction, chroma noise reduction, <b>white</b> <b>clip</b> extension, and improved sharpness circuitry. The effect was to increase the apparent horizontal resolution of a VHS recording from 240 to 250 analog (equivalent to 333 pixels from left-to-right, in digital terminology). The major VHS OEMs resisted HQ due to cost concerns, eventually resulting in JVC reducing the requirements for the HQ brand to [...] "white clip extension plus one other improvement." ...|$|E
