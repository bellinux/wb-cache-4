40|$|The {{assessment}} of abrasiveness and hardness of rocks have been extensively covered by previous researchers, with {{little attention to}} flints, which were only described as highly abrasive. However, analysis of flints has shown that abrasivity of flints varies. These parameters are important inputs for the prediction of drill bit wear rate and design of various parts of drilling/tunneling/mining equipment. In this paper, a classification of flints (sampled from the English, French and Danish Chalk) which correlates with the abrasivity and hardness of flints is proposed. The results showed lighter/grey flints (with more calcite) have lower potential to cause drill bit wear as indicated by hardness and geotechnical <b>wear</b> <b>indices</b> than dark flints. This tends to suggest that even small variations in the carbonate content results in significant variation in abrasivity and that colour {{can be used as}} an indication of the potential of flints to cause tool wear...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to predict}} gauge corner and flange root degradation {{in terms of}} rolling contact fatigue (RCF) and wear from measured rail, wheel and track geometries by so-called meta-models is presented. The methodology sets out from a parameterisation of the gauge corner and the flange root profiles. Statistics of measured rail and wheel profiles are then used to create scenarios, which are employed in multibody dynamics simulations with degradation quantified by RCF and <b>wear</b> <b>indices.</b> Finally regression analysis is employed to derive meta-models to predict whether contact will occur at the gauge corner and (when this is the case) quantify RCF and wear impact. Derived meta-models are used to rank measured profiles based on how detrimental they are. Robustness is assessed through comparisons for two different vehicles. The ability to rank measured profiles without computationally expensive simulations (including needs for additional presumptions that such simulations require) makes the study valuable e. g. for maintenance planning...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} tooth wear and dental erosion is rising in children {{and there is no}} consensus about an index to be employed. Aim: To assess the reliability of an epidemiological scoring system dental <b>wear</b> <b>index</b> (DWI) to measure tooth wear and dental erosive wear. Design: An epidemiological cross-sectional survey was conducted to evaluate and compare tooth wear and dental erosion using the dental <b>wear</b> <b>index</b> and erosion <b>wear</b> <b>index</b> (EWI). The study was conducted with randomised samples of 2, 371 children aged between 4 years and 12 years selected from the State of São Paulo, Brazil. Records were used for calculating tooth wear and dental erosion; the incisal edge and canine cusp were excluded. Results: As the schoolchildren's ages increased the severity of primary tooth wear increased in canines (P = 0. 0001, OR = 0. 34) and molars (P = 0. 0001, OR = 2. 47) and erosion wear increased in incisal/occlusal (P = 0. 0001, OR = 5. 18) and molars (P = 0. 0001, OR = 2. 47). There was an increased prevalence of wear in the permanent teeth of older schoolchildren, particularly on the incisal/occlusal surfaces (P = 0. 0001, OR = 7. 03). Conclusion: The prevalence of tooth wear and dental erosion increased as age increased in children. The epidemiological scoring system Dental <b>Wear</b> <b>Index</b> is able to measure both tooth wear and dental erosive wear. This index should be used to monitor the progression of non-carious lesions and to evaluate the levels of disease in the population...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} removal of {{material}} from a surface during polishing with ®xed abrasives. The material removal pro®le prescribes the amount of material removed from the surface along a direction orthogonal to the tool path as a polishing tool is moved along the surface.

A <b>wear</b> <b>index</b> for polishing is introduced to relate the material removal to the polishing condition. On the basis of the <b>wear</b> <b>index,</b> an approach for calculating the material removal pro®le is developed. It assumes that the pressure distribution is Hertzian at the contact between the tool and the surface. Polishing experiments are conducted which consist of polishing convex surfaces with cylindrical tools and concave surfaces with spherical tools. The proposed approach has been con®rmed by measurements of material removal pro®les in these experiments...|$|E

40|$|Data on the {{prevalence}} of tooth wear among children and adolescents are inconsistent. Given the impact of extensive tooth wear for over a lifetime, evidence on the extent is required. The aim was to systematically review the literature on {{the prevalence}} of tooth wear in children and adolescents. A PubMed literature search (1980 - 2008) used the keywords 'tooth' AND 'wear'; 'dental' AND 'attrition' AND 'prevalence'; 'dental' AND 'wear' AND 'prevalence'; 'erosion AND prevalence' AND 'abrasion AND prevalence'. Following exclusion criteria, 29 papers were reviewed using established review methods. There was a total of 45, 186 subjects (smallest study 80 and largest study 17, 047 subjects) examined from thirteen multiple random clusters, eight multiple convenience clusters and eight convenience clusters. Nine different tooth <b>wear</b> <b>indices</b> were used, but the common denominator among studies was dentin exposure as an indicator of severe wear. Forest plots indicated substantial heterogeneity of the included studies. Prevalence of wear involving dentin ranged from 0 to 82 % for deciduous teeth in children up to 7 years; regression analysis showed age and wear to be significantly related. Most of the studies in the permanent dentition showed low dentin exposure, a few reported high prevalence (range 0 - 54 %); age and wear were not related (regression analysis). The results of this systematic review indicate that {{the prevalence of}} tooth wear leading to dentin exposure in deciduous teeth increases with age.

40|$|Abstract This work {{presents}} the extreme-pressure behavior of 600 N base oil dispersed with MoS 2 Nano particles with 1 volume percent of polyisobutylenesuccinamide as dispersant. MoS 2 Nano particles were dispersed in 0. 05, 1. 0 wt. % and tested for Extreme pressure behavior on a 4 ball wear tester using the test method ASTM D 2783. The weld load and load <b>wear</b> <b>index</b> of base oil and oil dispersed with Nano particles are evaluated and compared for improvement. Prior to dispersion, the MoS 2 Nano particles are suitably surface modified {{to make them}} uniformly disperse in oils. The seizure load, weld load and load <b>wear</b> <b>index</b> of Nano particles dispersed oils have improved remarkably compared to Base oil. Metallographic studies done on the wear balls show that Nano particles get deposited on the worn area preventing the welding of the surfaces and hence higher weld load. The wear scar of bottom there balls are also found to be less for Nano dispersed oils compared to base oil and hence lower load-wear index...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to develop}} a tooth <b>wear</b> <b>index</b> capable of objectively {{classifying}} and quantifying the progression of tooth wear using accurate 3 D scanning data of tooth wear in patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: a 3 D tooth wear scanning protocol, aimed at in-vivo monitoring of tooth wear progression, was developed and assessed using a calibrated reference model. The methodology involved taking polyether impressions of the dentition, pouring impressions in Type IV stone and scanning the resultant casts using a 3 D contact-scanner. Thereafter, eleven tooth wear patients were recruited (n= 130 teeth) with participants’ dentitions scanned initially and after twelve months. The resultant 3 D scan data, demonstrating depth, surface area and distribution of tooth wear, were analysed and employed to formulate a novel 3 D tooth <b>wear</b> <b>index.</b> RESULTS: all study-participants demonstrated ≥ 140 µm of tooth wear {{over a period of}} twelve months. All participants had one or more teeth with ≥ 260 µm tooth wear. However, the wear affected surface area was ≤ 4 % in the majority of scanned teeth (n= 104 / 130). Based on clinical data, the proposed 3 D scanning index classifies tooth wear according to depth (Grade 1 : 140 – 260 µm, Grade 2 : 260 – 380 µm and Grade 3 : 380 - > 500 µm), surface area (Class A: 0 - 4 %, Class B: 4 - 8 % and Class C: ≥ 8 %), and distribution (Localised tooth wear: affecting ≤ 30 % of teeth with Grade 1 or more wear-depth. Generalised tooth wear: affecting > 30 % of teeth with Grade 1 or more wear-depth). CONCLUSION: the proposed tooth <b>wear</b> <b>index</b> offers an objective means to clinically assess and monitor tooth wear progression in patients using quantitative 3 D scan data acquired through a standardised, calibrated and repeatable scanning protocol...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{field studies}} of wheel rail noise, wear and {{top of rail}} {{lubrication}} practice have been conducted using instrumented rails and selected rollingstock, often with hand applied friction modification compounds to test alternative operations. Such studies are limited to selected test curves and selected vehicle bogie types that are of primary concern. Even if train operations allow sufficient track and vehicle possession time, testing {{is limited by the}} time required to apply the friction modifiers. Using vehicle simulation it is possible to test a wide variety of curvatures, curve designs and bogie types, as well as variable wheel rail profiles and friction conditions providing curving performance measures such as <b>wear</b> <b>indices</b> and lateral rail head forces. This paper reviews the paper from CORE 2004 ‘Control of Wheel/Rail Noise and Forces Through Friction Modification’ with studies conducted by the CRE (Centre for Railway Engineering) using vehicle dynamics software VAMPIRE®. The study was conducted by CRE on behalf of QR {{as a part of the}} Train Dynamics Management Program. The results agree with field measurements that rail head friction modification produces considerable benefits in wear reduction on very tight curvatures. The further simulations on medium and gentle curves, however, show the benefits from top-of-rail friction modification are small for medium and gentle curves, and the benefits are dependent on the passive steering features of the bogie and the wheel-rail profile and flange friction conditions. The paper presents the results of several different conditions of curvature, and wheel rail profile conicity. These results are discussed in view of developing guidelines for effective placement of friction modifier compounds...|$|R

40|$|Changing patters of tooth wear {{have been}} used {{extensively}} to obtain information about the lifestyle and culture of pre-historic humans. The assessment of tooth wear in previous anthropological studies has been largely based on quantitative analysis of wear indices and qualitative analysis of micrographs. Wear indices are simple to use and can be sensitive tools, {{but there is a}} lack of international standardization in their use. Micrographic assessment of pits and scratch marks on the worn surfaces of teeth can assist in dietry reconstruction of humans, but this approach has low reliability and high observer error. This review will provide an update on a new <b>wear</b> <b>index</b> and novel nano-techniques that hold promise for improving the analysis of tooth wear. Recently, a new <b>wear</b> <b>index,</b> termed the Basic Erosive Wear Examination index, has been proposed as a standardized universal tool for diagnosing erosive tooth wear. However, its value seems to be limited when assessing the dentitions of populations, in whom tooth wear occurs predominantly by attrition and abrasion. Optical technqiues involving scanning confocal microscopy combined with fractal analysis can provide an objective assessment of the worn surface. Other nanotechnology-based methods, such as nanohardness measurements, nano-computed tomography and mass spectrometry, can be useful in physical and chemical characterization of both sound and worn teeth, but these techniques are limited to use in vitro. A combined assessment of the worn dentition using all of these techniques promises to provide the best holistic approach to analyse tooth wear.

40|$|Purpose: Performance of DLC and W-DLC coated {{woodworking}} knives was investigated. The {{results of}} testing DLC and W-DLC coating properties {{as well as}} the results of life-time tests in the form of wear of HSS and HM knives with these coatings is presents. Design/methodology/approach: DLC coating was deposited by MCVA method, and W-DLC coating was deposited by pulsed RMS. Tests of knives coated with DLC and W-DLC as uncoated ones was made by machining: MDF board, pinewood slats and floorboard - using a typical industrial milling machine. Findings: DLC coating is significantly harder (33 - 40 GPa) than W-DLC coating (19 GPa). From Rockwell test it can be concluded that both coatings display high adhesion (HF 1), whereas in the scratch methods, significantly lower adhesion of DLC coating can be observed (LC 2 = 17 - 21 N) in comparison to W-DLC coating (LC 2 = 54 N). Influence of the hardness and adhesion of coatings on wear resistance of coated tools is discussed. Practical implications: Wear resistance of planer knives coated with DLC is by approx. 20 %, and W-DLC by approx. 30 % higher in comparison with uncoated knives during MDF milling. Wear of planer knives with W-DLC coating is approx. by 10 %, and DLC by approx. 25 % lower in comparison to uncoated HSS knives during pinewood milling. Lifetime of HM shape tools coated DLC and W-DLC is considerably higher (200 - 300 %) during floorboard milling. Originality/value: The industrial tests of cutting wood and wood-based materials indicate that the carbon coatings deposited on the tool generally improve its performance and all <b>wear</b> <b>indexes</b> for the tools are lower than for uncoated. The DLC and W-DLC coatings show good antiwear properties required in industry application...|$|R

Stone dies for each tooth were prepared and scanned using the CAD-CAM Laser Cercon System. Scanned images were printed and examined under a toolmaker microscope to quantify tooth wear and then the dies were directly assessed under the microscope to measure tooth wear. The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was {{used to analyze the}} data. Results TWI scores for incisal edges were 0 – 3 and were similar at both occasions. Score 4 was not detected. Wear values measured by directly assessing the dies under the toolmaker microscope (range= 113 – 150 μm, mean= 130 ± 20 μm) were significantly more than those measured from Cercon Digital Machine images (range= 52 – 80 μm, mean= 68 ± 23 μm) and both showed {{significant differences between the two}} occasions.

Scanned images were printed and examined under a toolmaker microscope (Stedall-Dowding Machine Tool Company, Optique et Mecanique de Precision, Marcel Aubert SA, Switzerland) to quantify tooth wear and then the dies were directly assessed under the microscope to measure tooth wear. The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was used to analyse the data. Results: TWI scores for incisal edges were 0, 1, and 2 and were similar at both occasions. Scores 3 and 4 were not detected. Wear values measured by directly assessing the dies under the tool maker microscope (range= 517 - 656 microm, mean= 582 microm, and SD= 50) were significantly more than those measured from the Cercon digital machine images (range= 132 - 193 microm, mean = 165 microm, and SD= 27) and both showed {{significant differences between the}} two occasions.
