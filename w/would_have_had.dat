5|$|A crisis erupted {{over the}} writs of {{assistance}} on December 27, 1760, {{when the news}} of King George II's death on October 23 arrived in Boston. All writs automatically expired {{six months after the}} death of the King, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to be re-issued by George III, the new king, to remain valid.|$|E
5|$|Along with Charles Madigan, Keogh {{withdrew from}} playing Manchester on 11 March after tour manager James Scott refused to lend them money. It is {{unlikely}} that the players, including Keogh, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> much recourse over disputes with the tour organisers; they would struggle to access the funds to necessary for passage back to New Zealand without them.|$|E
5|$|Although the RF-4M <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> some advantages, it was {{discounted}} as {{the cost}} would have been greater, with consequently fewer aircraft purchased, while only those that had been modified {{would have been able}} to undertake the reconnaissance mission. Ultimately, the RAF chose the standard F-4M and external pod, which allowed all of its aircraft to perform all designated roles.|$|E

5|$|Another {{idea that}} McDonnell {{proposed}} was {{a variation of}} a carrier-based Phantom, {{with the goal of}} improving catapult performance and lowering approach speeds. The F-4(HL) <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a longer fuselage and wingspan, with less sweep, stabilators with increased area and air intakes with auxiliary blow-in doors to increase airflow at low speeds. This proposal was not taken forward.|$|E
5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} taster, {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food was safe to consume. He is a prime suspect because he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> access to everything eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> anything to gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be able to claim the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding the homicide. Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line with the suggestion that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried an ailing Claudius out of the banquet, taken him to his room and forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate. Others say Xenophon used poisoned gruel.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus gives a {{detailed}} description of the Persian fleet that assembled at Doriskos in spring 480 BC (see table). However, after the fleet was struck the storm off the coast of Magnesia, approximately one third of the fleet was lost. Thus, by Herodotus's reckoning, the Persian fleet <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> approximately 800 triremes at Artemisium.|$|E

5|$|In 1864 the Board {{decided to}} seek powers {{to extend the}} railway beyond Gupworthy to {{workings}} in Joyce's Cleeve in the Quarme Valley. Preliminary notices to this effect were published, but no application was made. Had the line been built it would have entailed another incline, which ore <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to ascend before travelling eastwards to Brendon Hill where it would travel down again.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Raimi {{expressed}} interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter-ego, the Lizard, a villain which had been teased since Spider-Man 2; the character's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea. By December 2009, John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though {{she would not have}} transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics but a new superpowered figure, the Vulturess. According to sources online, an early draft of the film <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the Vulture buying out the Daily Bugle, forcing Spider-Man to kill him. Felicia Hardy, Vulture's daughter in this version of the script, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> an affair with Peter Parker in order to shatter his engagement with Mary Jane. These rumors were never confirmed. Raimi stated years later during an interview in 2013, however, that Hathaway was going to be Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, {{plans were}} drawn up {{to move to}} a 55,000-seat {{purpose-built}} arena {{on the site of the}} King's Dock in Liverpool.

5|$|In {{order to}} provide enough {{capacity}} for the line, the GG <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to be taken off of the Queens Boulevard Line, and a turnback was necessary to provide a new terminal for the line.

5|$|K–Pg {{boundary}} mammalian {{species were}} generally small, comparable {{in size to}} rats; this small size would have helped them find shelter in protected environments. In addition, it is postulated that some early monotremes, marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> additional protection from K–Pg boundary environmental stresses.|$|E
5|$|Lawyers for The Progressive voluntarily {{underwent}} {{security reviews}} and were granted Q clearances {{that allowed them}} to access restricted nuclear information.

5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, and, since the males were larger and required more food, males <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may {{have allowed the}} males to target larger prey than the females, {{and they may have}} had to defend females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals.|$|E
5|$|Like the Shieldings’ lookout, {{one made}} {{guardian}} of the gateway to Lejre <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to be trusted, and perhaps connected to the king by family or loyalty; the guardian would at least occupy an important position in the military hierarchy. Adornments like the Gevninge helmet fragment would have served to identify the rank of such a person, adding decoration to a helmet meant {{for more than just}} protection.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, 2003, Delaware {{officials}} unveiled {{plans at}} a public workshop for a new bridge to replace the 1965 bridge and its 1976 addition. A tied-arch design spanning the inlet slightly west of the 1976 addition to the 1965 bridge, the new bridge <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the longest arched span in the world, with a length of 1,000 feet (305 meters). With an estimated cost of $65 million, the new bridge <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> no piers in the water, avoiding the scouring problems that had plagued the earlier spans. Delaware officials hoped that work could begin {{in the autumn of}} 2004 and be completed two years later. However, the tied-arch design deterred all but one bidder on the construction contract, and that bid came in much higher than expected and was more than DelDOT could afford at the time. By the autumn of 2005, a $200 million shortfall in the state transportation budget had delayed construction projects all over Delaware and forced the state to put plans for the new bridge on hold, and in the meantime rising labor and materials costs drove the cost of the bridge up to $200 million, $50 million above the budget.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{pathogens}} and invasive species of extraterrestrial origin might differ enough from terrestrial organisms in their biology {{to have no}} adverse effects.

5|$|Preserved {{woolly mammoth}} fur is orange-brown, {{but this is}} {{believed}} to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> dark coats, while those with two copies of the recessive allele <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} ceratopsians, {{especially}} Centrosaurus and its relatives, {{appear to have}} been gregarious, living in herds.
