The paper addresses this question by studying selected soft <b>work</b> <b>practices,</b> namely <b>work</b> systems and fringe benefits, in a Dutch MNC and its subsidiaries in Western and in Central Eastern Europe. Acknowledging institutional variation across the studied host countries, the paper explores how the MNC’s economic interest and company values interact with host-country institutions in shaping subsidiary <b>work</b> <b>practices.</b> It is argued that the MNC’s rational behaviour is contextualized in local socio-institutional conditions, as well as it is informed by company values.

25|$|Social work is an {{academic}} discipline and profession that concerns itself with individuals, families, groups and communities {{in an effort}} to enhance social functioning and overall well-being. Social functioning refers {{to the way in which}} people perform their social roles, and the structural institutions that are provided to sustain them. Social work applies social sciences, such as sociology, psychology, political science, public health, community development, law, and economics, to engage with client systems, conduct assessments, and develop interventions to solve social and personal problems; and create social change. Social <b>work</b> <b>practice</b> is often divided into micro-work, which involves working directly with individuals or small groups; and macro-work, which involves working communities, and within social policy, to create change on a larger scale.|$|E

He therefore proposed that the <b>work</b> <b>practice</b> that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one best method for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their productivity would go up. Thus his compensation plans usually included piece rates. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect and tried to get large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} comprehensive {{analysis of the}} factors driving the adoption and use of high-involvement/high-performance <b>work</b> <b>practices.</b> Using a unique longitudinal data set of automobile assembly plants {{from around the world}} I address three key questions: (1) Given the extensive literature linking high-involvement <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> and superior organizational performance, how do we explain the slow adoption of such practices? (2) What factors determine the distribution of high-involvement <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> within a global industry? and (3) What modifications are made to <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> when they are brought into a different cultural and institutional environment?^ The adoption of high-involvement <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> is driven by a complex set of factors. Each factor shifts the perceived costs and benefits of altering existing <b>work</b> <b>practices.</b> I show that the presence of complementary human resource practices, experience with earlier practices, and disruptions that 2 ̆ 2 unfreeze 2 ̆ 2 existing practices are important in explaining who adopts high-involvement <b>work</b> <b>practices.</b> ^ The presence of complementary practices also {{plays an important role in}} explaining international differences in the use of high-performance work. Using dyadic analysis, I further demonstrate that location effects are extremely important. In particular, company effects are mitigated by host and home country effects. ^ Lastly, I show that while Japanese transplants in North America use the same <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> as their counterparts in Japan, they have made various modifications to accommodate the North American environment. Coupled with careful socialization and selection programs aimed at developing a work force amenable to high-involvement work, these changes help the transplants to manage the cultural and institutional differences between North America and Japan. The modifications show that, while high-involvement <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> can be implemented in very different cultural and institutional environments, some adaptation is needed. ^ The findings in this dissertation dramatically expand our understanding, both theoretically and empirically, of the determinants of adoption of high-involvement <b>work</b> <b>practices,</b> and the drivers of differences in how organizations operate in a multinational context. They accentuate the benefits of considering high-involvement work systems from the dual vantage points of a dynamic and a multinational perspective. ...|$|R
