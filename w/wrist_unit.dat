40|$|CAPP Terminal Device, Size # 2 for teenaged {{and adult}} amputees offers an {{alternative}} to hooks and hands available today. CAPP T D 2 {{is intended to be}} pleasing in appearance; it blends with the forearm in shape, colour and material to give a continuous flowing natural look. It was designed to provide secure grip through the combined action of a closing spring, a full frictional, resilient cover and a n automatic lock. The lock operates as part of the voluntary opening control system and requires no conscious action by the amputee. CAPP T D 2 is a general purpose terminal device which especially serves unilateral amputees by performing functions usually carried out by the non-dominant hand. CAPP TD 2 comes with a built-in wrist connector which is available in two models; both offer quick disconnect. One <b>wrist</b> <b>unit</b> has adjustable friction and the other attaches to an existing friction <b>wrist</b> <b>unit</b> so CAPP T D 2 can be applied to an existing prosthesis. Ten patients have completed the evaluation programme with promising results. Prototypes of CAPP T D 2 are available for patients interested in evaluating it...|$|E
40|$|Prosthetic wrists {{need to be}} compact. By {{minimizing}} space requirements, a <b>wrist</b> <b>unit</b> can be {{made for}} people with long residual limbs. This prosthetic wrist uses two motors arranged across the arm within the envelope of the hand. The drive is transmitted by a differential so that it produces wrist flexion and extension, pronation and supination, or a combination of both. As a case study, it was controlled by a single-prosthesis user with pattern recognition of the myoelectric signals from the forearm. The result is a compact, two-degree-of-freedom prosthetic wrist that has the potential to improve the functionality of any prosthetic hand by creating a hand orientation that more closely matches grasp requirements...|$|E

The purpose of the tactile paging system is to communicate to the deaf-blind people in an institutional environment. The system consists of a main console and individual satellite <b>wrist</b> <b>units.</b> The console emits three signals by telemetry to the <b>wrist</b> com (receiving <b>unit)</b> which will measure approximately 2 x 4 x 3 / 4 inches and will be fastened to the wrist by a strap.

The Morse code message can be felt and recognized with the finger...|$|R
40|$|As the {{development}} of dexterous prosthetic hand and <b>wrist</b> <b>units</b> continues, {{there is a need}} for command interfaces that will enable a user to operate these multi-joint devices in a natural, coordinated manner. In this study, myoelectric signals and hand kinematics were recorded as three able-bodied subjects performed a variety of individuated movements and simulated functional tasks. Time-delayed artificial neural networks (TDANNs) were designed to simultaneously decode the movement trajectories for seven distal degrees of freedom (pronation-supination, wrist ulnar-radial deviation, wrist flexion-extension, thumb rotation, thumb abduction-adduction, finger MCP flexion-extension, and finger PIP flexion-extension). Performance was quantified by calculating the variance accounted for (VAF) and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) between the decoded and actual movements. Accurate predictions were achieved (VAF: 0. 57 - 0. 80, NRMSE: 0. 04 - 0. 11), suggesting that it may be possible to provide an intuitive EMG-based scheme that provides continuous and simultaneous multi-joint control for individuals with below-elbow amputations...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of prostheses and of dynamic orthoses {{is to provide}} restorative function to anatomical joints of the upper or lower limb that are either absent or physiologically compromised. This study considers the volitional demands of upper limb function and the periodic requirements of the lower limb during gait. Control strategies using discrete magneto-transducers to measure normal residual physiological activities which predict intended joint positions of dysfunctional or absent joints in the lower or upper limb, have been investigated and tested by experiment. The restoration of ankle dorsiflexion in hemiplegics with drop foot using functional electrical stimulation (FES) has been investigated. FES is traditionally controlled using a pressure switch in the heel of the shoe switching the stimulation on only when the foot is not weight bearing. However functional and cosmetic constraints of this method of control do not make it universally acceptable. A novel FES controller using a magneto-transducer to measure the cyclic variation of angular velocity of the leg through the knee has been developed. Experimentation with this controller showed that reliable switching of FES during successive gait cycles was possible in some patients with a hemiplegic drop foot. Most powered prosthetic prehensors and wrist units are controlled using the myoelectric activity of muscles. Such prostheses however have no intrinsic relationship between {{the position of the}} prosthetic prehensor and <b>wrist</b> <b>unit</b> and hence a degree of conscious effort in their control is required. A powered prosthetic prehensor and <b>wrist</b> <b>unit</b> has been developed using magneto-transducers which sense the myokinemetric activity of muscles dedicated to grasping and which measure forearm rotation. Reliable volitional control of the position of prosthetic prehension and wrist rotator has been demonstrated over several cycles of grasping and wrist rotation...|$|E

The model is a combination of commercially available equipment, customized electronic circuits, and electromechanical transducers. The paging system facilitates communication to deaf-blind clients in an institutional environment as an aid in their training and other activities.

40|$|Although {{significant}} {{technological advances}} {{have been made}} in the last forty years, natural and effortless control of upper limb prostheses is still an open issue. Commercially available myoelectric prostheses present limited Degrees of Freedom (DoF) mainly because of the lack of available and reliable independent control signals from the human body. Thus, despite the crucial role that an actuated wrist could play in a transradial prosthesis in terms of avoiding compensatory movements, commercial hand prostheses present only manually adjustable passive wrists or actuated rotators controlled by (unnatural) sequential control strategies. In the present study we investigated the synergies between the humeral orientation with respect to the trunk and the forearm pronation/supination angles during the execution of a wide range of activities of daily living, in healthy subjects. Our results showed consistent postural synergies between the two selected body segments for almost the totality of the activities of daily living under investigation. This is a promising result because these postural synergies could be exploited to automatically control the <b>wrist</b> rotator <b>unit</b> in transradial prostheses improving the fluency and the dexterity of the amputee...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Up to now, {{the number of}} {{hemiplegia}} rehabilitation devices is increasing quickly along with hemiplegic patients'. But most of hand rehabilitation training just limit to the fingers flexible training of patients' affected hand.

In our new research, we proposed a novel hand and wrist rehabilitation robot to achieve grasp functional training of hand except thumb and intorsion/extorsion and dorsiflexion/plantar flexion of wrist, which provides a creative hand rehabilitation way for hemiplegic patients. In this paper, we will introduce the detail design of the robot. It mainly includes two rehabilitation <b>units</b> - <b>wrist</b> rehabilitation <b>unit</b> and hand rehabilitation unit, which can realize separate motion or cooperate motion of hand and wrist based on patients' willingness. What's more, the torque sensor unit is purposely designed to detect feedback torque of related motion instead of available ones in the market, which makes the whole mechanical structure more compact.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of electric prosthetic systems {{has resulted in}} the widespread transition to digital controllers, i. e., microprocessors. In fact, it may be true that every available electronic controller in the field of prosthetics will soon be a digital controller. In our own experience, the ProControl 2 was introduced seven years ago, which provided digital control of hand and wrist. The last seven years have brought new generations of improved software (the newest version is 5. 1. 2, so five generations have evolved), as well as development of new sensors. Also, continued {{evolution of}} commercial microprocessors has resulted in more powerful controllers, in even smaller sizes than were available previously. In December of 2002, initial units of the Utah Arm 3 with electric elbow, hand, and wrist functions were prepared, including completely new digital controllers for elbow, hand, and <b>wrist.</b> Five <b>units</b> were placed into field trial usage on every-day wearers of a transhumeral (or higher level) electric arm prosthesis.

40|$|The global {{trend for}} {{increasing}} {{life expectancy is}} resulting in aging populations {{in a number of}} countries. This brings to bear a pressure to provide effective care for the older population with increasing constraints on available resources. Providing care for and maintaining the independence of an older person in their own home is one way that this problem can be addressed. The EU Funded Unobtrusive Smart Environments for Independent Living (USEFIL) project is an assistive technology tool being developed to enhance independent living. As part of USEFIL, a <b>wrist</b> wearable <b>unit</b> (WWU) is being developed to monitor the physical activity (PA) of the user and integrate with the USEFIL system. The WWU is a novel application of an existing technology to the assisted living problem domain. It combines existing technologies and new algorithms to extract PA parameters for activity monitoring. The parameters that are extracted include: activity level, step count and worn state. The WWU, the algorithms that have been developed and a preliminary validation are presented.

40|$|The {{question}} was addressed {{as to whether}} the magnitude of Ia presynaptic inhibition might depend on the type of motor unit activated during voluntary contraction in the wrist extensor muscles. For this purpose, we investigated the effects of applying electrical stimulation to the median nerve on the responses of 25 identified motor units to radial nerve stimulation delivered 20 ms after a conditioning stimulation. The reflex responses of the motor units yielded peaks in the post-stimulus time histograms with latencies compatible with monosynaptic activation. Although median nerve stimulation did not affect the motoneurone net excitatory drive assessed from the mean duration of the inter-spike interval, it led to a decrease in the contents of the first two 0. 25 ms bins of the peak. This decrease may be consistent with the Ia presynaptic inhibition known to occur under these stimulation conditions. In the trials in which the median nerve was being stimulated, the finding that the response probability of the motor units, even in their monosynaptic components, tended to increase as their force threshold and their macro-potential area increased and as their twitch contraction time decreased suggests that the median nerve stimulation may have altered the efficiency with which the Ia inputs recruited the motoneurones in the pool. These effects were consistently observed in seven pairs of motor units each consisting of one slow and one fast contracting motor unit which were simultaneously tested, which suggests that the magnitude of the Ia presynaptic inhibition may depend on the type of motor unit tested rather than on the motoneurone pool excitatory drive. The present data suggest {{for the first time that}} in humans, the Ia presynaptic inhibition may show an upward gradient working from fast to slow contracting motor units which is able to compensate for the downward gradient in monosynaptic reflex excitation from ‘slow’ to ‘fast’ motor units. From a functional point of view, a weaker Ia presynaptic inhibition acting on the fast contracting motor units may contribute to improving the proprioceptive assistance to the <b>wrist</b> myotatic <b>unit</b> when the contraction force has to be increased...|$|R
2500|$|The {{conquest of}} Egypt by the Semitic Hyksos was {{to usher in}} {{significant}} changes. Hyksos technology was superior {{to that of the}} Egyptians, including more durable weapons of bronze (rather than the weaker copper), body armor, scimitars, and most devastatingly, the horse drawn chariot. The Egyptians suffered defeat and the Hyksos era saw a century [...] of foreign rule beginning in 1640BC although the Egyptians still retained control of southern or Upper Egypt. Mobilization of traditional weapons and fighting units reversed the Hyskos triumph including the campaigns of Seqenenre Tao (who {{died as a result of}} combat or capture) and the decisive military initiatives of his son and successor Kamose, which rolled back the Hyksos northward, and ravaged a merchant fleet beneath the walls of their capital Avaris. Building upon these successes, the final conquest of the Hyksos was completed by Ahmose I, who ushered in the 18th Dynasty, and the New Kingdom. While traditional forces defeated the Hyksos, two new weapons traceable to Hyksos influence- the composite bow and the chariot appear for the first time in widespread use of the Egyptian Army, and the Egyptians quickly adapted these, as the New Kingdom gained in power. This period saw new heights in Egyptian military sophistication and prowess. Recruitment methods were refined. Central armories were established that issued standardized bows, quivers, shields and spears to troops. Under the Pharaoh Ahmose I, well-organized and intense training was carried out, including archery practice and instruction on the proper handling and use of the chariots. Along with chariots, the more powerful and lethal composite bow was increasingly adopted. Documentation from the tomb of a Nubian royal official called Maiherpri from the 18th Dynasty shows that Nubian troops maintained their reputation for archery into this period. Armed even in death, the Nubian's funerary equipment includes arrows, bows, quivers and leather <b>wrist</b> guards. <b>Units</b> of other peoples such as Syrians, Libyans and Medjay also were incorporated into the Egyptian forces. These developments set the stage for the expulsion of the Hyksos and the re-conquest of territory. Ahmose's anti-Hyksos strategy also shows a new sophistication. He first cut Hyksos lines of communication between their base at Avaris and Canaan by taking the city of Tjaru. With this in hand he began a squeeze on Avaris, taking the city after 4 attacks. Further campaigning in Gaza put paid to Hyksos hegemony in Egypt permanently.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of motor preparation on human motoneuron activity was studied by combining single motor unit recording techniques with reaction-time (RT) methods. The tonic activity of <b>wrist</b> extensor motor <b>units</b> associated with voluntary isometric contractions was analysed during {{preparation for a}} ballistic wrist extensor muscle contraction, using a time preparation procedure. Two durations of the preparatory period elapsing between the warning signal and the response signal were used in separate blocks of trials: a short preparatory period (1 s) allowing optimum time preparation, and a longer, non-optimum one (3 s). Changes in motoneuron tonic discharge patterns not associated with any changes in the force output were observed during the preparatory period, which suggests that these changes were subtle enough to prevent any changes in muscle contraction from occurring before the forthcoming movement. The changes observed were a lengthening of the mean interspike interval (ISI) {{and a decrease in}} the ISI variability. These data confirm that inhibitory mechanisms are activated during motor preparation and suggest that spinal inhibitory mechanisms are involved in the preparatory processes. The mechanisms possibly involved, such as presynaptic inhibition, dysfacilitation processes or AHP conductance changes, are discussed. The fact that the preparation-induced effects on motoneuron activity were particularly prominent during {{the last part of the}} 3 s preparatory period suggests that they were probably related to the neural processes underlying temporal estimation. The anticipatory changes in motoneuron activity observed here during preparation for action provide evidence that central influences act on spinal motoneurons well before it is time to act...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} is to test whether the PowerGlove (PG), an {{instrumented}} glove which consists of inertial (accelerometers and gyroscopes) and magnetic sensors, is a valid and reliable instrument to measure different degrees of hand motor impairments in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Background: Assessment of hand movements {{is an important part of}} the motor function section of the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS). Unfortunately, the assessment often varies per physician and is highly dependent on experience. This subjective nature sometimes makes it hard to interpret the UPDRS correctly. Recently, the University of Twente developed the PG which enables accurate and ambulant measurement of hand and finger movements (Fig. 1 A) [1]. Application of the PG during the clinical scoring will enable more accurate observation of hand function and quantification of the PD motor symptoms. Methods: We plan to include 35 PD patients. We will assess the hand movements of the patients in medication on/off state with the PG during 7 UPDRS items, i. e. tremor at rest, action and postural tremor, finger tapping, rapid opening/closing of the hand, pro/supination of the hand, and <b>wrist</b> rigidity. Sensor <b>units</b> of the PG are attached to the dorsal side of the left hand and on the finger segments of the thumb, index and middle finger. One additional PG sensor is attached to the forearm to measure the wrist angle. A force sensor is used to measure the force which is applied to passively flex the wrist of the patient. Prior to measurement, an anatomical calibration procedure is performed to determine the sensor-to-segment coordinate systems. Results: Visual inspection of preliminary results showed there were notable differences in the recorded data within a patient in medication on/off state. Conclusions: The results indicate that the PG enables to quantitatively detect differences in the clinical state of the patient. In the next phase of this study, parameters need to be found which describe the performance of UPDRS tasks and include these in the group analyses of the 35 PD patients...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 In the United States, nearly 282, 000 {{people are}} hospitalized for {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI) each year. TBI includes patients with moderate and severe TBI. As {{a part of the}} clinical care continuum, intermediate care is traditionally the last stage of inpatient hospitalization for people with TBI cases in U. S. facilities. There, an interdisciplinary team evaluates a patient’s recovery from brain injury to identify appropriate care referral which is usually a skilled nursing facility, inpatient rehabilitation, or home. Unfortunately, while hospitalized the patient with TBI may encounter a care environment that is not always supportive of recovery. The environment of care is often a barrier and a facilitator to post-TBI recovery, because it influences important physiologic processes, notably sleep. It is a barrier because when there are excessive stimuli there is less rest. It is a facilitator because when these stimuli are curbed, there is a therapeutic effect that takes place. Overall, the goal in the intermediate care environment is to minimize barriers and augment facilitators of health improvement. In patients with TBI, both factors of intrinsic and extrinsic origin contribute to sleep disturbance and act as barriers. Among hospitalized patients of all kinds, extrinsic factors like hospital noise, exposure to light, and nighttime awakenings (either caused by hospital staff or occurring naturally in the patients themselves) are noted as salient barriers. These same problems can be assumed to also burden hospitalized patients with TBI. However the available literature on sleep disturbance of patients with TBI housed on intermediate care units is sparse. Current methods to describe the influence of the care environment on the sleep health of this patient population are also sparse. This may be {{due in part to the}} short and unpredictable length of stay for these patients when they are housed in intermediate care units—a phase of hospitalization where they are monitored until they are medically stable enough to be transferred to another level of care. Another challenge relates to conducting clinical research on a vulnerable population because it which requires more resources to obtain informed consent (support from legally authorized representative [LAR]). There is also the challenge of assessing sleep variables among a population with accompanying injuries and co-morbidities. Even if a retrospective study is implemented, there is the challenge of securing pertinent and consistent sleep and environmental information from the electronic medical record (EMR). More importantly, the challenge of not knowing the pattern of environmental and sleep characteristics of this group can prevent a nurse researcher from knowing what type of environmental curbing to focus on. For these reasons, the dual approach of documenting both sleep actigraphy and continuous external stimuli in the patient’s room may be necessary for the development of pertinent care interventions. The dissertation is composed of three manuscripts. The first manuscript aims to describe the utility of the EMR in identifying sleep health in patients with moderate-to-severe TBI who are housed in the neuroscience intermediate care setting. The second manuscript focuses on the methods for describing objective rest/activity characteristics during nighttime hours (using actigraphy) for hospitalized patients with moderate-to-severe TBI. The third manuscript describes the utility of continuously logging select external stimuli in the hospital rooms of patients being treated for a moderate-to-severe TBI. The first manuscript is a retrospective chart review that describes documented nursing interventions and sleep health of patients with moderate-to-severe TBI (N= 34) housed in a neuroscience specialty unit of a level 1 trauma center during nighttime hours (2200 through 0800 hours). Subjects were identified from the trauma registry between January and March 2013. Data were extracted from both the trauma registry and the EMR. The variables of “mean nighttime care activities” and “slept well” were created based on nursing flow sheet logs and hospital notes during the nighttime hours for these patients for up to seven days. The results of the study show that while nightly nursing care activities are frequent (M = 5. 6 activities per night), sleep/rest was poorly captured in nursing documentation. The paper highlights the absence of standard sleep/rest queries for nursing documentation in the EMR. The second manuscript recounts actigraphy findings from a single-cohort feasibility study (N = 17) and specifically details the sleep parameters of patients with moderate or severe TBI who are hospitalized on a neuroscience specialty floor of a level 1 trauma center. This manuscript also discusses some of the challenges of conducting actigraphy on this population as well as the underlying methodology and data analysis scheme. Wrist actigraphy data were collected on subjects for five consecutive days or until discharge from the unit; only nighttime sleep was analyzed. Injury and disability variables like Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and functional independence measure (FIM®), respectively, were also collected. Results from this study show that more than half the sample has sleep efficiencies of less than 80 %. During the hours of sleep, the average number of wake bouts across the sample is frequent (M = 41 per person) and total wake time during the nighttime hours is excessive (M = 74 minutes), suggesting poor sleep consolidation in this group. Likely due to the small sample size, weak associations were found between the sleep parameters and primary injury/disability variables. The third manuscript recounts findings from a single-cohort feasibility study (N = 18) that sought to describe the pattern of ambient environmental influences on the sleep of a patient with moderate or severe TBI during the nighttime hours of hospitalization on an intermediate care neuroscience specialty unit (2000 to 0800 hours). For up to five days or until discharge from the <b>unit,</b> <b>wrist</b> actigraphy and a custom, multi-sensor device continuously logged sleep-wake cycles and ambient stimuli, respectively, of a patient housed on the unit. The manuscript results show that sound and motion signaling significantly influences the probability of nighttime awakenings for patients in the sample. During nighttime hours, mean sound levels were 52 decibels (A-weighted); mean light levels were 9 lumens, and the mean proportion of movement was 0. 28 (p) (28 %). With the ambient stimuli set at their mean levels, there is a 20 % probability that patients will wake during the night (multi-level logistic regression). The comprehensive results from these papers suggest that implementation of known (actigraphy) and novel (multi-sensor) technologies among this patient population could yield critical information about the pattern of sleep and the pattern of environmental stimuli...|$|R
