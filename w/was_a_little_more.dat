5|$|The town of Port Chicago {{was located}} on Suisun Bay in the estuary of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. Suisun Bay is {{connected}} to the Pacific Ocean by San Francisco Bay. In 1944, the town <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a mile from a U.S. Navy munitions depot, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, which was later expanded and renamed the Concord Naval Weapons Station but is now called the Military Ocean Terminal Concord. The original magazine was planned in 1941 with construction beginning shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The first ship to dock at Port Chicago was loaded on December 8, 1942.|$|E

25|$|Otho Sackville-Baggins: (2910–3012) Otho was {{the only}} child of Longo and Camellia Sackville-Baggins. He {{inherited}} the headship of the Sackville family through his mother, Camellia. He also stood to inherit the headship of the Baggins family, which would have made him the head of two families at once. In 2942 his cousin Bilbo Baggins was presumed dead, and Otho's father was Bilbo's closest living heir. The Sackville-Bagginses nearly acquired Bag End, but were foiled by Bilbo's unexpected return. Otho's future wife, the formidable Lobelia Bracegirdle, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> successful: she had appropriated many of Bilbo's silver spoons. Many years later Bilbo adopted Frodo Baggins, a more distant relative, as his heir, thus thwarting Otho's ambitions for the Baggins inheritance. Otho was infuriated, and scrutinized Bilbo's will for any irregularities under the Shire's strict witnessing laws. Otho died between the time of Bilbo's Long Expected Party (which he attended) and Frodo's departure to Bree. Accordingly, he never enjoyed the luxuries of Bag End when Lobelia finally took ownership.|$|E
