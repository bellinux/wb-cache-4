Cross-section SEM showed that the exposure of samples to H 2 O with large concentrations of CO 2 led to the dissolution of the ZnO:Al layer, likely starting from the grain boundaries. This resulted in an increased series resistance, which is likely related to an increase in resistivity of the ZnO:Al layer. It also led to a very rapid decrease of the short-circuit current of these samples. Therefore, the conversion efficiency was rapidly lost. cop. 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A <b>purge</b> <b>water</b> {{management}} system is described for effectively eliminating {{the production of}} <b>purge</b> <b>water</b> when obtaining a groundwater sample from a monitoring well. In its preferred embodiment, the <b>purge</b> <b>water</b> {{management system}} comprises an expandable container, a transportation system, and a return system. The <b>purge</b> <b>water</b> management system is connected to a wellhead sampling configuration, typically permanently installed at the well site. A pump, positioned with the monitoring well, pumps groundwater through the transportation system into the expandable container, which expands in direct proportion with volume of groundwater introduced, usually three or four well volumes, yet prevents the groundwater from coming {{into contact with the}} oxygen in the air. After this quantity of groundwater has been removed from the well, a sample is taken from a sampling port, after which the groundwater in the expandable container can be returned to the monitoring well through the return system. The <b>purge</b> <b>water</b> management system prevents the <b>purge</b> <b>water</b> from coming in contact with the outside environment, especially oxygen, which might cause the constituents of the groundwater to oxidize.

All determinations were made prior {{to the opening of}} the unit and after the system was purged for 35 h with all bedside station taps open. Formaldehyde disinfection of the piping system was attempted with a recommended protocol after 11 weeks by feeding 2. 5 liters of 37 % formaldehyde (0. 85 %, vol/vol) into the delivery system. Prior to <b>water</b> <b>purging,</b> 24 ng of endotoxin per ml was detected. This level decreased to 2. 0 ng of endotoxin after the purging.

Species isolated from the renal dialysis system were predominately pseudomonads, whereas species isolated from the tap water were Bacillus and Flavobacterium species.

40|$|When {{evaluating}} uncertainties {{in developing}} an aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) system, under normal budgetary constraints, a systematic approach {{is needed to}} prioritise investigations. Three case studies where field trials have been undertaken, and clogging evaluated, reveal the changing perceptions of viability of ASR from a clogging perspective {{as a result of}} the progress of investigations. Two stormwater and one recycled water ASR investigations in siliceous aquifers are described that involved different strategies to evaluate the potential for clogging. This paper reviews these sites, as well as earlier case studies and information relating water quality, to clogging in column studies. Two novel theoretical concepts are introduced in the paper. Bayesian analysis is applied to demonstrate the increase in expected net benefit in developing a new ASR operation by undertaking clogging experiments (that have an assumed known reliability for predicting viability) for the injectant treatment options and aquifer material from the site. Results for an example situation demonstrate benefit cost ratios of experiments ranging from 1. 5 to 6 and apply if decisions are based on experimental results whether success or failure are predicted. Additionally, a theoretical assessment of clogging rates characterised as acute and chronic is given, to explore their combined impact, for two operating parameters that define the onset of purging for recovery of reversible clogging and the onset of occasional advanced bore rehabilitation to address recovery of chronic clogging. These allow the assessment of net recharge and the proportion of <b>water</b> <b>purged</b> or redeveloped. Both analyses could inform economic decisions and help motivate an improved investigation methodology. It is expected that aquifer heterogeneity will result in differing injection rates among wells, so operational experience will ultimately be valuable in differentiating clogging behaviour under different aquifer conditions for the same water type.

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{demonstration}} testing of the <b>Purge</b> <b>Water</b> Management System (PWMS) technology at the Savannah River Site (SRS), four wells were equipped with PWMS units in 1997 {{and a series of}} sampling events were conducted at each during 1997 - 1998. Three of the wells were located in A/M Area while the fourth was located at the Old Radioactive Waste Burial Ground in the General Separations Area. The PWMS is a ''closed-loop'', non-contact, system used to collect and return <b>purge</b> <b>water</b> to the originating aquifer after a sampling event without having significantly altered the water quality. One of the primary concerns as to its applicability at SRS, and elsewhere, is whether the PWMS might resample groundwater that is returned to the aquifer during the previous sampling event. The purpose of the present investigation was to compare groundwater chemical analysis data collected at the four test wells using the PWMS vs. historical data collected using the standard monitoring program methodology to determine if the PWMS provides representative monitoring samples. The analysis of the groundwater chemical concentrations indicates that the PWMS sampling methodology acquired representative groundwater samples at monitoring wells ABP- 1 A, ABP- 4, ARP- 3 and BGO- 33 C. Representative groundwater samples are achieved if the PWMS does not resample groundwater that has been purged and returned during a previous sampling event. Initial screening calculations, conducted prior to the selection of these four wells, indicated that groundwater velocities were high enough under the ambient hydraulic gradients to preclude resampling from occurring at the time intervals that were used at each well. Corroborating evidence included a tracer test that was conducted at BGO- 33 C, the high degree of similarity between analyte concentrations derived from the PWMS samples and those obtained from historical protocol sampling, as well as the fact that PWMS data extend all previously existing concentration trends to the present time. The latter line of evidence is considered to be the most powerful in demonstrating that representative samples are being acquired by the PWMS because {{it is highly unlikely that}} previously existing concentration trends would continue if resampling had occurred. Standard procedure for obtaining protocol groundwater monitoring samples at the Savannah River Site (SRS) calls for extracting or ''purging'' sufficient quantities of groundwater to allow removal of stagnant water and to allow certain key indicator parameters to stabilize prior to collection of samples. The water extracted from a well prior to sample collection is termed ''purge water'' and must be managed in an approved fashion if it contains hazardous and/or radiological constituents that exceed specified health-based limits described in the Investigation Derived Waste Management Plan (WSRC, 1994). Typical management practices include containerization, transportation, treatment, and disposal via Clean Water Act -permitted facilities. A technology for handling <b>purge</b> <b>water</b> that eliminates the need to containerize and transport this water to a disposal facility has been developed. This technology, termed the <b>Purge</b> <b>Water</b> Management System (PWMS), is currently under pilot stage deployment at SRS. The PWMS is a ''closed-loop'', non-contact system used to collect and return <b>purge</b> <b>water</b> to the originating aquifer after a sampling event without significantly altering the water quality. A schematic drawing of the PWMS is in Figure 1. The system has been successfully demonstrated at both a ''clean'' well, P- 26 D, and a ''contaminated'' well, MCB- 5, by comparing chemical concentration data obtained by PWMS sampling against the historical data record for each of these wells (Hiergesell et al., 1996).
