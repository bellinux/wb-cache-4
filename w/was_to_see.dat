5|$|Calhoun, {{though as}} avid a proponent for Texas {{acquisition}} as Upshur, posed a political liability to Tyler's aims.

5|$|Anne had {{explained}} before {{that she did}} not wish the public to know that her relationship with Sarah was failing, because any sign that Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as Captain-General. Sarah was kept in all of her offices – purely for the sake of her husband's position as Captain-General of the army – and the tension between the two women lingered on until early in 1711. This year <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the end of their relationship for good.|$|E

5|$|During the 1952 Winter Olympics, Rødkleiva {{hosted the}} men's slalom and the women's slalom, {{with the other}} events taking place at Norefjell. The {{organizing}} committee had set up 15,000 tickets for the men's discipline on 19 February, but between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the race, the surplus who did not pay for tickets. The large popularity <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Norway's favoured Stein Eriksen. Although leading after the first heat, {{he came out of}} balance in the second and finished second behind Austria's Othmar Schneider. The women's race held the following day was won by the American Andrea Mead-Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|The {{accession}} of Frederick, a {{child who}} would then become also the Holy Roman Emperor FrederickII in 1197, greatly affected the immediate future of Sicily. For a land so used to centralised royal authority, the king's young age caused a serious power vacuum. His uncle Philip of Swabia moved to secure Frederick's inheritance by appointing Markward von Anweiler, margrave of Ancona, regent in 1198. Meanwhile, Pope InnocentIII had reasserted papal authority in Sicily, but recognised Frederick's rights. The pope <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> papal power decrease steadily {{over the next decade}} and was unsure about which side to back at many junctures.|$|E
5|$|In January 1953, {{the corps}} {{underwent}} its last major {{reorganization of the}} war, losing command of the US 3rd, 24th, and 45th Infantry Divisions, the South Korean 8th and 9th Infantry Divisions, and the British 1st Commonwealth Division, while taking command of the US 2nd, 7th, and 25th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Marine Division. On 23 January 1953, the first major action {{of the year was}} initiated with a raid by aggressive infantrymen of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division against the enemy's Big Nori positions. The next months saw many such raids which harassed the enemy, captured prisoners, and destroyed defensive works. Beginning in March, the Communists continually attacked the corps outposts. In that month, troops on Old Baldy were withdrawn, on orders from I Corps, after suffering heavy casualties from the Chinese. On 10 April 1953 Lieutenant General Bruce C. Clarke, who <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the corps through the remainder of its combat, assumed command.|$|E

5|$|In June 1863, Hines led an {{invasion}} into Indiana with 25 Confederates {{posing as a}} Union unit in pursuit of deserters. Their goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the local Copperheads would support the invasion of John Hunt Morgan planned for July 1863. Traveling through Kentucky for eight days to obtain supplies for their mission, they crossed the Ohio River to enter Indiana, {{near the village of}} Derby, on June 18, 1863. Hines visited the local Copperhead leader, Dr. William A. Bowles, in French Lick, and learned {{that there would be no}} formal support for Morgan's Raid. On his way back to Kentucky, Hines and his men were discovered in Valeene, Indiana, leading to a small skirmish near Leavenworth, Indiana, on Little Blue Island. Hines had to abandon his men as he swam across the Ohio River under gunfire.|$|E
5|$|In the 197778 season Villa {{reached the}} quarter-final of the UEFA Cup {{where they went}} out 43 on {{aggregate}} against Barcelona. In the domestic league, however, they struggled and Saunders started rebuilding the team. As Saunders began restructuring his team {{in the summer of}} 1979, there were more changes in the boardroom. Doug Ellis set a resolution to have several directors removed from the board. The resolution was not successful and as a result, Ellis resigned from the board. Meanwhile, Saunders brought in several new players who were to become some of Villa's most prolific players in terms of goals and appearances. Allan Evans, Ken McNaught and Kenny Swain were brought into the defence and Des Bremner was brought into the midfield to play alongside Dennis Mortimer and Gordon Cowans. Tony Morley and Gary Shaw were the new strike partnership. When Peter Withe was signed from Newcastle United in the summer of 1980, Saunders had built a team that <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> much success in the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot MacPherson strut for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E
