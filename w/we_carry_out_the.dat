60|$|However, we {{obtain a}} new result of {{fundamental}} importance when <b>we</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> analogous consideration for {{a ray of}} light. With respect to the Galileian reference-body K, such a ray of light is transmitted rectilinearly with the velocity c. It can easily be shown that {{the path of the}} same ray of light is no longer a straight line when we consider it with reference to the accelerated chest (reference-body K1). From this we conclude, that, in general, rays of light are propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields. In two respects this result is of great importance.|$|E
60|$|But {{the uninitiated}} may wonder {{how it is}} {{possible}} to deal with a number which cannot be counted. It is impossible to count up all the numbers, one by one, because, however many we may count, there are always more to follow. The fact is that counting is a very vulgar and elementary way of finding out how many terms there are in a collection. And in any case, counting gives us what mathematicians call the ordinal number of our terms; that is to say, it arranges our terms in an order or series, and its result tells us what type of series results from this arrangement. In other words, it is impossible to count things without counting some first and others afterwards, so that counting always has to do with order. Now when there are only a finite number of terms, we can count them in any order we like; but when there are an infinite number, what corresponds to counting will give us quite different results according {{to the way in which}} <b>we</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> operation. Thus the ordinal number, which results from what, in a general sense may be called counting, depends not only upon how many terms we have, but also (where the number of terms is infinite) upon the way in which the terms are arranged.|$|E

5000|$|This is {{the form}} for W first derived by Boltzmann. Boltzmann's {{fundamental}} equation [...] relates the thermodynamic entropy S {{to the number}} of microstates W, where k is the Boltzmann constant. It was pointed out by Gibbs however, that the above expression for W does not yield an extensive entropy, and is therefore faulty. This problem is known as the Gibbs paradox. The problem is that the particles considered by the above equation are not indistinguishable. In other words, for two particles (A and B) in two energy sublevels the population represented by A,B is considered distinct from the population B,A while for indistinguishable particles, they are not. If <b>we</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> argument for indistinguishable particles, we are led to the Bose-Einstein expression for W: ...|$|E
