5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1817 Captain George <b>Woodbine,</b> one of Nicolls's former {{subordinate}} officers, was present in Spanish East Florida together with the former British soldier and Scottish mercenary lieutenant of Simon Bolivar, Gregor MacGregor. <b>Woodbine</b> and MacGregor both left Spanish East Florida to rejoin the Latin American revolutionary movement prior to U.S. military intervention in East Florida. The names of Nicolls, <b>Woodbine,</b> and MacGregor had become associated with the arming of blacks as soldiers, militiamen, and even as mercenaries. The threat, real or imaginary, was an anathema to North American popular conceptions of the time.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} six months of operation, the subway was {{operated}} as a single system, with trains from Eglinton Station running through to either Keele or <b>Woodbine</b> station, while other trains connected the latter two points. However, the manoeuvre made operation of both lines more difficult, and the practice was abandoned after the initial trial period, leaving Lower Bay Station abandoned.|$|E

Deciding to {{disclose}} his past, they drive to Allen City, to the <b>Woodbine</b> cemetery, where he shows her the Tomb of Deke Rivers. He explains that when the orphanage he lived in burned down eleven years earlier, he decided to bury his past, and took Rivers' name.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to British outposts on the Atlantic coast at Tangier and the Cumberland Islands, {{there was a}} similar outpost on the Gulf coast at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River in Spanish East Florida which attracted Redstick Creek Indians and Black Seminoles. George <b>Woodbine</b> and a detachment of Royal Marines were landed from HMS Orpheus in May 1814 with gifts, two thousand muskets and blankets for the Indians. A fort was constructed, and Cochrane sent Edward Nicolls to oversee the operations at Prospect Bluff.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 1978, Smythe {{suffered}} a heart attack. He spent {{a month in the}} hospital, in time to spend May 18 at <b>Woodbine,</b> where he had four horses racing that day.

5|$|The parkway was {{the second}} {{expressway}} to be built by Metropolitan Toronto (Metro). Planning began in 1954, the year of Metro's formation. The first section opened during 1961 and the entire route was completed {{by the end of}} 1966. South of Bloor Street, the expressway was constructed over existing roadways. North of Bloor Street, it was built on a new alignment through the valley, requiring the removal of several hills, diversion of the Don River and the clearing of woodland. North of Eglinton Avenue, the expressway follows the former <b>Woodbine</b> Avenue right-of-way north to Highway401.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndication}} {{deal for}} Secretariat precluded the horse racing past age three. Accordingly, Secretariat's last race was against older {{horses in the}} Canadian International Stakes over one and five-eighths miles on the turf at <b>Woodbine</b> Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on October 28, 1973. The race was chosen {{in part because of}} long-time ties between E.P. Taylor and the Chenery family, and partly to honor Secretariat's Canadian connections, Laurin and Turcotte. Unfortunately, Turcotte missed the race with a five-day suspension: Eddie Maple got the mount.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to higher}} {{elevation}} and precipitation, {{the ecology of}} the Black Hills differs significantly from that of the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by coniferous needleleaf evergreens: various types of pines—including ponderosa (covering , or 80% of the Black Hills forest), lodgepole, white, and timber—as well as western red cedar and spruces. Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber tree in the area. The South Dakota state tree is the Black Hills spruce. The Red Valley is home to blue-joint and bluegrasses, and wild plum, Juneberry, and chokecherry shrubs grow in the Hills. Violets, thistles, and horse mint are prevalent herbs. Vines grow widely: the <b>woodbine,</b> bittersweet, and wild grape, which is the pattern for Black Hills gold jewelry.|$|E

5|$|East of Highway404, {{the freeway}} travels {{generally}} {{parallel to the}} Rouge River. It interchanges with <b>Woodbine</b> Avenue (York Regional Road8) and Warden Avenue (York Regional Road65), east of which the route travels alongside a CN line and crosses the GO Transit Unionville Line. Highway407 continues straight eastward into a residential area, interchanging with Kennedy Road (York Regional Road3), McCowan Road (York Regional Road67) and Markham Road (York Regional Road68) where it crosses the river and diverges from both the CN line and power transmission corridor. The route interchanges with Ninth Line (York Regional Road69) and Donald Cousens Parkway (York Regional Road48) before exiting the urban GTA and curving northeast over a CP line and into Rouge Park.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{tensions}} existed {{with the}} Spanish. Writing from HMS Royal Oak, off Mobile Bay, on 15 March 1815, Rear Admiral Pulteney Malcolm, Cochrane's subordinate {{commander of the}} Mobile Squadron, assured Don Mateo Gonzalez Manrique, the Governor at Pensacola, that Post-Captain Robert Cavendish Spencer (a son of George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer) of , had been detailed to conduct a strict enquiry into the conduct of Nicolls and Captain <b>Woodbine,</b> regarding the property losses of Spanish inhabitants of Florida. Malcolm believed that in cases where former slaves could not be persuaded {{to return to their}} owners, the British government would undertake to remunerate the owners.|$|E
5|$|The MTO {{formally}} {{announced plans}} to alleviate traffic in Newmarket on 28 August 2000: a three contract project to widen and extend Highway404. The first contract added an additional lane in each direction in the grass median from Major Mackenzie Drive to Bloomington Road. A second contract then extended those two lanes north to Aurora Sideroad. These two projects both began {{in the summer of}} 2001 and were completed in December. The third contract called for a four lane extension from Davis Drive to Green Lane and the reconstruction of Green Lane into a four-laned arterial road between Leslie Street and <b>Woodbine</b> Avenue.|$|E

5|$|The first planned {{route of}} the parkway was to follow the lower Don Valley before turning north and {{continuing}} along the Don Mills Road right-of-way north to the Toronto Bypass (today's Highway401). Edward P. Taylor, developer of the Don Mills subdivision, situated at Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue, protested the plan heavily and the path was rerouted along the CPR railway from Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue north-east to meet the <b>Woodbine</b> Avenue right-of-way at Lawrence Avenue, and proceeded north to the Toronto Bypass. To facilitate the Flemingdon Park development, located south-east of Don Mills Road and Eglinton, the entire planned route south of Lawrence to the present interchange at Don Mills Road was moved east to its current alignment.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{continues}} directly north {{along the}} old <b>Woodbine</b> Avenue right-of-way to just south of Steeles Avenue, where it diverges to the west before continuing north. From just north of Sheppard, a northbound HOV lane is present alongside the central median. Southbound, the HOV lane continues as far as Highway401. Alongside Highway 404 to the east is an industrial warehouse and commercial office area, while on the west is a suburban subdivision of North York. Northbound, the freeway is six lanes wide from Sheppard Avenue to Finch Avenue, where one lane diverges onto an off-ramp, re-emerging north of Finch. Southbound, it is six lanes wide from Steeles south to Sheppard.|$|E
5|$|The second, more substantial, Corps served from 18 May 1814 until 20 August 1816. The {{greater part}} of the Corps was {{stationed}} on the Atlantic coast, with a smaller body occupying a fort on the Gulf coast in Florida. Recruits were accepted from among escaped slaves who had already gained their freedom on coming into British hands and who were unwilling to join West India Regiments. The establishment of the force sparked controversy at the time, the arming of former slaves representing a psychological threat to the slave-owning society of the Americas). As a consequence, the two senior officers of the Corps in Florida (George <b>Woodbine</b> and Edward Nicolls) were demonised in Niles' Register for their association with the Corps and inducing slave revolt.|$|E
