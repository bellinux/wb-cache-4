Specifically, for preference scanning <b>worms,</b> we are able to provide a precise condition that determines whether the <b>worm</b> spread will eventually stop and obtain the distribution {{of the total number of}} hosts that the <b>worm</b> infects.

40|$|Unrestricted"War of the worms" is a {{war between}} {{opposing}} computer <b>worms,</b> creating complex <b>worm</b> interactions {{as well as a}} detrimental impact on infrastructure. For example, in September 2003 the Welchia <b>worms</b> were launched to terminate the Blaster <b>worms</b> and patch the vulnerable hosts. We propose a new <b>Worm</b> Interaction Model (based upon and extending beyond the epidemic model) focusing on random-scan network <b>worm</b> interactions and encounter-based <b>worm</b> interactions.; Motivated by "war of the worms", we propose a <b>worm</b> interaction approach that relies upon automated beneficial <b>worm</b> generation aiming to alleviate problems of <b>worm</b> propagations in such networks. We also propose a new set of metrics to quantify the effectiveness of one <b>worm</b> terminating other <b>worm.</b> To understand the dynamic of <b>worm</b> interactions and its performance, we mathematically model <b>worm</b> interactions based on major <b>worm</b> interaction factors including <b>worm</b> interaction types, network characteristics,and node characteristics using ordinary differential equations and analyze their effects on our proposed metrics. Our study provides the first work to characterize and investigate <b>worm</b> interactions of random-scan <b>worms</b> in multi-hop networks.; For encounter-based <b>worms,</b> we validate our proposed model using extensive synthetic and trace-driven simulations. We find that, all the above <b>worm</b> interaction factors significantly affect the pattern of <b>worm</b> propagations. For example, immunization linearly decreases the infection of susceptible nodes while on-off behavior only impacts the duration of infection. Using realistic mobile network measurements, we find that encounters are "bursty", multi-group and non-uniform. The trends from the trace-driven simulations are consistent with the model, in general. Immunization and timely deployment seem to be the most effective to counter the <b>worm</b> attacks in such scenarios while cooperation may help in a specific case. These findings provide insights that we hope would aid in developing counterworm protocols in future encounter-based networks...|$|R
