40|$|EPA has {{identified}} <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing</b> at low mercury feedrates, {{as well as}} carbon adsorption via carbon injection into the offgas or via flow through fixed carbon beds, as control technologies {{that can be used}} to meet the proposed Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rule limit for mercury emissions from hazardous waste incinerators. DOE is currently funding demonstrations of gold amalgamation that may also control mercury to the desired levels. Performance data from a variety of sources was reviewed to determine ranges of achievable mercury control. Preliminary costs were estimated for using these technologies to control mercury emissions from mixed waste incineration. Mercury emissions control for mixed waste incineration may need to be more efficient than for incineration of other hazardous wastes because of higher mercury concentrations in some mixed waste streams. However, mercury control performance data for <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing</b> and carbon adsorption is highly variable. More information is needed to demonstrate control efficiencies that are achievable under various design and operating conditions for <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing,</b> carbon adsorption, and gold amalgamation technologies. Given certain assumptions made in this study, capital costs, operating costs, and lifecycle costs for carbon injection, carbon beds, and gold amalgamation generally vary for different assumed mercury feedrates and for different offgas flowrates. Assuming that these technologies can in fact provide the necessary mercury control performance, each of these technologies may be less costly than the others for certain mercury feedrates and the offgas flowrates...|$|R

40|$|Desulphurization of flue gases {{from various}} {{chemical}} industries in a techno-econo-enviro manner is a demanding technology. The concentrations of sulphur dioxide {{in and around}} these plants overshoot the danger point. In recent years, the process analysis of chemical absorption in a slurry has become important in rational design and development of <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing</b> processes {{for the removal of}} SO 2 from flue gases. The elementary steps encountered in <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing</b> by slurries are diffusion and reaction of gaseous species and solid dissolution in liquid film. In the present work, the process of the absorption of sulphur dioxide into wet magnesia slurry was theoretically analyzed according to the two-reaction plane model incorporating the solid dissolution promoted by the reactions with absorbed sulphur dioxide in the liquid film. A model based on Fick's second law has been developed to calculate enhancement factor for absorption of Sulphur dioxide into Mg(OH) 2 slurry. The concentration of accumulated species in the bulk of the liquid phase (sulphite ions for this case) which substantially control the absorption rates was included in the model for the prediction of theoretical enhancement factor. The values of theoretical enhancement factors obtained from model were compared with experimental enhancement factors available in literature. The model values of enhancement factors agreed well with the values of experimental enhancement factor available in literature...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{pilot plant}} tests of {{simultaneous}} removal of S 0 {sub 2 } and NO{sub x} in a wet lime flue gas desulfurization system were concluded in December. The tests, {{at up to}} 1. 5 MW(e) capacity, were conducted by the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company and Dravo Lime Company for the US Department of Energy at a pilot facility at the Miami Fort station of CG&E near Cincinnati, Ohio. The pilot plant scrubbed a slipstream of flue gas from Unit 7, a 530 MW coal-fired electric generating unit. Tests were conducted in three phases between April and December. The technology tested was <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing</b> with Thiosorbic{reg_sign} magnesium-enhanced lime for S 0 {sub 2 } removal and simultaneous NO scrubbing with ferrous EDTA, a metal chelate. Magnesium-enhanced lime-based <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing</b> is used at 20 full-scale high-sulfur coal-fired electric generating units with a combined capacity of 8500 NW. Ferrous EDTA reacts with nitric oxide, NO, which comprises about 95 % of NO{sub x} from coal-fired boilers. In this report, although not precise, NO and NO{sub x} are used interchangably. A major objective of the tests was to combine NO{sub x} removal using ferrous EDTA, a developing technology, with SO{sub 2 } removal using wet lime FGD, already in wide commercial use. If successful, this could allow wide application of this NO{sub x} removal technology...|$|R
