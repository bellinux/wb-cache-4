Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's hand with a marker on one of the walls of the White House <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.|$|E
5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E

She picks him up when he seems to wish it, and puts him down <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to explore. When he is distressed, she knows what kinds and degree of soothing he requires to comfort him – and she knows that sometimes a few words or a distraction will be all that is needed. On the other hand, the mother who responds inappropriately tries to socialize with the baby when he is hungry, play {{with him when he}} is tired, or feed him when he is trying to initiate social interaction.|$|E
500|$|... "Band Geeks", {{a second}} season episode {{that focuses on}} Squidward, is often {{considered}} by many critics and fans alike {{as one of the}} show's best episodes. Writing for The Washington Post, Michael Cavna ranked [...] "Band Geeks" [...] as the fifth best episode of SpongeBob SquarePants. In his review, Cavna said, [...] "Squidward's mix of artistic aspiration in the face of goading, humiliation and unrelenting sub-mediocrity made this a kids' episode that adults can experience on a whole 'nother level." [...] On a less positive note, Squidward was listed among Common Sense Media's [...] "10 Worst TV Role Models of 2012". Author Sierra Filucci said that the character's selfishness is his [...] "worst offense", called Squidward [...] "the mean and nasty cashier at the Krusty Krab" [...] and said that [...] " [...] is nice only <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> something".|$|E

500|$|A jubilant Thomas {{described}} the free kick {{as the most}} crucial goal of his career, and believed Wrexham had every chance of causing another upset in the next round, despite an unfavourable away draw: [...] "We are disappointed not {{to be at home}} but after beating the champions we're not afraid of anyone." [...] He credited the club for their conditioning programme but also attributed the good form to casual drinking: [...] "I always have two pints of Guinness on a Friday, sometimes more. It gives me energy, I feel stronger and believe in it." [...] His manager Flynn admitted Thomas [...] "trains <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to train," [...] and added: [...] "I will take whatever he's taking to keep him going. And if he was 10 years younger I'd be able to sell him for £5m." [...] Days after the win, Thomas was charged by North Wales Police for his involvement in a counterfeit currency scam. He was arrested a year later, and following a trial was sentenced to 18 months in jail.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{production}} expanded on that of The Chronic, with new, sparse {{beats and}} reduced use of samples which were prominent on his debut album. Co-producer Scott Storch talked of how Dr. Dre used his collaborators during recording sessions: [...] "At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something. He needed a fuel injection, and Dre utilized {{me as the}} nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, and I sort of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I'd be on the keyboards, and Mike [...] was on the bass guitar, and Dre was on the drum machine." [...] Josh Tyrangiel of Time has described the recording process which Dr. Dre employs, stating [...] "Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine {{in a room full}} of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to work, they work.) He'll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Affleck's poor {{critical}} notices {{continued in}} 2004 when he starred as a bereaved {{husband in the}} romantic comedy Jersey Girl, directed by longtime collaborator Smith. Stephen Holden of The New York Times described Affleck as an actor [...] "whose talent has curdled as his tabloid notoriety has spread". But Joe Leydon of Variety found his onscreen role as a father [...] "affecting". Later that year, he starred opposite James Gandolfini in the holiday comedy Surviving Christmas. Holden noted in The New York Times that the film [...] "found a clever way to use Ben Affleck's disagreeable qualities. The actor's shark-like grin, cocky petulance and bullying frat-boy swagger befit his character." [...] At this point, the quality of scripts offered to Affleck [...] "was just getting worse and worse" [...] {{and he decided to}} take a career break. The Los Angeles Times published a piece on the downfall of Affleck's career in late 2004. The article noted that, unlike film critics and tabloid journalists, [...] "few industry professionals seem to be gloating over Affleck's travails". Various producers and agents were interviewed, with Harvey Weinstein describing Affleck as [...] "one of the sweetest people I've ever met in this industry ... I think the sky's the limit <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to focus. And he will." ...|$|E

David thinks he wears the trousers and she is prepared to think that to an extent. So she manages to massage his ego and then does her own thing anyway." [...] Karen becomes an alcoholic in Series 4 and seeks therapy to control her urges. After trying to put David's affair with Jessica behind them, Karen starts an affair with publisher Mark. She breaks up with him via email while in Australia but he flies down and reveals their relationship to David. She briefly gets back together with Mark during her divorce from David in Series 5 but ends the relationship again <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> {{nothing to do with}} her children. After Rachel's death, Karen sees a grief counsellor. Norris and Bullen changed Karen's personality significantly between the pilot and the series; Norris altered the character's accent to be less [...] "posh" [...] and Bullen wrote her to be more sympathetic. Bullen found it difficult to write situations for Karen that took place outside the character's house. Eventually, he wrote a storyline for her in Series 2 where she rebels against her upper-middle-class lifestyle by smoking cannabis at a dinner party. Norris was disappointed that the plot of Karen and David's divorce could not be developed further in Series 5, as the majority of screen time was given to Adam and Rachel.|$|E

Beiste {{continues}} to advise Finn when he takes charge of the glee club for the duration of Will's stay in Washington while he serves on a blue-ribbon arts panel. Beiste also acts as faculty advisor to the school's superheroes club. When Sam (Chord Overstreet) and Brittany think the Mayan apocalypse is imminent and decide to get married, Beiste offers to marry them, but makes sure to perform a ceremony that is not valid legally. When the apocalypse does not happen, they are relieved when the coach tells them that they are not, in fact, married. Later in the season, after Emma leaves Will at the altar on their wedding day and the two are briefly estranged, Beiste confesses to falling in love with him, but he tells the coach that he and Emma have recently gotten back together. Will asks a hurt Beiste to come to glee club; Beiste does so reluctantly, but as the period begins, two gunshots are heard in the school, and Beiste assists in barricading the choir room, helping to keep everyone quiet, and aiding Will in subduing Sam <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to go out and search for Brittany, who was not in the room when the lockdown began. Afterward, Beiste tells Will that he should reach out to forgive Finn, whose role as Will's assistant on the glee club was terminated when Finn admitted to kissing Emma while Will was in Washington, and he does so.|$|E

He becomes an expert cricket-bowler, but only through hard effort (he needed sporting credit at Rugby School, and feared to play rugby football).

2500|$|In his autobiography, {{published}} some 65 years later, Kipling {{recalled the}} stay with horror, and wondered ironically if {{the combination of}} cruelty and neglect which he experienced there {{at the hands of}} Mrs. Holloway might not have hastened the onset of his literary life: [...] "If you cross-examine a child of seven or eight on his day’s doings (specially <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to go to sleep) he will contradict himself very satisfactorily. If each contradiction be set down as a lie and retailed at breakfast, life is not easy. I have known a certain amount of bullying, but this was calculated torture—religious as well as scientific. Yet it made me give attention to the lies I soon found it necessary to tell: and this, I presume, is the foundation of literary effort".|$|E

2500|$|The {{loneliness}} in Orbison's {{songs that}} he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: [...] "I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else... Although if you grow up in West Texas, {{there are a lot}} of ways to be lonely." [...] His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees stated, [...] "He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things... Before that no one would do it." [...] Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: [...] "When [...] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to cry." [...] Peter Lehman, on the other hand, considered Orbison's theme of constant vulnerability an element of sexual masochism.|$|E
