5|$|<b>Water</b> <b>is</b> {{essential}} to a thermal power station, heated to create steam to turn the steam turbines. Water used in the boilers is taken from two licensed boreholes on site. Once this water has been through the turbines it is cooled by condensers using water taken from the nearby River Ouse. <b>Water</b> <b>is</b> pumped from the river by a pumphouse on the river, north of the station. Once it has been through the condenser, the <b>water</b> <b>is</b> cooled {{by one of the}} natural draft cooling towers, with two towers serving each generating set. Once cooled, the <b>water</b> <b>is</b> discharged back into the river.|$|E

5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. <b>Water</b> <b>is</b> a {{stronger}} solvent than methane. <b>Water</b> <b>is</b> also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E

5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} fresh <b>water</b> <b>is</b> {{the result}} of precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the <b>water</b> <b>is</b> directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, {{a significant amount of}} fresh <b>water</b> <b>is</b> held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>water</b> <b>is</b> {{vital for}} life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even {{the structure of}} pure <b>water</b> <b>is</b> poorly understood, due {{to the ability of}} water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds.|$|E

5|$|At a {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point of <b>water</b> <b>is</b> 375°C. At {{a depth of}} 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea <b>water</b> <b>is</b> more than 300atmospheres (as salt <b>water</b> <b>is</b> denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E

5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, <b>water</b> <b>is</b> needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The <b>water</b> <b>is</b> transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle.
