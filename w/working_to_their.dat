50|$|Hot-stick working {{appeared}} in the second decade of the 20th century, when insulating poles made from baked wood were used for tasks such as replacing fuses, replacing post insulators, and transferring lines onto temporary supports. The sticks enabled the linemen {{to carry out the}} work without infringing on the minimum clearance distances from live equipment. As experience with the techniques developed, then the operating voltages at which the work was performed increased. With the advent of fibreglass poles in the late 1950s, which neither split nor soaked up rainwater, utilities were prepared to carry out hot-stick <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> highest operating voltages, perhaps 765 kV.|$|E
50|$|Cybertron's {{governing}} structure {{during the}} Beast Wars era {{is based upon}} the Pax Cybertronia (Peace of Cybertron). The peace on Cybertron is maintained through a treaty known as the Pax Cybertronia, which - perhaps unfairly - ranks the Predacons as second-class citizens, with the Maximals in control of the planet. Each side is governed by a council;the Maximals governing body is known as the Maximal Imperium while the Predacons' version, the Tripredacus Council, operate out of a satellite orbiting the planet or star, quietly <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own agenda... an agenda that was sorely disrupted by the rise to power of the renegade, Megatron, who stole a ship and escaped to prehistoric Earth with the intent of altering time.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} {{when it comes}} to using multisourcing. First of all, moving suppliers is quicker and easier, if something isn't working, and doesn't seem likely to work, you don't have to render the whole service but just a small part of it. This is extremely effective because clients are no longer tied down by the fact that one supplier deals with all their needs. This leads to another point which is that companies are keen on reducing their dependence on sole suppliers {{for longer periods of time}} driven by 10-15 year contract terms, thereby giving them the flexibility to align their products/services much faster and in-line with end-customer demands. This flexibility makes sure that companies always have the option of improving upon what they already have. It ensures that suppliers are always <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> maximum potential to fulfil their clients needs and gives the clients more options.|$|E

On technical level, early warning system is composed of five procedures, including goal setting, information collection, data analysis, information distribution, and early warning response. This chapter shows how to evaluate these procedures: providing evaluation strategy and indicators. On the viewpoint of administration level, seven evaluation indictors are proposed, including simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, portability, stability, security, and system costs. These indictors make conducting sound and fair valuations practical and help to assess whether a set of evaluative activities are well-designed and <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> potential...|$|E

40|$|People {{living with}} mental illness are {{underemployed}} in Canada. This study addresses how disability assistance in British Columbia is contributing to the financial and social empowerment of these people. My research addresses how the current $ 500 monthly exemption rate for beneficiaries with disabilities is contributing {{to their ability to}} gain adequate work experience and reintegrate into the labour market. My methodology includes interviews with social enterprise managers and focus groups with social enterprise employees in BC and Ontario. I find the flat exemption in BC is limiting the ability of some recipients from <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> maximum potential, and beneficiaries are not adequately informed of relevant policies and regulations. Based on key findings, I recommend that BC adopt a communication strategy in conjunction with a graduated earnings exemption.

40|$|In his 1973 book 2 ̆ 7 Cities and Geology 2 ̆ 7, the Canadian-English Engineer Robert Legget {{presented}} a detailed case for creating and maintaining public geotechnical databases (Legget 1973). The book summarises several public and mostly paper-based databases {{of the time}} and outlines the challenges for implementation. The viability of a modern public geotechnical database is influenced by many factors including the availability of data, an area 2 ̆ 7 s population density, and seismic risk. Where a city, region or country has sustained the use of a geotechnical database or databases through evolving technology and generational change, no case needs to be made. Elsewhere the creation of a database may be constrained by questions of liability and intellectual property, or by consultants who view a public database as <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> competitive disadvantage.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to describe}} the factors associated with successful employment of allied health and social care assistants in community-based rehabilitation services (CBRS) in England. The research involved the thematic analysis of interviews and focus groups with 153 professionally qualified and assistant staff from 11 older people 2 ̆ 7 s interdisciplinary community rehabilitation teams. Data were collected between November 2006 and December 2008. Assistants were perceived as {{a focal point for}} care delivery and conduits for enabling a service to achieve goals within interdisciplinary team structures. Nine mechanisms were identified that promoted the successful employment of assistants: (i) Multidisciplinary team input into assistant training and support; (ii) Ensuring the timely assessment of clients by qualified staff; (iii) Establishing clear communication structures between qualified and assistant staff; (iv) Co-location of teams to promote communication and skill sharing; (v) Removing barriers that prevent staff <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> full scope of practice; (vi) Facilitating role flexibility of assistants, while upholding the principles of reablement; (vii) Allowing sufficient time for client–staff interaction; (viii) Ensuring an appropriate ratio of assistant to qualified staff to enable sufficient training and supervision of assistants; and (ix) Appropriately, resourcing the role for training and reimbursement to reflect responsibility. We conclude that upholding these mechanisms may help to optimise the efficiency and productivity of assistant and professionally qualified staff in CBRS...|$|E
40|$|Provenance plays {{a pivotal}} in tracing {{the origin of}} {{something}} and determining how and why something had occurred. With {{the emergence of the}} cloud and the benefits it encompasses, there has been a rapid proliferation of services being adopted by commercial and government sectors. However, trust and security concerns for such services are on an unprecedented scale. Currently, these services expose very little internal <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> customers; this can cause accountability and compliance issues especially {{in the event of a}} fault or error, customers and providers are left to point finger at each other. Provenance-based traceability provides a mean to address part of this problem by being able to capture and query events occurred in the past to understand how and why it took place. However, due to the complexity of the cloud infrastructure, the current provenance models lack the expressibility required to describe the inner-working of a cloud service. For a complete solution, a provenance-aware policy language is also required for operators and users to define policies for compliance purpose. The current policy standards do not cater for such requirement. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a provenance (traceability) model cProv, and a provenance-aware policy language (cProvl) to capture traceability data, and express policies for validating against the model. For implementation, we have extended the XACML 3. 0 architecture to support provenance, and provided a translator that converts cProvl policy and request into XACML type...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this survey}} was to {{quantify}} the level of handicap experienced by patients with severe psoriasis, and to assess the value that patients place on their disease using various questionnaire techniques. Dermatologists throughout the U. K. each gave a questionnaire to up to five psoriasis patients, who were either being admitted for in-patient care or were starting systemic therapy. Three hundred and sixty-nine questionnaires were completed. Of the 150 patients currently working, 59. 3 % had lost a mean of 26 days (SD 21. 9) from work during the preceding year because of their psoriasis, and of the 180 not working 33. 9 % attributed not <b>working</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> psoriasis. The mean Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI) score was 38. 2 % (SD 23. 3, n = 248), with the mean sub-scores of the 'daily activities' and 'treatment' sections being greater {{than those of the}} other three sections. Despite having severe psoriasis, the majority of patients felt that it would be worse to have diabetes, asthma or bronchitis than to have psoriasis. Forty-six, 42 and 32 % considered it would be either 'better' or 'the same' to have diabetes, asthma or bronchitis, respectively. However, in those patients who also had the comparative disease, 87, 80 and 77 % considered it would be 'better', or 'the same' to have the comparative disease. Forty-nine per cent of patients (n = 362) stated they would be prepared to spend 2 or 3 h each day on treatment if this might result in normal skin {{for the rest of the}} day.
