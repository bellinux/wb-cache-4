Upon opening the package, Brown found a rubber snake; {{it was revealed that}} Brown was afraid of snakes. On the May 5 episode of WWF Superstars, the two men agreed to a match; Brown later claimed that his fear of snakes was cured, although he was quickly proven <b>wrong.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> July 28 episode of WWF Superstars, it was announced that Brown and Roberts face each other at SummerSlam with the Big Boss Man as a special referee. Brown also announced that he would bring 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats to counteract Roberts's boa constrictor, Damien.|$|E

25|$|Donovan openly {{believed}} {{during this}} time that a second major European war was inevitable. His foreign experience and realism earned him the friendship of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, notwithstanding their extreme differences in domestic policy {{and despite the fact}} that Donovan, during the 1932 election campaign, had harshly criticized Roosevelt's record as Governor of New York. The two men were from opposing political parties, but were similar in personality. Roosevelt respected Donovan's experience, felt that Hoover had done Donovan <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Attorney General appointment, and believed that if Donovan had been a Democrat he could have been elected President. Also, Donovan's national profile had risen considerably thanks to the 1940 Warner Brothers film The Fighting 69th, in which Pat O'Brien played Father Duffy and George Brent played Donovan, and Roosevelt recognized a useful opportunity to exploit Donovan's newfound popularity. As the two men began exchanging notes about developments abroad, Roosevelt recognized that Donovan could be an important ally and adviser.|$|E

25|$|Rodney Stark {{makes the}} {{argument}} in For the Glory of God: How Monotheism Led to Reformations, Science, Witch-Hunts, and the End of Slavery, that Christianity helped to end slavery worldwide, as does Lamin Sanneh in Abolitionists Abroad. These authors point out that Christians who viewed slavery as <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of their religious convictions spearheaded abolitionism, {{and many of the}} early campaigners for the abolition of slavery were driven by their Christian faith and a desire to realize their view that all people are equal under God. In the late 17th century, anabaptists began to criticize slavery. Criticisms from the Society of Friends, Mennonites, and the Amish followed suit. Prominent among these Christian abolitionists were William Wilberforce, and John Woolman. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote her famous book, Uncle Tom's Cabin, according to her Christian beliefs in 1852. Earlier, in Britain and America, Quakers were active in abolitionism. A group of Quakers founded the first English abolitionist organization, and a Quaker petition brought the issue before government that same year. The Quakers continued to be influential throughout the lifetime of the movement, in many ways leading the way for the campaign. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, was instrumental in starting abolitionism as a popular movement.|$|E
500|$|Although Shirley {{had been}} removed as commander-in-chief, he {{retained}} the Massachusetts governorship. He expected to lose even that post not long after his return to Boston in August. [...] However, no replacement had yet been named, and Loudoun saw either Shirley's interference or ineffectiveness in all that was <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> New York frontier. [...] He also raised detailed questions about Shirley's war-related expenditures, which he (and later historians) concluded was poorly-disguised patronage spending. [...] Loudoun and Shirley argued over many issues, including Shirley's continuance of military preparations after January 1756, when Loudoun's commission was issued. [...] Shirley pointed out that British leadership could hardly expect preparations to cease in the interval between Loudoun's commission and his arrival to take command. [...] While he waited for a replacement to be announced, Shirley took depositions, gathered evidence to support his version of affairs, and worked to close his financial affairs down. [...] (Loudoun was {{of the opinion that}} Shirley delayed his departure intentionally as a political maneuver.) [...] He sailed for England in October 1756. [...] Shirley would be formally replaced by Thomas Pownall in 1757.|$|E
500|$|English humanist {{lawyers in}} the 16th and 17th centuries {{interpreted}} conscience {{as a collection of}} universal principles given to man by god at creation to be applied by reason; this gradually reforming the medieval Roman law-based system with forms of action, written pleadings, use of juries and patterns of litigation such as Demurrer and Assumpsit that displayed an increased concern for elements of right and <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual facts. [...] A conscience vote in a parliament allows legislators to vote without restrictions from any political party to which they may belong. In his trial in Jerusalem Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann claimed he was simply following legal orders under paragraph 48 of the German Military Code which provided: [...] "punishability of an action or omission is not excused on the ground that the person considered his behaviour required by his conscience or the prescripts of his religion". The United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR) which is part of international customary law specifically refers to conscience in Articles 1 and 18. Likewise, the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) mentions conscience in Article 18.1. It has been argued that these articles provide international legal obligations protecting conscientious objectors from service in the military.|$|E

500|$|Grönholm was {{disappointed}} with his race, admitting {{that he thought}} {{he might be able to}} beat Sordo, if not Loeb. But after having gearbox and tyre problems on , he settled into third place and stayed in that position to the rally's conclusion. [...] "We got it <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tyre choice, which we had to have approved by the FIA early in the week," [...] he explained. [...] "We thought it would rain. Harder tyres would have made life easier for us." [...] BP-Ford was also unhappy. Christian Loriaux, the team's Technical Director said, [...] "Having Marcus finish behind Sordo is disappointing. Being behind Loeb is easier to understand, because I didn't expect the C4 to be any slower than the Xsara, and that car had a performance edge over us last year." [...] Petter Solberg also had issues with his tyres throughout the rally. After Subaru switched to es from Pirelli following the 2006 season, and with the shortest break between seasons the WRC had seen, the crews had not had enough time to test the new compounds. The Subarus had had their problems with the Pirellis, too. To protect them from breaking up too quickly the drivers had learned how to look after them, but driving that way on the new brand meant that he could not get the BFs up to temperature and ended up running slower. He finished the rally in sixth place. His teammate Atkinson did not have that problem though, and after fighting with Hirvonen in the final half of the rally, finished in fourth place. [...] "It's been a massive battle, and so much fun to be in a battle with these guys again," [...] he said after being congratulated by Hirvonen. Two drivers in non-manufacturer cars, Gardemeister and Kopecký, finished in seventh and eighth place to receive drivers points.|$|E

2500|$|The early 17th-century Flemish art {{historian}} Karel van Mander {{is the key}} source {{on the life of}} Baltens.

[...] Van Mander's error is possibly due to a misreading of the date 1569, the date on which Baltens became a member of the governing board of the Guild. Another erroneous statement by van Mander, which had a devastating impact on Baltens' art historical reputation, was to call Baltens a follower of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Van Mander was in fact <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> date on which Baltens joined the local Guild as well as on Baltens' relationship with Pieter Bruegel the Elder which he qualified as that of a follower.|$|E

Foulois replied that to ensure complete safety the Air Corps would have to end the flights, and Roosevelt suspended airmail service on March 11, 1934. Foulois wrote in his autobiography that he and MacArthur incurred [...] "the worst tongue-lashing I ever received in all my military service". Norman E. Borden, in Air Mail Emergency of 1934, wrote: [...] "To lessen the attacks on Roosevelt and Farley, Democratic leaders {{in both houses of}} Congress and Post Office officials placed the blame for all that had gone <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulders of Foulois."

2500|$|Hayek's {{influence}} {{on the development of}} economics is widely acknowledged. Hayek is the second-most frequently cited economist (after Kenneth Arrow) in the Nobel lectures of the prize winners in economics, which is particularly striking since his own lecture was critical of the field of orthodox economics and neo-classical modelisation. A number of Nobel Laureates in economics, such as Vernon Smith and Herbert A. Simon, recognise Hayek as the greatest modern economist. Another Nobel winner, Paul Samuelson, believed that Hayek was worthy of his award but nevertheless claimed that [...] "there were good historical reasons for fading memories of Hayek within the mainstream last {{half of the twentieth century}} economist fraternity. In 1931, Hayek's Prices and Production had enjoyed an ultra-short Byronic success. In retrospect hindsight tells us that its mumbo-jumbo about the period of production grossly misdiagnosed the macroeconomics of the 1927–1931 (and the 1931–2007) historical scene". Despite this comment, Samuelson spent the last 50 years of his life obsessed with the problems of capital theory identified by Hayek and Böhm-Bawerk, and Samuelson flatly judged Hayek to have been right and his own teacher, Joseph Schumpeter, to have been <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> central economic question of the 20th century, the feasibility of socialist economic planning in a production goods dominated economy.|$|E

There were two sets of [...] "bones", and two sets of sticks, numbering from 7-11 for each team. When a game was in play, one team had two sets of [...] "bones".

When you had the bones, your objective was to make sure the other team guessed <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bones set. When the other team guessed wrong, you gained a point. When a team had the two sets of bones, two individuals hid the bones and swapped them around from hand to hand. Eventually the bones were brought forward, but were concealed as to show the other team which one had a stripe on it. The game was usually accompanied by drumming and singing, used to boost the morale of the team. The side that had the bone sings, while the other tried to guess. Musical accompaniment was also sometimes used to taunt the other team. Gambling could be done by players, or spectators of a match.

2500|$|On 29 January 2005 the {{government}} held a funeral ceremony {{for him at}} the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery, a place reserved for revolutionary heroes and high government officials, that was attended by some 2,000 mourners, who were pre-approved to attend. Several dissidents, including Zhao's secretary Bao Tong and Tiananmen Mothers leader Ding Zilin, were kept under house arrest and therefore could not attend. Xinhua reported that the most senior official to attend the funeral was Jia Qinglin, fourth in the party hierarchy, and other officials who attended included He Guoqiang, Wang Gang and Hua Jianmin. Mourners were forbidden to bring flowers or to inscribe their own messages on {{the government}}-issued flowers. There was no eulogy at the ceremony because the government and Zhao's family could not agree on its content: while the government wanted to say he made mistakes, his family refused to accept he did anything <b>wrong.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> day of his funeral, state television mentioned Zhao's death for the first time. Xinhua issued a short article on the funerary arrangements, acknowledging Zhao's [...] "contributions to the party and to the people", but said he made [...] "serious mistakes" [...] during the 1989 [...] "political disturbance". According to Du Daozheng, who wrote the foreword to the Chinese edition of Zhao's memoirs, {{the use of the term}} [...] "serious mistakes" [...] instead of the former verdict of supporting a [...] "counter-revolutionary riot" [...] represented a backing down by the Party. After the ceremony, Zhao was cremated. His ashes were taken by his family to his Beijing home, since the government had denied him a place at Babaoshan.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{two main}} sides of the {{abortion}} debate tend to agree that a human fetus is biologically and genetically human (that is, of the human species), they often differ in their view {{on whether or not}} a human fetus is, in any of various ways, a person. Pro-life supporters argue that abortion is morally <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis that a fetus is an innocent human person or because a fetus is a potential life that will, in most cases, develop into a fully functional human being. They believe that a fetus is a person upon conception. Others reject this position by drawing a distinction between human being and human person, arguing that while the fetus is innocent and biologically human, it is not a person with a right to life. In support of this distinction, some propose a list of criteria as markers of personhood. [...] For example, Mary Ann Warren suggests consciousness (at least the capacity to feel pain), reasoning, self-motivation, the ability to communicate, and self-awareness. [...] According to Warren, a being need not exhibit all of these criteria to qualify as a person with a right to life, but if a being exhibits none of them (or perhaps only one), then it is certainly not a person. [...] Warren concludes that as the fetus satisfies only one criterion, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain), the fetus is not a person and abortion is therefore morally permissible. [...] Other philosophers apply similar criteria, concluding that a fetus lacks a right to life because it lacks brain waves or higher brain function, self-consciousness, rationality, and autonomy. These lists diverge over precisely which features confer a right to life, but tend to propose various developed psychological or physiological features not found in fetuses.|$|E

2500|$|The American {{historian}} Gordon A. Craig {{complained that}} of Irving's double standard in Hitler's War [...] of crediting {{all of the}} German victories to the Führer while blaming all of the German defeats {{in the war on}} Hitler's unworthy and incompetent generals. Craig wrote that in his opinion some of Irving's language was inappropriate, such as Irving's remark that [...] "Hitler was cheated of the ultimate winter victory", and that Irving totally ignored Hitler's own incompetence as a military leader. Craig charged that it was simply <b>wrong</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of Irving to write that Hitler in October 1941 {{was in a state of}} pain over German losses on the Eastern Front with Hitler supposedly thinking [...] "What would be left of Germany and the flower of her manhood?" [...] As a way of rebuttal to this picture of Hitler, Craig quoted Hitler's remark later in 1941 when told of heavy German losses, [...] "But that's what the young people are there for!". Like many other historians, Craig was critical of Irving using the [...] "no liquidation" [...] comment in Himmler's telephone logbook from 30 November 1941 to prove that Hitler was opposed to the Holocaust. Citing Lucy Dawidowicz, Craig argued the phrase [...] "no liquidation" [...] referred only to Dr. Jekelius. Finally, to prove that Hitler was aware of the Holocaust, Craig quoted Hitler's remark to the Czechoslovak foreign minister in January 1939 that [...] "We are going to destroy the Jews!...The day of reckoning has come!" [...] plus the broad hints that Hitler dropped in his speeches of 30 January 1941; 30 January 1942; 24 February 1942; 30 September 1942, and 8 November 1942 that he knew of the Holocaust. Finally, Craig cited Himmler's remark of May 1944 where he stated he had orders from an unnamed higher authority (who Craig argued could only be Hitler) for the [...] "Final Solution." ...|$|E
