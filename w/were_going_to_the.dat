5|$|After the Roman {{victory at}} Mount Olympus, the Tectosagi begged {{them not to}} attack them and asked to meet him for a conference halfway between their camp and Ancyra. The main aim of the conference was for the Tectosagi to delay the Roman attack {{so that they could}} allow the women and {{children}} to retreat across the Halys River. Their other aim was to assassinate Manlius while he was at the conference. While they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conference the Romans saw the Galatian cavalry charging at them. In the skirmish that followed the Galatians overpowered Manlius' bodyguard due to their numbers but were driven back when the escort that had been accompanying the Roman foragers arrived and forced the Galatians to retreat.|$|E

A tyre blew out and the car rolled on the Leichhardt Highway near Condamine. Murray was taken to Miles District Hospital with broken ribs. He had {{suffered}} heart trouble for some time, and {{the shock of the}} accident is believed to have caused his death the following day. Murray was interred at Mount Thompson Crematorium with full military honours after a funeral service at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Monument {{attracted}} enormous crowds {{before it}} officially opened. For {{six months after}} its dedication, 10,041 people climbed the 898 steps and 50 landings to the top. After the elevator {{that had been used}} to raise building materials was altered to carry passengers, the number of visitors grew rapidly, and an average of 55,000 people per month <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top by 1888. The annual visitor count peaked between 1979 and 1997, where an average of 1.1 million visitors visited annually; however, from 2005 to 2010, the Washington Monument has had an average of only 631,000 visitors each year. As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the national memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.|$|E

Two escalators failed at Five Points station, and one escalator failed at Dome/GWCC/Philips Arena/CNN Center station.

However, a subsequent formal investigation showed that the braking systems and a weak motor were {{to blame for the}} incidents.|$|E
25|$|The longe whip {{takes the}} place of the rider's legs, asking the horse to move forward or out. It is held with the tip low, {{pointing}} towards the horse's hocks, with the lash dragging on the ground. The whip is held in the hand that the horse is not going (so if the horse <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, the whip would be held in the lunger's left hand). The horse is to accept the whip as an aid, and not be fearful. When the handler goes toward the horse to adjust equipment, the lash is caught up and the whip turned backward, under the arm, so that it does not interfere with the horse.|$|E

25|$|After a {{brief period}} of farmworking and odd jobs at Mount Vernon, New York, Riis {{returned}} to New York, where he read in the newspaper New York Sun that the newspaper was recruiting soldiers for the war. Riis rushed there to enlist, but the editor (whom he later realized was Charles Anderson Dana) claimed or affected ignorance but offered the famished Riis a dollar for breakfast; Riis indignantly refused. Riis was destitute, at one time sleeping on a tombstone and surviving on windfall apples. Still, he found work at a brickyard at Little Washington in New Jersey, and was there for six weeks until he heard that a group of volunteers <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> war. Thereupon he left for New York.|$|E

500|$|Dwyane Wade {{was born}} on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, to JoLinda and Dwyane Wade Sr, whose name's unusual {{spelling}} was decided by his own mother. In 1977, JoLinda, {{at the age of}} 18, already had two children. Wade has described his upbringing in Chicago as being very difficult. Wade stated that [...] " [...] mom was on drugs and [...] family was in the gang environment, so it was a rough childhood." [...] At a very young age, Wade already witnessed police raids and found dead bodies several times in a nearby garbage can. When he was only 4 months old, his parents separated – and would later divorce. Jolinda was given custody of the two children, and she moved to her mother's house with them. The family struggled financially, and it was around that time when Jolinda started dealing drugs. His mom was addicted to several substances including cigarettes, alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. JoLinda would get high with friends at her home, even in the presence of her children. In an interview with ESPN, Wade said [...] "I've seen the needles laying around the house. I've seen my mother shoot up before. I've seen a lot of things my mother didn't even know I'd seen as a kid." [...] At the age of 6, he recalls police – with guns drawn – raiding his home as they searched for his mother. When Wade turned 8 years old, his older sister, Tragil, tricked him – by telling him they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movies – into living with his father, a former Army sergeant, and stepmother in a nearby neighborhood. Wade would still occasionally visit his mom. A year later, his father moved the family to Robbins, Illinois. After moving to Robbins, Wade didn't see his mother for two years. During this time, JoLinda was able to access a free supply of drugs by volunteering to be a tester – i.e., someone who tests street drugs for impurities before the dealers try to sell them. JoLinda was hospitalized and nearly died after she mistakenly injected herself with LSD. In 1994, JoLinda was arrested for possession of crack cocaine with intent to sell and locked up in Cook County Jail. Wade, at the age of 10, reunited with his mom by talking with her at Cook County Jail through a glass panel over a telephone. JoLinda served 23 months in prison for her crimes, but while serving her second sentence in 1997, she failed to report to prison while on work release.|$|E

2500|$|The miners {{who stayed}} at Vital Creek soon {{heard of a}} new strike made by Pete Toy off the Omineca River. One of the parties who {{decided to go to}} those new {{diggings}} was led by an American by the name of James Germansen. While he and his group <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new diggings, Germansen found an undiscovered creek coming off the Omineca River. To Germansen, this unknown creek, [...] "seemed right", but his party was eager to get to Pete Toy's strike, so Germansen had to continue along with them. However when they arrived at Pete Toy's strike they encountered little success and returned to Vital Creek. But Germansen hadn't forgotten the little unnamed creek and he returned there with Duncan McMartin, James May and [...] "Blackjack" [...] Smith.|$|E
2500|$|In 1962 Vertinskaya {{starred in}} the Amphibian Man, Gennady Kazansky and Vladimir Chebotarev's {{adaptation}} of Alexander Belyayev's science fiction novel of the same title. Cast as Gutierrez, {{a young woman in}} love with an amphibian man, Vertinskaya had to go through difficult late autumn underwater shooting sessions which she performed all by herself, without any stuntwomen involved. The film became the Soviet 1962 box-office blockbuster. [...] "Vertinskaya was now a brand. People <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cinema to watch her, specifically," [...] her future husband Nikita Mikhalkov later recalled. All this changed the teenage actress's life dramatically. [...] "In those days there weren't any bodyguards. I used to travel by tram to my studies. I had to queue for bread like everyone else. Not only was I recognized, they made a point of touching me too... It was in those days that I developed the fear of crowds... This immense psychic violence haunted me all through those years," [...] she later remembered.|$|E
2500|$|Britten and Bird {{go to see}} Sam at his home; {{he claims}} {{that he was trying}} to find out about his father, who had cancer. Britten asks how tall he was; outside, Bird asks for an {{explanation}} and Britten tries to spin a story about a small window at the clinic that someone could have crawled through to poison MacKenzie. His partner warns Britten that coming up with theories and looking for evidence to fit is not standard procedure. That night, Rex and Cole work on their motorbike. Later, in the [...] "red reality", Hannah tells Britten that she opened the package and was glad she did. She tells her husband about the motorcycle, and how the boys would claim they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beach when they went off to work on it. At the station, Vega tells Britten that they have a new case; however, he insists on sticking with the MacKenzie shooting and checks photos of short criminals. The homeless man comes in and offers more information in return for lunch. The partners start arguing, and Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) calls Britten into her office. Soon after, Britten asks Vega if he wants to lead a new case.|$|E

2500|$|Tendulkar's {{allegations}} {{were supported by}} former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a [...] "control freak" [...] and said, [...] "After he was appointed {{the coach of the}} Indian team, he once came upto me and told [...] "Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West Indies for a four-Test series after that and he asked me if I would open. I mentioned in 2000 I had decided I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him. I was the second highest run scorer under him." ...|$|E
