5|$|Before {{the tournament}} commenced, TNA held three preview matches {{involving}} World X Cup participants. The first two were {{featured on the}} June12 episode of Impact!. In the first preview match, Team TNA's The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) were pitted against Team Japan's Speed Muscle (Masato Yoshino and Naruki Doi) in a tag team match lasting 6 minutes. The Motor City Machine Guns won when Sabin pinned Doi, after Shelley and Sabin performed a double kick to the face. The second was between Team International's Alex Koslov and Team TNA's Curry Man, which lasted 4 minutes. Koslov won the match by pinfall after a splash from the top rope. TNA held another preview match on the June19 episode of Impact!. In this match, Kaz of Team TNA defeated Koslov after smashing Koslov face-first into the mat with his signature <b>Wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> maneuver.|$|E

In the final match of round two, Team TNA faced Team Mexico. Team TNA's Kaz defeated Team Mexico's Ultimo Guerrero in 5 minutes. Kaz won the bout by pinfall after slamming Guerrero face-first onto the mat with his signature <b>Wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Future</b> maneuver.

Our findings confirm that nationwide increases in the MLDA in the late 1970 s and 1980 s and adoption of ZT laws in the 1990 s both significantly reduced alcohol consumption by high school seniors, with larger effects for the MLDA than for ZT laws. Higher beer taxes are also estimated to reduce youth drinking participation.

Modifications in wave regime induced by climate changes can influence <b>the</b> sediment dynamics <b>of</b> those coastal systems.

This work aims to analyse <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> a <b>future</b> <b>wave</b> regime in <b>the</b> sediment budget <b>of</b> a coastal lagoon inlet and at the nearshore adjacent coast. To achieve this goal a morphodynamic modelling system was used, forced by present and future waves, corresponding to a typical year of present and future wave climates.

40|$|Copyright {{management}} systems (CMS) —technologies that enable copyright owners to regulate reliably and charge automatically {{for access to}} digital works—are <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very near <b>future.</b> <b>The</b> advent <b>of</b> digital networks, which make copying and distribution of digital content quick, easy, and undetectable, has provided the impetus for CMS research and development. CMS are premised on <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> 2 ̆ 2 trusted systems 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 secure digital envelopes 2 ̆ 2 that protect copyrighted content and allow access and subsequent copying {{only to the extent}} authorized by the copyright owner. Software developers are testing prototype systems designed to detect, prevent, count, and levy precise charges for uses that range from downloading to excerpting to simply viewing or listening to digital works. In a few years, for example, an individual seeking online access to a collection of short fiction might be greeted with a menu of options including: Open and view short story A — 0. 50, or 0. 40 for students doing assigned reading (verified based on roster submitted by instructor) Open and view short story B (by a more popular author) — 0. 80, or 0. 70 for students Download short story A (encrypted and copy-protected) — 1. 35 Download short story B — 2. 25 Download entire collection — 15. 00 Extract excerpt from short story A — 0. 03 per 50 words Extract excerpt from short story B — 0. 06 per 50 words CMS also loom large on the legislative horizon. Copyright owners have argued that technological protection alone will not deter unauthorized copying unless the law provides penalties for circumventing the technology. Although a bill to protect CMS against tampering failed to reach a vote in Congress last year, the World Intellectual Property Organization 2 ̆ 7 s recent adoption of treaty provisions requiring protection means that Congress must revisit the question soon. Part II describes these developments. The seemingly inexorable trend toward a digital CMS regime raises two questions, which the author addresses in parts III and IV, respectively. First, broadly drawn protection for CMS has the potential to proscribe technologies that have indisputably lawful uses and also to foreclose, as a practical matter, uses of copyrighted works that copyright law expressly permits. How may protection for CMS be drafted to avoid disrupting the current copyright balance? Second, and equally fundamental, CMS may enable both pervasive monitoring of individual reading activity and comprehensive 2 ̆ 2 private legislation 2 ̆ 2 designed to augment—and possibly alter beyond recognition—the default rules that define and delimit copyright owners 2 ̆ 7 rights.
