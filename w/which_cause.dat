5|$|Soil {{nutrient}} deficiencies {{can cause}} a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants {{to a lack of}} head growth. Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including cutworms, which cut seedlings off at the soil line; wireworms and nematodes, <b>which</b> <b>cause</b> yellow, stunted plants; tarnished plant bugs and aphids, <b>which</b> <b>cause</b> yellow, distorted leaves; leafhoppers, <b>which</b> <b>cause</b> stunted growth and pale leaves; thrips, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; leafminers, which create tunnels within the leaves; flea beetles, which cut small holes in leaves and caterpillars, slugs and snails, which cut large holes in leaves. Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants. Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, and other natural phenolics such as flavonol and glycosides, which help to protect it against pests. Certain varieties contain more than others, and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance.|$|E

5|$|Aerophones, {{which produce}} a sound with a {{vibrating}} column of air; they {{are sorted into}} free aerophones such as a bullroarer or whip, which move freely through the air; flutes, <b>which</b> <b>cause</b> the air to pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, which use a vibrating reed; and lip-vibrated aerophones such as trumpets, for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds.|$|E
5|$|Apicomplexa is a {{major group}} of {{unicellular}} eukaryotes that encompasses several important parasites, including the malaria parasite Plasmodium. Three species are known from the marsh rice rat, all of which belong to the Eimerina clade. Two are in the genus Eimeria, members of <b>which</b> <b>cause</b> the economically significant disease coccidiosis in poultry. The third {{is a member of}} Isospora, which includes species that are pathogenic in humans and pigs.|$|E
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences <b>which</b> <b>cause</b> the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
5000|$|On Earth, an {{atmosphere}} containing naturally occurring amounts {{of greenhouse gases}} causes air temperature near the surface to be about [...] warmer {{than it would be}} in their absence. Without the Earth's atmosphere, the Earth's average temperature would be well below the freezing temperature of water. The major greenhouse gases are water vapour, <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> about 36-70% of the greenhouse effect; carbon dioxide (CO2), <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> 9-26%; methane (CH4), <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> 4-9%; and ozone (O3), <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> 3-7%. Clouds also affect the radiation balance through cloud forcings similar to greenhouse gases.|$|R
50|$|Pigeon breeders {{sometimes}} {{suffer from}} an ailment known as bird fancier's lung or pigeon lung. A form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pigeon lung {{is caused by}} the inhalation of the avian proteins found in feathers and dung. It can sometimes be combated by wearing a filtered mask.Other pigeon related pathogens causing lung disease are Chlamydophila psittaci (<b>which</b> <b>causes</b> psittacosis, Histoplasma capsulatum (<b>which</b> <b>causes</b> histoplasmosis and Cryptococcus neoformans, <b>which</b> <b>causes</b> cryptococcosis.|$|R

5|$|Lettuce also {{suffers from}} several viral diseases, {{including}} big vein, which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and mosaic virus, which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves. Aster yellows are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves. Fungal diseases include powdery mildew and downy mildew, <b>which</b> <b>cause</b> leaves to mold and die and bottom rot, lettuce drop and gray mold, <b>which</b> <b>cause</b> entire plants to rot and collapse. Crowding lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases. Weeds {{can also be}} an issue, as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground. Transplanted lettuce (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing misshapen lettuce and lower yields. Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult. Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production. However, {{this has led to}} the development of herbicide-resistant weeds and prompted environmental and health concerns.|$|E

5|$|Between {{these stars}} and Sirius lie Omicron1, Omicron2, and Pi Canis Majoris. Omicron2 {{is a massive}} supergiant star about 21 times as massive as the Sun. Only 7 million years old, it has {{exhausted}} the supply of hydrogen at its core and is now processing helium. It has an Alpha Cygni variable that undergoes periodic non-radial pulsations, <b>which</b> <b>cause</b> its brightness to cycle from magnitude 2.93 to 3.08 over a 24.44-day interval. Omicron1 is an orange K-type supergiant of spectral type K2.5Iab that is an irregular variable star, varying between apparent magnitudes 3.78 and 3.99. Around 18 times as massive as the Sun, it shines with 65,000 times its luminosity.|$|E
5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, <b>which</b> <b>cause</b> a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
5|$|Entomopathogenic fungi, <b>which</b> <b>cause</b> {{disease in}} insects, {{include at least}} 14 species that attack aphids. Beauveria bassiana is mass-produced and used to manage {{a wide variety of}} insect pests {{including}} whiteflies, thrips, aphids and weevils. Lecanicillium spp. are deployed against white flies, thrips and aphids. Metarhizium spp. are used against pests including beetles, locusts and other grasshoppers, Hemiptera, and spider mites. Paecilomyces fumosoroseus is effective against white flies, thrips and aphids; Purpureocillium lilacinus is used against root-knot nematodes, and 89 Trichoderma species against certain plant pathogens. Trichoderma viride has been used against Dutch elm disease, and has shown some effect in suppressing silver leaf, a disease of stone fruits caused by the pathogenic fungus Chondrostereum purpureum.|$|E

5|$|Many {{genes are}} known to be {{involved}} in schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression. The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants <b>which</b> <b>cause</b> schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.|$|E
