5|$|The Irish overprinted stamps came, as {{supplied}} from the printers in London, with a <b>watermark</b> of the Royal Cypher of George V. The first Irish <b>watermark</b> was a stylised {{design of the}} two overlapping letters 's' and 'e' making an 'se' <b>watermark</b> representing {{the name of the}} country Saorstát Éireann. This <b>watermark</b> was discontinued around 1940 when the country's name changed to Éire (Ireland); it was replaced with e <b>watermark</b> paper to represent Éire. Stamps of the period may have the <b>watermark</b> in any of several states of inversion and rotation attributable to the way the paper was fed into the printing machines.|$|E
5|$|A {{friend from}} the {{discussion}} group, who uses the handle Parkaboy, privately emails her saying {{a friend of a}} friend has discovered an encrypted <b>watermark</b> on one clip. They concoct a fake persona, a young woman named Keiko, to seduce the Japanese man who knows the <b>watermark</b> code. Cayce, along with an American computer security specialist, Boone Chu, hired to assist her, travels to Tokyo to meet the man and retrieve the <b>watermark</b> code. Two men attempt to steal the code but Cayce escapes and travels back to London. Boone travels to Columbus, Ohio to investigate the company that he believes created the <b>watermark.</b> Meanwhile, Blue Ant hires Dorotea who reveals that she was previously employed by a Russian lawyer whose clients have been investigating Cayce. The clients wanted Cayce to refuse the job of tracking the film clips and it was Dorotea's responsibility to ensure this.|$|E

5|$|The first {{banknotes}} to {{be issued}} with his signature was the two last runs of the original designs, dated 1994. The first run, which consisted of denominations from $2 to $20, had the original <b>watermark</b> of the Zimbabwe Bird (profile angle, short neck), whilst the second run consisted only of the $2 and $5 denominations, bearing the <b>watermark</b> of the bird with a longer neck and at ¾ profile angle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>watermark</b> was updated in 2001 to {{coincide}} with Prime's new logo, still shown at the top right of the screen. This continued until Prime Television's relaunch as Prime7 in 2011. The <b>watermark</b> is now seen at the bottom right of the screen, like most TV network watermarks.|$|E
5|$|Since 1922, nine Irish {{definitive}} stamp series {{have been}} released. Besides different designs, there were changes involving the <b>watermark</b> and eventually {{doing away with}} watermarked paper, changes in currency were also reflected on the stamps: decimalisation in 1971, and Euro changeover in 2002.|$|E
40|$|In image <b>watermarking,</b> {{information}} is embedded into cover media to prove ownership. Various <b>watermarking</b> techniques {{have been proposed}} by many authors {{in the last several}} years which include spatial domain and transform domain <b>watermarking.</b> Wavelet based image <b>watermarking</b> is gaining more popularity because of its resemblance with the human visual system. This paper elaborates suitability of wavelet transform for image <b>watermarking,</b> wavelet transform based image <b>watermarking</b> process, classification and analysis of wavelet based <b>watermarking</b> techniques. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature available on wavelet based image <b>watermarking</b> methods.

40|$|Digital <b>watermarks</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} in recent literature as the means for copyright protection of multimedia data. In this paper we address the capability of invisible <b>watermarking</b> schemes to resolve copyright ownerships. We will show that rightful ownerships cannot be resolved by current <b>watermarking</b> schemes alone. In addition, {{in the absence of}} standardization of <b>watermarking</b> procedures, anyone can claim ownership of any <b>watermarked</b> image. Specifically, we provide counterfeit <b>watermarking</b> schemes that can be performed on a <b>watermarked</b> image to allow multiple claims of rightful ownerships. We also propose non-invertible <b>watermarking</b> schemes in this paper and discuss in general the usefulness of digital <b>watermarks</b> in identifying the rightful copyright owners. The results, coupled with the recent attacks on some image <b>watermarks,</b> further imply that we have to carefully re-think our approaches to invisible <b>watermarking</b> of images, and re-evaluate the promises, applications and limitatio [...] ...|$|R

5|$|On March 31, 2009, a {{full-length}} DVD-quality workprint {{of the film}} without a timecode or <b>watermark,</b> with some unfinished effects shots, a different typeface for titles and casting, and alternate sound effects was leaked online. The studio {{said it would be}} able to determine the source of the leak using forensic marks in the workprint. The FBI and MPAA began investigating the illegal posting. Fox estimated the workprint was downloaded roughly 4.5million times by the time Wolverine was released in theaters. As of 2014, Fox estimates that a minimum of 15 million people downloaded it.|$|E
5|$|Surcharges {{imposed by}} the Irish post office on mail bearing {{insufficient}} pre-paid postage had the postage due collected {{by the use of}} these labels. Since 1925 there have been six series printed, with the design remaining the same until 1980, though the colour and watermarks have changed. The Irish word pingin, for penny, is used in both £.s.d and decimal currency, but because it has the same meaning in each, the value on the label does not indicate whether the label was issued before or after decimalisation. Hence, identifying the issue of a label requires further information: if collectors knows the date of use, the existence of a <b>watermark</b> and if so which type, and the specific colour, identification will be easier. For example, the 3d value was blue between 1940 and 1969, and stone colour from 1971 until 1980; it changed from a watermarked to a non-watermark paper in 1978. Additionally, the 1, 5 and 8 pence values are seen in two different colours depending on the issue, while the d, 1d, 2d and 6d are seen with both <b>watermark</b> varieties. Except for the sixth issue, which has the word Éire in the design, there is no explicit country identity on any of the others. The first four series use only Irish words.|$|E

30|$|Digital <b>watermarking</b> is a {{technique}} that embeds additional data into digital contents so that the distortion by embedding them is perceptually undetectable [1]. The distortion of <b>watermarked</b> images by general digital <b>watermarking</b> methods is fixed only after embedding. Some digital <b>watermarking</b> methods [2] prevent the degradation of the image quality of <b>watermarked</b> images by using human visual system. However the lower limit of the image quality of the <b>watermarked</b> images was not clear. Such obscurity of the lower limit disturbs the practical use of digital <b>watermarking.</b>|$|R

The extension of this semiprivate <b>watermarking</b> method to enable a blind detection is presented. To enable the embedding of multiple <b>watermarks</b> the algorithm distributes the different <b>watermarks</b> in individual frequency bands. Several experiments verify the theory and show the different robustness levels of the <b>watermarks.</b> Enhancements and variations of the algorithm are discussed...|$|R
30|$|There are {{a number}} of {{benefits}} of a formal generic <b>watermarking</b> model. As discussed in section 1, a formal <b>watermarking</b> model is the first step towards conceptualizing, systematic development, and evaluation of the <b>watermarking</b> schemes. It helps avoid any confusion and misconceptions by defining the necessary inputs, outputs, and component functions of a <b>watermarking</b> scheme. The <b>watermarking</b> schemes described using a formal model offer the readiness for implementation and computer-aided fashion of analysis. The required properties and design criteria of a <b>watermarking</b> application can also be defined by the model, which helps characterize a <b>watermarking</b> scheme for the application. The model also provides a means for defining attack models and thus for carrying out a rigorous analysis of a <b>watermarking</b> scheme. Moreover, a formal <b>watermarking</b> model creates a common platform for all possible <b>watermarking</b> schemes. Such a platform is expected not only to give a designer sufficient flexibility to describe any <b>watermarking</b> scheme, but also to help others understand the scheme in a systematic way.|$|R

5|$|Players have {{discovered}} that {{the cover of the}} North American Wii version of Ōkami includes a <b>watermark</b> from IGN, and traced the source to an image taken from IGN's site. To make up for the error, Capcom offered for a limited time to replace the cover with one of three high-resolution covers free of charge to users in North America. Because of delays in fulfilling the offer, Capcom shipped copies of all three covers to those that registered. They have since discontinued the offer, but have made the cover images available worldwide in high-quality PDF files for users to download and print themselves. The European PAL version of the cover has no such error.|$|E
40|$|In public <b>watermarking</b> applications, {{the public}} {{must have the}} ability to detect <b>watermarks,</b> but must not {{have the ability to}} re-move them. It has been {{proposed}} that such systems might be made secure by using asymmetric key <b>watermarking,</b> in which the em-bedder and detector use different keys. This paper asks whether asymmetric-key <b>watermarking</b> is suf-ficient and necessary for secure public <b>watermarking</b> applications. The answer found, both to the question of sufficiency and the ques-tion of necessity, is basically no. Asymmetric-key <b>watermarking,</b> by itself, is demonstrably insufficient, because there exist asymmetric-key <b>watermarking</b> systems that do not provide the required secu-rity. Asymmetric-key <b>watermarking</b> might not be necessary, be-cause it is possible to imagine irreversible <b>watermarking</b> systems, in which even complete knowledge of the embedder would not help an adversary remove <b>watermarks.</b> The paper concludes by suggesting that research in secure public <b>watermarking</b> should focus on the design of the detector. The embedding algorithm, and whether it employs any informa-tion that must be kept secret, is of secondary concern. 1...|$|R

5|$|The 2007 {{banknote}} series was {{prepared by the}} Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird <b>watermark</b> continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, see-through register marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. Holographic security threads and Optically Variable Ink were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Zimbabwe dollar {{was again}} {{reformed}} on 2 February 2009 when the fourth dollar replaced the third dollar {{at the ratio}} of 1000000000000 (1012) to 1 with the original intention of phasing out the latter by 1 July 2009. The 2009 banknote series was issued for the fourth dollar which circulated from 2 February 2009 until the suspension of the dollar on 12 April 2009. The series consisted of denominations ranging from $1 to $500. The notes had a revised design with chevrons as registration devices, the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink and an iridescent strip.

Designs included: Sword of Light, Map of Ireland, Celtic Cross, Arms of the Four Provinces and St. Patrick. <b>Watermark</b> and extra values were made until new designs, known as the Gerl definitives, using early Irish art motifs, were {{produced}} in 1968. These were the first new designs in 31 years for the high values and 46 years for the low values. The Gerl series was denominated initially in pre-decimal Irish pounds and later in decimal currency (both watermarked issues). It latterly appeared as unwatermarked stamps.|$|E
