40|$|In this research, {{the effect}} of {{different}} compaction durations on changes of total pore spaces, available <b>water</b> content, <b>aeration</b> porosity and hydraulic conductivity of a compacted clay loam soil were investigated. Soil samples were compacted at compaction levels of 0 kg/cm 2, 1. 98 kg/cm 2 and 3. 00 kg/cm 2 for 1, 2 and 4 minutes, then, above mentioned physical properties of soil samples were determined. Total pore spaces, available <b>water</b> content, <b>aeration</b> porosity and hydraulic conductivity of soil samples were not significantly affected from the compaction durations, but significantly decreased with increasing compaction levels...|$|R
30|$|The {{terms of}} {{operation}} on the pilot included {{a period of}} 8  weeks, aerobic conditions and an ambient temperature of (30  ±  5  °C). Also moisture content range was 75 – 85 % controlled by addition of <b>water</b> or <b>aeration.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Lake Tuusulanjärvi Water Protection Association {{has taken}} action {{to save the}} lake from {{eutrophication}} effects since the early 1970s. Apart from wintertime <b>water</b> <b>aeration</b> and cyprinid fish removal, some additional water is being fed into the Lake via the Päijänne Water Tunnel.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{procedure}} {{by which}} oxygen {{is added to}} water {{can be considered a}} type of <b>water</b> <b>aeration.</b> This being the only criterion, {{there are a variety of}} ways to aerate water. These fall into two broad areas - surface aeration and subsurface aeration. There are a number of techniques and technologies available for both approaches ...|$|E
40|$|The {{variation}} of moisture during sewage sludge bio-drying was investigated. In situ measurements {{were conducted to}} monitor the bulk moisture and water vapor, while the moisture content, water generation, <b>water</b> evaporation and <b>aeration</b> <b>water</b> input of the bio-drying bulk were calculated based on the water mass balance. The moisture in the sewage sludge bio-drying material decreased from 66 % to 54 % {{in response to control}} technology for bio-drying. During the temperature increasing and thermophilic phases of sewage sludge bio-drying, the moisture content, water generation and water evaporation of the bulk initially increased and then decreased. The peak water generation and evaporation occurred during the thermophilic phase. During the bio-drying, water evaporation was much greater than <b>water</b> generation, and <b>aeration</b> facilitated the <b>water</b> evaporation. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
30|$|To {{our best}} knowledge, no {{studies have been}} {{conducted}} on SSRIs in treatment of aerated landfill leachate. When pharmaceuticals enter the environment through landfill leachate systems, they may either be found in the water phase or bound to particles. Landfill leachate aeration ponds could treat the <b>water</b> via <b>aeration</b> and particulate matter sedimentation.|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} linear {{alkylbenzene}} sulfonate (LAS) was evaluated in a UASB reactor using short-chain alcohols (ethanol and methanol) and complex co-substrate (yeast extract). Using only methanol and ethanol as co-substrates resulted in removal of LAS between 30 and 41 %. At the end, {{addition of a}} complex substrate (yeast extract) increased the removal of LAS to 50 %. During the assay, <b>water</b> supply <b>aeration</b> increased the volatile fatty acid of the effluent (70 mg HAc. L- 1) and decreased the removal of LAS (from 40 to 30 %). According to the {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) results, the amount of Archaea decreased due to <b>water</b> supply <b>aeration</b> (from 64 to 48 %). Furthermore, addition of complex co-substrate increased the total anaerobic bacteria and methanogenic archaea content (three and four log units, respectively), which were estimated using the most probable number technique...|$|R
50|$|The lake's water jets {{help with}} <b>water</b> <b>aeration,</b> whilst also {{providing}} a visual and auditory perspective. A major attribute {{of the reserve}} is the exposed sandstone rock face, formed during quarrying operations, when the site was used for brick making. Part of this cliff is used for a large waterfall and is a conspicuous attraction in the park.|$|E
50|$|All metals can be {{classified}} into a galvanic series representing the electrical potential they develop in a given electrolyte against a standard reference electrode. The relative position of two metals on such a series gives a good indication of which metal {{is more likely to}} corrode more quickly. However, other factors such as <b>water</b> <b>aeration</b> and flow rate can influence the rate of the process markedly.|$|E
50|$|Oxygenation by <b>water</b> <b>aeration</b> {{can be part}} of the {{environmental}} remediation of a usually stagnant body of water. For example, Bubbly Creek in Chicago, Illinois, was hypoxic (deficient in oxygen) due to its use as an open sewer by Chicago's meat packing industry but has been oxygenated by introducing compressed air into its waters, increasing the fish population. A similar technique has previously been used in the Thames.|$|E
5000|$|POM {{is readily}} decomposable and serves many soil functions. It {{is a source}} of food or energy for soil organisms and {{nutrients}} for plants. POM also enhances soil structure leading to increased <b>water</b> infiltration, <b>aeration</b> and resistance to erosion [...] Soil management practices, such as tillage and compost/manure application, alter the POM content of soil and water.|$|R
50|$|Wave {{action on}} the shores of large bodies of <b>water</b> can provide <b>aeration</b> of the <b>water</b> in the vicinity, thus {{providing}} enhanced oxygenation which can benefit various aquatic lifeforms.|$|R

50|$|Via deep <b>water</b> <b>aeration</b> or hypolimnetic aeration, {{the oxygen}} demand of deep water {{is covered by}} oxygen from the {{atmosphere}} without destroying the lake’s natural stratification. Thus the deep water becomes aerobic, the phosphate dissolution is reduced significantly and the mineralization of sediments improves.Years of scientific evidence show {{that it is possible}} to keep the deep water aerobic all year round via technical ventilation measures and thereby to recover the natural balance of lakes effectively.|$|E
50|$|Root rot {{can occur}} in hydroponic applications, if the water is not {{properly}} aerated. This is usually accomplished by use of an air pump, air stones, air diffusers and by adjustment of the frequency and length of watering cycles where applicable. Hydroponic air pumps function {{in much the same}} way as aquarium pumps, which are used for the same purpose. Root rot and other problems associated with poor <b>water</b> <b>aeration</b> were principal reasons for the development of aeroponics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>aeration</b> {{is often}} {{required}} in water bodies that suffer from anoxic conditions, usually caused by adjacent human {{activities such as}} sewage discharges, agricultural run-off, or over-baiting a fishing lake. Aeration can be achieved through the infusion of air {{into the bottom of}} the lake, lagoon or pond or by surface agitation from a fountain or spray-like device to allow for oxygen exchange at the surface and the release of noxious gasses such as carbon dioxide, methane or hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
50|$|Organic {{matter and}} other water {{components}} diffuse into the biofilm where the treatment occurs, mostly by biodegradation. Biofiltration processes are usually aerobic, {{which means that}} microorganisms require oxygen for their metabolism. Oxygen can be supplied to the biofilm, either concurrently or countercurrently with <b>water</b> flow. <b>Aeration</b> occurs passively by the natural flow of air through the process (three phase biofilter) or by forced air supplied by blowers.|$|R
50|$|During <b>aeration,</b> <b>water</b> {{is pumped}} into a non-pressurized tank and agitated. This {{physically}} removes {{many of the}} sulfur compounds, which are then vented. Exposure to oxygen in the air also oxidizes some of the compounds, creating atomic sulfur which can be filtered from the water.|$|R
30|$|Initially, {{the soil}} <b>water</b> contents, <b>aeration,</b> {{availability}} of organic matter, soil temporal fluctuation and soil mesic properties have been {{actively involved in}} the mineralization of available organic source through the efficient microbial activity (Tejada et al. 2009). Our data in Tables  1 and 2 clearly reflected pertaining to availability of optimum soil water content for the active existence of soil niche. Synergistically, it was evident from the suggestion endorsed by Ullah et al. (2013) that active participation of microbial population has vitally mineralized the available organic substrate in the optimum soil water contents.|$|R
5000|$|TIBEAN or TWBA {{stands for}} the German „Tiefenwasserbelüftungsanlage" [...] which means „deep <b>water</b> <b>aeration</b> system". The TIBEAN - series are {{floating}} or submerse plants. They consist {{of one or more}} upstream pipes, where the water is aerated while rising up, a degassing chamber where the aerated water is freed of gases and one or more downstream pipes where the vented, degassed water is pumped back into the hypolimnion. In the degassing chamber additional nutrient absorbers and/ or nutrient precipitation devices can be implemented.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, lake {{sediment}} {{was being}} stirred up by nearly 20,000 catfish, carp, and black crappie fish. This overcrowding {{also led to}} odor problems. The Oregon Bass and Panfish Club attempted to reduce the fish population without success. By 2008, the lake had become acutely eutrophic (lacking oxygen), and the sediment layer had reduced the lake depth from 13 to 15 ft to only 18 in. Each year, large amounts of blue-green algae were produced as the sun quickly heated the shallow water. In response, Portland City Council allocated funds to dredge the lake and install a <b>water</b> <b>aeration</b> and circulation system.|$|E
5000|$|Rapids are hydrology|hydrological {{features}} {{between a}} run (a smoothly flowing {{part of a}} stream) and a cascade. Rapids are characterised by the river becoming shallower with some rocks exposed above the flow surface. As flowing water splashes over and around the rocks, air bubbles become mixed in with it and portions of the surface acquire a white colour, forming what is called [...] "whitewater". Rapids occur where the bed material is highly resistant to the erosive power of the stream {{in comparison with the}} bed downstream of the rapids. Very young streams flowing across solid rock may be rapids for much of their length. Rapids cause <b>water</b> <b>aeration</b> of the stream or river resulting in better water quality.|$|E
2500|$|Fertilizers [...] {{enhance the}} growth of plants. This goal is met in two ways, the {{traditional}} one being additives that provide nutrients. [...] The second mode by which some fertilizers act is to enhance {{the effectiveness of the}} soil by modifying its <b>water</b> retention and <b>aeration.</b> [...] This article, like many on fertilizers, emphasises the nutritional aspect.|$|R
50|$|Starfish are characterised {{by having}} {{saponins}} known as asterosaponins in their tissues. They contain {{a mix of}} these saponins, and at least 15 chemical {{studies have been conducted}} seeking to characterise these saponins. The saponins have detergent-like properties, and keeping starfish in limited <b>water</b> volumes with <b>aeration</b> results in large amounts of foam at the surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{benefits}} of andenes include utilizing steep slopes for agriculture, minimizing {{the threat of}} freezes, increasing exposure to sunlight, controlling erosion, improving absorption of <b>water,</b> and better <b>aeration</b> of the soil. The construction and use of andenes for crops enabled agriculture in the Andes to expand into climatically marginal areas of low or seasonal rainfall, low temperatures, and thin soils.|$|R
50|$|In stratified, {{eutrophic}} lakes {{an oxygen}} deficit {{in deep water}} is created during summer stagnation. As a result of elevated nutrient inputs the trophic level of many lakes increases continuously. Elevated phosphorus concentrations may lead to stronger algae growth and a corresponding increase in oxygen consumption in the deep zones. In the anaerobic environment of deep water sludge accumulates, while concentrations of ammonium, iron, manganese and toxic hydrogen sulfide increase in the water body.The hypolimnion is now not only hostile, but the anaerobic conditions also cause increased phosphate dissolutions from the sediments into the deep water. These additional nutrient loads create further problems after the next full circulation. Particularly in terms of drinking water production in reservoirs and dams {{with respect to the}} existing regulations of the Drinking Water Ordinance, these deteriorations in water status are a serious problem. The deep <b>water</b> <b>aeration</b> can prevent this process.|$|E
40|$|Nitrite usually {{occurs in}} aquatic environments {{as a product}} of {{bacterial}} activity. It normally comes from oxidation of ammonia and this (nitrification) depends on the <b>water</b> <b>aeration.</b> Another source of water nitrite is the industrial wastes (Nikinmaa, 1992; Heckman et al., 1997). The fish-culture systems also increas...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{physical}} {{quality is}} the ability of a given soil to meet plant and ecosystem requirements for <b>water,</b> <b>aeration,</b> and strength over time and to resist and recover from processes that diminish that ability. Concepts of soil physical quality can be applied to individual soil horizons, profiles, or areas classified to a common soil type...|$|E
50|$|Soil texture determines total {{volume of}} the {{smallest}} pores; clay soils have smaller pores, but more total pore space than sands. Soil structure has a strong influence on the larger pores that affect soil <b>aeration,</b> <b>water</b> infiltration and drainage. Tillage has the short-term benefit of temporarily {{increasing the number of}} pores of largest size, but these can be rapidly degraded by the destruction of soil aggregation.|$|R
40|$|Nitrification in soil {{converts}} relatively immobile ammonium-nitrogen (N) {{to highly}} mobile nitrate-N (via nitrite), {{and this has}} implications for N-use efficiency by agricultural systems {{as well as for}} environmental quality, especially in situations where the potential for loss of soil or added N is high following nitrate formation. The literature on various physical, environmental, and chemical factors and their interactions on nitrification in soil is reviewed and discussed with examples from natural and agro-ecosystems. Among the various factors, soil matrix, <b>water</b> status, <b>aeration,</b> temperature, and pH have strong influence on nitrification. The information on factors that influence nitrification is useful when developing strategies for regulating nitrification in soils by employing chemical or biological nitrification inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Capillary {{barriers}} fullfill {{the requirements}} for a top cover in the sustainable landfill strategies, as they may allow controlled <b>water</b> infiltration, <b>aeration,</b> gas permeation. A key point for capillary barriers design is determining the maximum water discharge that will enter the landfill. Fine and coarse grain materials for the different layers of the cover must be chosen in order to limit infiltration to this threshold discharge. A mixed experimental and theoretical procedure for testing capillary barriers is described. It is based on scaling concepts and hydraulic behaviour of the capillary barrier. It {{was applied to the}} case of study of a top cover at a large landfill site in the South of Europe...|$|R
