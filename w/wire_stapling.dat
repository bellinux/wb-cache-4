Most foals are born with at least some degree of limb deformity of either type, and carpal valgus is the most frequently encountered type. Methods employed to surgically correct angular limb deformities include hemicircumferential transection of periosteum and periosteal elevation (or periosteal stripping) and transphyseal bridging (or growth retardation). Transphyseal bridging is accomplished with screws and <b>wires,</b> <b>staples,</b> or with a lag screw across the physis. Combinations of stripping and growth retardation have also been used.

50|$|Very thin lumber is {{used for}} a wirebound box. <b>Wires</b> are <b>stapled</b> or {{stitched}} to the girth and to wood cleats.

40|$|In this study, z-pinning by {{implementing}} staples as load-bearing elements for CFRP dou-ble-lap joints is presented. Both conventional staples and purpose-made stainless steel <b>wire</b> <b>staples</b> {{were used as}} fastener elements. Two different inserting methods were inves-tigated. In addition, {{the influence of the}} element’s diameter was examined. An overall in-crease of 28 % in tensile strength was determined for stand-alone staples in comparison to bolted joints. A patented principle of edge-staple showed an increase of 23 % tensile strength in comparison to purely bonded joints. The geometrical form of staples provides an effective way in terms of axial fixation, since pull out did not occur. Furthermore, the staple principle provides the opportunity to use the elements as supporting entities for bonded joints by reducing peak stresses and suppressing peel. Nevertheless, the test re-sults showed a decrease of the in-plane strength with increasing number of elements, which should be considered for joint design. The study represents a first step in technology evaluation and demonstrates the potential of stapled joints...|$|R

5000|$|In {{traditional}} play, fretting {{is achieved}} with a [...] "noter"—typically a short length of dowel or bamboo (see photo at left)—on the melody course, while {{the middle and}} bass strings ring as unfretted drones. This style of play is now referred to as [...] "noter-drone" [...] play. In some traditions, players use a feather quill with the barbs removed to strum the instrument. The frets on early mountain dulcimers were usually simple <b>wire</b> <b>staples</b> spanning only halfway across the fingerboard, meaning only the melody string course could be fretted. By the early 1960s, many dulcimer makers had abandoned staples in favour of manufactured fret wire extending across the entire width of the fingerboard. This enabled players to fret all the strings, allowing for chording and an expanded melodic range. A variety of new, [...] "noter-less" [...] playing styles emerged now collectively referred to as [...] "chord-melody" [...] play. The emergence of full-width frets also compelled makers to fret their instruments in equal temperament. The fret patterns on the older half-width-fret instruments rarely adhered to equal temperament, and intonation varied from builder to builder. With a simple melody played against the drone, these idiosyncratic scales could add warmth and a distinctive flavour to the music, but the old non-standard fret patterns often produce a dissonance when chorded that some find unacceptable.|$|R

The circumferential skin defect was successfully treated with controlled lengthening of the distal skin by the Ilizarov technique using nylon <b>wires</b> and skin <b>staples</b> to apply traction.

30|$|Proximal humeral {{fractures}} occur frequently. Most proximal humeral fractures are minimally displaced or non-displaced and {{are treated}} conservatively with good results. However, unstable or displaced fractures {{may lead to}} non-union, malunion or limited function [1]. Therefore, these displaced or unstable fractures require operative reduction and stabilization for favorable outcome. Various devices have been proposed for fixation, including plates and screws, <b>staples,</b> <b>wire,</b> multiple pins, intramedullary nails, and combination of these items. Intramedullary fixation has been thought as less invasive because it, compared with plate fixation, requires less extensive soft tissue dissection [2, 3].|$|R
50|$|The two {{pivoting}} blades interlock each other. They {{are made}} of chrome-plated steel, which is harder than the thin ductile <b>wire</b> of the <b>staple</b> and strong enough to withstand the force required to remove it. The chrome plating provides a mild rust-resistance suitable for use in an office environment away from any liquids. Though the blade is made from what was originally sheet metal, the right angles and clean edges mean that a punch and die method of production would not be suitable. Therefore, the piece of sheet metal is cut using the process of blanking in a mechanical press, then bent in a press brake. This is a highly automated method which allows for a production rate of up to 1,500 units per minute.|$|R
40|$|A typical {{severely}} obese {{patient will}} have about 50 kg excess weight to lose, which {{is equivalent to}} a store of 350, 000 kcal. The optimum rate of weight loss in such a patient is about 1 kg/week, which involves an energy deficit of 1000 kcal/day for about a year. It is difficult to maintain this degree of dietary restriction over such a long period, and procedures such as jaw <b>wiring</b> or stomach <b>stapling</b> may help in some cases. Maintenance of weight loss is difficult to achieve and may be helped by fitting a nylon waist cord after weight loss. On theoretical grounds, patients who do not lose weight despite keeping to a properly-designed reducing diet would not benefit from surgery, but in practice this problem does not arise.

40|$|AbstractDisplaced tibial {{intercondylar}} eminence fractures require early {{reduction and}} stable fixation to prevent nonunion, knee instability, {{and a lack}} of extension. Many types of surgical procedure are recommended including arthrotomy or an arthroscopic technique to stabilize the fracture segment using Kirschner <b>wire,</b> screws, <b>staples,</b> and suture fixation. However, contemporary arthroscopic techniques and devices can facilitate intra-articular surgery and have been applied to the treatment of this fracture. In our current report, we describe a simple suture fixation method under arthroscopy for the treatment of tibial intercondylar eminence fractures. We treated eight knees of eight patients. One patient had a Type II fracture and seven patients had a Type III fracture according to Meyer's classification. Following the arthroscopic inspection of concomitant injuries, debridement of hematoma, and reduction of the fragment, two nonabsorbable sutures (Ethibond No. 2, Johnson & Johnson, Somerville, NJ, USA) were advanced through the suture passer device, which is used to penetrate the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) near to the insertion site of the displaced fragment. Two surgical sutures were pulled out by the suture retriever from the anterior proximal tibia hole and were fixed to the tibia cortex bone with a double-spike plate. At follow-up, radiographic examinations showed that bone union was achieved in all cases. All but one patient could resume normal activities with no restrictions and no ligamentous instability. All knees had a negative Lachman's test and showed a gain of stable ligament function by KT 2000 arthrometer evaluation. One patient had an insignificant extension limitation and experienced slight pain after walking but these symptoms were minimal. In conclusion current arthroscopic surgery techniques for tibial intercondylar fractures can be easily performed and reproducibly achieve secure fixation and early mobilization of the knee...|$|R
40|$|Till Rolls was {{commissioned}} by the Towner Art Gallery Eastbourne specifically for the exhibition Compulsive, Obsessive, Repetitive (2011). ‘Till Roll’s’ is typical of Jill Townsley's practice; it is often large in scale, installation or temporary, though the physical labour applied to its construction is generally excruciatingly repetitive. She {{is interested in the}} subjective results of repetitive action, such as ‘failure', ‘temporality', ‘erasure' and 'authorship'. She generally uses everyday materials, such as, plastic spoons, broom bristles or <b>staple</b> <b>wire.</b> In this work she has used 10, 000 till roll’s, each of which has its middle extruded from the center, to form a tall vertical cone. Each cone differs in height, from very small to 3 meters (10 ft) high. Each roll is placed on the floor to form a giant grid; 5. 7 meters square. This structure is reminiscent of a graph, though we have no access to what it is recording. Compulsive, Obsessive, Repetitive, is a group show of sculptors who obsessively use small scale repetitive processes to create large scale installations. The exhibition comprises five new commissions by: Elpida Hadzi-Vasileva Brendan Jamison Susie MacMurray Jill Townsley Henry Seaton (Rex Henry and Graham Seaton) It also features an earlier work by Claire Morgan. These artists are motivated by the need to compulsively repeat an action – in a labour intensive and painstaking way - to create a large scale installation composed of multiple elements. From MacMurray’s sculptural drawing made from corrugated hose to Hadzi-Vasileva’s wall of salmon skins, individual elements are transformed through repetition into something {{more than the sum of}} its parts...|$|R
