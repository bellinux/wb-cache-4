500|$|Hitchens first {{referred}} to The Rage Against God in August 2009, {{in one of}} his weekly columns: [...] "Above all, I seek to counter the assertion, central to my brother's case ... that the Soviet regime was in fact religious in character. This profound misunderstanding {{of the nature of the}} USSR is the key to finding another significant flaw in what is in general his circular argument". Then, a week before the book's publication, Hitchens wrote: [...] "...it is obvious much of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> [...] arises out of my attempt to debate religion with him , it would be absurd to pretend that much of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> here is not intended to counter or undermine arguments he presented in his book, God Is Not Great...".|$|E
500|$|Knowing that {{prosecutors}} {{were about to}} publicly disclose her past addiction, McCain preemptively revealed the story to reporters, saying that she was doing so willingly: [...] "Although my conduct {{did not result in}} compromising any missions of AVMT, my actions were wrong, and I regret them ... if <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> can help just one person to face the problem, it's worthwhile." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{director}} of 300, Zack Snyder, stated in an MTV interview that [...] "the events are 90 percent accurate. It's {{just in the}} visualization that it's crazy… I've shown this movie to world-class historians who have said it's amazing. They can't believe it's as accurate as it is." [...] Nevertheless, {{he also said the}} film is [...] "an opera, not a documentary. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> when people say it's historically inaccurate". He was also quoted in a BBC News story as saying that the film is, at its core [...] "a fantasy film". He also describes the film's narrator, Dilios, as [...] "a guy who knows how not to wreck a good story with truth".|$|E

500|$|Ling is {{not above}} using her {{ethnicity}} {{as a means}} of gaining advantage. [...] In one episode, as she delivers her closing arguments to a jury, she says [...] "There's a very old expression in China," [...] and then begins to speak in Chinese. In the subtitles we see her saying, [...] "It really doesn't matter <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> here, because none of you speak Chinese. But you can see from my sad face I'm sympathetic. You hear from my tone it's appropriate to feel sorry for me. As I drop to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|E
500|$|During the 1892 campaign, Tillman {{called for}} the defeat in the Democratic primary for the {{legislature}} {{of most of the}} men elected as his supporters, urging the selection of more loyal men. Tillman urged the voters, [...] "turn out this cattle, these driftwood legislators, and send me a legislature that will do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> and I'll show you reform." [...] South Carolinians dutifully voted out their representatives as Tillman requested. Although no primary for governor was permitted, the delegates to the nominating convention were elected by the Democratic voters, and Tillman won an overwhelming victory over Sheppard, who took only four of thirty-five counties. The convention was mostly Tillmanite, and gave the governor an easy triumph. The Conservatives had agreed not to bolt the party, and Tillman won uncontested re-election.|$|E
500|$|About casting, Singer said, [...] "You pick {{people not}} {{for what they}} are, but what you imagine they can turn into." [...] To {{research}} his role, Spacey met doctors and experts on cerebral palsy and talked with Singer about how it would fit dramatically in the film. They decided that it would affect only {{one side of his}} body. According to Byrne, the cast bonded quickly during rehearsals. Del Toro worked with Alan Shaterian to develop Fenster's distinctive, almost unintelligible speech patterns. According to the actor, the source of his character's unusual speech patterns came from the realization that [...] "the purpose of my character was to die." [...] Del Toro told Singer, [...] "It really doesn't matter <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> so I can go really far out with this and really make it uncomprehensible." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the last}} 16, O'Sullivan {{compiled}} two century breaks to whitewash Lee 5–0 for his 13th consecutive win and his 9th consecutive quarter-final. Regarding comments he made about his retirement after his previous match, O'Sullivan said, [...] "There's no point quoting me because <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> {{from one day}} to the next will be different". Maguire made a [...] of 140 in his 5–2 win over Ding, while Hamilton defeated Williams 5–3 for his fourth consecutive win over the world number two. Hendry, whose last tournament victory was this event last year, made four breaks over 60 in his 5–2 win over Carter to set up a match with Higgins, who made the highest break so far with a 141 in his 5–3 win over Pinches. Doherty became the fifth member of the top eight to lose when he was defeated 4–5 by Hicks, while Hawkins defeated Bingham 5–4 and Murphy beat Holt 5–3.|$|E
500|$|Fazekas said that, [...] "Whitney is used {{to people}} {{treating}} her {{with a certain amount}} of deference, because she’s a famous actress, and she’s met her match in Peggy." [...] She added that in the series, [...] "You see the makings of a villain, but she doesn't start off evil. She starts off manipulative and not the nicest person you've ever met, but she's not a bad guy when you first meet her." [...] Fazekas additionally noted how the sexist themes of the times were handled, by showing [...] "that the only way Whitney Frost felt she could exert power in the world was through her husband, because she had been told her whole life, 'Nobody cares how smart you are, they care about how pretty you are.'" [...] On Frost's relationship with Chadwick, Everett called him [...] "her best friend. And like many friends and family, you end up , but he’s always there ... he knows I can do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> I can do, especially in the science world. So he’s really the only one who gets me." ...|$|E
500|$|Finding the Persian fleet {{gone from}} Samos, the Allies were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they {{resolved}} {{that they would}} sail to the mainland, and equipped themselves for a naval battle. However, when the Allies approached Mycale, the Persians {{did not attempt to}} engage them, and remained guarding their camp. Leotychides therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal to the Ionians: [...] "Men of Ionia, you who hear us, understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> for by no means will the Persians understand anything I charge you with when we join battle; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry Hebe: and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it." [...] Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly to encourage the Ionians, unbeknownst to the Persians, to fight for the Allies (or at least not to fight against them); or, if the message became known to the Persians, to make the Persians mistrust the Ionians.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, upon leaving church, Scalia {{was asked}} by a {{reporter}} whether being a traditionalist Catholic had caused problems for him, and he responded by asking, [...] "You know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to those people?" [...] and with a gesture, cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out. The gesture, which got captured by a photographer, was initially reported by the Boston Herald as obscene. Scalia responded to the reports with {{a letter to the}} editor, accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of The Sopranos and stating that the gesture was a strong brush-off. Roger Axtell, an expert on body language, described the gesture as possibly meaning [...] "I've had enough, go away" [...] and noted, [...] "It's a fairly strong gesture". The gesture would later be parodied by comedian Stephen Colbert during his performance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner later that year, with the justice in attendance: cameras showed that unlike most of the butts of Colbert's jokes that evening, Scalia was laughing.|$|E
500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song that lasts for three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, while Lohan's vocal range spans from F3 to D5. When asked about the lyrical content of the song, Lohan revealed, [...] "A lot of people go through family issues, abuse {{and that kind of}} thing. I think it's important to show that other people go through it. [...] I hope [...] see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> in the song is, 'I love you,' so many times, that I need him and the crazy things in my life. I hope he sees the positive side of the video rather than the negative. The video is kind of offensive, but it is very raw. He's my father. I need someone to walk me down the aisle when I get married." [...] The single's b-side, [...] "My Innocence", features a similar message to Lohan's father.|$|E
500|$|I Am... (January 2002) marked several {{milestones}} for Hamasaki. Hamasaki increased {{her control}} over her music by composing {{all of the}} songs on the album under the pseudonym [...] "Crea", of which the 2000 single [...] "M" [...] was the first. [...] "Connected" [...] (November 2002) and [...] "A Song Is Born" [...] (December 2001) were the exceptions. I Am... also showed evolution in Hamasaki's lyrical style: it was a retreat from the themes of [...] "loneliness and confusion" [...] of some of her earlier songs. Moved by the September 11 attacks, Hamasaki revised her vision of I Am..., focusing {{on issues such as}} faith and world peace. [...] "A Song Is Born", in particular, was directly influenced by the events. The single, a duet with Keiko Yamada, was released as part of Avex's non-profit Song Nation project, which raised money for charity."まず、浜崎あゆみとKEIKOがデュエットした『a song is born』が2001年12月12日にリリースされた。" [...] She also dropped the planned cover and opted instead to be portrayed as a [...] "peace muse", explaining, I had a completely different idea for the cover at first. We'd already reserved the space, decided the hair and makeup and everything. But after the incident, as is typical of me, I suddenly changed my mind. I knew it wasn't the time for gaudiness, for elaborate sets and costumes. It sounds odd coming from me, but I realize <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> and how I look has a great impact.|$|E

500|$|American {{recording}} artist Kanye West {{also contributed to}} three tracks on the album; Madonna called him [...] "the black Madonna" [...] and said, [...] "We're comrades in the envelope-pushing genre". Madonna said, [...] "It's {{a little bit of}} a bullfight, but we take turns. He knows that he's walking into a room with a person with a strong point of view, and I do, too. I listen to what he has to say, take it in, and he listens to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> and takes it in. We didn't agree on everything, but he has good ideas." [...] She told Rolling Stone that of the songs she played him, West connected the most with [...] "Illuminati" [...] and that, [...] "e loved the melody, and he was actually jumping up and down on the soundboard. He literally stood on top of the mixing board—we were worried he was going to hit his head on the ceiling, but he didn't. He ended up being very excited about that track, and then he added his spin to it, musically, and I love it. To me, he elevated the lyrics with the music. It's like a siren, alerting people." [...] In December 2014, thirteen demos of tracks for the album, including [...] "Illuminati", were leaked to the Internet. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks, including the final version of [...] "Illuminati" [...] with the addition of West's writing and production, with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift".|$|E
500|$|Following a {{long time}} of hiatus in her acting career, Cher was {{announced}} to be returned on the musical film Burlesque (2010) co-starring Christina Aguilera. This {{was the first time}} Cher appeared on the screen since Stuck on You (2003). Talking about the making of the film, Cher revealed, [...] "It’s harder to do things. I've beat my body up so badly, it's amazing it's still talking to me and listening to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> But I’ve got aches and pains everywhere." [...] The soundtrack was also revealed, with eight songs performed by Aguilera, and two songs by Cher: [...] "Welcome to Burlesque" [...] and [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me". During an interview with a California journal, Cher commented about [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me", [...] "That song, for me, had a lot of meaning. It reminded me that I have to kind of move over." [...] She also spoke about the track with the Fresno Bee, saying [...] "Not that I'm doing it gracefully, because you'd have to pull me over kicking and screaming." [...] In the United States, the song was released to adult contemporary radio station on January 15, 2011 the first single from the soundtrack. In order to promote the song, several promotional remixes were made by Almighty, Dave Aude and StoneBridge.
