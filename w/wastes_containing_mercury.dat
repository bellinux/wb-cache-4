In contrast to original host, E coli JM 109 which could hardly grow at 1 mg/L Hg 2 + concentration, genetically engineered E. coli cells were able to propagate themselves in LB with Hg 2 + concentration up to 7. 4 mg/L, although cell reproduction was delayed with increasing Hg 2 + concentration. Simultaneously, this strain could accumulate Hg 2 + from LB + Hg 2 + solutions effectively with more than 96 % of mercury removal whether the cells were induced by IPTG or not. Cell propagation was somewhat inhibited by IPTG, but the capability of Hg 2 +-uptake of the induced cells was enhanced. These results suggested this strain {{could be used for}} the bioremediation of contaminated <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>mercury</b> and organic matters. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{conversion}} {{process and the}} existing forms of mercury {{in the course of}} coal firing are first analyzed, and different methods to measure mercury are introduced; To assess the mercury emission levels of boilers in large power plants, through testing the mercury content in combustion products of the boiler in 700 MW unit under different loads in one power plant of Jiangxi Province, we analyzed the formation distribution of mercury emissions and the effect of low temperature economizer on the mercury concentration before and after the ESP, and acquired the mercury emission characteristics of 700 MW boiler. In study, we found that mercury in the coal burnt in 700 MW boiler was mainly discharged in the form of gas, with a small amount existing in burnt solids. The change of gaseous mercury before and after the ESP is not obvious, but the concentration of bivalent mercury is higher than that of zero-valent mercury; and more than 90 % of the particulate mercury is removed. The low temperature economizer in operation can obviously reduce the concentration of mercury in flue gas at the ESP outlet by 30. 8 %. Mercury is a typical toxic heavy metal with strong toxicity. The mercury in atmosphere is mainly from the combustion of coal and <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>mercury,</b> metal mineral smelting, and industries with production involving mercury (such as production process of batteries, fluorescent lamp...|$|E

30|$|Unfortunately, high {{concentrations}} of heavy metals {{are found in the}} landfill leachate of Bangladesh. Several factors could contribute for the heavy metal input in landfill leachate. About 2.8 million metric tons of electronic <b>wastes</b> <b>containing</b> <b>mercury</b> (Hg) and lead (Pd) are generated each year which are disposed to landfills, agricultural land and water bodies (EDSO 2010). The presence of heavy metals in fertilizers (Yusuf et al. 2003; Naser et al. 2009) and anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and industrial activities increases the Pb and nickel (Ni) contents of soils and waters which have effects on the metal contents in vegetables (Alegria et al. 1991). These metals containing discarded vegetables in solid waste may also contribute to high metal level in landfill leachate. In composition, dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a major fraction of leachate which contributes more than 85 % of total organic matter in terms of organic carbon in leachates (Zhang et al. 2009). This DOM has potential ability to bind heavy metal that affects their speciation (Wu et al. 2011). In previous study, it was found that, a considerable fraction of heavy metal was associated with DOM of landfill leachate (Baun and Christensen 2004). Strong affinity of humic substances (in DOM) toward heavy metals was found due to the presence of large number of functional groups in their structures (Wu et al. 2012; Terbouche et al. 2010) which help to form DOM–metal complexes. In aquatic environment and soil, DOM–metal complexes may completely alter the bioavailability and transport of many toxic metals (Zhao and Nelson 2005).|$|E

At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892, some of which were staked for gold exploration. Commercial mining has occurred in some areas, mostly near the McDermitt Caldera, where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted. Mines in what was called the Opalite Mining District produced 270,000 flasks of mercury—"the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere"—from cinnabar extracted from the caldera in the 20thcentury. The two leading mercury-producing mines in North America were the Cordero and McDermitt mines {{on the edge of the}} caldera in Nevada. Together, they operated from 1933 to 1989.

40|$|Many of the {{different}} substances used in our society today can be classified as harmful and dangerous. Mercury {{is one of the}} most dangerous toxins in our environment. In Sweden, decisions have been taken to stop all use of mercury and that the mercury existing in the Swedish society shall be collected and deposited in a safe way. The safest alternative for a final storage of mercury is considered to be a deep repository in the Fennoscandian bedrock. This also opens the possibility to use existing facilities such as a mine. The aim of this thesis is to illuminate what localization factors influence the functionality of a deep repository, mainly from a hydrogeological perspective. No direct demands has been set by the Swedish EPA that a deep repository must fulfil, instead the overall solution should be taken into account. Boliden Mineral AB’s plan for a deep repository for <b>waste</b> <b>containing</b> <b>mercury</b> and its two possible locations is used as an example. Boliden Mineral AB has large quantities of <b>waste</b> <b>containing</b> <b>mercury</b> at their smelting plant at Rönnskär. The company also has access to existing mines and they have the knowledge and the technology to build facilities deep in the bedrock. The main alternative is to build a repository deep in the bedrock under Rönnskär. The second alternative is to use the existing logistic facilities at the mine called Åkullagruvan, northeast of the community of Boliden, where plans exist to mine a new ore deposit. The best suitable alternative is the alternative with the least impact on the environment. The impact of the repository is dependent both on the size of the emission and the sensitivity of the environment where the emission surfaces. ercury is leached out of the waste by ground water seeping through the repository and then transported with the ground water until it reaches the surface. Where the contaminated ground water reaches the surface depends on the flow path of the ground water which in turn depends on the hydraulic conductivity and the hydraulic gradient. When the contaminated ground water reaches the surface depends on the length of the flow path and the speed of the ground water, which also depends on the hydraulic conductivity and the hydraulic gradient. To find out the magnitude of the negative impact on the environment of the contaminated ground water, the concentration of mercury in the ground water has to be known as well as the sensitivity of the environment where the ground water surfaces. The magnitude of the impact depends on the attenuation or dilution that occurs when the contaminated water surfaces. If the contaminated water surfaces in small waters and/or in a sensitive biotope the damages will be significantly larger than if it surfaces in a large river or a sea where the high dilution leads to a much smaller concentration of mercury. The hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock depends on the rock type, depth and the occurrence of fracture zones. Conducted tests show the hydraulic conductivity to be lower than the regional average for both example locations. The hydraulic gradient is high at the inland location of Åkulla and low at the coastal location of Rönnskär. These factors indicate the length of the flow path from the planned repository at Åkulla to be approximately 1 km and from Rönnskär approximately 400 m, and that the time for the ground water to surface will be between 1 000 – 10 000 years for the Åkulla location and 1 000 – 15 000 years for the Rönnskär location. After such a long time the land uplift occurring in the area will have changed certain parameters in the area as might a change in climate. Foremost the land lift will have an impact on the hydraulic gradient at Rönnskär and thus increase the ground water flow through the planned repository. The ground water flow through the example location of Åkulla was calculated to 1 500 – 7 500 litres per year and with a concentration of 0, 012 mg of mercury per litre leachate water, a total emission of 20 – 90 mg of mercury per year can be expected. For the Rönnskär location, with a slightly higher ground water flow of 2 500 – 12 000 litres per year and the same concentration, a total emission of 30 – 140 mg per year can be expected. After the effect of 3 000 years of land lift is taken into account, the total emission from a repository at the Rönnskär location can be expected to be 70 – 350 mg of mercury per year. When a contaminated ground water from the Åkulla location surfaces in the lake Stavträsket it will be diluted around 400 000 – 2 100 000 times and will give the lake an additional mercury concentration of 5, 6 • 10 - 6 – 2, 8 • 10 - 5 µg/l. A contaminated ground water flow from the Rönnskär location surfaces at the mouth of the Skellefteå River, which has a much higher discharge than Stavträsket. The dilution there reaches 2 • 108 – 9 • 108 times and gives the Bothnian Bay an additional mercury concentration of 1, 4 • 10 - 8 – 7, 0 • 10 - 8 µg/l. Compared to the background concentrations of Stavträsket, < 5 • 10 - 3 µg/l, and Bothnian Bay, 1, 3 • 10 - 2 µg/l, these additional concentrations are negligible. The impact of a deep repository on the local ground water is unquestionable regardless of the location. With an inland location the surfacing, contaminated ground water will always have a relatively restricted discharge area and thus a restricted possibility of dilution and a higher risk of too high concentrations of the potentially dangerous substances in local waters. With a coastal location the discharge will occur closer to larger bodies of water that are more resilient than the smaller waters of an inland location. Validerat; 20110730 (anonymous...|$|R

Diante disso, foi elaborado um plano de gerenciamento de resíduos para o Instituto de Química da Universidade Federal de Goiás (IQ/UFG), com horizonte de projeto de cinco anos. Foi realizado um levantamento de reagentes químicos, de materiais de escritório e de produtos de limpeza, entre outros, e verificadas quais eram as atividades geradoras de resíduos, identificando, quantificando e classificando todos esses produtos. Foram elaborados o diagnóstico e o prognóstico da segregação, da minimização, do acondicionamento, do armazenamento, da coleta, do transporte, do tratamento e da disposição final dos resíduos gerados. Os resultados indicaram que existe desperdício de materiais e que muitos reagentes encontram-se estocados de forma inadequada dentro dos laboratórios. A maioria dos resíduos não é tratada e não possui local apropriado para armazenamento. São gerados anualmente cerca de 900 kg de resíduos comuns e 600 kg de resíduos químicos, sendo as análises cromatográficas as atividades que mais geram esses resíduos químicos. A maioria deles é da classe I, com destaque para os inflamáveis. Os resíduos comuns são, na maior parte, papel e papelão. Foi proposta a construção de um abrigo para os resíduos químicos e a aquisição de outro contêiner para os resíduos comuns. Propôs-se a incineração dos materiais, com exceção daqueles contendo mercúrio e cianeto, os quais devem ser encaminhados para um aterro de resíduos perigosos. Conclui-se que os resíduos comuns recicláveis devem ser encaminhados para cooperativas de reciclagem e os não-recicláveis para o aterro sanitário de Goiânia. The {{quantity}} of waste generated grows {{and can cause}} many problems to {{human health and the}} environment. Recently, increased the discussions around the management of chemical waste in laboratories for teaching and research in Brazil, with that, details emerged of how this waste could provide occupational risks, besides offering damage to the environment. Hence, the plan for managing waste to the Institute of Chemistry of the Federal University of Goiás (IQ/UFG) was idealized. At work diagnoses and predictions for each stage of waste management were executed simultaneously, in a horizon of five years of the project. We raised the chemicals and materials used and the waste-generating activities, and then identified, quantified and ranked all waste generated. The diagnosis and prognosis of segregation, minimization, packaging, storage, collection, transportation, treatment and final disposal of waste generated were prepared. The results indicated that some materials were purchased in excess and many reagents are inadequately stored in the laboratories. The management at IQ/UFG is worrying, because there is no treatment and appropriate place for the storage of waste. 900 kg of common waste and 600 kg of chemical waste are generated per year. The chromatographic analyses are the activities that generate more chemical waste and administrative work is the activity that generates more common waste. Most of the chemical waste is of class I and flammable waste represents the greater percentage. Most of the common waste is paper and cardboard. It was proposed to build a shelter for the chemical waste and the acquisition of other containers for common waste.

Although validated batch measurement methods such as EPA Method 29, the Ontario Hydro mercury speciation method, and EPA Method 101 A exist for total and speciated mercury, they are difficult and costly to perform. In addition, the data are not available for use until several days later. Continuous emission monitors (CEMs) are a very attractive option because the data are in near real-time, allowing the data to be used as feedback control for mercury control strategies. Also, a properly designed analyzer should require minimal operator input. However, based on {{the current state of the}} art, mercury CEMs are not without problems, as demonstrated in recent field tests (2). In addition, they are often bulky and costly to purchase. Sensor Research and Development Corporation (SRD) was contracted by DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory (formerly the Federal Energy Technology Center [FETC]) to develop a prototype instrument for thermal treatment process continuous emission monitoring applications. The work by SRD for DOE on the mercury CEM was conducted under two different contracts. Work under the first contract began October 1, 1997, and ended June 2000, with a second contract continuing until June 2001. The SRD process has the potential to be the basis for a very low-cost mercury CEM. The initial cost estimates provided by SRD are an order of magnitude lower than any other proposed mercury CEM.
