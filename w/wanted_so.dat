She blackmails Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) into appointing Sandy as the school's new Arts director, and together they hold auditions for a school production of Cabaret, hoping to entice away the glee club's star, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele). Rachel feels slighted when Will awards Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) a solo that she <b>wanted,</b> <b>so</b> she auditions for the musical and is given the lead role. When Will refuses to reassign the solo to Rachel, she quits the club.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Maggie Roswell {{was hired}} {{for the first}} season of The Simpsons. She played a few minor {{characters}} until she became a regular cast member {{with the introduction of}} Maude Flanders in the second season. In 1994, Roswell and her husband Hal Rayle moved from Los Angeles to Denver to raise their daughter. Together they established the Roswell 'n' Rayle Company, creating and voicing advertisements for companies. Because of her move to Denver, Roswell had to travel to Los Angeles twice a week to tape The Simpsons. This ultimately led to her requesting a pay raise in 1999; however, Fox refused to offer her the amount she <b>wanted</b> <b>so</b> she quit the show. Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal to record her lines from her Denver home.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added the subtitle The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write everything that they had <b>wanted,</b> <b>so</b> they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1862, shortly after Porter left Vicksburg, the U.S. Navy was {{extensively}} modified; among {{the features of the}} revised organization were a set of officer ranks from ensign to rear admiral that paralleled the ranks in the Army. Among the new ranks created were those of commodore and rear admiral. According to the organization charts, the persons in command of the blockading squadrons were to be rear admirals. Another part of the reorganization transferred the Western gunboat flotilla from the army to the navy, and retitled it the Mississippi River Squadron. The change of title implied that it was formally equivalent to the other squadrons, so its commanding officer would likewise be a rear admiral. The problem was that the commandant of the gunboat flotilla, Flag Officer Charles H. Davis, had not shown the initiative that the Navy Department <b>wanted,</b> <b>so</b> he had to be removed. He was made rear admiral, but he was recalled to Washington to serve as chief of the Bureau of Navigation.|$|E

The filming of the school scenes could only be done during the Taiwanese school holidays.

According to the author, he and White had long discussions on the subject [...] "because he <b>wanted</b> <b>so</b> much for me to approve. I couldn't approve." [...] Yancey writes that, although he continued to cultivate his friendship with White, many other Christians shunned the pastor. One chapter, [...] "The Lovesick Father", retells the Parable of the Prodigal Son in a modern setting with the spendthrift child, a daughter. Yancey writes that the closest many people get to experiencing pure grace is a romantic relationship, when they believe that [...] "someone at last feels that I — I! — am the most desirable, attractive, companionable creature on the planet".|$|E

500|$|Goebbels {{knew how}} to play on Hitler's fantasies, {{encouraging}} {{him to see the}} hand of providence in the death of United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April. Whether Hitler really saw this event as a turning point as Goebbels proclaimed is not known. By this time, Goebbels had gained the position he had <b>wanted</b> <b>so</b> long– at the side of Hitler. Göring was utterly discredited, although he was not stripped of his offices until 23 April. Himmler, whose appointment as commander of Army Group Vistula had led to disaster on the Oder, was also in disgrace with Hitler. Most of Hitler's inner circle, including Göring, Himmler, Ribbentrop, and Speer, prepared to leave Berlin immediately after Hitler's birthday celebration on 20 April. Even Bormann was [...] "not anxious" [...] to meet his end at Hitler's side. On 22 April, Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself. Goebbels moved with his family into the Vorbunker, connected to the lower Führerbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in central Berlin, that same day. He told Vice-Admiral Hans-Erich Voss that he would not entertain the idea of either surrender or escape. On 23 April, Goebbels made the following proclamation to the people of Berlin: ...|$|E

500|$|Mullen has {{admitted}} his bass drum technique {{is not one}} of his strengths and has used a floor tom to his left to create the effect he wants (since The Unforgettable Fire era), using it for accents or in songs such as [...] "With or Without You", [...] "In God's Country", [...] "One" [...] and Pride (In the Name of Love)". Speaking in 1995, he said, [...] "When it came to recording 'Pride' for The Unforgettable Fire album, Danny [...] was able to pick up from me that I had some interesting ideas but here was a slight lack of focus. My kick drum technique was then, as it is now, completely underdeveloped and I {{never got a chance to}} practice and learn like most people would. In the marching bands, I only used a snare and when I first got a kit, I never learned how to properly use all the elements together. So I went and listened to a basic demo of 'Pride' and tried to play a beat just using the kick and snare. But I couldn't get the kick to do what I <b>wanted,</b> <b>so</b> I got a floor tom down and did what I'd done in the past, which was if I couldn't physically do what was necessary, I'd find another way around it. I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives." ...|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes. After finishing the Australian concerts, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they <b>wanted.</b> <b>So,</b> I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E
