5|$|As can {{be discerned}} from the {{previous}} description, the 1945 campaign <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> but genteel and polite. Jolliffe replied by giving a radio speech (written {{with the assistance of}} Lister Sinclair) that accused Drew of running a political Gestapo in Ontario. In the speech excerpt below, Jolliffe alleged that a secret department of the Ontario Provincial Police was acting as a political police – spying on the opposition and the media.|$|E
5|$|Published {{commentators}} on the Roseberys {{claim their}} marriage was happy, {{and there is}} no known evidence that Hannah <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> other than happy in her marriage, and quite a lot to suggest she was indeed blissfully happy. However, much evidence suggests that Rosebery, while professing to be happy, was at times irritated and bored by Hannah, who was always keen to accommodate his every whim.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E

5|$|As {{the period}} of Sovietization and Stalinism began, the PZPR <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> but united. The most {{important}} split among the communists occurred before the union with PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomułka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction. The PZPR had become divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While the official ideology, the Russian version of Marxism, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, {{including those of the}} Sanation, the National Democracy, and the 19th century traditions of cooperation with the partitioning powers.|$|E
5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February 2008 the Australian Family Association (AFA), was {{publicly}} {{outraged that}} Underbelly would be screening at 8:30pm, well {{within reach of}} children, after clips of the series were leaked onto the internet. The clips highlighted the use of extreme profanities, and scenes that show a violent bashing, a cold-blooded murder, and a sexual encounter. The Nine Network defended the timeslot and the M classification, saying the clips, leaked from the Network's production department, were indeed from the series, {{but not all of}} them made the final cut. The Network set its own classification, under the accepted rules of the Australian Commercial Television Code of Conduct. The Australian Family Association threatened to take the matter to Communications Minister Stephen Conroy if the content of the show <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> near that of an unauthorised promotional clip leaked from Nine's production department.|$|E

5|$|While {{he tried}} to {{consolidate}} his rule over Mosul, Hasan showed himself conspicuously loyal to the Abbasid regime, and refused to support the revolt of Mu'nis al-Khadim against the Caliph al-Muqtadir in 932. Mu'nis succeeded in overthrowing and killing al-Muqtadir, {{but over the next}} few years the Abbasid government all but collapsed, until in 936 the powerful governor of Wasit, Muhammad ibn Ra'iq, assumed the title of amir al-umara ("commander of commanders") and with it de facto control of the Abbasid government. The Caliph al-Radi was reduced to a figurehead role, while the extensive civil bureaucracy was cut down dramatically both in size and power. Ibn Ra'iq's position <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> but secure, however, and soon a convoluted struggle for control of his office, and the Caliphate with it, broke out among the various local rulers and the Turkish and Daylamite military chiefs, which ended in 946 with the ultimate victory of the Buyids.|$|E
5|$|Đính's {{political}} stay was brief, as General Nguyễn Khánh, who was disgruntled at {{not receiving}} a high position after Diệm's removal, deposed the MRC {{with the support}} of Khiệm on 30 January 1964, without firing a shot. Khánh used the coup to exact retribution against Generals Đôn, Đính, Xuan and Lê Văn Kim. Khánh had them arrested, claiming that {{they were part of a}} neutralist plot with the French government of President Charles de Gaulle to make a peace deal with North Vietnam that would not end communism. Khánh noted they had all served in the French-backed VNA prior to 1955, although he had as well. He also accused the four generals of discussing such a plan with some visiting politicians from de Gaulle's party during a dinner, although Đính and his accused colleagues denied that the meeting <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> more than social. The generals were flown to Mỹ Khe beach, near Đà Nẵng.|$|E

However, in those games he took only 14 wickets and failed entirely with the bat, compiling just 81 runs in his 11 innings.|$|E
25|$|The first robust {{indications}} that the mass to light ratio <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> other than unity came from measurements of galaxy rotation curves. In 1939, Horace W. Babcock reported the rotation curve for the Andromeda nebula (known now as the Andromeda Galaxy), which suggested that the mass-to-luminosity ratio increases radially. He attributed it to either light absorption within the galaxy or modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to missing matter.|$|E
25|$|Such an all-encompassing love often {{leaves little}} room for other affections. Hephaestion was the best friend of Alexander, his king and his {{commanding}} officer, {{so it is not}} surprising that we only hear of several other close friendships or attachments in his life. There is no evidence, however, that he <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> but popular and well liked among the group of Alexander's close friends and Companions who had grown up together, and worked well together for so many years.|$|E

Simpson was a 46-year-old former professional football player with chronic arthritis. He had scars on his knees from old football injuries. But Clark produced into evidence an exercise video that Simpson made {{a few months before}} the murders titled O.J.

25|$|Much of the {{knowledge}} about the daily activities of the convent comes from seven volumes of diaries that were meticulously kept by convent scribes. These diaries cover {{over a hundred years}} of convent history, from 1851 to 1971; they are handwritten in French and entitled Annales de Singapour. From their observations, it is known that life within the convent walls <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> but sedate. Apart from daily chores, the nuns also had to organise and attend mass, grade papers, maintain the buildings and the grounds as well as raise money to support their activities.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} he shared his homes, first in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, then in France, {{with his partner}} Anthony Forwood, who was the former husband of actress Glynis Johns {{and the father of}} their only child, actor Gareth Forwood. Bogarde {{repeatedly}} denied that their relationship <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> other than platonic. Such denials were understandable, mainly because male homosexual acts were criminal during most of his career, and could lead to prosecution and imprisonment. Rank Studio contracts included morality clauses, which provided for termination of the contract in the event of 'immoral' conduct {{on the part of the}} actor. This would have included same-sex relationships, thus potentially putting the actor's career in jeopardy.|$|E
