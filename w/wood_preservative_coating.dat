Sapwood of scots pine, (Pinus sylvestris L.), oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky), and chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) specimens (300 × 100 × 15 [*]mm along the grain) were impregnated with aqueous solution of 2 % CCA, 2 % Tanalith E, 1 % boric acid, and Immersol aqua. Surface roughness, dry film thickness, adhesion strength, gloss measurement, scratch, and abrasion resistance were determined according to related standards for treated and untreated samples. The results indicated that surface roughness and adhesion strength depended on wood species and the chemical composition of <b>preservatives.</b> Generally, waterborne <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives</b> increased the surface roughness of wood while the organic-based <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives</b> decreased it.

40|$|Wood {{materials}} {{are often used}} for outdoor constructions. It is expected that with growing demand for natural and renewable materials their usage will even increase in the future. In {{order to protect the}} wooden outdoor constructions biocides (<b>wood</b> <b>preservatives)</b> are applied, and if they are released to the environment with run-off waters, this could be considered as a source of environmental pollution with highly toxic substances. Due to the high toxicity, some of the historic wooden preservatives are banned or heavily restricted e. g. creosote, pentachlorophenol. There are several possibilities to reduce the environmental pollution coming from outdoor wooden constructions, e. g., by using <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives</b> with less toxic chemicals as components where possible, by reducing contact with water, or by achieving stronger binding of the toxic substances to the wooden material. The precondition for all these actions is proper information about the presence and concentrations of toxic substances in the composition of <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives.</b> The aim of the present research was to detect the extent of releases of toxic substances from wood materials treated with <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives</b> and to explore efficiency of paint in reduction of leaching of toxic substances. Leachates obtained from painted and unpainted wood materials treated with three different <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives</b> were tested by Daphnia magna ecotoxicity test (LVS EN ISO 6341 : 1996). All three of the researched <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives</b> were water based and targeted to protect wooden constructions in outdoor conditions. The information about the products applied was crosschecked and verified with various information sources including further testing. Ecotoxicity test results showed that all tested leachates of wood material treated with <b>wood</b> <b>preservative</b> characterizes with high toxicity to D. magna. Treatment of the preserved wood with paint reduces toxicity of leachates justifying painting as efficient measure to reduce leaching of toxic substances.

Each preservative was used in treatment of wood blocks in a reduced-pressure method to measure its treatability.

The preservatives successfully penetrated into wood blocks, probably due to the use of ammonium hydroxide as a dissociating agent. However, the stability of okara-based preservatives dropped as the concentration of acid in the solutions used for hydrolysis of okara increased. The treatability and leachability of the preservatives were not affected by hydrolysis temperature but were negatively affected by the addition of borax. Leached wood blocks treated with okara-based preservatives and exposed to decay fungi Gloeophyllum trabeum and Postia placenta over 12 weeks showed good decay resistance.
