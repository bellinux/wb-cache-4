50|$|While regular vacuum {{cleaners}} {{are designed to}} simply contain visible dirt and debris, hypoallergenic vacuums are designed to trap {{almost all of the}} smaller particles which in a regular vacuum are simply re-circulated into the ambient air. While this is not an issue for most people who do not suffer allergies, many with particular sensitivities to allergens (including asthma) can find that this not only does not help their condition, but stirring the dust into the air can make the condition worse.Most modern hypoallergenic {{vacuum cleaners}} use a system consisting of four primary components: the final output filter (generally a HEPA or similar filter), the motor and fan or impeller assembly, secondary particle filter to protect the motor assembly, and a primary filter - a bag, cup or <b>wet</b> <b>filter</b> bucket (each of which provide the initial filtration and retention of most dust and contaminants). Modern high quality hypoallergenic vacuum cleaners generally use HEPA (High Efficiency Particle Arrestor) filters to trap the vast majority (at least 99.97%) of very small particles that other vacuum cleaners would simply re-emit into the ambient air - ideally specifying a recognised and independently tested HEPA filter grade (see HEPA article) rather than just using the term. Recently many cheaper 'HEPA type' filters have appeared on the market attempting to capitalise on the term, these are generally inferior and do not meet the stringent requirements set by the US Dept of Energy (or in Europe EN 1822) to call themselves HEPA, and have not been independently tested to assess their ability to stop dust egress. While many dry bagless systems include HEPA grade filtration, the user is generally exposed to the very dust and allergens they are trying to avoid during emptying/cleaning the system. Anti-allergy bagged systems avoid most of this risk with a bag that will contain dirt and contaminants, and <b>wet</b> <b>filter</b> bagless systems also allow emptying without exposure to airborne particles as it is contained in a 'mud'. While <b>Wet</b> <b>filter</b> systems do avoid the cost and environmental waste of needing new bag for every filling, like wet/dry and shampooing machines they do generally require a very small amount of anti foaming agent, though this is generally environmentally benign. Some Hypoallergenic vacuum bags differ a great deal from non-hypoallergenic bags. Hypoallergenic bags often come in two pieces, an inner and outer bag. The inner bag (which captures the dirt) will be disposable and completely contained. Outer bags will sometimes take the place of a filter all together filtering out dust and allergens out of the air. Some modern hypoallergenic vacuum cleaners will use the two bag system with the outer bag made up of high-performance filtration material treated with antimicrobials to impede the growth of mold, bacteria and other parasites. A two bag system will still require a final HEPA filter to be able to comply with the standards of HEPA filtration. All good Hypo-allergenic systems are designed, not just to contain 99+% of containments (99.97% in the case of HEPA systems), but to clean the air while cleaning the floors, some, including water filter models, achieving retention of particles over 0.3 micrometer diameter of 99.99% (1 particle in 10,000 released).|$|E
50|$|The woman’s {{body was}} {{discovered}} partially covered by sand {{on a beach in}} Sicily.

Experts identified the mosquito as C. pipiens, a species not known to travel far distances, such as between the suspect’s home and the crime scene. This evidence, along with grains of sand and leaf fragments on the suspect’s clothing that matched samples from the beach, helped convict the suspect of second degree murder.

40|$|Fibrous {{filters are}} used for {{environmental}} and occupational mist sampling and industrial mist collection. If compounds in the filtered droplets are volatile or semi-volatile, they may evaporate into the gas passing through the filter. In sampling applications, failure to properly account for evaporation of collected mist will lead to mist concentration estimates that are low. In control applications, volatilization of filtered droplets may release vapors that are harmful to workers or the public. Also, vapor emitted from mist filters may recondense as a hazardous aerosol or on surfaces to pose a safety or housekeeping problem. Droplets collected by fibrous filters coalesce into larger drops that reside on the fibers. Results from a numerical model developed to predict evaporation from these drops agree favorably with experimental data. Measurements and numerical predictions show that a gas stream leaving a <b>wetted</b> fibrous <b>filter</b> can be saturated with the vapor of semi-volatile compounds retained on the filter. In some situations, the model indicates that the gas stream will be saturated before it passes 0. 1 mm into a <b>wetted</b> <b>filter.</b> If the liquid retained on a filter is a pure compound, the vapor concentration leaving the filter is constant when initially clean air passes through. If the liquid is multicomponent, the downstream vapor concentration in previously uncontaminated air will decrease with time as the more volatile components evaporate preferentially.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{analytical device}} capable of performing simultaneous immunofiltration-based immunoassay on 30 samples {{in the presence}} of reference standards has been developed. The device consists of a rectangular membrane with 36 antibody spotted zones, one end of which was attached to a semirigid polyethylene card. A piece of <b>wetted</b> <b>filter</b> paper between the membrane and the polyethylene card absorbs the added reagent. The assay is a competitive one using T- 2 toxin-horseradish peroxidase (T- 2 toxin-HRP) as the labeled analyte and 4 -chloro- 1 naphthol (4 CN) as the substrate. Signal amplification was done by the Super-CARD signal amplification method. Semiquantitative results were obtained by visual comparison of the color intensity of a sample spot with those of reference standards. Densitometric analysis was used for quantitation. The method allows rapid and easy determination of T- 2 toxin in wheat and poultry feed with detection limits of 12. 5 and 25 Ìg kg- 1, respectively, with accuracy and precision. Matrix interference was eliminated by appropriate dilution of sample extracts with assay buffer. The detection sensitivity in ELISA was 10 - fold higher than that in the membrane-based method. Noninfected samples were spiked with T- 2 toxin at several concentrations and analyzed by the present method and rapid ELISA. Mean recoveries by both methods were between 80 and 108...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{examine the effect of}} rapid sand {{filtration}} on NOM in reduced groundwater, groundwater with high concentrations of iron, ammonia, manganese and NOM was treated in a pilot plant consisting of a trickling filter column (TFI) followed by a <b>wet</b> type <b>filter</b> column (WFII) and a separate <b>wet</b> type <b>filter</b> column (WFsep). The organic carbon flow (adsorption + biodegradation) was calculated from the biomass detected in iron sludge. The influence of the filtration process on BOM was investigated by AOC and BDOC determinations. The results showed that the decrease of the organic carbon content by TFI and WFsep was caused by adsorption onto iron flocks and biodegradation. The bioprocesses in TFI and WFsep were responsible for BDOC reduction. Predominant production of AOC by TFI and predominant AOC reduction by WFsep suggested that the AOC was effected by chemical reactions depending on the oxygen concentration in the filter layer and the contact time in the filter column. Thus, for groundwater treatment by rapid sand filtration wet type filtration should always be preferred. If trickling filtration is necessary for elimination of high iron and ammonia contents contact time in the filter column should be as short as possible. (orig.)

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of two SPEL basins - a dry media filter basin and a <b>wet</b> sump <b>filter</b> basin - in treating stormwater pollutants from urban runoff. Two sites were chosen in Sippy Downs, on the Sunshine Coast. These sites are located in a developing urban area, in the landscape verge along Sippy Downs Drive. Inlet and outlet subsamples were captured in and withheld in Campbell Scientific PVS 4100 C Auto Samplers after rainfall events over 12 months, {{in which they would}} then be collected and analysed. Parameters tested were: total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). In total, 23 sample sets of stormwater were collected between the two basins. However, only six were used for analysis. The other 17 events were disqualified due to not meeting minimum sample and rainfall protocol or were excluded for demonstrating erratic results. No events from the <b>wet</b> sump <b>filter</b> basin were used for analysis as all samples exhibited erratic results. It is likely that these erratic results may be due to blockages within the stormsack trough which interrupted sampling. The dry media filter basin results showed average concentration removal efficiencies of 40 %, 14 % and - 14 % for TSS, TN and TP respectively.
