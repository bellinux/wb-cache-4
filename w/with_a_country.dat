An access road intersects the road that connects SR-224 to the Utah Olympic Park. As the highway approaches Snyderville, the commercial buildings turn into residential homes and the road briefly turns southwest before turning southeast and then south again. Residential development disappears when the highway turns southeast and hills appear {{on either side of the}} road. Homes appear yet again on either side of the road <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> club on the eastern side of the road and a golf course on the west. The route intersects with SR-248 and enters Park City as Park Avenue. The route turns off of Park Avenue and onto Deer Valley Drive. The road turns southeast and bypasses the center of town. A roundabout appears and the road turns onto Marsac Avenue, a two-lane road. As the route exits Park City and heads into rural Summit County, a runaway truck ramp appears on the east side of the road, serving northbound traffic. As the highway enters more forested and elevated terrain, it turns southwest and continues in a general southerly direction through Ontario Canyon before terminating at the Wasatch County line.|$|E

[...] It is noted that the sound of Hammond organ is instrumental in resonating the vibe of early 1980s in the song.

School Library Journal wrote: [...] "Willie Nelson differs (from) rock artists framing their music <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> & western facade — in that he appears a honky-tonk stardust cowboy to the core. This album abounds in unabashed sentimentalism, nasal singing, lyrics preoccupied with booze, religion, and love gone bad, and stereotyped Nashville instrumentation (twangy steel guitars, fiddles, and a clean rhythm section characterized by the minimal use of bass drum and cymbals, both of which gain heavy mileage with rock performers).|$|E
