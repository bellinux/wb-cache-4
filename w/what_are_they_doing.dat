In March, in briefing Emperor Hirohito on Japan's response to the expected Okinawan invasion, Japanese military leaders explained that the Japanese Imperial Army was planning extensive air attacks, {{including the use of}} kamikaze. The emperor then reportedly asked, [...] "But what about the Navy? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>doing</b> to assist in defending Okinawa? Have we no more ships?" [...] Now feeling pressured by the emperor to also mount some kind of attack, Japan's Navy commanders conceived a kamikaze-type mission for their remaining operational large ships, which included the battleship Yamato.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Clifford Young, {{who oversees}} federal {{relations}} for California State University San Bernardino, {{estimates that the}} school has received $60 million to $70 million for earmarked projects since it retained Copeland Lowery in late 1999. Since hiring the firm, the university has paid the firm about $490,000, according to disclosure reports initially filed by Copeland Lowery; university records showed $702,500 paid. As the earmarks started arriving, Young began receiving calls from other universities and from town and county governments across the Inland Empire of central and southern California. [...] "They were asking, 'Who are you using (in Washington)? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>doing</b> for you? How are they doing it for you?' I {{get a lot of}} those calls." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Let us {{recall the}} film, The Fall of Berlin. Here only Stalin acts. He issues orders in a hall {{in which there}} are many empty chairs. Only one man {{approaches}} him to report something to him – it is Poskrebyshev... And where is the military command? Where is the politburo? Where is the government? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>doing,</b> and with what are they engaged? There is nothing about them in the film. Stalin acts for everybody, he does not reckon with anyone. He asks no one for advice. Everything is shown to the people in this false light. Why? To surround Stalin with glory – contrary to the facts and contrary to historical truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mayor Michael Bloomberg said: [...] "Where does [...] come from?' I don't know. Do {{you really}} want every time they pass the basket in your church, and you throw a buck in, they run over and say, '...where do you come from? ... Where {{did you get this}} money?' No." [...] The TV news anchor Rick Sanchez said: [...] "...if you start going into who is giving money to whom ... {{you have to go to}} my church. You have got to go to Rome and start asking where the money is going into Rome.

6000|$|As {{much of this}} as Ambrose knew or {{understood}} he told to Stephen, {{who listened}} in {{a good deal of}} bewilderment, understanding very little, but with a strong instinct that his brother's love of learning was leading him into dangerous company.

60|$|And {{man does}} this. Countless men have glimpsed that other and truer order {{of truth and}} recoiled from it.

6000|$|Some more {{refreshment}} {{was offered}} {{her in a}} decided but not discourteous manner, and she partook of it, remembering that exhaustion might add to her perils.

50|$|The {{origins of}} the name 'Quelimane' are obscure.
