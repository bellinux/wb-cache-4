25|$|The US Preventive Service Task Force {{reported}} {{that not all}} children with a high BMI need to lose weight though. High BMI can identify a possible weight problem, but does not differentiate between fat or lean tissue. Additionally, BMI may mistakenly rule out some children <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> excess adipose tissue. It is therefore beneficial to supplement the reliability of a BMI diagnosis with additional screening tools such as adipose tissue or skin fold measurements.|$|E
25|$|B. pseudomallei is {{normally}} found in soil and surface water; {{a history of}} contact with soil or surface water is, therefore, almost invariable in patients with melioidosis; that said, the majority of patients <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> contact with infected soil suffer no ill effects. Even within an area, the distribution of B.pseudomallei within the soil can be extremely patchy, and competition with other Burkholderia species has been suggested as a possible reason. Contaminated ground water was implicated in one outbreak in northern Australia. Also implicated are severe weather events such as flooding tsunamis and typhoons.|$|E
25|$|This {{is below}} the {{replacement}} rate of 2.1, and also lower than in previous years. A 2002 study reported that urban women averaged 2.1 children per woman, with women living in rural areas having more children, at 2.9. As of the 1990s, both urban and rural women were averaging fewer children than previously. For those women <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> children, after former president Michelle Bachelet's childcare mandates, childcare centers that provide free services are four times more numerous. Nursing mothers also have {{the legal right to}} breastfeed during the workday. Women are less likely to seek divorces and marriage annulments.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} the quantitation and reconstruc-tion protocol on clinical tasks. The performance of standard clinical reconstruction procedures in discrimination tasks re-lated to the diagnosis of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was compared with the performance of a quantitative approach incorporating improved corrections for scatter, attenuation, in-trinsic spatial resolution, and distance-dependent spatial reso-lution. Methods: Seventeen normal controls (normal group), 56 subjects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not <b>have</b> dementia, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> memory problems, but <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not develop AD within 5 y of follow-up (questionable group), and 27 subjects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not <b>have</b> demen-tia, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> memory problems, and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> develop AD over the follow-up period (converter group) were considered in this study. 99 mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime SPECT and MRI studies were performed for each subject at baseline.

25|$|Since 1917, when King George V {{changed the}} name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, {{members of the royal family}} belong, either by birth or by marriage, to the House of Windsor. Senior titled members of the royal family do not usually use a surname, {{although}} since 1960 Mountbatten-Windsor, incorporating Prince Philip's adopted surname of Mountbatten, has been prescribed as a surname for Elizabeth II's direct descendants who do not have royal styles and titles, and it has sometimes been used when required for those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> such titles. In 2014 the royal family were regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the family among a group of people that they most associated with UK culture.|$|E
25|$|For further {{education}} {{there are two}} tertiary institutes and two national universities. The first ones are Instituto Superior Juan XXIII, (probably linked to the future UNISAL (standing for Universidad Salesiana) of the Salesians) and Instituto Avanza (tertiary institute of humanities). National Universities are Facultad Regional Bahía Blanca Universidad Tecnológica Nacional, devoted mainly to exact sciences and intended for students <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a job for making a living, with formal activities in the evening; and Universidad Nacional del Sur (National University of the South), founded in January 1956. This last one has associated internationally known institutes of research in biological, biochemical and technological sciences such as INIBIB and Instituto de Oceanografia, among others. Both national universities are free of tuition fees for all students.|$|E
25|$|All {{statistical}} hypothesis tests have a probability of making type I and type II errors. For example, all blood tests for a disease will falsely detect {{the disease in}} some proportion of people who don't have it, and will fail to detect the disease in some proportion of people <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> it. A test's probability of making a type I error is denoted by α. A test's probability of making a type II error is denoted by β. These error rates are traded off against each other: for any given sample set, the effort to reduce one type of error generally results in increasing the other type of error. For a given test, {{the only way to}} reduce both error rates is to increase the sample size, and this may not be feasible.|$|E

25|$|Further, those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> {{higher levels}} of {{education}} often pursue job opportunities in larger cities, particularly Ottawa or even Montreal, which can create a barrier to economic development in their home communities. As well, even today many students of Franco-Ontarian background are still educated in anglophone schools. This {{has the effect of}} reducing the use of French as a first language in the province, and thereby limiting the growth of the Franco-Ontarian community; in the Canada 2006 Census, for example, 40 per cent of residents of Sudbury reported themselves as able to speak or understand French, but only 16 per cent of the city's population reported actually using the French language in their daily lives and barely one per cent of the city's population reported themselves as being exclusively francophone.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the game model is relevant. Alexander Gambotto-Burke from The Guardian {{described}} it as [...] "an astonishingly sophisticated simulation of the Israel/Palestine conflict". In a column published in July 2009, Steven Poole claimed that the game [...] "provides a roughly accurate model {{of the political and}} security options on both sides of an actual conflict", and that it was rightly praised. Poole pointed out the game's most educational side is that the intentions of the player do not always lead to the expected outcome. According to him, PeaceMaker makes the player understand that [...] "even people <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> power cannot control everything, and they, too, can be at the mercy of events". The Globe and Mail’s Marc MacKinnon agreed, stating that [...] "it gives players a feel for the impossibility of Mahmoud Abbas and Ehud Olmert’s jobs".|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1960s, French Canadians in Quebec have {{generally}} used Québécois (masculine) or Québécoise (feminine) {{to express their}} cultural and national identity, rather than Canadien français and Canadienne française. Francophones who self-identify as Québécois {{and do not have}} French-Canadian ancestry may not identify as [...] "French Canadian" [...] (Canadien or Canadien français). Those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> French or French-Canadian ancestry, but who support Quebec sovereignty, often find Canadien français to be archaic or even pejorative. This {{is a reflection of the}} strong social, cultural, and political ties that most Quebeckers of French-Canadian origin, who constitute a majority of francophone Quebecers, maintain within Quebec. It has given Québécois an ambiguous meaning which has often played out in political issues, as all public institutions attached to the Government of Quebec refer to all Quebec citizens, regardless of their language or their cultural heritage, as Québécois.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, the Court {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} not allowing tribes to prosecute nonmembers, those nonmembers would escape prosecution altogether for criminal activity engaged in within tribal boundaries. The federal government retains the power to prosecute felonies that take place on reservations. Tribes retain the power to expel undesirable persons. Tribal authorities may still arrest the nonmember and detain him until he can be handed over to authorities <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> the power to prosecute the nonmember. The tribe pointed out that state authorities can lack the power to prosecute crimes committed by nonmembers on reservations; Arizona, for instance, expressly disclaims this prosecutorial authority. But Congress has allowed states to assume this power, and Arizona is free to take up Congress's invitation. Finally, if the tribes still believed that there remained a [...] "jurisdictional void," [...] despite these options, they could persuade Congress {{to give it to}} them.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not known}} whether PTS {{increase}} the likelihood of developing PTE. Early PTS, while not necessarily epileptic in nature, are associated with a higher risk of PTE. However, PTS do not indicate that development of epilepsy is certain to occur, {{and it is difficult to}} isolate PTS from severity of injury as a factor in PTE development. About 3% of patients with no early seizures develop late PTE; this number is 25% in those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> early PTS, and the distinction is greater if other risk factors for developing PTE are excluded. [...] Seizures that occur immediately after an insult are commonly believed not to confer an increased risk of recurring seizures, but evidence from at least one study has suggested that both immediate and early seizures may be risk factors for late seizures. [...] Early seizures may be less of a predictor for PTE in children; while as many as a third of adults with early seizures develop PTE, the portion of children with early PTS who have late seizures is less than one fifth in children and may be as low as one tenth. [...] The incidence of late seizures is about half that in adults with comparable injuries.|$|E
