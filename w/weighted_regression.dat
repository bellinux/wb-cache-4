5000|$|Spatial {{regression}} methods capture spatial dependency in regression analysis, avoiding statistical {{problems such}} as unstable parameters and unreliable significance tests, {{as well as providing}} information on spatial relationships among the variables involved. Depending on the specific technique, spatial dependency can enter the regression model as relationships between the independent variables and the dependent, between the dependent variables and a spatial lag of itself, or in the error terms. Geographically <b>weighted</b> <b>regression</b> (GWR) is a local version of spatial regression that generates parameters disaggregated by the spatial units of analysis. [...] This allows assessment of the spatial heterogeneity in the estimated relationships between the independent and dependent variables. The use of Bayesian hierarchical modeling in conjunction with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have recently shown to be effective in modeling complex relationships using Poisson-Gamma-CAR, Poisson-lognormal-SAR, or Overdispersed logit models. Spatial stochastic processes, such as Gaussian processes are also increasingly being deployed in spatial regression analysis. Model-based versions of GWR, known as spatially varying coefficient models have been applied to conduct Bayesian inference. Spatial stochastic process can become computationally effective and scalable Gaussian process models, such as Gaussian Predictive Processes [...] and Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes (NNGP).|$|E

Using the single-tree biomass data of three large samples, the bias correction in logarithmic regression for non-linear models was studied and comparison between logarithmic regression and <b>weighted</b> <b>regression</b> was discussed in this paper. Firstly, the imminent cause producing bias in logarithmic regression was analyzed, and a new correction factor was presented with which three commonly used bias correction factors were examined together, and {{the results showed that}} the correction factors presented here and derived by Baskerville (1972) should be recommended, which could insure the corrected model to be asymptotically consistent with that fitted by <b>weighted</b> <b>regression.</b> Secondly, the fitting results of <b>weighted</b> <b>regression</b> for non-linear models, using the weight function based on residual errors of the model estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) and the general weight function (w= 1 /&#x 192;(x) 2) presented by Zeng (1998) respectively, were compared with each other that showed two weight functions worked well and the general function was more applicable.

30|$|To {{handle this}} situation, two {{approaches}} were used; {{the use of}} <b>weighted</b> linear <b>regression</b> {{and the use of}} polynomial equations (Nakov et al. 2014, Korany et al. 2013). The latter is only applied in the case of non-linear or curved data sets, where the quadratic regression y[*]=[*]a[*]+[*]bx[*]+[*]cx 2 is the most preferable. However, higher order polynomial equations greater than quadratic are generally not preferred (Singtoroj et al. 2006). The data set generated in the bioanalytical method is linear and, therefore, the most commonly used method is the <b>weighted</b> linear <b>regression.</b> The choice of weighting factor in the <b>weighted</b> linear <b>regression</b> evaluated in the pre-validation stage is based on evaluating the % relative error (% RE) and the calibration model on the test of homoscedasticity (Almeida et al. 2002).|$|R

In Section 5, the three regression methods: mean regression, classic quantile <b>regression</b> and proposed <b>weighted</b> quantile <b>regression,</b> are applied to the real-life examples: the Buffalo snowfall (Subsection 1.1) and CO 2 emission (Subsection 1.2).
