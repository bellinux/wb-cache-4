5|$|A320 Enhanced family (or A320E family) is {{the working}} title {{for a series}} of {{improvements}} to the A320 family. The improvements include engine improvements, aerodynamic refinements– such as adding large curved <b>winglets</b> (Sharklets), weight savings, and a new cabin design.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{anticipated}} efficiency gains and development work, Airbus {{announced that the}} new <b>winglets</b> will not be offered to customers, claiming that {{the weight of the}} modifications required would negate any aerodynamic benefits. Instead, on 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.|$|E
5|$|The Airbus A330-800neo {{will retain}} the {{fuselage}} {{length of the}} A330-200, with cabin optimisation allowing up to six additional seats. It will feature new Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines with a 10:1 bypass delivering , improved aerodynamics including A350-style <b>winglets</b> increasing the span by 3.7m to 64m, and is scheduled to enter service in early 2018.

40|$|AbstractThe tip leakage flow has an {{important}} influence {{on the performance of}} transonic compressor. Blade tip <b>winglet</b> has been proved to be an effective method to control the tip leakage flow in compressor, while the physical mechanisms of blade tip <b>winglet</b> have been poorly understood. A numerical study for a highly loaded transonic compressor rotor has been conducted to understand the effect of varying the location of blade tip <b>winglet</b> on the performance of the rotor. Two kinds of tip <b>winglet</b> were designed and investigated. The effects of blade tip <b>winglet</b> on the compressor overall performance, stability and tip flow structure were presented and discussed. It is found that the interaction of the tip <b>winglet</b> with the flow in the tip region is different when the <b>winglet</b> is located at suction-side or pressure-side of the blade tip. Results indicate that the suction-side <b>winglet</b> (SW) is ineffective to improve the performance of compressor rotor. In addition, a significant stall range extension equivalent to 33. 74 % with a very small penalty in efficiency can be obtained by the pressure-side <b>winglet</b> (PW). An attempt has been made to explain the fundamental mechanisms of blade tip <b>winglet</b> in detail...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{primarily}} aims {{to investigate}} the aerodynamic characteristics of a small Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) with different blade tip configurations to enhance power generation efficiency. To understand the flow behavior at the tip and to reduce the induced drag due to tip vortex, three different blade configurations (upwind <b>winglet,</b> downwind <b>winglet</b> and blade without a <b>winglet)</b> were designed, manufactured and tested under a range of wind speeds and yaw angles. The {{results show that the}} <b>winglet</b> has significant effect on the aerodynamic performance of the wind turbine blade used for domestic scale wind generator. The results indicated an increase of lift-to-drag ratio with the upwind <b>winglet</b> by around 26 % compared to a straight blade with no <b>winglet</b> whereas the downwind <b>winglet</b> results in a decrease of lift-to-drag ratio about 27 %...|$|R
5|$|The {{origins of}} insect flight remain obscure, since the {{earliest}} winged insects currently known {{appear to have}} been capable fliers. Some extinct insects had an additional pair of <b>winglets</b> attaching to the first segment of the thorax, for a total of three pairs. As of 2009, no evidence suggests the insects were a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved to have wings.|$|E
5|$|An-188: A {{program to}} develop this variant was {{launched}} at the 2015 Paris Air Show. This variant will essentially be a four jet engine powered heavy-medium transport with modernized NATO- compatible western cockpit, slightly enlarged wings, <b>winglets</b> and aerial refueling capabilities. The An-188 is intended {{to fill the gap}} between a C-130 and C-17 while being a direct competitor to the A400M. Plans include incorporating a western engine option (as well as a Ukrainian one) to appeal to western markets and reduce dependency on eastern markets.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, DC-10 and L-1011 models were {{approaching}} retirement age, prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs. McDonnell Douglas {{was working on}} the MD-11, a stretched and upgraded successor of the DC-10, while Airbus was developing its A330 and A340. In 1986, Boeing unveiled proposals for an enlarged 767, tentatively named 767-X, to target the replacement market for first-generation wide-bodies such as the DC-10, and to complement existing 767 and 747 models in the company lineup. The initial proposal featured a longer fuselage and larger wings than the existing 767, along with <b>winglets.</b> Later plans expanded the fuselage cross-section but retained the existing 767 flight deck, nose, and other elements.|$|E
50|$|At {{least three}} {{different}} <b>winglet</b> designs {{have been produced}} for the ASW-20, including a NASA <b>winglet</b> fitted to the Centrair gliders (FP), a design by Peter Masak, and a second generation <b>winglet</b> designed by Prof. Mark D. Maughmer of Penn State University(USA).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This work {{describes}} the aerodynamic characteristic for aircraft wing model {{with and without}} bird feather like <b>winglet.</b> The aerofoil used to construct the whole structure is NACA 65 3 - 218 Rectangular wing and this aerofoil {{has been used to}} compare the result with previous research using <b>winglet.</b> The model of the rectangular wing with bird feather like <b>winglet</b> has been fabricated using polystyrene before design using CATIA P 3 V 5 R 13 software and finally fabricated in wood. The experimental analysis for the aerodynamic characteristic for rectangular wing without <b>winglet,</b> wing with horizontal <b>winglet</b> and wing with 60 degree inclination <b>winglet</b> for Reynolds number 1. 66 × 10 5, 2. 08 × 10 5 and 2. 50 × 10 5 have been carried out in open loop low speed wind tunnel at the Aerodynamics laboratory in Universiti Putra Malaysia. The experimental result shows 25 - 30 % reduction in drag coefficient and 10 - 20 % increase in lift coefficient by using bird feather like <b>winglet</b> for angle of attack of 8 degree.

40|$|For {{identical}} {{increases in}} bending moment, a <b>winglet</b> provides a greater gain in induced efficiency than tip extension. <b>Winglet</b> toe angle allows design trades between efficiency and root moment. A <b>winglet</b> shows the greatest benefit when the wing loads are heavy near the tip. Washout diminishes {{the benefit of}} either tip modification, and the gain in induced efficiency becomes a function of lift coefficient; thus, heavy wing loadings obtain the greatest benefit from a <b>winglet,</b> and low-speed performance is enhanced even more than cruise performance. Both induced efficiency and bending moment increase with <b>winglet</b> length and outward cant. The benefit of a <b>winglet</b> relative to a tip extension is greatest for a nearly vertical <b>winglet.</b> Root bending moment {{is proportional to the}} minimum weight of bending material required in the wing; thus, it is a valid index of the impact of tip modifications on a new wing design...|$|R
5|$|Epicoxal hypothesis: This theory {{suggested}} that a possible origin for insect wings {{might have been the}} movable abdominal gills found in many aquatic insects, such as on naiads of mayflies. According to this theory these tracheal gills, which started their way as exits of the respiratory system and over time were modified into locomotive purposes, eventually developed into wings. The tracheal gills are equipped with little <b>winglets</b> that perpetually vibrate and have their own tiny straight muscles.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Airbus tested three {{styles of}} winglet {{intended}} {{to counteract the}} wing's induced drag and wingtip vortices more effectively than the previous wingtip fence. The first design type to be tested was developed by Airbus and was based on work done by the AWIATOR programme. The second type of winglet incorporated a more blended design and was designed by Winglet Technology, a company based in Wichita, Kansas. Two aircraft {{were used in the}} flight test evaluation campaign– the prototype A320, which had been retained by Airbus for testing, and a new build aircraft which was fitted with both types of <b>winglets</b> before it was delivered to JetBlue.|$|E
25|$|Wingtip devices or <b>winglets</b> {{are usually}} {{intended}} {{to improve the}} efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft. The concept of <b>winglets</b> originated in the late 19th century, but the idea remained on the drawing board. Throughout the 1970s {{when the price of}} aviation fuel started spiraling upward, NASA aeronautical engineer Richard Whitcomb began investigating and studying the feasibility of <b>winglets</b> in order to improve overall aerodynamics and reduce drag on aircraft. Whitcomb's tests finally culminated with the first successful test flight of his attached <b>winglets</b> on a KC-135 Stratotanker on July 24, 1979.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} reveal the science of adding <b>winglet</b> for Active aircraft, the paper calculates the {{aerodynamic}} efficiency of a wing added <b>winglet</b> using CFD technology, Aerodynamic benefit of the wing added <b>winglet</b> reaches the maximum when the angle of attack is 2 degree, the lift and drag reduction rate are 21. 07 % and 43. 56 % respectively. The results show {{that it is a}} good choice to add <b>winglet</b> for aircraft to reduce operation cost and fuel consumption...|$|R
5000|$|The final {{aerodynamic}} {{improvements to}} the Model 60 included {{the creation of the}} distinctive [...] "ogive" [...] <b>winglet</b> trailing edge. This lengthening of the chord near the interface of the <b>winglet</b> and the wing improved the interaction of the wing’s pressure spike with the <b>winglet’s</b> pressure spike. The result was a significant lowering of the drag in this area and a significant improvement of the wing's efficiency. On the prior “Longhorn” wing the interference between the <b>winglet</b> and the wing nearly canceled the effects of the <b>winglet.</b> The single ventral fin was also replaced with two ventral fins that Learjet called [...] "Delta Fins" [...] to improve stall characteristics and promote aerodynamic stability.|$|R
5000|$|The new <b>winglet</b> is 9 ft high. Other {{improvements}} {{include a}} re-contoured tail cone, revised {{auxiliary power unit}} inlet and exhaust, aft-body vortex generators removal and other small aerodynamic improvements. Aviation Partners offers a similar [...] "Split-Tip Scimitar" [...] <b>winglet</b> for previous 737NGs. It resembles a three-way hybrid between a blended <b>winglet,</b> wingtip fence, and raked wingtip.|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study has}} been conducted to explore {{the effect of a}} pressure-side <b>winglet</b> on the flow and heat transfer over a blade tip. Calculations are performed for both a flat tip and a squealer tip. The <b>winglet</b> {{is in the form of}} a flat extension, and is shaped in the axial chord direction to have the maximum thickness at the chord location, where the pressure difference is the largest between the pressure and suction sides. For the flat tip, the pressure-side <b>winglet</b> exhibits a significant reduction in the leakage flow strength. The low heat transfer coefficient &# 8220;sweet-spot&# 8221; region is larger with the pressure-side <b>winglet,</b> and lower heat transfer coefficients are also observed along the pressure side of the blade. For the flat tip, the <b>winglet</b> reduces the heat transfer coefficient locally by as much as 30 %, while the average heat transfer coefficient is reduced by about 7 %. In the presence of a squealer, the role of the <b>winglet</b> decreases significantly, and a 5 % reduction in the pressure loss coefficient is achieved with the <b>winglet</b> with virtually no reduction in the average heat transfer coefficient. On the other hand, the suction-side squealer with constant width <b>winglet</b> shows lower heat transfer (reduction of 5. 5 %) and pressure loss coefficient (reduction of 26 %) than its baseline counterpart. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Numerical {{simulations}} {{were carried}} out to investigate the performance of plane and curved rectangular <b>winglet</b> type vortex generators (VGs). Effects of shape of the VGs on heat transfer enhancement were evaluated using dimensionless numbers- j/j 0, f/f 0 and h =(j/j 0) /(f/f 0). The results showed that curved <b>winglet</b> type VGs have better heat transfer enhancement than plain <b>winglet</b> type in both laminar and turbulent flow regions. The flow resistance is also lower in case of curved <b>winglet</b> type than corresponding plane <b>winglet</b> VGs. The best results for heat transfer enhancement is obtained at high Reynolds number values (Re> 10000) by using VGs. The processes in solving the simulation consist of modeling and meshing the basic geometry of rectangular channel with VGs using the package ANSYS ICEM CFD 14. 0. Then the boundary condition will be set according to the experimental data available from the literature. Finally result has been examined in CFD-Post. This work presents a numerically study on the mean Nusselt number, friction factor and heat enhancement characteristics in a rectangular channel having a pair of <b>winglet</b> type VGs under uniform heat flux of 416. 67 W/m 2.

40|$|A {{transonic}} {{model and}} a low-speed model were flutter {{tested in the}} Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel at Mach numbers up to 0. 90. Transonic flutter boundaries were measured for 10 different model configurations, which included variations in wing fuel, nacelle pylon stiffness, and wingtip configuration. The <b>winglet</b> effects were evaluated by testing the transonic model, having a specific wing fuel and nacelle pylon stiffness, with each of three wingtips, a nonimal tip, a <b>winglet,</b> and a nominal tip ballasted to simulate the <b>winglet</b> mass. The addition of the <b>winglet</b> substantially reduced the flutter speed of the wing at transonic Mach numbers. The <b>winglet</b> effect was configuration-dependent and was primarily due to <b>winglet</b> aerodynamics rather than mass. Flutter analyses using modified strip-theory aerodynamics (experimentally weighted) correlated reasonably well with test results. The four transonic flutter mechanisms predicted by analysis were obtained experimentally. The analysis satisfactorily predicted the mass-density-ratio effects on subsonic flutter obtained using the low-speed model. Additional analyses were made to determine the flutter sensitivity to several parameters at transonic speeds...|$|R
50|$|A blended <b>winglet</b> is {{attached}} to the wing with smooth curve instead of a sharp angle and is intended to reduce interference drag at the wing/winglet junction.

The measured transonic flutter speed boundary for each wingtip configuration had roughly the same shape with a minimum flutter speed near M= 0. 82.

In {{contrast to the}} ordinary aircraft configurations, this kind of configuration can totally eliminate the drag resulted from fuselage, bringing many advantages such as simple structure, compact scale, high load capability. But its small aspect ratio makes the induced drag higher. Through wind tunnel experiments, it is discovered that a type of sweepback fin-shaped <b>winglet</b> can efficiently reduce the induced drag {{of this kind of}} aircraft. When this <b>winglet</b> is mounted to a model in wind tunnel experiment, the maximal ratio of lift to drag of the model can be increased by 75 % as compared with the model without <b>winglet</b> at the speed of 30 m/s, and reached 15 at the speed of 50 m/s. In order to investigate the performance of this aircraft with <b>winglet</b> at low speed, test flights were processed. The results of test flights not only verify the conclusions of experiments in wind tunnel but also indicate that the load capability of the aircraft with <b>winglet</b> is increased and its lateral stability is even better than that of the aircraft without <b>winglet...</b>|$|R
