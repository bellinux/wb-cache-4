500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was happy}} with his players after they had come from behind to win the match: [...] "It was a {{difficult}} game. We were controlling the game, passing the ball around and then <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and had to work really hard to get back. They played well, but I think we controlled the game. To score three goals is not easy. I can {{say that we are}} very happy now with this trophy. Now is the time to enjoy our victory." [...] With five days of the transfer window left, Benítez refused to speculate on whether Liverpool would sign Michael Owen, stating, [...] "I like good players, {{we have a lot of}} them here." ...|$|E
500|$|The Oxford boat club {{president}} Andy Hall said [...] "the {{water was}} round our ankles... <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> {{in doing that}} warm-up over part of the course... {{there was so much}} water on board that I thought 'God, we're going to sink.' [...] It was really hopeless after that." [...] In losing the race, Hall became the first Oxonian to lose four Boat Races in the 20th century. [...] Jim Railton, writing in The Times summarised the race: [...] "Cambridge beat the Tideway and the Tideway beat Oxford." [...] According to Dickie Burnell, [...] "to say that the race was soon over would be a mis-statement. [...] It never really began." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{preparing}} {{it on his}} Logic recording software, Bilal recorded A Love Surreal in five months, {{which he}} said was the fastest he had recorded an album. Recording sessions for the album took place at Brooklyn Recording and Breeding Grounds Studio in Brooklyn, New York; Lalabelle Music and Lamont Caldwell's Bedroom in Clifton, New Jersey; Pine Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Prime Rib Productions and The Krusty Lab in Los Angeles, California. He recorded his vocals at a beach-side studio in Los Angeles. Bilal originally intended to record A Love Surreal as an extended play {{when he entered the}} studio, but, according to him, [...] "it was just so easy that the music started to flow ... by the fifth day we were like 'damn, <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and wrote five extra songs". He worked with most of the recording crew from Airtight's Revenge and produced 10 of the album's 14 songs. Bilal viewed that his role as a producer had progressed from his 2001 debut 1st Born Second to A Love Surreal, which he felt best conveyed his vision for the album's sound.|$|E

500|$|In the {{original}} airing of this episode, Mrs. Krabappel names several different diseases Bart has faked {{in order to}} get out of taking his English test, one of which is Tourette's syndrome. After Bart claims that he is not over it, he begins barking and snarling and mutters, [...] "Shove it, witch!" [...] This scene garnered many complaints from people who thought it was tasteless of the writers to make fun of an actual condition and Joshua Smith, a boy in Renton, Washington began seeking legal action. Smith demanded that they [...] "not repeat the episode and have Bart Simpson befriend somebody with Tourette's on the show" [...] and include an apology from Bart at the end. Executive producer Mike Reiss replied with an apology saying [...] "We kind of feel like <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> this time. We felt bad about this." [...] In a move that was unprecedented for the show, the producers agreed to remove the scene from future broadcasts. However, Smith's other requests went unfulfilled. In the version of the episode released on the season four DVD boxset, the part with Bart demonstrating his supposed Tourette's syndrome to Mrs. Krabappel was kept intact, but Krabappel's line about Bart having [...] "...that unfortunate bout of Tourette's syndrome" [...] was replaced with [...] "...that unfortunate bout of rabies." ...|$|E
500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1978, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) had {{prepared}} {{a draft of}} its final report, concluding that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted as the lone assassin. However, after evidence from the Dictabelt recording was made available, the HSCA quickly reversed its conclusion and declared that a second gunman had fired the third of four shots heard. HSCA chef counsel G. Robert Blakey later said, [...] "If the acoustics come out that <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> somewhere, I think that would end it." [...] Despite serious criticism of the scientific evidence and the HSCA's conclusions, speculation regarding the Dictabelt {{and the possibility of}} a second gunman persisted.|$|E

2500|$|Criticism {{continued}} to be made following Wurst's victory. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin posted on social networking service Twitter that the result [...] "showed supporters of European integration their European future: a bearded girl." [...] Another Russian politician, the ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, proclaimed [...] "There's no limit to our outrage. It's the end of Europe", later adding that [...] "Fifty years ago the Soviet army occupied Austria. <b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in freeing Austria. We should have stayed." [...] Deputy leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Valery Rashkin, announced that [...] "The last Eurovision results exhausted our patience... We cannot tolerate this endless madness", calling for the foundation of an alternative, The Voice of Eurasia, in which Russia and its neighbouring allies could compete. The Russian Orthodox Church condemned Wurst's victory, with Vladimir Legoyda, chairman of the church's information department, describing it as [...] "yet one more step in {{the rejection of the}} Christian identity of European culture", reflecting an attempt to [...] "reinforce new cultural norms". A social media campaign involved Russian men shaving off their beards in protest at Wurst's victory; those taking part included broadcaster Andrey Malakhov and rapper Aleksander [...] "ST" [...] Stepanov.|$|E
2500|$|After the match, Alex Ferguson praised Teddy Sheringham for his {{immediate}} impact after being brought on to replace Keane, saying: [...] "Teddy was magnificent. He has proved a point today. He {{was the key}} to victory." [...] He also complimented David Beckham on his performance in central midfield after Keane's withdrawal: [...] "Beckham took over Keane's role and was absolutely magnificent... People say that going to Barcelona without Roy Keane will be a major hurdle, but I don't think so now." [...] Ryan Giggs recognised the importance of scoring the first goal early in the game, saying: [...] "It helped getting the early goal then the second. It was hard for Newcastle {{to get back into the}} game with the weather like that. After the quick goal we could relax and hit Newcastle on the break." [...] Meanwhile, Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit was pleased with the effort his players had put in, but bemoaned their mistakes allowing Manchester United an easy victory: [...] "We were punished for our mistakes. The effort was right. The players worked hard and I can't ask for more, but every time we were on top <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and that cost us two goals. In the end we had to be thankful they did not get three, four or five." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{case was}} stated {{in his usual}} nervous {{language}} by Mr. Chamberlain a few months later.(16) “When we came into office,” (M13) he said, “we were all agreed that the original annexation was a mistake, that it ought never to have been made; and there arose the question could it then be undone? We were in possession of information {{to the effect that}} the great majority {{of the people of the}} Transvaal were reconciled to annexation; we were told that if we reversed the decision of the late government, there would be a great probability of civil war and anarchy; and acting upon these representations, we decided that we could not recommend the Queen to relinquish her sovereignty. But we assured the Boers that we would take the earliest opportunity of granting to them the freest and most complete local institutions compatible with the welfare of South Africa. It is easy to be wise after the event. It is easy to see now that we were wrong in so deciding. I frankly admit <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> Whatever the risk was, and I believe it was a great risk, of civil war and anarchy in the Transvaal, it was not so great a danger as that we actually incurred by maintaining the wrong of our predecessors.” Such was the language used by Mr. Chamberlain after special consultation with Lord Kimberley. With characteristic tenacity and that aversion ever to yield even the smallest point, which comes to a man saturated with the habit of a lifetime of debate, Mr. Gladstone wrote to Mr. Chamberlain (June 8, 1881): “I have read with pleasure what you say of the Transvaal. Yet I am not prepared, for myself, to concede that <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in not advising a revocation of the annexation when we came in.” ...|$|E
