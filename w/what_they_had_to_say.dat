25|$|And no {{one could}} have been more deeply {{attached}} to the people of Wyoming. Cliff genuinely liked other people. He was interested in their backgrounds, their work, their families, and their opinions. Those thousands of different people he met from all over Wyoming, Washington D. C., and beyond, knew when he looked them in the eye that there was nothing practiced nor obligatory about his interest in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rhode-Island, July 26. This Day, 26 of the Pirates {{taken by}} his Majesty Ship the Greyhound, Captain Solgard, were {{executed}} here. Some of them delivered <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in writing, {{and most of}} them said something at the Place of Execution, advising all People, young ones especially, to take warning by their unhappy Fate, and to avoid the crimes that brought them to it. Their black Flag, under which they had committed abundance of Pyracies and Murders, was affix'd to one Corner of the Gallows. It had in it the Portraiture of Death, with an Hour-Glass in one Hand, and a Dart in the other, striking into a Heart, and three Drops of Blood delineated as falling from it. This Flag they called Old Roger, and us'd to say, They would live and die under it.|$|E
500|$|After {{dinner the}} guests signed the {{visitors}} book, {{after which the}} prince—accompanied by Coventry, Williams and the two Somersets—received Lycett Green and the other accusers. After hearing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> the prince dismissed all except Coventry and Williams, and called for Gordon-Cumming, who told Edward that the accusation was [...] "foul and abominable"; the prince pointed out that [...] "there are five accusers against you". Gordon-Cumming then withdrew while the royal party discussed what the next steps would be. He returned {{after half an hour}} to find just the two courtiers, who urged him to sign a document that they had drafted. Under pressure, and still denying the accusations, Gordon-Cumming signed the document without knowing who else would sign it afterwards.|$|E
60|$|In {{this manner}} did the night pass, in weariness and anxiety. Little was said, and for hours scarce a limb was moved, {{in the group}} that {{clustered}} around the mess-chest. As the signs of day appeared, however, every faculty was keenly awake, to catch {{the first signs of}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> hope, or the first certainty of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fear.|$|R

500|$|Frederick {{wrote to}} Elgin in January 1895 that Karim was deeply unpopular in the Household, {{and that he}} {{occupied}} [...] "very much {{the same position as}} John Brown used to". Princesses Louise and Beatrice, Prince Henry of Battenberg, Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Secretary of State for India Henry Fowler had all raised concerns about Karim with the Queen, who [...] "refused to listen to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> but was very angry, so as you see the Munshi is a sort of pet, like a dog or cat which the Queen will not willingly give up". Elgin was warned by both Ponsonby and the India Office that the Queen gave his letters to the Munshi to read, and that consequently his correspondence to her should not be of a confidential nature. Victoria's advisors feared Karim's association with Rafiuddin Ahmed, an Indian political activist resident in London who was connected to the Muslim Patriotic League. They suspected that Ahmed extracted confidential information from Karim to pass onto the Amir of Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman Khan. There is no indication that these fears were well-founded, or that the Munshi was ever indiscreet.|$|E
2500|$|Library {{activists in}} the 1930s {{pressured}} the American Library Association to be more responsive to issues put forth by young members involved with issues such as peace, segregation, library unions and intellectual freedom. [...] In 1931, the Junior Members Round Table (JMRT) was formed to provide a voice for the younger members of the ALA, but much of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> resurfaced in the social responsibility movement to come years later. [...] During this period, the first Library Bill of Rights (LBR) was drafted by Forrest Spaulding to set a standard against censorship and {{was adopted by the}} ALA in 1939. [...] This has been recognized as the moment defining modern librarianship as a profession committed to intellectual freedom and the right to read over government dictates. [...] The ALA formed the Staff Organization's Round Table in 1936 and the Library Unions Round Table in 1940.|$|E
60|$|Neither of the pair, however, {{appeared}} cheerful, and Weston's {{face grew}} hard {{when he heard}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about the mine.|$|E

60|$|When {{the boys}} {{got back to}} the hotel they found Dick Rover looking for them. He listened in {{surprise}} to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
60|$|The youths {{went back}} to the auto and told of their adventure. Sam and the girls listened with {{interest}} to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
60|$|They silenced his objections, {{and sent}} for Grenfell, who {{appeared}} disconcerted {{for a moment}} when he heard <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Then he laughed somewhat harshly.|$|E

60|$|In {{the morning}} Dave insisted upon talking the matter over with Sam Barringford. They found the old hunter ready enough {{to listen to}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
60|$|Anyhow, {{there they}} were in a {{first-class}} carriage; and there was the collector at the door, looking indignantly at their second-class tickets, and waiting to hear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for themselves.|$|E
60|$|So {{the boys}} went {{together}} up to Wallace's room. They {{found him in}} his alcove as before. They advanced to the table, and Wallace looked {{up to them to}} hear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E

60|$|Randy and Earl both spoke earnestly, {{and it was}} {{not their}} fault that <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> did not take effect. But Fred Dobson was both wild and reckless, and he shook his head.|$|E
60|$|They {{were shown}} {{into the inner}} office, where a gray-haired gentleman listened gravely to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Then he took the salvage claim from Jordan, and laid it beneath a pile of other papers.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not long}} before the migratory medical man was brought to the Princess. There was nothing the matter with her, but she liked to meet with persons of skill and {{learning}} to hear <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
