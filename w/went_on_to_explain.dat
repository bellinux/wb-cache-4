5|$|Up to this point, Australia's {{performances}} {{had been}} poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators. During one meeting, a cross-country representative {{asked for the}} selection of six athletes, prompting the selection committee chairman to interject. The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed, and <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> that a dog was required to find the athletes after they {{got lost in the}} snow. The majority of his colleagues burst into laughter.|$|E
5|$|John Cena and Chris Jericho were {{involved}} in the main rivalry on the Raw brand over the World Heavyweight Championship. At WWE's November Survivor Series, Cena returned to the WWE after a legitimate neck injury (that he sustained at SummerSlam) and defeated Jericho to win the championship. On the November 24 episode of Raw, Jericho defeated Randy Orton and Batista in a Triple Threat match to earn a title match against Cena at Armageddon. Later that night, Chris Jericho attempted to steal Cena's thunder, claiming that he plans on winning back the title at Armageddon. When World Champion, John Cena could even make his much anticipated return to Raw, he then gave Jericho an opportunity to confront him face-to-face, Cena explained the difference between himself and Jericho, stating that he actually cares about the many members of the WWE Universe. After Jericho once again stated his intention to beat Cena at Armageddon and continued to belittle the WWE Universe, Cena snapped. He proceeded to brutalize Jericho, throwing him against the announce table, bludgeoning him with the steel stairs and locking him into an STFU. On the following week's episode of Raw, Jericho made his presence known {{in much the same way}} as Cena did the week before, addressing the audience as he made his way through the crowd down to the ring. The difference however, was that while Cena welcomed his fans, Jericho made pains to ignore them. He then <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> his resentment toward Cena, stating that while away from the WWE since August 2005, Jericho's son grew to be a fan, not of his father, but of John Cena. Now, Jericho hopes to show his son and all of the WWE what a real hero is, by beating Cena for the World Heavyweight Title at Armageddon. Later that night, Cena fought Kane in Raw's main event. Though Jericho attempted to become involved, Cena managed to fight off and then go on to defeat Kane. After the match, Cena chased Jericho, who was attempting to escape. The tables turned, however, when Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Manu emerged to attack Cena, allowing Jericho to lock Cena in the Walls of Jericho.|$|E

25|$|The report - {{in which}} the {{frequent}} mention of the police reflected the magazine's concerns as expressed by Stancer - <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> that the race had been banned by the NCU and the RTTC but {{that there had been}} no incidents other than a lorry backing on to the course. Fifteen riders finished and all those involved in the race were expelled from the NCU. Stallard was banned for life for refusing to account for himself to the NCU's management.|$|E
25|$|The main {{distinction}} between the MCA and AEDPA, the Court <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain,</b> was that AEDPA applies in practice to those prisoners serving a sentence after having been tried in open court and whose sentences have been upheld on direct appeal, whereas the MCA suspends {{the application of the}} writ to those detainees whose guilt has not yet been legally determined. In other words, the comparison to AEDPA was found by the majority to be misplaced, in that AEDPA's limitations on habeas review stemmed from cases that had already been to trial, whereas the cases involving MCA had not been to trial and therefore habeas review would have been appropriate.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the fifth}} episode {{received}} harsh criticism from Japanese and Western audiences {{due to its}} poor animation style compared to the previous four episodes. Dragon Ball Kai and Resurrection 'F producer Norihiro Hayashida felt that the criticism was overblown. He said that people were criticizing the entire series based on a few bad sequences that were done by new animators. He <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> a quality decline in the anime industry that he believes {{is the result of}} studios cutting time given for post-production and not allowing for reviews of the final product. Toei Animation improved the animation for episode five's Blu-ray and DVD release.|$|E

25|$|On March 12, 2011, Dana White {{revealed}} that Zuffa had purchased Strikeforce. White <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> that Strikeforce will operate {{as an independent}} promotion, and that Scott Coker will continue to run the promotion. Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker announced the return of Fedor Emelianenko on an unspecified July or August event and said that Zuffa-owned company would continue to co-promote with M-1 Global. Following the purchase, the UFC signed many of Strikeforce's top stars and champions, such as Jason Miller, Nick Diaz, Dan Henderson, Alistair Overeem, and Cung Le. Under Zuffa's ownership, Strikeforce made minor changes, including adopting the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts in full, closing the promotion's men's weight classes below lightweight, and ceasing promotion of amateur undercard bouts. After an extension was reached to continue Strikeforce through 2012, the promotion's heavyweight division (sans Heavyweight Grand Prix finalists) was merged into the UFC, and the promotion's Challengers series was ended.|$|E
25|$|At Slammiversary, Joe betrayed A.J. Styles {{and turned}} on all the fans by helping Kurt Angle win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the King of the Mountain match, and thus turned heel. On the June 25 episode of Impact!, Joe officially joined The Main Event Mafia after having spent the last five months taking them out. This was {{revealed}} by Angle, to be a master plan to fool the TNA Frontline and the attacks were all planned by Joe and the Mafia in advance. Joe then <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> that he joined the Mafia for the money that was invested by Jenna Morasca and for the power and also debuted a new rap themed, entrance music. Throughout the night, he carried out attacks with the Mafia on Styles and Daniels {{and the leader of}} the Mafia, Sting, who was kicked out of the Mafia as leader and once again replaced with Kurt Angle. At Victory Road, Joe faced Sting in a grudge match. Late in the match, Taz made his TNA debut and helped Joe beat Sting, thus revealing himself as his new adviser. At Hard Justice Joe defeated Homicide to win the X Division title for the fourth time. After winning this title, Joe feuded with his longtime rival Daniels and defeated him at No Surrender. On the October 8 edition of Impact! Joe lost the X Division title to Amazing Red after Bobby Lashley interfered in the match. At Bound for Glory Lashley defeated Joe in a submission match with a referee stoppage. On the following edition of Impact! Kurt Angle turned into a fan favorite, thus signaling the end of the Main Event Mafia. The following month at Turning Point Joe unsuccessfully challenged TNA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles for the title in a three-way match, also involving Daniels.|$|E

500|$|Lights and Sounds debuted to {{mixed reviews}} from {{contemporary}} music critics, receiving criticism as the album fell short {{from the standard}} set by its predecessor, Ocean Avenue. Upon the album's release, it charted at number five on Billboards 200 and Top Internet Albums' charts, making it the band highest charting album to date. The album accumulated sales of just over 315,000 copies, which failed to match the 2million sales of their previous album. Yellowcard <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> that the disappointment of the sales were due to their going [...] "a bit too far" [...] with the expectations they had thought the album would exceed. Lights and Sounds was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E
500|$|In 2004, the New Statesman {{reported}} that the sandwich chosen by a politician as his [...] "favourite" [...] is loaded with political symbolism. For example, it suggested that a chicken tikka sandwich would be a [...] "gentle nod to an imperial past and a firm statement of a multicultural present and future". The article <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> that the then Leader of the Opposition William Hague had accused the then Prime Minister Tony Blair of being a hypocrite with regards to food, telling one portion of society that his favourite meal was fish and chips and another {{that it was a}} fresh fettuccine dish. The conclusion of the article was that Blair chose the BLT as his favourite sandwich, which appeals to all classes.|$|E
500|$|Susie Wiles, who ran Rick Scott's {{successful}} 2010 gubernatorial {{campaign in}} Florida, worked first {{as executive director}} of H-PAC and then as Huntsman's campaign manager.

According to Henson, [...] "When {{we hit the}} editing, I did the first cut, and then George was heavily involved on bringing it to the final cut. After that, I took it over again and did {{the next few months}} of post-production and audio." [...] Henson <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain,</b> [...] "When you edit a film with somebody else you have to compromise. I always want to go one way, and George goes another way, but we each took turns trading off, giving and taking. George tends to be very action-oriented and he cuts dialogue quite tight; I tend to cut looser, and go for more lyrical pauses, which can slow the story. So, I loosen up his tightness, and he tightens my looseness." ...|$|E
500|$|Anderson later {{revealed}} that Charlie and Angelo would face tough times in 2011, stating: [...] "They've had {{their fair share}} of hurdles – and there are more to come." [...] Charlie and Angelo split up and Anderson admitted she was happy that there is always drama in Charlie's love life and she added [...] "I think it's going to be full-on for Ms Buckton this year. But, you know, romances in Summer Bay never last." [...] Of breaking Charlie and Angelo up, Welsh said, [...] "The thinking behind that was to challenge the characters and do something a bit different."

500|$|Self-syndicated {{newspaper}} columnist Michael McManus {{once said that}} his goal in writing his weekly column was [...] "to suggest answers to problems of the old industrial states."

[...] In the article, McManus proposed several reasons why a city, like Chicago, Pittsburgh, or Scranton might find {{the addition of a}} tourist attraction like Steamtown beneficial. [...] McManus <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> why the business was failing in Vermont. [...] Among the reasons the article gave for poor attendance at the Vermont site were: past failed management, an isolated location and the lack of signs on Interstate 91, which the state opposed. In addition to these problems, the roof of the largest storage shed on the site collapsed under heavy snow the previous winter, damaging several pieces of equipment. Among the injured were the Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1293 and the Meadow River Lumber Company No. 1 Shay (shown in the infobox).|$|E
