5|$|In Kesselring's memoirs, he {{said that}} in Wolfsberg he was {{approached}} by a former SS major who had an escape plan prepared. According to Kesselring, he declined the offer {{on the grounds that it}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a confession of guilt. Other senior Nazi figures did manage to escape from Wolfsberg to South America or Syria.|$|E
5|$|Hope {{had been}} offered {{a leading role in}} Stanley Kubrick's war film, Full Metal Jacket, when he was offered the role of Gorman. He interacted with the other film's cast and crew, since both were shot near the Battersea Power Station in Nine Elms. The cast who played Colonial Marines (except latecomer Michael Biehn) {{underwent}} several weeks of training with United States Marines without Hope. Director James Cameron said that he wanted Hope separated so he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an outsider, complementing Gorman's onscreen inexperience.|$|E
5|$|Ravel {{composed}} little during 1913. He {{collaborated with}} Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky's unfinished opera Khovanshchina, {{and his own}} works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier. In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of The Rite of Spring. Stravinsky later said that Ravel {{was the only person}} who immediately understood the music. Ravel predicted that the premiere of the Rite <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande.|$|E

5|$|The player {{initially}} {{can see a}} top-down view of the surface-level of {{the fortress}} site; each layer of a z-axis level can be viewed when the player changes it. An entire underground level <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> its entire section of terrain while a mountain at the surface level would have only its section visible with the remaining surface landscape. Thus, for digging, the player can designate, for every z-level starting from the surface, staircases to be carved, and, at the final designated level, end the staircase by having it dug into a room.|$|E
5|$|Both {{before the}} {{establishment}} of Australia Day as the national day of Australia, and {{in the years after}} its creation, several dates have been proposed for its celebration and, at various times, the possibility of moving Australia Day to an alternative date has been mooted. Some reasons put forward are that the current date, celebrating the foundation of the Colony of New South Wales, lacks national significance; that the day falls on school holidays which limits the engagement of schoolchildren in the event; and that it fails to encompass members of the indigenous community and some others who perceive the day as commemorating the date of an invasion of their land. Connected to this is the suggestion that moving the date <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a significant symbolic act.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{the demise}} of wooden covered bridge <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>as</b> a storm, dubbed the Pumpkin Flood of 1903, struck in October of that year. The storm struck both communities, and the bridge in between, causing the loss of many lives, and on October 17, the toll {{collector}} on the bridge closed off the gate and did not allow any person to cross. At 6:40 that evening, a crash was heard, and seconds later, the bridge was no more, after tumbling into the Delaware River below. Remnants of the bridge were swept downstream, and smashed {{on the side of}} the new Northampton Street Bridge, constructed just a few years before. After the storm cleared, the community of Belvidere put a ferry to Riverton back in almost immediately.|$|E

5|$|Long {{was elected}} to the United States Congress in the 1882 election, and served until 1889, declining to run for reelection in the 1888 election. In 1886, he was {{encouraged}} to stand for the Senate by Henry Cabot Lodge, although Lodge's support was apparently part of a ruse to test the strength of the state party leadership. Lodge withdrew his support at the last minute, throwing it instead to the incumbent Henry L. Dawes, and the legislature reelected Dawes to the seat. The incident cooled relations between Lodge and Long. In the wheeling and dealing that preceded the Senate election, Long was offered Democratic support by Butler, but refused, believing that such votes <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> tainted by an unsavory political deal.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July, {{less than}} twelve {{hours before the}} book went on sale in the Eastern time zone, Raincoast warned The Globe and Mail {{newspaper}} that publishing a review from a Canada-based writer at midnight, as the paper had promised, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a violation of the}} trade secret injunction. The injunction sparked a number of news articles alleging that the injunction had restricted fundamental rights. Canadian law professor Michael Geist posted commentary on his blog; Richard Stallman called for a boycott, requesting the publisher issue an apology. The Globe and Mail published a review from two UK-based writers in its 16 July edition and posted the Canadian writer's review on its website at 9:00 that morning. Commentary was also provided on the Raincoast website.|$|E
5|$|By noon, the Lithuanians {{received}} a reply from Moscow stating that Raštikis {{was not a}} suitable candidate for Prime Minister. The selection of another candidate would be supervised by Molotov's deputy Vladimir Dekanozov. Merkys continued to act as Prime Minister. Smetona, who continued to disagree {{with the majority of}} his government, decided to leave the country in protest and appointed Merkys as acting President. By late evening on June 15, Smetona and Minister of Defense Kazys Musteikis reached Kybartai and crossed the border into Germany, where they were granted temporary asylum. The Lithuanian guards did not allow them to pass; thus, Smetona had to wade across the shallow Liepona rivulet. Smetona′s departure worked to the Soviets′ advantage; its indignity opened him to ridicule {{and they were able to}} exploit the sentiments against him without fearing that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a martyr. By fleeing, Smetona escaped the fate of Latvian President Kārlis Ulmanis and Estonian President Konstantin Päts, who were manipulated by the Soviets and later arrested. Under the Lithuanian constitution, Merkys became acting president.|$|E
50|$|Polynomials {{over other}} finite fields of prime order do have applications,but {{treating}} the coefficients {{of such a}} polynomial as the digits of a single number is rather uncommon,so the multiplication of such polynomials <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a carry-less multiplication of numbers.|$|R
50|$|Further, {{according}} to this hypothesis, Antigonus Mattathias <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the Wicked Priest. Antigonus was the last Hasmonean king of Israel.

5|$|Coolidge {{has often}} been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural {{disaster}} to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed {{a lack of interest}} in federal flood control. Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, and that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost. On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.|$|E
5|$|The three {{beings are}} {{discovered}} to be reptilian humanoids, {{and in a}} scuffle, they capture Elliot and strike Tony with a venomous forked tongue; the Doctor and Rory subdue one while the other two retreat with Elliot back into the earth. The Doctor realises the beings are {{a new form of}} Silurians, and that they have relented in their attack since both sides hold a hostage. The captured Silurian calls herself Alaya; {{she is a member of}} the warrior caste, awoken by the drill. Alaya believes, as do all Silurians, that the Earth still belongs to them, that the drilling was a form of attack by the humans, and that they will defeat humanity eventually. Tony, suffering from the effects of the venom, says they should dissect Alaya, but the Doctor warns that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an act of war. The Doctor decides to travel in the TARDIS down the drilling shaft to talk to the rest of the Silurians and work out a truce; Nasreen accompanies him.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Graham, the Master of the Mint, in 1859 persuaded William Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, {{that the}} state of the copper {{currency}} demanded a lighter, more durable replacement. Bronze was selected as harder and less subject to oxidation. It was a material with which the Mint had experience, having recently struck bronze coins for the Canadian colonies, and it had been used in France since 1852. Parliament passed legislation in 1860 that allowed the penny to be struck from an alloy of metals. The act required that Britannia appear on the coin, as the design was felt to symbolise Britain as ruler of the waves, and to omit her <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> abandoning that role. The Mint in 1860 awarded a contract for 1,720 tonnes of bronze pennies, halfpennies and farthings to James Watt & Co of Birmingham, a contract that would not be completed until 1863. Heaton's was also called upon to supply dies and coins, especially as Watt's prepared to execute its huge contract.|$|E

50|$|Ronald Audley Martineau Dixon of Thearne Hall, FSAS FRSE FRGS FGS (1871-1960) was a British natural historian, {{antiquarian}} {{and author}} on historic subjects.

5|$|U.S. diplomats were {{concerned}} that the move <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process {{in which he was}} a candidate. The Americans felt that a legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice. Ambassador G. Frederick Reinhardt informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing a level playing field for the opposition, and that the foreign press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being a facade. The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum as an exercise in democracy for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, as they saw it as an opportunity to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, as they saw a republican model as being more robust.|$|E
5|$|When Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, George's {{first cousin}} (their mothers were sisters), was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the British {{government}} offered political asylum to the Tsar and his family, but worsening {{conditions for the}} British people, and fears that revolution might come to the British Isles, led George {{to think that the}} presence of the Romanovs <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> inappropriate. Despite the later claims of Lord Mountbatten of Burma that Prime Minister Lloyd George was opposed to the rescue of the Russian imperial family, the letters of Lord Stamfordham suggest that it was GeorgeV who opposed the idea against the advice of the government. Advanced planning for a rescue was undertaken by MI1, a branch of the British secret service, but because of the strengthening position of the Bolshevik revolutionaries and wider difficulties with the conduct of the war, the plan was never put into operation. The Tsar and his immediate family remained in Russia, where they were murdered by Bolsheviks in 1918. The following year, Nicholas's mother (George's aunt) Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) {{and other members of the}} extended Russian imperial family were rescued from the Crimea by a British warship.|$|E
25|$|In some cultures, pets or {{sporting}} {{animals are}} sometimes given names similar to human names. Other cultures, {{such as the}} Chinese, give animals nonhuman names because it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> offensive and disrespectful to {{the person of the}} same name.|$|E
