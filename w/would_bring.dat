5|$|Over {{the course}} of the war, these words would prove prophetic. No Confederate forces <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> Fort Greble under fire during its entire {{four-year}} active military career, and its garrison units, rotated regularly, served quietly behind its earthen walls.|$|E

5|$|Acquacotta {{was invented}} in part {{as a means to}} make stale, {{hardened}} bread edible. People that worked away from home for significant periods of time, such as woodcutters and shepherds, <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> bread and other foods with them (such as pancetta and salt cod) to hold them over. Acquacotta was prepared and used to marinate the stale bread, thus softening it.|$|E

5|$|Faramir's {{decision}} {{to reject the}} One Ring shows influences from a kind of courage and behaviour that was known to Tolkien from the medieval poem The Battle of Maldon.

5|$|Fearing the {{newspaper}} <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> the countryside {{down on the}} Mormons, the Nauvoo city council declared the Expositor a public nuisance and ordered the Nauvoo Legion to destroy the press.

5|$|They fought as hoplites, usually {{carrying}} clipei, large round Greek shields, {{and wearing}} bronze helmets, {{often with a}} number of feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature.

5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown that a large event interfering with normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating.

5|$|Cagney {{was accused}} of being a {{communist}} sympathizer in 1934, and again in 1940. The accusation in 1934 stemmed from a letter police found from a local Communist official that alleged that Cagney <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> other Hollywood stars to meetings. Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter's writer, backed up this denial, asserting that the accusation stemmed solely from Cagney's donation to striking cotton workers in the San Joaquin Valley. William Cagney claimed this donation was the root of the charges in 1940. Cagney was cleared by U.S. Representative Martin Dies Jr., on the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E

Using the robotic arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through the procedures to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, reinforced carbon-carbon nose cap, and heat shield tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the schedule for landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early {{to try to avoid}} the possibility of showers that would prevent a landing on Friday.

5|$|From mid-1942 through mid-1944, the Filipino guerrilla {{resistance}} {{had been}} supplied and encouraged by U.S. Navy submarines {{and a few}} parachute drops, so that the guerrillas could harass the Japanese Army and {{take control of the}} rural areas, jungles and mountains – thus, the Japanese Empire only controlled 12 out of 48 provinces.
