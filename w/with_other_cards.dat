2500|$|In the Yu-Gi-Oh Trading Card Game, both Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr are {{represented}} as [...] "Nordic Beast" [...] Monster Cards. They {{are meant to}} be used in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> representative of other characters and creatures from Norse mythology, including their master Thor.|$|E
50|$|Avatar: {{the leader}} of your army. With his/her {{abilities}} this card works <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> in the set to boost troop’s abilities.|$|E
5000|$|Inmortal (Immortal) - While not {{properly}} an ability, Inmortal {{worked as a}} [...] "title" [...] that allowed to interact <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> that specified Inmortal card.|$|E
50|$|Beginners {{and players}} who are {{familiar}} <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>card</b> games <b>with</b> similar but different rules of hand formation and superiority often misinterpret some of the rules that involve the kicker, causing illegal play.|$|R
50|$|A few {{fundamental}} and exceptive rules {{are essential for}} understanding the game play of the game. Some rules are structured differently from the <b>other</b> popular <b>card</b> games. Players who have prior experience <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>card</b> games, such as poker, and Big Two, often prejudice the rules.|$|R
5000|$|Quanta has {{a number}} of MXM notebooks, but {{compatibility}} <b>with</b> <b>other</b> MXM <b>cards</b> is questionable.|$|R
5000|$|Lenovo used MXM on its {{discontinued}} 17" [...] workstation line (w700(ds) and w701(ds), {{though it}} is not compatible <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> due to BIOS/vBIOS and possibly electrical routing issues) and has used it on a few Ideapad series notebooks.|$|E
50|$|If {{an amount}} of colored joker is handed <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards,</b> handing after it is {{impossible}} in some rules. In other rules, two colored jokers can be a joker that is bigger than colored joker, and it can defeat such handing.|$|E

50|$|Mutations in BinCARD and <b>other</b> {{proteins}} containing <b>CARD</b> domains {{are linked}} to Bcl10-related diseases, including lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Bcl10 {{has been shown to}} induce apoptosis and to activate NF-kappaB. This protein is reported to interact <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>CARD</b> domain containing proteins including CARD9, 10, 11 and 14, which are thought to function as upstream regulators in NF-kappaB signaling. Accordingly, BinCARD protein has a pivotal role in regulating apoptotic functions.|$|R
5000|$|As Eddie Rayne, he was {{a talented}} bridge player, {{representing}} England {{at the age of}} 21 and becoming European Bridge Champion at the age of 26. An interview shortly before he took up his role as chairman of the BFC also noted his facility <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>card</b> games: [...] "He is the Sky Masterson of Mayfair. As a colleague said: 'Nobody beats Eddie at poker'." ...|$|R
5000|$|As <b>with</b> some <b>other</b> <b>Card</b> novels (Ender's Game, for example), {{this book}} {{started out as}} a shorter story [...] "Mikal's Songbird", which was a Nebula Award finalist in 1978.Songmaster {{received}} the Hamilton-Brackett Memorial Award 1981.|$|R
50|$|An {{error in}} {{counting}} a hand {{may not be}} corrected after that hand has been mixed <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards.</b> However, if an error in scoring is discovered when there had previously been no dispute, an agreed upon correction may be made at any time.|$|E
50|$|Aspect ratios {{range from}} 1.42 to 1.8. There is no {{standard}} for the business card dimensions. Sharing dimensions <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> makes storage easier, for example banking cards (85.60 × 53.98 mm) and business cards in Western Europe (85 × 55 mm) have almost the same size.|$|E
5000|$|All 94 {{cards in}} the Unglued set each had a single word printed {{on the bottom of}} the card. Alone these single words made little or no sense but when {{combined}} in proper numerical order <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> in the series spell out the following secret message: ...|$|E
50|$|Está peluda - This {{is said to}} {{a player}} either when you can win the hand but it leaves you <b>with</b> no <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> or when you have low cards and winning the hand is unlikely.|$|R
50|$|Each type of card {{should be}} mixed with those {{sharing the same}} back design (such as gold nugget cards with gold nugget cards and playing <b>cards</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> playing <b>cards).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Caspase-1 is {{produced}} as a zymogen that {{can then be}} cleaved into 20 kDa (p20) and 10 kDa (p10) subunits that {{become part of the}} active enzyme. Active Caspase 1 contains two heterodimers of p20 and p10. It contains a catalytic domain with an active site that spans both the p20 and p10 subunits, as well as a noncatalytic Caspase Activation and Recruitment Domain (CARD) [...] It interacts <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>CARD</b> containing proteins such as Apoptosis-Associated Speck-like Protein Containing a CARD (ASC) and Nod-Like Receptor (NLR) Family CARD Domain-Containing Protein 4 (NLRC4) through CARD-CARD interactions in the formation of inflammasomes.|$|R
50|$|Before {{you start}} playing, locate 4 cards {{with the same}} rank that are close and {{near the end of}} the layout. Try to get the 4 cards to the end of the layout. You do not want to cover them <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> until the end of your game.|$|E
5000|$|Card [...] "2" [...] {{is called}} [...] "money" [...] when handing <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> (except both Jokers). The 2 becomes the same ranking with the card(s) which is(are) handed. For example, 2-2-4-4-4 is {{equivalence}} to 4-4-4-4-4. But using 2 in Gou Ji cards make the Gou Ji cards [...] "not pure".|$|E
50|$|Both Jokers can be {{used the}} same as money, but more useful than it. If an amount of black joker is handed <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards,</b> only the same or bigger amount of colored joker can be handed out after it, and {{the total amount of}} card should be the same of {{previous}} handing.|$|E
50|$|The card is not {{compatible}} <b>with</b> <b>other</b> travel <b>cards</b> in Japan (such as SUGOCA or PASMO) and {{cannot be}} used outside the Okinawa prefecture.Currently, it {{cannot be used}} for other services like cruises, taxis, and ferries, but the feasibility has been studied.|$|R
5000|$|Today, the {{development}} of the Internet has given rise to various online communities, through which members can trade collectible <b>cards</b> <b>with</b> each <b>other.</b> <b>Cards</b> are often bought and sold via eBay and other online retail sources. Many websites solicit their own [...] "sell to us" [...] page in hopes to draw in more purchase opportunities.|$|R
50|$|If {{a player}} draws a bonus card from the draw pile during their regular turn, they will {{automatically}} collect it along <b>with</b> any <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> matched during that turn, {{except in the}} event of a ppeok, in which all four cards (i.e. the three cards involved in the ppeok plus the bonus card) must remain on the table.|$|R
50|$|Three of Clubs Start - The {{person with}} the three of clubs starts the first round in the game by placing down that card. It may be played in {{combination}} <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> per legal combinations. In multi-deck games, {{the first person to}} throw down a three of clubs (or legal combination thereof) starts.|$|E
50|$|The card is usable for {{railways}} {{and buses}} by Enshū Railway, including Enshū Railway Line. However, {{it is not}} usable for community buses by municipalities there (excluding Ku-Ru-Ru and Iwata City Bus), or for e-wing, the bus for Chūbu Centrair International Airport. Currently, the card has no plan to have integrated services <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards,</b> such as Suica, ICOCA, LuLuCa or TOICA.|$|E
5000|$|Artifacts also {{received}} a rule change. Before the change, an artifact [...] "shut off" [...] or stopped working while it was tapped, unless it was an artifact creature. After, an artifact remains active while tapped. This was to bring artifacts more in line <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards.</b> Some artifacts (like [...] and [...] ) retained the [...] "shut off" [...] aspect, which necessitated explicitly printing that they only worked while untapped.|$|E
50|$|For example, ICEBERG nucleates the {{formation}} of Caspase-1 filaments and is thus incorporated into the filaments, but lacks the ability to inhibit the activation of inflammasomes. Instead, it is thought to inhibit Caspase-1 activation by interfering with the interaction of Caspase-1 <b>with</b> <b>other</b> important <b>CARD</b> containing proteins.|$|R
50|$|The R9 380, along <b>with</b> the <b>other</b> enthusiast-level <b>cards</b> are {{the first}} cards to use the third and newest {{iteration}} of the GCN instruction set and micro-architecture. The <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> in the series feature first and second gen iterations of GCN. The table below details which GCN-generation each chip belongs to.|$|R
5000|$|On March 23, 2013, Hayakaken {{has also}} been made {{interoperable}} <b>with</b> six <b>other</b> similar <b>cards</b> using the same FeliCa technology, including PASMO, PiTaPa, Manaca, ICOCA, TOICA, and Kitaca.|$|R
50|$|Two decks {{of cards}} without jokers are needed. The dealer, chosen at random, deals 6 cards to each player in {{clockwise}} direction. After dealing he puts four face up cards {{in front of}} where he would put a rest of cards, {{in the center of}} the table. These cards can be placed in hand only if you can form <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> at least three of same and different numbers. They are helping cards.|$|E
5000|$|Energy {{cards were}} the only cards that could {{be placed in the}} Side Deck up until the release of the Bankai Expansion, which now allows them to be {{switched}} <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> at a 1 for 1 ratio. Energy cards are what players use to pay costs and play their cards. There are currently three kinds of Energy: Mind Energy, Body Energy and Spirit Energy. The Bounts expansion included Dual Energy cards, which produce either of two types of energy: they are limited to one card of each type per deck.|$|E
5000|$|Much like Unglued before it, each {{card in the}} Unhinged set -including Super Secret Tech- has {{a single}} word printed {{on the bottom of}} the card after the artist's name and card number. Alone these single words made little to no sense but when all cards are placed in the proper order <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> in the series they spell out a secret message {{detailing}} cards that allegedly did not make it into the set. Placing all the Unhinged cards in reverse alphabetical order will cause the following message to appear: ...|$|E
5000|$|The Spoils uses {{a number}} of {{mechanics}} in common <b>with</b> <b>other</b> collectible <b>card</b> games. Unlike many games of this kind, you start {{the game with a}} Faction card in play, which determines how you begin your turn and which actions you are allowed to take. These Factions have special abilities, unique to each Faction card.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{song of the}} 1860s was [...] "The King of Trumps". The cover {{depicts a}} playing card for the King of Trumps in colour <b>with</b> parts of <b>other</b> <b>cards</b> in each corner, around a picture of Alfred Vance in a top hat.|$|R
50|$|Contact {{smart cards}} (with chip) have a contact zone {{consisting}} of a few small contact petals. When the card is inserted into the reader, the chip connects with the card reader which can then read and write information. The standard ISO/IEC 7816 also regulates data exchange protocols and some aspects of work <b>with</b> <b>other</b> smart <b>card</b> data.|$|R
