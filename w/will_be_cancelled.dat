Each antenna element or group of antenna elements incorporates a discrete phase shift that produces a phase gradient across the array.

Signals travelling along that beam will be reinforced. Signals offset from that beam <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>cancelled.</b> The amount of reinforcement is antenna gain. The amount of cancellation is side-lobe suppression.|$|E

Independent commissions will be established to oversee the judiciary, police, elections department, Auditor-General's Department and Attorney-General's Department. The Commission on Bribery and Corruption will be strengthened and political diplomatic appointments annulled. Populist measures in the manifesto include a commitment to write-off 50% of farmers' loans, reduce fuel prices by removing taxes and a salary increase of Rs.10,000 for public servants.
