There are eleven lifts in the building, spread amongst two cores, with an additional core containing stairs leading to a ground floor fire exit. There are two platform lifts on the ground floor for disabled access.|$|E
25|$|The {{windshield}} wiper is a bladed device used to wipe rain and dirt from a windshield. In 1903, Mary Anderson {{is credited with}} inventing the first operational {{windshield wiper}}. In Anderson's patent, she called her invention a <b>window</b> <b>cleaning</b> device for electric cars and other vehicles. Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle, her version of windshield wipers closely resembles the windshield wiper found on many early car models. Anderson had a model of her design manufactured. She then filed a patent (U.S. patent number 743,801) on June 18, 1903 that was issued to her by the U.S. Patent Office on November 10, 1903.|$|E
500|$|After Jolie {{had just}} {{given birth to}} twins, she spent time {{training}} before filming to get fit in order to perform {{almost all of the}} stunts herself. Bonaventura said, [...] "She is so prepared and so ready and gung-ho, she'll do any stunt. We had her jumping out of helicopters, shooting, jumping off of all sorts of things and infiltrating places that are impossible to infiltrate". Salt's fighting style was described as a mixture of Muay Thai, Shaolin Kung-Fu, & Jeet Kune Do, which was considered by the stunt team the most suitable for Jolie's physique, and Krav Maga, for its rawness and aggressiveness. Noyce wanted to film the scene where Salt hangs {{from the edge of the}} building in a studio with chroma key, but Jolie insisted on doing it herself in the actual location. On May 29 2009, filming was temporarily halted after Jolie suffered a minor head injury during filming an action scene. She was taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure and released on the same day with no serious injuries, allowing filming to resume. Salt's escape after being captured in St. Bartholomew's originally involved her jumping off a building into a <b>window</b> <b>cleaning</b> machine, but budgetary constraints caused the scene to be changed into a car chase.|$|E

6000|$|So {{one great}} lump of the servant's toil will {{practically}} disappear. Two others are already disappearing. In many houses {{there are still}} the offensive duties of filling lamps and blacking boots to be done. Our coming house, however, will have no lamps to need filling, and, as for the boots, really intelligent people will feel the essential ugliness of wearing the evidence of constant manual toil upon their persons. They will wear sorts of shoes and boots that can be cleaned by wiping in a minute or so. Take now the bedroom work. The lack of ingenuity in sanitary fittings at present forbids the obvious convenience of hot and cold water supply to the bedroom, {{and there is a}} mighty fetching and carrying of water and slops to be got through daily. All that will cease. Every bedroom will have its own bath-dressing room which any well-bred person will be intelligent and considerate enough to use and leave without the slightest disarrangement. This, so far as [...] "upstairs" [...] goes, really only leaves bedmaking to be done, and a bed does not take five minutes to make. Downstairs a vast amount of needless labour at present arises out of table wear. [...] "Washing up" [...] consists of a tedious cleansing and wiping of each table utensil in turn, whereas {{it should be possible to}} immerse all dirty table wear in a suitable solvent for a few minutes and then run that off for the articles to dry. The application of solvents to <b>window</b> <b>cleaning,</b> also, would be a possible thing but for the primitive construction of our windows, which prevents anything but a painful rub, rub, rub, with the leather. A friend of mine in domestic service tells me that this rubbing is to get the window dry, and this seems to be the general impression, but I think it incorrect. The water is not an adequate solvent, and enough cannot be used under existing conditions. Consequently, if the window is cleaned and left wet, it dries in drops, and these drops contain dirt in solution which remain as spots. But water containing a suitable solvent could quite simply be made to run down a window for a few minutes from pinholes in a pipe above into a groove below, and this could be followed by pure rain water for an equal time, and in this way the whole <b>window</b> <b>cleaning</b> in the house could, I imagine, be reduced to the business of turning on a tap.|$|E

50|$|After {{being elected}} Mayor of New York City in 1993, Republican Rudy Giuliani hired Bratton as his police {{commissioner}} to implement similar {{policies and practices}} throughout the city. Giuliani heavily subscribed to Kelling and Wilson's theories and was eager to implement policies based on their theories. Such policies emphasized addressing crimes that negatively impact quality of life. In particular, Bratton directed the police to more strictly enforce laws against subway fare evasion, public drinking, public urination, and graffiti. He increased enforcement against squeegee men, those who aggressively demand payment at traffic stops for unsolicited car <b>window</b> <b>cleanings.</b> Bratton also revived New York City Cabaret Law, a previously dormant Prohibition era ban on dancing in unlicensed establishments. Throughout the late 1990s NYPD shut down many of the city's acclaimed night spots for illegal dancing.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this formative research was to explore the acceptability and feasibility of chan-ging housekeeping behaviors as a low-cost approach that may reduce childhood lead expos-ure in Johannesburg, South Africa. Using the Trials of Improved Practices (TIPs) method-ology, modified housekeeping behaviors were negotiated with participants who chose the be-haviors they wanted to try and then performed them in their homes over 4 weeks. Researchers interviewed them {{at the end of}} the month to understand their experience of trying out the be-haviors. The modified behaviors offered to each participant were as follows: <b>cleaning</b> <b>window</b> sills with detergent and water, <b>cleaning</b> <b>window</b> sills more frequently, mopping floors with two buck-ets (one with soapy water for washing and one with clean water for rinsing), mopping floors more frequently, dusting surfaces with detergent and water and dusting surfaces more frequently. Participants found <b>cleaning</b> <b>window</b> sills with soap and water and cleaning them more often the most acceptable and feasible of behavior modifications. Environmental samples showed a significant reduction in lead dust on window sills. These findings can assist in the development of acceptable and feasible medium-term interven-tions to reduce childhood lead exposure in re-source-poor settings until more robust health policies are implemented...|$|R
