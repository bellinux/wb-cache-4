Elongate hemlock scale, European <b>fruit</b> <b>lecanium,</b> hemlock woolly adelgid and pear thrips were analyzed for the presence of mycopathogens, in order to consider the potential for managing these pests with biological control. Fungal cultures isolated from insects with signs of fungal infection were identified based on morphological characters and DNA profiling. Mycopathogens recovered from infected insects were subdivided into three groups, i. e., specialized entomopathogenic; facultative entomopathogens; ubiquitous opportunistic contaminants. Epizootics were caused by fungi in the specialized group with the exception of M. microspora, P. marquandii and I. farinosa. Inoculation of insects in laboratory and field conditions with B. bassiana, L. muscarium and Myriangium sp. caused insect mortality of 45 to 95 %. Although pest populations in the field seemed severely compromised after treatment, the remnant populations re-established themselves after the winter. Although capable of inducing high mortality, a single localized aerial application of a soil-dwelling fungus does not maintain long-time suppression of pests. However, it can halt their range expansion and maintain populations below the economic threshold level without the use of expensive insecticides which have a negative impact on the environment...|$|R

40|$|Citation: Evans, Jephthah W. Chinch-bug. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1894. Introduction: Introduction: Were {{you to ask}} the <b>western</b> <b>fruit</b> grower which insect in most {{injurious}} to his efforts, {{he would}} undoubtedly answer ‘the Curculio’. Were you to confront the western grain grower with this same question, he would certainly answer ‘the Chinch-bug’. And he would be right. The Hessian Fly, often simply called ‘The Fly’, injures the wheat by its larva or maggot living between the sheath and the stems and thus absorbing the sap before it reaches the fruiting portion. The ‘Weevil’ in certain favorable seasons does considerable damage by its little orange-colored, legless larva sucking the sap from the growing kernel. The ‘Joint-worm’ may at times assist in allaying {{the growth of the}} plant by causing abnormal enlargements of the joints. The ‘Plant-louse’, the ‘White-gnat’, the ‘Wire-worm’, and certain ‘Cut-worms’ each have a tendency to lessen the return of the western gran grower, but the combined effort of all these does not equal the damage done by the chinch-bug. He is undoubtedly the meanest insect the western farmer has to deal with...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Studies {{conducted}} with the adult <b>western</b> cherry <b>fruit</b> fly, Rhagoletis indifferens Curran, revealed that successful oviposition occurred in three distinct phases, the prepenetration phase, the penetration phase and the postpenetration phase. During the postpenetration phase which averaged 51 seconds (range 18 to 86), the females dragged their ovipositor over the fruit surface following the deposition of an egg. During this process, they apparently released and deposited a highly specialized pheromone which affected the behavior of incoming flies. The pheromone was soluble in methanol and water which indicated {{that it could be}} a polar compound. Methanolic and water extracts were stable and retained biological activity under laboratory and field conditions. The pheromone(s) was stable for at least two weeks at 3 °C and did not lose its biological activity even upon heating to 80 °C. The pheromonal compound(s) prevented repeated oviposition in a fruit already containing an egg, thus contributing to a uniform egg distribution throughout the available fruits. Identification and synthesis of the pheromone could result in its application in an integrated pest management program against the <b>western</b> cherry <b>fruit</b> fly...|$|R

40|$|Several {{characteristics}} of tart cherry fruits (Prunus cerasus L.) were measured over two seasons {{in order to}} determine if such traits can be used to predict the onset of oviposition by the <b>western</b> cherry <b>fruit</b> fly, Rhagoletis indifferens Curran.
