Additionally a player may not make any significant movement after the ball comes into play and before the ball reaches the striker. If this happens, an umpire will call and signal 'dead ball'. For close fielders anything other than minor adjustments to stance or position {{in relation to the}} striker is significant. In the outfield, fielders may move in towards the striker or striker's wicket; indeed, they usually do. However, anything other than slight movement off line or away from the striker is to be considered significant.|$|E

All vehicles driving into the city must have the appropriate vehicle pass, and all occupants are required to have valid ticket, {{in order to get}} in. Vehicles are also searched for any items that are prohibited in the city. For those who have their tickets held at <b>Will</b> <b>Call,</b> <b>the</b> booths are located between the Highway 34 entrance and the main gate. All tickets and vehicle passes must be bought in advance; they are not directly sold outside the gate or at the Will Call booths. Furthermore, unless they have a valid early arrival pass for the pre-event set up, any vehicle who arrives before the gate opens is turned away and told to go back to Reno, and not to wait {{along the side of the}} road on either Highways 34 or 447 (which would be a safety hazard), nor stay in Gerlach (and overcrowd the small town).|$|E

Stacey {{runs out of the}} house and Janine convinces Jean to call the police. Stacey contemplates suicide but Max stops her and says he will help her to escape. Stacey convinces Jean that Janine has framed her. Ryan plans to run away with Stacey, but Stacey states that events have happened rapidly, and she is not sure whether she loves him. Stacey ends their romance. Ronnie and Roxy confront her, and Stacey confesses that she did kill Archie. Ronnie tells her to go, and Max drives her to the airport as the police arrive on the Square. At the airport, Max says he loves her and offers to leave with her, but she tells him she only ever loved Bradley. She and Lily then board a flight and leave the country. The next day, Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) receives a phone call from Stacey, saying that her and Lily are safe and well in Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Dual meets {{usually take}} place on evenings during the school week (Monday through Friday); on Saturday mornings, afternoons, or evenings; or even on Sunday mornings or afternoons during the wrestling season and begin with weigh-ins at a maximum of one hour before the meet begins. No weight {{allowances}} are made for dual meets and multiple-day dual meets. Wrestlers are also examined by a physician or a certified athletic trainer for any communicable skin diseases. If a student-wrestler does not make weight, he is ineligible for that weight class and a forfeit is scored. If there are any communicable skin diseases, it is a ground for disqualification. The wrestler's coach or athletic trainer can provide written documentation from a physician that a skin infection of a wrestler would not be communicable. The final judgement for whether a wrestler {{would be allowed to}} compete lies with the meet physician or athletic trainer on site. In all cases, after determining the sequence of weight classes for the dual meet, the referee <b>will</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> wrestlers from each team who have been designated as captains. One of the visiting captains will call a disk toss. The colored disk will then fall to the floor and determine: 1) which team has the choice of position {{at the start of the}} second period and 2) which one of the team's members is to appear first on the mat when called by the referee for each weight class. The wrestler-captain who won the disk toss may choose the even or odd weight classes. That is, he may choose the weight classes, from lowest to highest, that are numbered evenly or oddly. For example, the 125lb, 141lb, 157lb, etc. weight classes would be odd, and the 133lb, 149lb, 165lb, etc. weight classes would be even. This order would work in the traditional sequence until the last even weight class of 285lb.|$|E

I love the Constitution; it was made by the inspiration of God; and it will be preserved and saved by the efforts of the White Horse, and by the Red Horse who will combine in its defense." [...] Smith additionally said, according to the diary, that the Mormons would send missionaries to [...] "gather the honest in heart from among the Pale Horse, or people of the United States, to stand by the Constitution of the United States as it was given by the inspiration of God." [...] Roberts' account quotes Smith as predicting numerous wars involving Great Britain, France, Russia, China, and other countries, and saying that the European nobility [...] "knows that [...] is true, but it has not pomp enough, and grandeur and influence for them to yet embrace it." [...] He is also reported to have said that a temple which the Latter Day Saints had planned to build in Jackson County, Missouri [...] "will be built in this generation." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the 5432 has {{released}} its authority in Anna, the dispatcher may issue a new {{authority to the}} 4321 authorizing them through Anna block.
