PNA exhibits nonimmune but selective binding to glycoproteins with beta-D-galactosyl(1, 3) -N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues. We also investigated whether a relationship existed {{between the number of}} histochemical-related PNA acceptors and the histochemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) stain intensity, and between the number of PNA receptors and DNA ploidy level. The results show that neoplastic prostate tissues and high-grade intraepithelial prostatic neoplasias (PIN 2 _ 3) exhibit a significantly higher number of PNA acceptors than benign prostatic hyperplasias and low (PIN 1) grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the number of histochemically related PNA acceptors and <b>PSA</b> <b>immunostain</b> intensity.

40|$|The alpha- 2, 8 -linked sialic acid polymer (PSA) on {{the neural}} cell {{adhesion}} molecule (NCAM) is an important regulator of cell surface interactions. We have examined the translocation of PSA-NCAM {{to the surface of}} cultured cortical neurons and insulin secreting beta cells under different conditions of cell activity. Endoneuraminidase N, an enzyme that specifically cleaves PSA chains, was used to remove pre-existing PSA from the plasma membrane and the re-expression of the molecule was monitored by immunocytochemistry. Punctate <b>PSA</b> <b>immunostaining</b> was restored on the surface of 68 % of neurons within 1 h. This recovery was almost completely prevented by tetrodotoxin, suggesting that spontaneous electrical activity is required. K+ depolarization (50 mM) allowed recovery of PSA surface staining in the presence of tetrodotoxin and this effect required the presence of extracellular Ca 2 +. Rapid redistribution of PSA-NCAM to the surface of beta cells was observed under conditions that stimulate insulin secretion. Ca 2 + channel inhibition decreased both PSA-NCAM expression and insulin secretion to control, non-stimulated levels. Finally, subcellular fractionation of an insulin-secreting cell line showed that the secretory vesicle fraction is highly enriched in PSA-NCAM. These results suggest that PSA-NCAM can be translocated to the cell surface via regulated exocytosis. Taken together, our results provide unprecedented evidence linking cell activity and PSA-NCAM expression, and suggest a mechanism for rapid modulation of cell surface interactions...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate CTC detection and phenotyping as prognostic biomarkers for response to primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) of metastatic prostate cancer (PC). METHODS: PC patients presenting with a prostate specific antigen (PSA) > 80 ng/ml and/or metastatic disease, intended for ADT were enrolled in the study. CTCs were analysed for expression of PSA prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) before and three months after ADT and related to progression. RESULTS: At inclusion, 46 out of 53 patients (87 %) were CTC-positive with a sensitivity and specificity for distant metastases (M 1) of 98 % and 75 %, respectively. In patients with M 1 -disease, EGFR-detection in CTC was an independent prognostic marker for progression-free survival, <b>whereas</b> <b>PSA</b> and alkaline phosphatase serum levels, Gleason score, or T-stage were not. EGFR-positive patients had significantly shorter time to progression (5 months) compared to EGFR-negative patients (11 months) (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Dickoppf- 1 (DKK- 1) is a {{negative}} regulator of bone formation with tumorigenic potential. The up-regulation of DKK- 1 is an early event in prostate cancer (PCa) development, thus we investigated {{its role as a}} marker in the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa. Methods. We retrospectively enrolled 159 patients who underwent prostate biopsy, either for elevated PSA or suspect digital rectal examination, between 2003 and 2010. During the biopsy, one serum sample was collected from all patients; PSA and DKK- 1 were measured by ELISA technique. Amongst the biopsy of 159 patients 75 were affected by PCa and 84 were not the mean period of follow-up for these patients was 5 years; a new biopsy was performed in case of PCa suspicion. Results: PSA performed better than DKK- 1 in detecting PCa (0. 63 vs 0. 51 respectively). Differently from PSA DKK- 1 was significantly higher in patients who developed PCa during follow-up than in cancer-free ones, thus DKK- 1 performed better than PSA in detecting these patients (0. 67 vs 0. 55). DKK- 1 was significantly lower in patients with bone metastases, <b>whereas</b> <b>PSA</b> was not significantly different in patients with different outcomes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{recent studies}} serum levels of human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK 2) {{demonstrated}} {{significant differences in}} pathologically organ-confined versus non-organ-confined prostate cancer (PCa). In this study we investigated whether hK 2 adds independent information when considered together with traditionally used parameters to predict organ confined (pT 2 a/b) PCa. METHODS: Serum levels of hK 2, total and free prostate-specific antigens (PSA) were obtained one day before radical prostatectomy in 245 consecutive men. These were included with clinical stage and biopsy Gleason grade into univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: pT 2 a/b PCa was found in n = 148 patients. In univariate analysis all preoperative parameters demonstrated significant association {{with the presence of}} pT 2 a/b PCa. Using multivariate logistic regression model hK 2 (P = 0. 022), clinical stage (P < 0. 0001), and Gleason grade (P < 0. 0001) were independent predictors of pT 2 a/b PCa <b>whereas</b> <b>PSA</b> (P = 0. 3) was not.

Methods Needle arthroscopy of an inflamed knee joint was performed in patients with early untreated BD (n = 8) and PsA (n = 9). Synovial fluid (SF) was collected for cytokines, perforin, and granzyme analysis. Eight synovial biopsies per patient were obtained for immunohistochemical analysis of the cellular infiltrate (T cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, B cells, plasma cells, mast cells, and neutrophils), blood vessels as well as expression of perforin and granzyme. The stained slides were evaluated by digital image analysis. Results The global degree of synovial inflammation was similar in the two types of arthritis. In the analysis of the innate immune cell infiltration, there was a striking neutrophilic inflammation in BD synovitis <b>whereas</b> <b>PsA</b> displayed significantly higher numbers of cells positive for c-kit, a marker of mast cells. As for lymphocytes, CD 3 (+) T cells, but neither CD 20 (+) B cells nor CD 138 (+) plasma cells, were significantly increased in BD versus PsA. Further analysis of the T-lymphocyte population showed no clear shift in CD 4 /CD 8 ratio or Th 1 /Th 2 /Th 17 profile. The SF levels of perforin, an effector molecule of cytotoxic cells, displayed a significant four-to fivefold increase in BD.

40|$|AIMS: High {{intensity}} focused ultrasound (HIFU) is {{an emerging}} alternative {{for the treatment}} of prostate adenocarcinoma. Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) {{has been shown to be}} a sensitive immunomarker for prostate cancer, however, there is no information available concerning its utility and that of other immunomarkers for the detection of malignancy after HIFU therapy. METHODS: AMACR expression was examined in 11 cases of prostatic carcinoma treated by HIFU, with histological evidence of residual carcinoma. In seven cases tumour was examined from thin core biopsies and in four cases from tissue fragments obtained by transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). In addition to AMACR, immunostaining was also undertaken for p 63, cytokeratin 34 betaE 12, cytokeratin 5, cytokeratin 8 - 18, prostate specific alkaline phosphatase (PSAP), prostate specific antigen (PSA), chromogranin and CD 56. RESULTS: In two of the cases foci of tumour were cut out in serial sections. AMACR was expressed in eight of nine evaluable cases (4 / 5 biopsies and 4 / 4 TURP specimens). Cytokeratin 8 - 18 and PSAP were positive in all cases, <b>whereas</b> <b>PSA</b> was positive in five of nine cases.

[...] - METHODS: Paired PBMC and SFMC samples of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; n[*]=[*] 10) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA; n[*]=[*] 10), and PBMC of healthy controls were cultured to assess osteoclastogenic potential by the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) -positive osteoclasts (OCs) and expression of OC-related genes (receptor activator of nuclear factor-κΒ (RANK), cFMS, and TRAP). Osteoclastogenesis was correlated with the arthritis-related inflammatory indicators in serum and synovial fluid (SF).

We aimed to study the effect on prostate volume and symptoms of shifting to monotherapy in patients who previously received a combination therapy. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was conducted of 60 patients who were diagnosed with BPH. Patients were aged 45 years or older and had a prostate volume of 30 cc or more, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of 12 or above, maximal flow rate (Qmax) of 15 ml/s or less, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of less than 10 ng/ml. The patients initially received a combination therapy of doxazosin 4 mg/day and finasteride 5 mg/day for 3 months and were then randomly assigned to receive monotherapy for 3 months. The factors were then compared. Results: A total of 30 patients were assigned to doxazosin (group 1) and 30 to finasteride (group 2) after the combination therapy. The percentage changes in prostate volume, IPSS, and Qmax during the period from post-combination therapy to post-monotherapy were not significantly different between the two groups (p= 0. 052, 0. 908, 0. 081), <b>whereas</b> <b>PSA</b> significantly decreased in group 2 (p< 0. 001). IPSS was not significantly different at post-combination therapy and at post-monotherapy in both groups (p= 0. 858, 0. 071).

Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to compare predictive performances of PSA, PSA density (PSAD; PSA/prostate volume), PZPSAD (PSA/PZ volume), and TZPSAD (PSA/TZ volume) for detecting PCa and high-grade PCa for each group. Results: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was higher for PSAD than for PSA in the 5 ARI group (0. 751 vs. 0. 677) and in the 5 ARI-naïve group (0. 649 vs. 0. 582), respectively (P< 0. 001). In the 5 ARI group, the AUC for PZPSAD was even higher than that for PSAD (0. 781 vs. 0. 751, P= 0. 038); in the 5 ARI-naïve group, however, PZPSAD failed to achieve significant superiority (0. 652 vs. 0. 649, P= 0. 321). All volume-adjusted PSA indexes showed higher predictive accuracies for detecting PCa than did PSA in both groups. For detecting high-grade cancer, PZPSAD also revealed the highest predictive value in the 5 ARI group, <b>whereas</b> <b>PSA</b> revealed the highest predictive value in the 5 ARI-naïve group. Conclusions: The diagnostic performance of PSAD in the detection of PCa is superior to that of PSA. For patients receiving 5 ARI for more than 6 months, PZPSAD confers additional benefits for detecting both PCa and high-grade PCa...|$|R

To determine its value with respect to predicting response to treatment and time to clinical progression. Finally to compare TPS with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements in terms of prognostic impact in patients with metastatic prostatic carcinoma. TPS and PSA measurements were performed before start of and monthly during intermittent MAB in 68 patients participating in EORTC protocol 30954. Both TPS and PSA were measured in serum. Fifty-six patients from eight centers {{were included in the}} final analysis because at least three TPS values were available. TPS and PSA values were correlated with clinical course of the disease. Median follow-up was 21. 3 months. Three patient groups were defined on clinical grounds: (a) clinically progressive disease (n= 18); (b) clinically stable disease (n= 33); and (c) patients who did not reach a predefined nadir PSA value following 9 months of treatment (n= 5). Pretreatment TPS was significantly higher in the clinically progressive patients than in the other patient groups (p= 0. 0041). When grouping patients according to their pretreatment TPS values (cut-off value of 100 U/l) the pretreatment TPS value (> 100 U/l) proved to be a statistically significant prognostic factor with respect to time to progression: elevated TPS was associated with a 3. 8 increased risk for progressive disease (p= 0. 0055). Pretreatment PSA (> 100 ng/ml) was of no prognostic value for time to progression. In five patients increase of TPS coincided with or preceded clinical progression during treatment, <b>whereas</b> <b>PSA</b> remained normal. Additional value of pretreatment TPS measurements in metastatic prostate cancer patients is found in defining the patients with rapid clinical progression. Following MAB an increase in TPS signifies clinical progression even if PSA is found to remain norma...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{parametric}} schedu-lability analysis of distributed real-time systems scheduled by fixed pri-ority. We propose two different approaches to parametric analysis. The first one is a novel analytic technique that extends single-processor sen-sitivity analysis to the case of distributed systems. The second approach is based on model checking of Parametric Stopwatch Automata (PSA) : we generate a PSA model from a high-level description of the system, and then we apply the Inverse Method to obtain all possible behaviours of the system. Both techniques have been implemented in two software tools, and they have been compared with classical holistic analysis on two meaningful test cases. The results show that the analytic method provides results similar to classical holistic analysis in a very efficient way, <b>whereas</b> the <b>PSA</b> approach is slower but covers the entire space of solutions. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline by 50 % {{from the}} {{baseline}} to 12 weeks (PSA 50 w 12) is currently {{used to predict}} response to treatment and clinical outcome of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We evaluated the association between PSA changes at 4 weeks and clinical outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had PSA levels assessed at baseline, and monthly during enzalutamide treatment. Early PSA increase {{was defined as a}}n increased PSA level at 4 weeks ? 20 % (PSA + 20 w 4) from baseline. Early PSA decline was defined as a PSA response at 4 weeks ? 30 % (PSA 30 w 4) and ? 50 % (PSA 50 w 4) from baseline. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The impact of early PSA increase and decline on PFS and OS was evaluated by Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: We assessed 193 patients with median age of 73 years (range 43 - 91 years). The median follow-up was 11. 7 months (range 0. 5 - 27. 4 months). PSA + 20 w 4 predicted both PFS and OS [HR 6. 50 (95 % CI 2. 63 - 16. 07; p < 0. 0001) and HR 10. 54 (95 % CI 4. 02 - 27. 64; p < 0. 0001), respectively], <b>whereas</b> <b>PSA</b> 30 w 4 and PSA 50 w 4 predicted only PFS [HR 0. 37 (95 % CI 0. 21 - 0. 67; p = 0. 0009) and HR 0. 34 (95 % CI 0. 19 - 0. 60; p = 0. 0003), respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: An early PSA increase, defined as a PSA level at 4 weeks ? 20 % (PSA + 20 w 4), could be useful to quickly identify patients unlikely to benefit from enzalutamide. Larger studies are needed to confirm PSA + 20 W 4 as an early biomarker of primary resistance to enzalutamide...|$|R
40|$|The role of pollen in {{disseminating}} Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) in kiwifruit orchards {{was investigated}} and {{the survival of}} the pathogen as an epiphyte on leaves and fruits was followed, from pollination time until the pre-harvest season. Pollen with natural inoculum was obtained from an infected orchard and pollen harvested without any contamination by Psa was experimentally inoculated at approximately the same contamination level. Two pollination techniques were used in glasshouse experiments: dusting and spraying. In parallel, field trials in commercial orchards were carried out: two plots were designed in two orchards, where bacterial canker was present at low incidence. From petal fall to 3 weeks before harvesting, leaf and fruit samples were taken and analysed for the presence of Psa, using two different PCR protocols and direct isolation. Results confirmed the dissemination of Psa through pollen, especially when using the aqueous suspensions. Both in glasshouse experiments and in the orchards Psa was found as an epiphyte for several weeks after pollination. Pathogen populations on leaves were, initially, 10 to 100 times less than on fruitlets. As the summer continued, the epiphytic contamination levels of fruits decreased constantly, being no more detectable from early August, <b>whereas</b> <b>Psa</b> was present at detectable levels on leaves until early October, approx. 20 days before harvesting time. Our results confirmed the role of pollen in disseminating Psa, the long epiphytic survival of the pathogen on kiwifruit leaves and the increasing unsuit­ability of fruits to harbour detectable, epiphytic populations of the bacterium through the summer season in commercial orchards with low disease incidence, when they are reaching the final development stage. Thus, kiwifruit surfaces {{do not appear to be}} a suitable niche for a long term survival of Psa as an epiphyte and, therefore, kiwifruits should not represent a pathway for Psa dissemination and pose a negligible risk for the introduction of the pathogen into new areas. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Neuroendocrine (NE) {{cells are}} androgen-independent cells and secrete growth-modulating neuropeptides via a {{regulated}} secretory pathway (RSP). We studied NE differentiation after androgen withdrawal in the androgen-dependent prostate cancer xenograft PC- 310. Expression patterns of chromogranin A, secretogranin III, and prohormone convertase- 1 were analyzed at both protein and mRNA level {{to mark the}} kinetics of NE differentiation both in vivo and in vitro. PC- 310 tumor-bearing nude mice were killed at 0, 2, 5, 7, 14, and 21 days postcastration. PC- 310 C cultures initiated from collagenase-treated tumor tissue could be maintained up to four passages, and androgen-deprivation experiments were performed similarly. PC- 310 tumor volumes decreased by 50 % in 10 days postcastration. Proliferative activity and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum levels decreased to zero postcastration, <b>whereas</b> <b>PSA</b> levels in PC- 310 C culture media first decreased and subsequently increased after 5 days. In vivo, androgen receptor (AR) expression decreased initially but returned to control level from 5 days postcastration on. CgA, secretogranin III, and secretogranin V expression increased in vivo from 5 days postcastration on. Subsequently, prohormone convertase- 1 and peptidyl alpha-amidating monooxygenase {{as well as the}} vascular endothelial growth factor were expressed from 7 days postcastration on, and, finally, growth factors such as gastrin-releasing peptide and serotonin were expressed in {{a small part of the}} NE cells 21 days postcastration. The PC- 310 tumors did not show colocalization of the AR on the NE cells in the tumor residues after 21 days. As in the PC- 310 xenograft, NE differentiation was induced and AR expression relapsed after prolonged androgen suppression in PC- 310 C. For PC- 310 C cells, this relapse was associated with the secretion of PSA. PC- 310 C is the first culture of human prostatic cancer cells having the NE phenotype. The PC- 310 model system is a potential androgen-dependent model for studying the role of NE cells in the progression of clinical prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation of NE-differentiated prostate cancer may induce the formation of both NE- and AR-positive dormant tumor residues, capable of actively producing NE growth factors via a RSP, possibly leading to hormone refractory disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{prostate}} is {{a target}} {{organ of the}} GH and IGF-I axis because prostate hypertrophy is found in acromegaly, reduced prostate size is found in GH deficiency (GHD) patients, and additionally, IGF-I {{is reported to be}} a positive predictor factor of prostate cancer. To investigate whether GH replacement therapy in adult patients with GHD has adverse effects on the prostate, we studied the effect of 12 -month GH or GH plus testosterone replacement on prostate pathophysiology in 24 adult patients with GHD (11 euandrogenemic and 13 hypoandrogenemic), compared with 24 age-matched healthy controls. At study entry, GHD patients had lower prostate volume than controls (19. 4 +/- 1. 7 vs. 24. 9 +/- 1. 7 ml; P = 0. 03). After 12 months of treatment, all hypoandrogenemic patients achieved normal testosterone levels, and prostate volume increased in the patients to the same level as controls (25. 0 +/- 1. 9 ml). The percentage increase in prostate volume was greater in hypoandrogenemic patients receiving both GH and testosterone replacement (51 +/- 11 %) than in those receiving GH replacement alone (15 +/- 3 %; P < 0. 0009). At baseline, prostate volume was similar in GHD patients below or above 60 yr of age (16. 8 +/- 1. 3 vs. 23 +/- 3. 6 ml; P = 0. 08), whereas after treatment it was higher in the latter patients (21. 8 +/- 1. 2 vs. 29. 5 +/- 3. 9 ml; P = 0. 04). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and free PSA did not change, <b>whereas</b> <b>PSA</b> density was significantly reduced after treatment in hypoandrogenemic patients; there was also no change in calcifications, cysts, or nodules. In conclusion, GH replacement restores prostate size to normal in both young and elderly patients, with no increase in prostate abnormalities. Because the simultaneous treatment with GH and testosterone induces an increase of prostate size by 50 % of baseline on average, care is suggested in elderly patients with prostate hyperplasia to avoid any risk of prostate symptoms. In these cases, GH replacement might be performed sequentially to reduce the hypertrophic effect of combining GH and testosterone...|$|R

40|$|Esta comunicación da cuenta de una investigación empírica que estudia qué tienen en común los artículos de investigación de la ciencia y los artículos de divulgación de la ciencia. Se analizan los atenuadores en los artículos de investigación y los marcadores fáticos, conativos y los elementos poéticos en los artículos de divulgación. Constituyen las dos caras de una misma moneda: la relación entre autor y lector, o relación metadiscursiva, fuertemente unida al concepto de tenor (Halliday 1978). Así, el metadiscurso es un aspecto pragmático común a ambos tipos de texto o géneros, vistos como constructos sociales (Gazdar 1981, Fairclough 1992, 1995). Ambos deben gustar a la audiencia mediante distintas estrategias pragmáticas con el fin de persuadir. My paper gives {{account of}} an {{empirical}} research {{carried out in}} an attempt {{to bridge the gap between}} research articles (RAs) and popular science articles (PSAs) from the viewpoint of metadiscourse. Both hedges in RAs and phatic, conative and poetic elements in popular science articles are two faces of metadiscourse, tightly linked to Halliday's tenor (Halliday, 1978), alluding to the interpersonal macro-function of language. Therefore, metadiscourse can be viewed as an essential aspect in the pragmatic handling of the two above mentioned genres. A view of these genres as social constructs is, therefore, central to my study (Gazdar, 1981; Swales, 1990; Fairclough, 1992, 1995). RAs and PSAs, although differing in their generic macrostructure, share part of their communicative goal: they must please their audience. RAs aim entails persuading and convincing their scientific communities, <b>whereas</b> <b>PSAs</b> purpose is to inform, entertain and persuade an audience partly made of lay public. Aim of the research: Towards that end, I have compared the use of hedges in RAs and of phatic, conative and poetic elements in PSAs, as the major and most prototypical devices that integrate their metadiscourse. The aim has been to trace the linguistic resources displayed in both genres, seeking some homogeneity or difference that can provide a sound account of their common metadiscursive core, thus depicting the nature of the relational pressure from their respective tenors. Method: A cross-generic and an intra-generic comparison have been conducted. On the one hand, hedges have been analysed in RAs, following Salager-Meyer's (1994) and Hyland's (1998 a, 1998 b) classification proposals, attempting thus to establish their specific representational choice. On the other hand, following the tenets of Jakobson's language functions, I have searched and described the linguistic encoding of phatic, conative and poetic functions (Jakobson, 1971, 1985), analysing PSAs morfosyntactic, lexico-semantic and stylistic levels. An English language corpus has been collected, with 15 texts for each genre, making a total of 30. Results and conclusions: Results have shown that RAs display a quantitatively greater use of metadiscursive resources than PSAs, epistemic and auxiliary verbal forms accounting for the most representative choices made through the hedging phenomenon. This would indicate that the relational pressure with the tenor in RAs suggests a rich and powerful metadiscourse, mainly achieved through politeness strategies that cater for the required self-concealment and objectivity. PSAs metadiscourse analysis evidences a quantitatively lower number of devices and relies mainly on pronominal forms of self-reference which provide a strong discourse subjectivity, meeting in this way the tenor's requirement for persuasiveness...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a simple one-step dual-label immunoassay for simultaneous {{measurement of the}} free, noncomplexed form of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total PSA. The assay is based on time-resolved fluorescence and includes a stable fluorescent chelate of Eu to label a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that detects only free <b>PSA,</b> <b>whereas</b> a second mAb labeled with a fluorescent chelate of Tb provides equimolar detection of both free PSA and PSA complexed to alpha 1 -antichymotrypsin. A third mAb on a solid phase captures the free and complexed forms of PSA in an equimolar fashion. The simultaneous measurement of the free-to-total PSA ratio (F/T) with the one-step dual assay is not sensitive to variations in the sample volume. The discrimination between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer patients, i. e., the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, increased from 0. 64 (total PSA assay) to 0. 78 and 0. 81 when the F/T ratio was measured with single and dual assays, respectively...|$|R
