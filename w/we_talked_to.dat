500|$|According to the prosecutor's case, al-Ekri {{acted as}} the group's ringleader, {{organizing}} staff at Salmaniya {{to oppose the}} Bahraini government. Al-Ekri was well known in Bahrain previous to the uprising for a January 2009 trip to the Gaza Strip to provide aid to Palestinians during the Gaza War. On his return, he received a number of awards, including one from the king. After his arrest, Al-Ekri stated {{that he was being}} persecuted for his comments to the media about police violence: [...] "They know we witnessed all the crimes of the regime and we stood strong by injured people and <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the media ...

A lot of the actors came in to the room as we were starting this season and Bernthal was one of those actors. He was aware {{of a lot of the}} things that were coming up and <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him about his character and what we had planned for him this season and he was on board with a lot of it. It was nice being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character. Because actors, a lot of times, think about their characters more than the writers because they’re focused on that single character for months of their lives, if not years. He was all prepared for this." ...|$|E
500|$|UT {{running backs}} Henry Melton and Ramonce Taylor also {{received}} criticism. Taylor {{was criticized for}} running backwards and sideways {{in an effort to}} gain yards, instead of moving ahead and breaking tackles. The Daily Texan observed [...] "Five of Taylor's 15carries resulted in a loss or no gain for a total of minus-17yards. However, the other 10carries totaled 119yards for an average of 11.9yards per positive running play. The sophomore didn't have a positive gain of fewer than 5yards and accumulated three runs of 20yards or longer." [...] Greg Davis, UT's offensive coordinator, said [...] "Ramonce is a darter. The only time that really concerned me was a third-and-two situation. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him on the sideline about a little bit more down and distance awareness." [...] Melton was criticized for [...] "tiptoeing indecisively". and letting himself get tackled near the line of scrimmage.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, while filmmaker Julie Anne Robinson directed it. Featured music includes Psapp's [...] "King of You", The Whitest Boy Alive's [...] "Fireworks", Iain Archer's [...] "Canal Song", Miho Hatori's [...] "Barracuda" [...] and Sybarite's [...] "Runaway". Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with the idea of getting this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you do with that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E

It's true. When we decided let's do vampires and werewolves, we thought that concept's been done. Of course it's been done. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> our agent, we went on the Internet, we looked at everything, and outside of the 50s, it just hasn't been done.

60|$|I told Atkins all this, and {{he heard}} me with great earnestness; but {{it seemed as if}} he turned off the {{discourse}} to the rest, for he said to me he would go and have some talk with his wife; so he went out a while, and <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> the rest. I perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion, as much as I was when I went rambling away from my father; yet there were none of them backward to hear what had been said; and all of them seriously promised that they would talk with their wives about it, and do their endeavours to persuade them to turn Christians.|$|E
60|$|I {{sent off}} Cothope with a dummy note to Woking, because I {{did not want}} to {{implicate}} him, and took my uncle to the pavilion. I went down to my aunt, and made a clean breast of the situation. She became admirably competent. We went into his dressing-room and ruthlessly broke his locks. I got a pair of brown boots, a tweed suit and a cap of his, and indeed a plausible walking outfit, and a little game bag for his pedestrian gear; and, in addition, a big motoring overcoat and a supply of rugs to add to those I had at the pavilion. I also got a flask of brandy, and she made sandwiches. I don't remember any servants appearing, and I forget where she got those sandwiches. Meanwhile we talked. Afterwards I thought with what a sure confidence <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> each other.|$|E
60|$|Of course, we {{must now}} leave Chedcombe; and when <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Poplington about it {{he said there}} was two places the English went to for their rheumatism.

As soon as I heard of Bath I was on pins and needles to go there, for in all the novel-reading I've done, which has been getting better and better in quality since the days when I used to read dime novels on the canal-boat, up to now when I like the best there is, I could not help knowing lots about Evelina and Beau Brummel, and the Pump Room, and the fine ladies and young bucks, and it would have joyed my soul to live and move where all these people had been, and where all these things had happened, even if fictitiously.|$|E

You see, a rather big farmer came in one day {{and spent most of}} the morning examining our seeders and pointing out their defects. Then he inquired why we had the assurance to demand so much for our implement when he could buy a very much better one several dollars cheaper. I asked him if he was sure of that, and when he said he was I suggested that it would be considerably wiser to go right away and buy it instead of wasting his time and mine. The proprietor desired to know how we expected him to make a living if <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> customers like that, and I pointed out that we couldn't do so anyway by answering insane questions." ...|$|E

You see, the colored church in Thorbury has just got a new minister, and he has to board somewhere; and as soon as Phoebe heard that, she made up her mind to take a house and board him; and she did it before anybody else could get the chance. Mike, her husband, who works for us, talked to her and <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her, but it wasn't of any use. I think she considers it one of the greatest honors in the world to board a minister. Mike does not believe in that sort of business, but he says that Phoebe has always been in the habit of doing what she wants to, and he is getting used to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{were more}} decorous, or rather more awkward now, {{and the party}} began with a formal period when the boys {{gathered}} in a group and pretended indifference to the girls. The girls were cleverer at it, and actually achieved {{the impression that they}} were indifferent. We kept an eye on them, uneasily, while <b>we</b> <b>talked.</b> <b>To</b> be in Nancy's presence and not alone with Nancy was agonizing, and I wondered at a sang-froid beyond my power to achieve, accused her of coldness, my sufferings being the greater because she seemed more beautiful, daintier, more irreproachable than I had ever seen her. Even at that early age she gave evidence of the social gift, and it was due to her efforts that we forgot our best clothes and our newly born self-consciousness. When I begged her to slip away with me among the currant bushes she whispered:--"I can't, Hugh. I'm the hostess, you know." ...|$|E

6000|$|Some French writer that I read when I was a boy, {{said that}} the desert went {{into the heart of}} the Jews in their wanderings and made them what they are. I cannot {{remember}} by what argument he proved them to be even yet the indestructible children of earth, but it may well be that the elements have their children. If we knew the Fire Worshippers better we might find that their centuries of pious observance have been rewarded, and that the fire has given them a little of its nature; and I am certain that the water, the water of the seas and of lakes and of mist and rain, has all but made the Irish after its image. Images form themselves in our minds perpetually as if they were reflected in some pool. We gave ourselves up in old times to mythology, and saw the Gods everywhere. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> them face to face, and the stories of that communion are so many that I think they outnumber all the like stories of all the rest of Europe. Even to-day our country people speak with the dead and with some who perhaps have never died as we understand death; and even our educated people pass without great difficulty into the condition of quiet that is the condition of vision. We can make our minds so like still water that beings gather about us that they may see, it may be, their own images, and so live for a moment with a clearer, perhaps even with a fiercer life because of our quiet. Did not the wise Porphyry think that all souls come to be born because of water, and that [...] "even the generation of images in the mind is from water"? ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was near}} {{the end of a long}} summer day when we arrived at a small hamlet of about a dozen cottages on the edge of an {{extensive}} wood--a forest it is called; and, coming to it, we said that here we must stay, even if we had to spend the night sitting in a porch. The men and women <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> all assured us that they did not know of anyone who could take us in, but there was Mr. Brownjohn, who kept the shop, and was the right person to apply to. Accordingly we went to the little general shop and heard that Mr. Brownjohn was not at home. His housekeeper, a fat, dark, voluble woman with prominent black eyes, who minded the shop in the master's absence, told us that Mr. Brownjohn had gone to a neighbouring farm-house on important business, but was expected back shortly. We waited, and by and by he returned, a shabbily dressed, weak-looking little old man, with pale blue eyes and thin yellowish white hair. He could not put us up, he said, he had no room in his cottage; there was nothing for us but to go on to the next place, a village three miles distant, on the chance of finding a bed there. We assured him that we could go no further, and after revolving the matter a while longer he again said that we could not stay, as there was not a room to be had in the place since poor Mrs. Flowerdew had her trouble. She had a spare room and used to take in a lodger occasionally, and a good handy woman she was too; but now--no, Mrs. Flowerdew could not take us in. We questioned him, and he said that no one had died there and there had been no illness. They were all quite well at Mrs. Flowerdew's; the trouble was of another kind. There was no more to be said about it.|$|E
