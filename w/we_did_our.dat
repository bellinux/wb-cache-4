Kavner {{described}} the show as, [...] "like being back in school, {{a chance to play}} a wide variety of characters, some really vicious people, to not rest on laurels, to not play it safe". Kavner commented, [...] "What I do is not mimicry or an impersonation, but more of an assimilation. [...] {{we did a lot of}} looking at people to find out who to base our characters on. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>our</b> homework on our lunch hour." [...] She received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Best Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Strange Bird, unlike its brief chart history, was overwhelmingly positive. The enthusiastic response even caught the band by surprise; Williams told Rip It Up [...] "I {{could see a}} few holes in the album and I'd say, 'how come {{no one else has}} picked this up?'" [...] Reviewers, however, focused on the positives; Guy Garvey of The Independent said [...] "My favourite of the year is Augie March's Strange Bird", while David Fricke wrote in Rolling Stone of [...] "luxuriant melees of chiming guitars, mountain-stream voices and keyboard grandeur". Donovan said the band found it hard to take the positive reviews too seriously; [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>our</b> heads would explode or overinflate", he told Beat.|$|E

[...] Madigan attempted to seamlessly mesh the visual effects with the physical sets and depend less on CGI. A friend told Madigan that after seeing the pilot, [...] "he didn’t see any vfx shots, even though there are dozens of shots throughout episode 1.

500|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1997, Blink-182 would enter an {{extended}} period of touring to support their second studio album, Dude Ranch. The group had played a handful of dates on the Vans Warped Tour 1996, a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music. However, upon Dude Ranch release and popularity, Blink-182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with the bands NOFX and Social Distortion. The group were gone from their hometown of San Diego for nearly nine months straight beginning in late 1997. [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>our</b> longest tour stretch, it was right when I started dating my fiancee," [...] recalled vocalist/guitarist Tom DeLonge.

500|$|Fincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt {{spent months}} {{interviewing}} witnesses, {{family members of}} suspects, retired and current investigators, the only two surviving victims, and the mayors of San Francisco and Vallejo. Fincher said, [...] "Even when <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>our</b> own interviews, we would talk to two people. [...] One would confirm some aspects of it and another would deny it. Plus, so much time had passed, memories are affected and the different telling of the stories would change perception. So when there was any doubt we always went with the police reports". During {{the course of their}} research, Fincher and Fischer hired Gerald McMenamin, an internationally known forensic linguistics expert and professor of linguistics at California State University Fresno, to analyze the Zodiac's letters. Unlike document examiners in the 1970s, he focused on the language of the Zodiac and how he formed his sentences in terms of word structure and spelling.|$|E

As, however, the trophy is gone to Cardiff, there is no one who more heartily congratualtes them than the captain of the losers.

500|$|The new {{script was}} then pitched to the BBC. The pitch tape they made {{was based on}} the same pitch used by The Muppet Show. This was done as a tribute to it, with Miller arguing that when The Muppet Show did it, [...] "it just must have just knocked the socks off the people who saw it, because it's like nothing you've ever seen before, and we thought: 'Why fix what ain't broke, so <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>our</b> own very British version of that." [...] The {{producers}} liked it but did not fully understand what the show was about. Miller, Brown and a third writer, Daniel Peak began to write scripts over a period of four years. A pilot was eventually filmed and the BBC commissioned a full series, targeted at adults. Despite the adult nature, Miller did not want to make the show too crude. Eight episodes were filmed so as to spread the cost of making the series over each episode.|$|E

Who knows, House of Music could be the last Tony Toni Toné album." [...] The band remained committed to promoting the record into 1997, including a February 28 taped performance at VH1's Hard Rock Live special. According to Mercury vice president Marty Maidenberg, an international tour for the album had been planned by October 1996, with concert dates in Japan and the United Kingdom, but it never materialized. In November 1997, Saadiq told the Philadelphia Daily News [...] "there should have been like four singles from that album. You'll have to call Mercury on that. It went Platinum with no promotional tour. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>our</b> job and they made their money."

2500|$|A major {{technical}} issue {{was that of}} frame rate. Shiny set a target of maintaining a constant frame rate of at least 30fps at all times on all machines, and so they simply play-tested the game multiple times. Any moment when the frame rate dropped below 30, they either removed something from that particular part of the game, rewrote the graphics code, or altered the artwork until they could get the frame rate up to where they wanted without having to reduce the resolution or increase the pixel size. According to Bruty, [...] "We {{had no idea how}} fast we could get the engine when we started.

Today it didn't help." [...] Ferrari team principal Marco Mattiacci defended his team's strategy and did not believe anything specific prevented his team from finishing on the podium: [...] "Definitely the safety car didn't do any better for us, but the race is made of 60 laps. We squeezed the car as much as we could; the strategy from the pits was excellent. There were other variables we know we cannot control. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>our</b> best." [...] Boullier suggested Red Bull used coded messages to assist Ricciardo when they told Ricciardo to remain off the kerbing but stressed it was the FIA's task to investigate. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner spoke to Whiting for clarification because Ricciardo had battery damage from going over the kerbing. The sport's governing body confirmed they were satisfied with Red Bull's radio messages and stated the team abided by the regulations.|$|E

2500|$|Because sniper mode was a {{major part}} of the game, with the ability to zoom up to 100x, the team decided not to employ any of the usual {{techniques}} to limit pop-up, such as clipping and fogging. A major technical issue was that of frame rate. Shiny felt most PC games maintained frame rate by using big pixels in low resolution, which works as long as the game is not running SVGA mode. Based on their experiences developing for consoles, they wanted to take a different approach; using small pixels in high resolution. They set a target of maintaining a constant frame rate of at least 30fps at all times on all machines, and so they simply play-tested the game multiple times.
