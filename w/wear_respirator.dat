2500|$|The {{difference}} of the APF for air purifying negative pressure full-facepiece masks are not large. The difference between PAPR with helmets a few more. But measurements {{showed that the}} real effectiveness of RPD (at the workplace conditions) {{is strongly dependent on}} the conditions of their use, not only from the design, and this partly explains the difference in APF values. The APF for negative pressure half mask respirators are twofold. But this difference cannot be considered separately from recommendations for use of respirators. The use of half-face masks in the US is limited to 10 PEL for the [...] "worst case" [...] - work in the polluted atmosphere of 8 hours per day, 40 hours a week. But British experts took into account large experience of the use of negative pressure air purifying RPDs, and they concluded that to achieve continuous <b>wear</b> <b>respirator</b> 8 hours a day is impossible (because of the negative impact on the health of workers). For this reason, [...] they recommend to the employer to give the job to the workers so that they work in the polluted atmosphere not during entire shift, but only a part of the shift. The remaining time the employee needs to work in a non-polluted atmosphere (without the respirator). The fact that the employee is in a non-polluted atmosphere some part of working time provide additional protection of his health, and therefore, the requirements to the efficiency of the respirator may be less stringent.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the use of respiratory protective devices in New Zealand industry and the physiological costs the respirator imposes on the wearer. Two cross sectional surveys of respirator users were undertaken to determine the extent and nature of use or non-use in the working environment and which factors contribute most to non-use. Evidence is presented that indicated that non-use is common (50 % of those surveyed) and that difficulty breathing, thermal discomfort and difficulty communicating and seeing were all important reasons for non-use. In addition, it was found that <b>respirators</b> are <b>worn</b> for extended lengths of time and that many users believe that their work when <b>wearing</b> a <b>respirator</b> was physically demanding. Evidence is presented {{that this is not the}} case. The physical characteristics of respiratory protection in terms of resistance to airflow, weights and dead space volumes, were measured in a selection of commonly used respirators in NZ industry. It was evident that most pressure-flow relationships were below recommended limits for inspiratory and expiratory resistances and that some masks in particular, offered little external resistance to breathing. The physiological consequences of <b>wearing</b> <b>respirators</b> was examined in a series of studies measuring relationships in heart rate, oxygen consumption, ventilation, facial skin temperatures and perceived exertion, with and with-out subjects <b>wearing</b> <b>respirators</b> and at differing levels of external work. It was found that the respirator imposed little physiological strain (in terms of heart rate, gas exchange and minute ventilation), but that psycho-physiological sensations (perceived difficulty breathing and rated perceived exertion) increased significantly. In addition, increases in facial skin temperatures, particularly the lip temperature under the mask when worn, caused a sensation of thermal discomfort that may be the predominant cue that influences reasons for non-use. Finally, the incongruence between physiological and psychophysiological measures of distress was clearly demonstrated in this thesis. It is apparent that not only is a respirator a complex device, but the micro-climate it produces on the skin surface and the effect this has on an individuals' perception of discomfort, is also enigmatic...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Emergency {{physicians}} {{are at risk}} for infection during invasive procedures, and the respirators can reduce this risk. This study aimed to determine whether endotracheal intubation using direct laryngoscopes affected protection performances of respirators. Methods. A randomized crossover study of 24 emergency physicians was performed. We performed quantitative fit tests using respirators (cup type, fold type without a valve, and fold type with a valve) before and during intubation. The primary outcome was respirators’ fit factors (FF), and secondary outcomes were acceptable protection (percentage of scores above 100 [*]FF [FF%]). Results. 24 pieces of data were analyzed. Compared to fold-type respirator without a valve, FF and FF% values were lower when participants <b>wore</b> a cup-type <b>respirator</b> (200 [*]FF [200 - 200] versus 200 [*]FF [102. 75 – 200], 100 % [78. 61 – 100] versus 74. 16 % [36. 1 – 98. 9]; all P< 0. 05) or fold-type respirator with a valve (200 [*]FF [200 - 200] versus 142. 5 [*]FF [63. 50 – 200], 100 % [76. 10 – 100] versus 62. 50 % [8. 13 – 100]; all P< 0. 05).
