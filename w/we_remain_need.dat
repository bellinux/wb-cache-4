Still, the Palestinian Authority is seeking the support of other countries to send more money to help fix a budget deficit that is approximately $1.5 billion for 2012, and it is estimated that they need approximately $500 million more. Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian Authority spokesman, said, [...] "This $100 million is important and significant because it's coming from a leading Arab state, and this hopefully can be an example for other countries to follow... <b>We</b> will <b>remain</b> in <b>need</b> of external funding.

40|$|Growth and {{democracy}} represent two profound aspirations of mankind: prosperity and freedom. Their relationship endorses great interests among scholars, philosophers and even common citizens. This book {{is an attempt}} to offer empirical evidence, theoretical analysis and further perspectives on the effects of democracy on economic growth. As to the empirical evidence, over the last three decades democracy and growth have run in parallel, as most countries experienced a synergic success in improving both prosperity and freedom. Behind this evidence, though, <b>we</b> <b>remain</b> in <b>need</b> of further exploring the concepts of democracy and growth and their relation, especially {{in view of the fact}} that the econometric approaches seem to reach inconclusive results as to whether democracy fosters or hinders economic growth. The exploration is undertaken by addressing both political science and economics contributions to the understanding of the democracy/growth nexus. Thus, it is possible to clarify the theoretical paradox and to develop an original framework of analysis to address the issue. The analysis of this book highlights a core characteristic of the relationship between democracy and growth, namely: the nexus exists, it is strong, but it is indirect, channelled by institutions. Institutions – properly “unbundled” – are pivotal in the transmission of the effects of democracy on growth. The present book provides a framework for the analysis of the relationship between institutions, democracy and growth and it is proposed to scholars in the field of social sciences, post-graduate students and simply curious people. The exposition of the topics is maintained as plain as possible, and postpones technical and methodological issues in the Appendix...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{advances}} {{have been made}} in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mainly in that of Crohn's disease, but many questions still <b>remain.</b> <b>We</b> <b>need</b> to develop treatments that modify the disease. The use of immunomodulation using cytokines and anti-cytokines is an important step to achieve this goal. The standard is now the chimeric monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in Crohn's disease. These treatments, however, are associated with problems of immunogenicity and autoimmunity. Moreover a proportion of patients do not respond to treatment and we do not have measurements that predict response. The optimal use and the combined treatment with immunosuppression are under investigation. The safety of this treatment in the long-term is also not established. These costly drugs are not suitable for the management of mild to moderate Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). If it turns out that the antigenic drive of the inappropriate immune reaction is in the lumen of the gut changing the gut flora by using probiotics may be the way to go. status: publishe...|$|R
