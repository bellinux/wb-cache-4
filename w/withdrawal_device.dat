A pumping device in the blood path is operable to pump blood through the blood path from the blood <b>withdrawal</b> <b>device</b> to the blood return device. The monitoring device obtains pressure data from a pressure sensor arranged upstream of the pumping device in the blood path, and processes the pressure data for detection of a disruption of the blood path downstream of the pumping device, e. g. caused by VND (Venous Needle Dislodgement). The disruption is detected by evaluating presence/absence of cross-talk pulses at the pressure sensor, where the cross-talk pulses originate from one or more pulse generators in the extracorporeal blood processing apparatus and have propagated on a propagation path in a direction downstream of the pumping device through the blood return device, the blood vessel access and the blood <b>withdrawal</b> <b>device</b> to the pressure sensor...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} {{numerical}} calculation results are shown on dynamic behaviors of turbid current in the reservoir. With a {{large volume of}} the current, it flows down {{along the bottom of}} the reservoir, and the return current after clashing the dam contributes much on mixing of the turbid water with surroundings, causing prolonged turbidity in the reservoir. The mechanism implied possible treatments to reduce the volume of the turbid water. Numerical experiments indicate that successful purging the turbid water by a low layer outlet, such as a selective <b>withdrawal</b> <b>device,</b> reduces the period of turbid water by 88 %. Then, some calculations are conducted to improve the condition of sediment flow in reservoirs. The results suggest that the behavior of sediment flow can be controlled if the stratification condition or the outlet elevation in reservoirs can be changed.

In this study, a new approach based on focal-plane-array Fourier transform infrared (FPA-FTIR) microspectroscopy and multivariate data analysis was developed for the characterisation of some marine microorganisms. Cell and lipid compositions in lipid-rich marine yeasts collected from the Australian coast were characterised in comparison to a commercially available PUFA-producing marine fungoid protist, thraustochytrid. Multivariate classification methods provided good discriminative accuracy evidenced from (i) separation of the yeasts from thraustochytrids and distinct spectral clusters among the yeasts that conformed well to their biological identities, and (ii) correct classification of yeasts from a totally independent set using cross-validation testing. The findings further indicated additional capability of the developed FPA-FTIR methodology, when combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis, for rapid monitoring of lipid production {{in one of the}} yeasts during the growth period, which was achieved at a high accuracy compared to the results obtained from the traditional lipid analysis based on gas chromatography.

This study evaluated the effect of acute stress by road transportation on estrous behavior and ovulation, monitored by serum progesterone and cortisol concentrations in cows at the periovulatory period, using a crossover design. Eleven crossbred cows, divided into Control and Transport groups had their estrus cycle synchronized with GnRH, an intravaginal progesterone device, and cloprostenol. Thirty hours after <b>withdrawal</b> of the <b>device,</b> the animals of the Transport group were transported for 60 min by truck and those from the Control group remained at pasture. Ovarian ultrasound examination was performed every 12 h from <b>device</b> <b>withdrawal</b> until ovulation in every cow.

40|$|URL] Pentax-AWS {{system is}} a rigid {{indirect}} video laryngoscope with integrated tube guidance. Complications associated with this device are not well understood. We report two cases of epiglottis malposition during intubation with the Pentax-AWS. The standard technique of using the Pentax-AWS system involves direct elevation of the epiglottis for exposure of the vocal cords. The blade tip should be passed posterior to the epiglottis for laryngeal exposure, but pressure on the anterior surface of the epiglottis by the tip can rarely happen even during the correct maneuver. Although the Pentax-AWS provides clear images of the airway structures, it is sometimes difficult to observe the epiglottis continuously because the camera is located beneath the blade tip. Consequently, {{the view of the}} epiglottis from the camera may be impeded by the blade tip and may result in undiagnosed epiglottis malposition.

40|$|Oestrous {{synchronization}} involves synchronization {{of ovarian}} follicular turnover, new wave emergence, and finally induction of ovulation. The final step can be synchronized by the parenteral administration of either GnRH or oestradiol benzoate. This study investigated corpus luteum and follicular emergence after ovulation had been {{induced by the}} administration of either GnRH or oestradiol benzoate. The injection of oestradiol benzoate may have delayed {{the emergence of the}} first follicular wave subsequent to the induced ovulation; administration of oestradiol benzoate or GnRH lowered the progesterone rise so that the maximum dioestrous concentration of progesterone on Day 9 was lower when cows were treated during pro-oestrus compared to the spontaneously ovulating controls. One implication of findings from the present study is that induction of ovulation with either oestradiol benzoate or GnRH, administered 24 or 36 h after withdrawal of the CIDR device, respectively, may lower fertility.

Four groups of hinds (n = 7 - 8 per group) were treated with progesterone-impregnated intravaginal controlled internal drug-releasing (CIDR) devices for 12 days to synchronize estrus (CIDR <b>device</b> <b>withdrawal</b> = Day 0). Group 1 served as controls; group 2 received an i. m. injection of 0. 25 mg estradiol benzoate (EDB) at 72, 84, 96, and 108 h after removal of the device; group 3 received an i. m. injection of 1200 IU eCG at- 72 h; group 4 received both EDB and eCG treatments.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} how {{the timing of}} the administration of estradiol benzoate (EB) impacted the synchronization of ovulation in fixed-time artificial insemination protocols of cattle. To accomplish this, two experiments were conducted, with EB injection occurring at different times: at withdrawal of the progesterone-releasing (P 4) intravaginal device or 24 h later. The effectiveness of these times was compared by examining ovarian follicular dynamics (Experiment 1, n = 30) and conception rates (Experiment 2, n = 504). In Experiment 1, follicular dynamics was performed in 30 Nelore cows (Bos indicus) allocated into two groups. On a random day of the estrous cycle (Day 0), both groups received 2 mg of EB i. m. and a P 4 -releasing intravaginal device, which was removed on Day 8, when 400 IU of eCG and 150 ?g of PGF were administered. The control group (G-EB 9; n = 15) received 1 mg of EB on Day 9, while Group EB 8 (G-EB 8; n = 15) received the same dose a day earlier. Ovarian ultrasonographic evaluations were performed every 8 h after device removal until ovulation. The timing of EB administration (Day 8 compared with Day 9) did affect the interval between P 4 device removal to ovulation (59. 4 ± 2. 0 h compared with 69. 3 ± 1. 7 h) and maximum diameter of dominant (1. 54 ± 0. 06 a cm compared with 1. 71 ± 0. 05 b cm, P = 0. 03) and ovulatory (1. 46 ± 0. 05 a cm compared with 1. 58 ± 0. 04 b cm, P < 0. 01) follicles. In Experiment 2, 504 suckling cows received the same treatment described in Experiment 1, but insemination was performed as follows: Group EB 8 -AI 48 h (G-EB 8 -AI 48 h; n = 119) and Group EB 8 -AI 54 h (G-EB 8 -AI 54 h; n = 134) received 1 mg of EB on Day 8 and FTAI was performed, respectively, 48 or 54 h after P 4 device removal. Group EB 9 -AI 48 h (G-EB 9 -AI 48 h; n = 126) and Group EB 9 -AI 54 h (G-EB 9 -AI 54 h; n = 125) received the same treatments and underwent the same FTAI protocols as G-EB 8 -AI 48 h and G-EB 8 -AI 54 h, respectively; Continue Continuation however, EB was administered on Day 9. Conception rates were greater (P < 0. 05) in G-EB 9 -AI 54 h [63. 2 % (79 / 125) a], G-EB 9 -AI 48 h [58. 7 % (74 / 126) a] and G-EB 8 -AI 48 h [58. 8 % (70 / 119) a] than in G-EB 8 -AI 54 h [34. 3 % (46 / 134) b].

The animals were randomly divided into three groups: exposure to progesterone for 14 days (Control, n= 12); 12 h extension of progesterone exposure (12 hP 4 group, n= 11); and 12 h extension, associated with the administration of 25 μg of gonadorelin acetate (12 hP 4 GnRH group, n= 11). From the 12 th to the 15 th day of protocol, 133 mg of pFSH were administered through eight decreasing doses. Artificial inseminations were performed 36 and 48 h after <b>device</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> using frozen/thawed semen. The number of ewes on estrus and the time to onset of estrus after withdrawing device were similar among between all groups (P> 0. 05).

Cows (n= 227), 60 - 80 days postpartum, received estradiol benzoate (5 mg) and a vaginal device containing 250 µg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; day 0). On day six, cloprostenol (125 µg) and eCG (400 IU) were administrated and calves were weaned for 88 h. The devices were removed on day seven (BioRep group) or on day eight (TAI group). All cows of TAI group and cows of BioRep group that did not exhibit standing estrus received GnRH (100 µg) on day 9. In experiment I, the follicular growth was monitored daily by transrectal ultrasound exams, from day 6 to day 9. The average size of the dominant follicle on day nine was 11. 1 ± 0. 99 mm (BioRep, n= 7) and 11. 5 ± 0. 65 mm (TAI, n= 7) and all animals ovulated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{conventional}} X-rays and CT-scan in detecting peri-prosthetic osteolytic lesions, a major concern after total ankle replacement (TAR). METHODS: We prospectively assessed 50 patients (mean age 56 years), consecutively operated on by the same senior surgeon, between 2003 and 2006 and with a mean follow-up period of 4 years (range, 2 - 6. 2). The component used was AES total ankle replacement. The etiologies for total ankle arthroplasty were: posttraumatic in 50 %, osteoarthritis secondary to instability in 36 %. Plain radiographs were analyzed by 4 independent observers, using a 10 -zone protocol (location) and 5 size categories. RESULTS: At 4 -year follow-up, all patients had been CT-scan assessed with the same protocol by 2 independent observers. Plain radiographs showed dramatic progression of severe periprosthetic lyses (> 10 mm) : from 14 % to 36 % of interface cysts for the tibial component respectively at 2 and 4 -year follow-up and from 4 % to 30 % for the talar implant. The talar component was more accurately assessed by CT-scan (mean frontal and sagittal talar lesion: from 270 mm 2 to 288 mm 2 for CT-scan versus 133 mm 2 to 174 mm 2 for X-rays). For tibial cysts, axial views showed larger lesions (313 mm 2 than frontal (194 mm 2) or sagittal (213. 5 mm 2) views.

40|$|Background: the undue {{resistance}} to intrauterine device (IUD) use seen in several settings {{does not seem}} to occur in the Family Planning Unit of UNIFESP-EPM (São Paulo Federal University, Brazil). in fact, the Copper T 380 A IUD in this clinic has reached an outstanding importance and this motivated us to present our differing experience. the prevalence of this method in this clinic is as high as 40 %. This contrasts to the low use {{in the rest of the}} country, where tubal ligation is by far the most used contraceptive method (40 %) and where IUD is inexpressive (1. 1 %). Study Design: This is a retrospective study of the records of 118 users of Copper T 380 A IUD inserted at the clinic and who were followed during 5 years. Results: the cumulative pregnancy rate was 0. 8 %. the main cause for discontinuation of the study was loss to follow-up (21. 3 %). Other reasons for the <b>withdrawal</b> of the <b>device</b> were personal option (13. 6 %), dislocation (11. 7 %) and pregnancy wish (3. 4 %). There was no withdrawal by pelvic inflammatory disease. Bleeding (0. 8 %) was not an important cause for withdrawal, and there were no withdrawals due to pain. the continuation rate at 5 years was 46. 7 %. The structured service and an adequate educative program perhaps could explain at least partially the good performance of IUD use in this clinic. There was an amazing prevalence of the components of the metabolic syndrome. This could represent contraindications for hormonal contraception, and, in consequence, it could influence the increased option for and continuation of the IUD. Conclusion: These data show a good performance of the IUD for long duration, in relation to other studies, and this should be considered as a reliable alternative to the high prevalence of female sterilization in this Country.

However, {{in order to avoid}} paravenous injection, it is mandatory to check for blood withdrawal before administering medication: this simple procedure confirms both the system’s patency, correct needle position in the chamber and the catheter tip’s intravascular location. This study’s objective was to evaluate the incidence of partial and total blood withdrawal impairment in TIVADs directly after accessing the port system. Material and Methods: From November 2003 to March 2004, nurses from 20 hospitals in Flanders (Belgium) agreed {{to take part in a}} prospective cohort study and collect data on TIVAD access procedures in cancer patients. In case of blood <b>withdrawal</b> problems or <b>device</b> occlusion, they recorded all actions needed for diagnosing the cause of the problem and restoring patency. In each hospital, TIVAD maintenance and solutions for troubleshooting were performed according to individual institutional protocols. Results: The data included 8685 accesses in 2853 patients. The incidence of blood withdrawal occlusion and total occlusion were 11. 11 % and 0. 24 % respectively. Overall incidence varied between hospitals from 3. 05 % to 28. 37 %. Nurses restored full device patency in 53. 25 % of cases, mostly by changing patients’ position or intrathoracic pressure, additional flushing and repositioning of the Huber needle in the port septum. In 83. 51 % of persistent occlusions, no further investigation into the cause of the functional impairment was undertaken. Thirty-one events of occlusion (3. 14 %) were treated by thrombolytics or device replacement. Altogether, blood aspiration was regained in 55. 17 %. Conclusions: Withdrawal and total occlusion problems occurred in 11. 35 % of TIVAD access and were resolved by nurses’ interventions in 53. 25 % of cases. The incidence expressed in function of the number of punctures reflects accurately the impact of this problem in daily practice. The differences between hospitals revealed that prevention of occlusion and established protocols for maintenance or troubleshooting solutions are important factors to maintain optimal TIVAD patency and deserves further analyses. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Together with cost {{inflation}} and stagnant market prices, the new 200 -nautical-mile regime {{has hit the}} conventional tuna and skipjack fishing industry very hard. Japanese countermeasures consist of domestic adjustments such as cost and risk-reducing <b>devices,</b> <b>withdrawals</b> of fishing vessels, employment of purse-seine fisheries, nearshore fishing ground adjustments, and demand expansion; and external strategies such as historical fishing rights, legal-Informal Composite Negotiating Text (ICNT), and bilateral arrangements. The Japanese claim on historical tuna and skipjack fishing rights in the EEZs and archipelagic waters of coastal states in Southeast Asia and the western central Pacific is based on 1) discovery of the fishing grounds by the Japanese, 2) risk-taking for development by the Japanese, 3) continuous and habitual Japanese fishing activities in the region, 4) long legal practices under the Japanese fisheries licensing system, and 5) {{the importance of the}} fishery. Although most coastal nations in Southeast Asia and the western central Pacific treat tuna and skipjack in their EEZs as their national properties, the position of the ICNT emphasizes that highly migratory species such as tuna and skipjack are managed by cooperation among the countries concerned and international cooperation is essential to manage those fishery wisely. Bilateral arrangements such as fee fishing and joint-ventures, associated with overseas cooperation, have been successful in terms of fishing access to the EEZs and archipelagic waters of coastal states in the region, but current arrangements become increasingly difficult due to coastal nations' desires to increase fishing fees and take part in joint-ventures. Emergence of subregional management schemes will become more important for dealing with highly migratory species like tuna and skipjack, but Japan is not yet ready for such schemes. The legal, political, and economic constraints on each of the strategies are numerous and combine to aggravate the problem. Although the Japanese government has committed to easing the adjustment of Japanese fishermen to the new ocean regime, the job is not easy. The problem involves not only the Japanese, but also coastal, resource-owning nations as well. Joint arrangements have many advantages over attempts by any one nation to go it alone. However, in order to arrive at successful arrangements, it is essential for each party to understand the interests, capabilities, and limitations of the other. A new international cooperation toward sound tuna and skipjack management can emerge only if each sets reasonable goals and recognizes a gradual growth process while seeking benefits for the welfare of both...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Urinary tract {{infections are}} the most {{frequent}} healthcare associated infections, being related to both high costs and morbidity.  Our intention was to carry out an epidemiological characterization of hospital acquired urinary tract infections that occurred in an internal medicine department of a Portuguese hospital. Material and Methods: Retrospective cohort study (historic cohort). Data were analysed from a systematic random sample of 388  patients, representative of the 3492 admissions occurred in 2014 in that department. Results: One in four patients underwent the placement of a bladder catheter [24. 7 % (n = 96); 95 % CI: 20 % - 29 %], 36. 5 % (95 % CI:  33 % - 48 %) of which {{in the absence of}} clinical criteria for that procedure. The global cumulative incidence rate for nosocomial urinary tract infections was 4. 6 % (95 % CI: 2. 5 % - 6. 7 %). Most hospital acquired urinary tract infections (61. 1 %) were related to bladder catheter use. We quantified 3. 06 infections / 1000 patient-days and 14. 5 infections / 1000 catheter-days. Catheter associated urinary tract infection occurred at an early stage of hospitalization. The vast majority of patients (66. 7 %) that developed a catheter associated urinary tract infection were subjected to bladder catheter placement at emergency department. Seventy one per cent of catheter associated urinary tract infection occurred in patients that were subjected to bladder catheter placement without criteria. Discussion: These results point to an excessive and inadequate use of urinary catheters, highlighting the need for judicious use taking into account the formal clinical indications. The incidence of catheter associated urinary tract infection is similar to what we found in other studies. Nevertheless we found a very high incidence density per catheter-days that may foresee a problem probably related to the absence of early <b>withdrawal</b> of the <b>device,</b> and to both bladder catheter placement and maintenance practices. A significant part of catheter associated urinary tract infection occurred in patients that had the bladder catheter placed in the emergency department, before the admission to the internal medicine ward, which highlights the need to assess the urinary catheterization practices in those departments. Conclusion: The high rate of catheter associated urinary tract infection that occurred in the absence of bladder placement indication reinforces the need to implement prevention strategies that contemplate the reduction of its use. Emergency departments should be part of quality improvement projects in this area. Causes for the early onset of catheter associated urinary tract infection in this cohort should be investigated...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{a number}} of {{guidelines}} issued in Anglo-American countries {{over the past few}} decades for forgoing treatment stating that there is no ethically relevant difference between withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatments (LST), it is recognized that many healthcare professionals in Japan as well as some of their western counterparts do not agree with this statement. This research was conducted to investigate the barriers that prevent physicians from withdrawing specific LST in critical care settings, focusing mainly on the modes of withdrawal of LST, in what the authors believe was the first study of its kind anywhere in the world. In 2006 - 2007, in-depth, face-to-face, semistructured interviews were conducted with 35 physicians working at emergency and critical care facilities across Japan. We elicited their experiences, attitudes, and perceptions regarding withdrawal of mechanical ventilation and other LST. The process of data analysis followed the grounded theory approach. We found that the psychosocial resistance of physicians to <b>withdrawal</b> of artificial <b>devices</b> varied according to the modes of withdrawal, showing a strong resistance to withdrawal of mechanical ventilation that requires physicians to halt the treatment when continuation of its mechanical operation is possible. However, there was little resistance to the withdrawal of percutaneous cardiopulmonary support and artificial liver support when their continuation was mechanically or physiologically impossible. The physicians shared a desire for a "soft landing" of the patient, that is, a slow and gradual death without drastic and immediate changes, which serves the psychosocial needs of the people surrounding the patient. For that purpose, vasopressors were often withheld and withdrawn. The findings suggest what the Japanese physicians avoid is not what they call a life-shortening act but an act that would not lead to a soft landing, or a slow death that looks 'natural' in the eyes of those surrounding the patient. The purpose of constructing such a final scene is believed to fulfill the psychosocial needs of the patient's family and the physicians, who emphasize on how death feels to those surrounding the patient. Unless withdrawing LST would lead to a soft landing, Japanese clinicians, who recognize that the results of withdrawing LST affect not only the patient but those around the patient, are likely to feel that there is an ethically relevant difference between withholding and withdrawing LST.

40|$|Stenting of carotid arteries is at {{risk for}} embolic {{complication}} with cerebral ischemia. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the prevalence, quality and clinical relevance of microembolism in 50 unselected patients with hemodynamic lesions of carotid bifurcations (> 70 % stenosis) submitted to 50 carotid artery stenting (CAS) from January 2005 to January 2006. Methods. High-resolution color-flow mapping (CFM), transcranial Doppler (TCD), cerebral computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) and 4 psychometric tests were carried out in the preoperative study in all the patients. Local anesthesia, 3 different carotid stents and 3 temporary distal filter protection devices, without predilatation, were employed. TCD monitoring was used intra- and 6 h postoperatively to evaluate the presence and the number of microembolic signals (MES) and to investigate the effectiveness of neuroprotective filter devices. The efficacy of the in situ opened filter was judged evaluating the decrease of mean blood velocity in ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the reduction rate of microembolic events. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) of the brain was obtained within 24 to 48 h after the procedures to detect new ischemic brain lesions. Psychometric tests were repeated before patientÕs discharge and after 2 months to evaluate cognitive faculties. Results. During postoperative period (30 days) and follow-up, no death or major strokes procedure-related occurred; 2 regressive minor strokes intraoperatively were recorded (4 %). TCD monitoring showed MES (60 events mean) in all the CASs (100 %). A 10 - 30 % decrease of mean blood velocity basal value was recorded in ipsilateral MCA when filter device was opened; mean 70 % reduction of MES was also detected for the time in which the cerebral protection system was working. In 5 patients repeated microemboli occurred during 1 h postoperative TCD control (10 %). Postoperative DWI detected new focal ischemic lesions in 22 patients (44 %), 5 ipsi- and/or contralateral lesions mean. Cognitive capability worsened in 18 patients (36 %). Conclusion. Isolated corpuscolated emboli were detected during cannulation of common carotid and internal carotid artery, introduction and <b>withdrawal</b> of protection <b>device</b> and during stenting and ballooning. The use of a protection device seems to be able to sensibly reduce the number of embolic event. New asymptomatic lesions were detected in the brain by DWI in the postoperative period with a weighty deterioration of cognitive capability in 1 / 3 of patients...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of gonadorelin (GnRH), used both {{at the outset of}} a timed artificial insemination (TAI) protocol to synchronize follicular wave recruitment and at the end to synchronize ovulation, on the conception rate (CR) in Nellore cows. The experiment was conducted on two beef cattle farms in the Vale do Araguaia, MT. The body condition score (BCS) evaluation and ultrasound examination to determine ovarian status [follicle diameter < 10 mm, ? 10 mm or presence of corpus luteum (CL) ] were performed at the beginning (Day 0) of the TAI protocol. Multiparous cows (n = 494) were subjected to the following protocol: Day 0 – insertion of intravaginal progesterone device (P 4 DIB®, MSD) previously used for 8 or 16 days and IM administration of 2. 0 mg of estradiol benzoate (EB, Gonadiol®, MSD); Day 8 – P 4 <b>device</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> IM injection of 300 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG, Folligon®, MSD), 1. 0 mg of estradiol cypionate (ECP®, Zoetis) and 0. 265 mg of Sodium cloprostenol (PGF 2 ?, Ciosin®, MSD); Day 10 – TAI, performed by a single inseminator. Animals were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four groups: control (n = 126), GnRH D 0 (n = 123), GnRH D 10 (n = 123) and GnRH D 0 + D 10 (n = 122). Animals treated with GnRH received 50 mcg of gonadorelin (GnRH, Cystorelin®, Merial). Pregnancy was diagnosed by ultrasound 39 ± 10 days after TAI. Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS program (P < 0. 05). The overall CR was 42. 71 %. Effect of treatment was not detected (P = 0. 2482) on CR, which was 36. 89 % ± 0. 19 (47 / 126) for the control group, 46. 08 % ± 0. 19 (56 / 123) for GnRH D 0, 48. 30 % ± 0. 18 (61 / 123) for GnRH D 10 and 38. 48 % ± 0. 19 (47 / 122) for GnRH D 0 + D 10. An effect of farm was detected; the CR was 47. 32 % ± 0. 13 at Farm A and was 38. 24 % ± 0. 13 at Farm B (P = 0. 0249). No effects of the interaction between farm and treatment were observed (P = 0. 7662), nor of those among ovarian condition and treatment (P = 0. 1225) on CR. Cows with follicles < 10 mm had lower CR (16. 44 % ± 0. 08; P = 0. 0001) than cows with follicles ? 10 mm (46. 15 % ± 0. 07) and cows with CL (48. 35 % ± 0. 07). It was concluded that GnRH used to both synchronize the follicular wave recruitment and synchronize ovulation as part of a TAI protocol, did not improve the conception rate in Nellore beef cows.   </p...|$|R
