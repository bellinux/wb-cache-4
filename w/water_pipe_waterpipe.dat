40|$|Background: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco {{smoking is}} {{spreading}} globally and is increasingly becoming {{popular in the}} United States, particularly among young people. Although many perceive <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking to be relatively safe, clinical experimental studies indicate significant exposures to tobacco smoke carcinogens following <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use. We investigated biomarkers of nicotine intake and carcinogen exposure from <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking in the naturalistic setting of hookah bars. Methods: Fifty-five experienced <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> users were studied before and after smoking <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> in their customary way in a hookah bar. Urine samples were analyzed for nicotine, cotinine, the tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanol (NNAL), and mercapturic acid metabolites of volatile organic compounds (VOC). Results: We found an average 73 -fold increase in nicotine, 4 -fold increase in cotinine, 2 -fold increase in NNAL, and 14 % to 91 % increase in VOC mercapturic acid metabolites immediately following <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking. We saw moderate to high correlations between changes in tobacco-specific biomarkers (nicotine, cotinine, and NNAL) and several mercapturic acid metabolites of VOCs. Conclusion: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking in a hookah bar is associated with significant nicotine intake and carcinogen exposure. Impact: Given the significant intake of nicotine and carcinogens, chronic <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use could place users at increased risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. © 2014 AACR...|$|R
40|$|Background: Smoking tobacco {{preparations}} in a <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> (hookah) {{is widespread}} {{in many places}} {{of the world and}} is perceived by many as relatively safe. Weinvestigated biomarkers of toxicant exposure with <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> compared with cigarette smoking. Methods: Weconducted a crossover study to assess daily nicotine and carcinogen exposure with <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarette smoking in 13 people who were experienced in using both products. Results: When smoking an average of 3 <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> sessions compared with smoking 11 cigarettes per day (cpd), <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use was associated with a significantly lower intake of nicotine, greater exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), and a different pattern of carcinogen exposure compared with cigarette smoking, with greater exposure to benzene, and high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), but less exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines, 1, 3 -butadiene, acrolein, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, and low molecular weight PAHs. Conclusions: A different pattern of carcinogen exposure might result in a different cancer risk profile between cigarette and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking. Of particular concern is the risk of leukemia related to high levels of benzene exposure with <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use. Impact: Smoking tobacco in <b>water</b> <b>pipes</b> has gained popularity in the United States and around the world.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of this habit on pulmonary function and exercise capacity indices among healthy Saudi adults. Procedures: Forty Saudi male subjects were selected. Their ages ranged from 18 - 25 years old. They were divided into two groups. In experimental group there were 20 subjects who were smoking <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> (21. 8 ± 2. 6) years while in the control group there were 20 subjects (20. 6 ± 1. 9) years. After recording detailed personal and smoking habit information, all subjects performed pulmonary function test and cardiopulmonary exercise test. Result: Statistical analysis showed significant reduction in pulmonary function test and exercise capacity indices variables (P= 0. 000), VC, FVC, FEV 1, MVV, VO 2 max among <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers than in non smokers.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking {{appears to}} be an {{increasing}} public health concern, with anecdotal reports of higher prevalence than cigarette smoking among young people in some high-income countries. We examined the prevalence and predictors of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarette smoking among students attending secondary schools in a deprived, ethnically diverse part of inner London. METHODS: We conducted a 96 -item, validated smoking habits questionnaire with 2, 399 students from Years 8, 10, and 12 / 13 from 15 secondary schools in Brent, northwest London. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of current and ever cigarette and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking. RESULTS: Current <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking prevalence was more than double that of cigarette smoking prevalence (7. 6 % vs. 3. 4 %, p <. 001). One in 4 students had tried <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> compared with 1 in 6 who had tried cigarette smoking (24. 0 % vs. 15. 8 %, p <. 001). Significant predictors of ever <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use include being in a higher age group, South Asian or Middle Eastern ethnicity, and personal, family, or friends tobacco use. Significant predictors of ever cigarette use include being in a higher age group, White ethnicity, and personal, family, or friends tobacco use.

40|$|Background: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> is a {{traditional}} method of tobacco use, which is epidemically spreading throughout Europe. There are scarce data {{about the use of}} <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and its relation to other addictive behaviors among young adults in Western countries. Objectives: It was our aim to identify the sociodemographic characteristics of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> users in Switzerland and to describe concurrent cigarette and cannabis smoking habits. Methods: Young adults aged 16 - 30 years were evaluated based on a 16 -item standardized questionnaire on tobacco consumption and exhaled carbon monoxide. Current <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking was defined as <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use at least once within the last 4 weeks; regular <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking was defined as <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use {{at least once a week}} during the last 52 weeks. Results: Out of 353 volunteers, a total of 204 subjects (mean age 21 ± 3. 5 years, 113 males) met the inclusion criteria for the study. A total of 78 % (n = 160), 30. 0 % (n = 55) and 3. 9 % (n = 8) reported ever, current and regular <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking, respectively. Males smoked more often than females: 2. 8 sessions/year (interquartile range 1. 1 - 8) versus 2 sessions/year (interquartile range 0 - 4; p = 0. 022). The major risk factor for ever smoking <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> was cigarette smoking (odds ratio 6. 22, 95 % confidence interval 2. 33 - 16. 62), followed by cannabis consumption (odds ratio 1. 44, 95 % confidence interval 1. 29 - 1. 62). Ever <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking was more common among current cannabis users (100 vs. 0 %; p > 0. 0001) and related to higher exhaled carbon monoxide values (6. 0 ± 9. 0 vs. 2. 1 ± 4. 6 ppm; p > 0. 001).

This study aimed to determine the predictors of nicotine dependence among women <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> consumers in Bushehr in 2013 - 2014. Methods: In this cross-sectional (descriptive and analytical) study, 430 women <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers were selected via simple sampling and snowball methods. A structured interview was conducted on 20 women <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> consumers in order to design a researcher-made questionnaire via appropriate statistical tests.

40|$|Background: Smoking tobacco {{preparations}} in a <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> (hookah) {{is widespread}} {{in many places}} of the world, including the United States, where it is especially popular among young people. Many perceive <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking to be less hazardous than cigarette smoking. We studied systemic absorption of nicotine, carbon monoxide, and carcinogens from one <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking session. Methods: Sixteen subjects smoked a <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> on a clinical research ward. Expired carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin were measured, plasma samples were analyzed for nicotine concentrations, and urine samples were analyzed for the tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 - butanol (NNAL) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolite biomarker concentrations. Results:We found substantial increases in plasmanicotine concentrations, comparable to cigarette smoking, and increases in carbon monoxide levels that are much higher than those typically observed from cigarette smoking, as previously published. Urinary excretion of NNAL and PAH biomarkers increased significantly following <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking. Conclusions: Absorption of nicotine in amounts comparable to cigarette smoking indicates a potential for addiction, and absorption of significant amounts of carcinogens raise concerns of cancer risk in people who smoke tobacco products in <b>water</b> <b>pipes.</b> Impact: Our data contribute {{to an understanding of}} the health impact of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use.

40|$|Background & Aim: Tobacco smoking exerts a {{harmful effect}} on the {{periodontal}} tissues manifested by periodontal pockets, attachment loss and periodontal bone loss. Current evidences {{on the effects of}} tobacco on periodontal health mainly concern cigarette smoking. In view of the increasing popularity of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking in Arabian countries and reports confirming that <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking has health effects similar to those of cigarette smoking, {{there is a need for}} a better understanding of the potential harm of this smoking habit. The present thesis was carried out in order to explore whether <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking is associated with periodontal health in a manner similar to cigarette smoking. Material & Methods: Residents in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia, were invited to participate in the study by means of announcements in two daily newspapers. 355 individuals, 100 women and 255 men (17 - 60 years) responded to a standardized questionnaire and digital panoramic dental radiographs were taken. The questionnaire included information about oral hygiene practices, dental care and smoking habits. Of these subjects, 262 (73 %) also volunteered for clinical examination, including assessments of oral hygiene, gingival inflammation and probing depth. Subgingival microbial test was carried out in 198 individuals for the detection of 12 different bacterial species most commonly associated with periodontal disease using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Participants were stratified into <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers 33 %, cigarette smokers 20 %, smokers of both <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarettes (mixed smokers 19 %) and non-smokers 28 %. Results: Tobacco smoking is associated with a suppression of the gingival bleeding response to plaque accumulation. A suppressive effect was observed in both cigarette and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers compared to non-smokers (Study I). Both cigarette and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking were associated with the presence of more than 10 pockets of ¡Ý 5 mm probing depth. The relative risk for periodontal disease was 5. 1 -fold and 3. 8 -fold increased in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarette smokers, respectively, compared to non-smokers (p < 0. 01). The relative risk associated with heavy smoking was about 8 -fold elevated in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and 5 -fold elevated in cigarette smokers, suggesting an exposure-response effect (Study II). Tobacco smoking was associated with a reduction of the periodontal bone height. The reduction was of similar magnitude in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and cigarette smokers. The relative risk of periodontal bone loss of more than 30 % of the root length was 3. 5 -fold and 4. 3 -fold elevated in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarette smokers, respectively, compared to non-smokers (p < 0. 01). The relative risk associated with heavy smoking was 7. 5 -fold elevated in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and 6. 3 -fold elevated cigarette smokers (Study III). Further more, cigarette smokers, <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and non-smokers exhibited similar periodontal microflora (Study IV). Conclusion: Tobacco smoking is associated with inferior periodontal health. The impact of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking is of largely the same magnitude as that of cigarette smoking. The association between tobacco smoking and an inferior periodontal health seems to be independent of the subgingival microflora. <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking habit should be considered in periodontal health...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: A <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> (hookah) is {{a tobacco}} smoking tool which {{is thought to}} be more {{harmless}} than a cigarette, and there are no adequate studies about its hazards to health. Water-pipe smoking is threatening health of the youth in the world today. The objective of this study has been to investigate the carbon monoxide (CO) levels in breath, examine the changes in pulmonary function tests (PFT) and to assess the change of the oxidative stress parameters in blood after smoking a <b>water</b> <b>pipe.</b> Material and Methods: This study is a cross-sectional analytical study that has included 50 volunteers who smoke a <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and the control group of 50 volunteers who smoke neither a cigarette nor a <b>water</b> <b>pipe.</b> Carbon monoxide levels were measured in the breath and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were performed before and after smoking a <b>water</b> <b>pipe.</b> Blood samples were taken from either the volunteer control group or water-pipe smokers group after smoking a <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> for the purpose of evaluation of the parameters of oxidative stress. Results: Carbon monoxide values were measured to be 8. 08 ± 7. 4 ppm and 28. 08 ± 16. 5 ppm before and after smoking a <b>water</b> <b>pipe,</b> respectively. This increment was found statistically significant. There were also significant reductions in PFTs after smoking a <b>water</b> <b>pipe.</b> Total oxidative status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) were found prominently higher after smoking a <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> for the group of water-pipe smokers than for the control group.

40|$|Introduction: Although <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco {{smoking is}} common in Lebanon and Syria, {{prevalence}} in neighboring Jordan is uncertain. The {{purposes of this study}} were (a) to assess the prevalence of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking among university students in Jordan and (b) to determine associations between sociodemographic variables and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking in this population. Methods: A trained interviewer administered a questionnaire among randomly selected students at four prominent universities in Jordan. The questionnaire assessed sociodemographic data, personal history of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco use, and attitudes regarding <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking. We used logistic regression to determine independent associations between sociodemographic and attitudinal factors and each of two dependent variables: ever use of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and use at least monthly. Results: Of the 548 participants, 51. 8 % were male and mean age was 21. 7 years. More than half (61. 1 %) had ever smoked tobacco from a <b>water</b> <b>pipe,</b> and use at least monthly was reported by 42. 7 %. Multivariable analyses controlling for all relevant factors demonstrated significant associations between ever use and only two sociodemographic factors: (a) gender (for women compared with men, odds ratio [OR] = 0. 11, 95 % CI = 0. 070. 17) and (b) income (for those earning 500 - 999 Jordanian dinar (JD) monthly vs. < 250 JD monthly, OR = 2. 37, 95 % CI = 1. 31 - 4. 31). There were also significant associations between perception of harm and addictiveness and each outcome. Discussion: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking is highly prevalent in Jordan. Although use is associated with male gender and upper middle income levels, use is widespread across other sociodemographic variables. Continued surveillance and educational interventions emphasizing the harm and addictiveness of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking may be valuable in Jordan. © The Author 2010.

Methods: A bronchoprovocation challenge with mannitol was performed in young adults recruited at the University of Basel, Switzerland. Subjects were categorized as acute <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers (single episode of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking, no or < 0. 5 pack-years cigarette smoking); chronic <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers (weekly for ≥ 4 weeks, no or < 0. 5 pack-years cigarette smoking); cigarette smokers (no <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers); and never-smokers (no cigarette or <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers). Primary outcomes were airway reactivity {{as measured by the}} response-to-dose ratio (RDR) and airway responsiveness measured by the provocation dose to cause a 15 % fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1; PD 15). Results: Seventy-four subjects {{with a mean age of}} 22. 5 ± 2. 5 years and FEV 1 % predicted 90. 1 %± 8. 6 % were included. Subgroups were matched in terms of age, gender, and spirometry results.

This thread helped and the water tower was being built in 1896. The water tower was taken into operation on 31 August 1896.
