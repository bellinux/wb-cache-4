In fact such reactors, in addition to energy generation, can also improve nuclear fuel exploitation and decrease nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>radiotoxicity</b> mainly by transmutation processes. Transmutation of Trans-Uranic nuclides (TRU) can be carried on in GEN-IV reactors mainly due to their neutronic behaviour and design features. An optimization of the burning process, by using different reactors chains (symbiotic cycles), has been analyzed in order to allow an efficient TRU transmutation with the aims to reduce <b>waste</b> <b>radiotoxicity,</b> optimize raw material exploitation and close nuclear fuel cycle...|$|E
40|$|Partitioning and {{transmutation}} (P&T) aims {{at making}} nuclear energy more sustainable {{from the viewpoint}} of the back-end of the fuel cycle by minimising the high-level waste with respect to its mass, radiotoxicity and (possibly) repository risk. P&T mainly deals with the management – i. e. transmutation and/or special conditioning and confinement – of minor actinides and fission products, but involves the closure of the fuel cycle for plutonium as a necessary first or parallel step. The conditions for a completely closed fuel cycle, the goals for transmutation, and the implications for the reactor and fuel cycle technology are overviewed and discussed, and the currently favoured transmutation strategies are compared with respect to achievable <b>waste</b> <b>radiotoxicity</b> reduction and impact on the releases of potentially troublesome actinides from a repository for vitrified high-level waste. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{molten salt}} reactor {{is one of}} the six {{concepts}} retained by the Generation IV forum in 2001. Based on the MSRE and MSBR concepts developed by ORNL in the 60 s which involve a liquid fuel constituted of fluorine molten salt at a temperature close to 600 8 C, new developments with innovative approach and technology have been realized which contribute to strongly improve the concept. The thorium breeder potentiality is closely related to the use of a liquid fuel which is able to be periodically treated. A reprocessing scheme has been established to treat used fuel by extraction of fission products. According to the Gen IV philosophy for closed cycle nuclear reactor, the actinides are sent back in the reactor core. In this way, the <b>wastes</b> <b>radiotoxicity</b> is strongly decreased and the use of natural resource is optimized. This paper describes an innovative reactor concept, the TMSR-NM (non-moderated thorium molten salt reactor), from the nuclear physic point of view and the different steps involving in the reprocessing scheme from the chemical point of view...|$|R

In contrast to fission waste, fusion waste will neither contain transuranium elements nor fission products. However, the waste will contain activation products and tritium. The {{management of the}} fusion waste {{will be an important}} issue when deciding on the realisation and siting of the facilities. This paper focuses mainly on waste from future fusion power reactor designs investigated within the European programme on the safety and environmental assessment of fusion power, long-term (SEAL). Comparisons are made with other energy producing systems on radioactive material produced, <b>radiotoxicity,</b> <b>waste</b> treatment, re-cycling, clearance, intermediate storage and waste disposal...|$|R
40|$|The waste {{materials}} {{generated in the}} nuclear fuel cycle are very varied,ranging from the tailings arising from mining and processing uranium ore, depleted uranium {{in a range of}} chemical forms, to a range of process wastes of differing activities and properties. Indeed, the wastes generated are intimately linked to the options selected in operating the nuclear fuel cycle, most obviously to the management of spent fuel. An open fuel cycle implies the disposal of highly radioactive spent fuel, whereas a closed fuel cycle generates a complex array of waste streams. On the other hand, a closed fuel cycle offers options for waste management, for example reduction in highly active <b>waste</b> volume, decreased <b>radiotoxicity,</b> and removal of fissile material. Many technological options have been proposed or explored, and each brings its own particular mix of wastes and environmental challenges...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{two fundamental}} issues of fuel cycle sustainability. The two primary issues of interest are {{efficient use of}} the natural uranium resource (cradle), and management of nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>radiotoxicity</b> (grave). Both uranium utilization and radiotoxicity are directly influenced by the burnup achieved during irradiation (transmutation related) and where applicable the separation efficiency (partitioning related). Burnup influences the in-growth of transuranics by breeding them into the fuel cycle. Transuranic breeding is virtually essential to resource sustainability because it increases utilization of naturally abundant fertile U- 238. However, the direct consequence of this build-up is the in-growth of transuranic isotopes which generally increase the source of future geologically committed radiotoxicity. For scenarios involving recycle, separation efficiency influences {{the degree to which}} this transuranic source term is removed from active service in the fuel stream and made a disposal legacy of human activity...|$|E
40|$|Using current technologies, we have {{demonstrated}} {{in this study}} that it is theoretically possible to obtain different minor actinide transmutation scenarios with a significant gain on the <b>waste</b> <b>radiotoxicity</b> inventory. The handling of objects with Am+Cm entails the significant increase of penetrating radiation sources (neutron and γ) whatever mixed scenario is envisioned; the PWR and FR scenario involving the recycling of Am + Cm in the form of targets results in the lowest flow. In the light of these outcomes, the detailed studies has allowed to: • design a target sub assembly with a high fission rate (90 %); • define a drawing up of reprocessing diagram with the plant head, the minor actinide separation processes (PUREX, DIAMEX and SANEX). Some technological difficulties appear in manipulating curium, principally in manufacturing where the wet process (“sol-gel”) is not acquired for (Am+Cm). 749 Objectives The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the performance of all the separation – transmutation scenarios chosen using conventional technologies.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Generation IV International Forum, six innovative concepts of nuclear reactors have been chosen as suitable for the future challenges of nuclear energy. Among these reactors, a renewed interest has been focused on the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), due to its unique capabilities for actinide burning and natural resource exploitation, while reducing the <b>waste</b> <b>radiotoxicity.</b> In MSRs, the molten salt serves both as fuel and coolant, leading to a complex and highly coupled physical environment. In this paper, a multi-physics modelling (MPM) approach is developed to study the dynamics of the entire MSR primary circuit, with reference to the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). As concerns the geometry, a single channel representative of the core average conditions is modelled considering a two-dimensional axial-symmetric domain. A further one-dimensional domain is implemented in order to model the external primary circuit. The proposed MPM approach provides careful estimates of the spatial distribution of the main physical quantities. Moreover, it allows to evaluate the particular dynamic behaviour of this reactor. In the present study, the MPM potentialities are shown analysing the system response under different transient conditions...|$|E
40|$|Accelerator Driven Systems (ADSs) are {{hybrid systems}} {{consisting}} of a high-intensity proton accelerator with beam energy {{in the hundreds of}} MeV range impinging on a target of a heavy element and coupled to a sub-critical core. The intense (of the order of 1015 n/cm 2 /s) and fast neutron fluxes produced by the spallation reactions triggered by the impinging protons in the target can be used to induce fission reactions in the actinides and capture reactions in the long-lived fission products in the fuel assemblies in the core of the system. ADSs have been considered during the last fifteen years as one of the promising technological solutions for the transmutation of nuclear <b>waste,</b> reducing the <b>radiotoxicity</b> of the high-level nuclear waste and hence reducing the burden to the geological repositories. The European Commission´s Green Paper entitled “Towards a European Strategy for the Security of Energy Supply ” clearly pointed out the importance of nuclear energy in Europe. With 145 operating reactors producing a total power of 125 GWe, the resulting energy generation of 850 TWh per year provides 35 % of the electricity consumption of the European Union. The Green Paper also points out that the nuclear industry has mastered the entire nuclear fuel cycle with th...|$|R
40|$|At present, the 125 GWe {{of nuclear}} power in the European Union produce about 3000 tons of spent fuel annually, {{containing}} about 25 tons of plutonium, 2. 5 tons of minor actinides (MA) and about 100 tons of fission products, of which 3. 1 tons are long-lived fission products. Actual reprocessing of LWR fuel and a first recycling as mixed plutonium and depleted uranium oxide fuel (MOX) in LWR already contribute to a significant reduction of <b>waste</b> volumes and <b>radiotoxicity.</b> However HTRs have some characteristics which make them particularly attractive: intrinsic safety, cost-effectiveness, reduced thermal pollution, capability of increasing energy availability (with the use of Pu-Th cycle) and of minimizing actinides radiotoxicity and volume of actinides. In this paper particularly the last item is investigated. Symbiotic fuel cycles of LWR and HTR can reach much better waste minimization performances. It happens because of the specific features of HTRs cores that leads to an ultra-high burnup and, last but not least, the ability to accommodate {{a wide variety of}} mixtures of fissile and fertile materials without any significant modification of the core design. This property is due to a decoupling between the parameters of cooling geometry and of neutronic optimization. In our calculations we considered a pebble-bed HTR using a Pu-based fuel (deriving from reprocessing of classical LWR fuel and/or weapons grade plutonium) at the maximum technological discharge burnup. As results, we find, at EOL (End Of Life), a relatively small amounts of residual Pu and MA produced in terms of quantities and of radiotoxicities. Furthermore we used in our calculations a different type of fuel based on a mixture of Pu and Th to try to optimize the previous results and to increase energy availability. Calculations have been done using MCNP-based burnup codes, capable of treating 3 -D complex geometry and ultra-high burnup...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{interest}} towards new energy forms {{is a common}} feature of many different studying fields: physics, engineering, economics and politics. The main reason is that human population is growing fast (there's a prevision of about nine billion people in 2050) and with it is increasing the energy request, both for the industrialized world and for the developing countries. This means that the actual organization of the energy market {{will not be able}} to satisfy the needs of the near future: clean energy for everybody. The International Energy Agency provided a "business as usual" scenario where is shown that by the year 2030 the world energy demand will be 70 % higher than now and the electricity demand would follow the same pattern, needing somewhat like 3475 GW of new electric power. The logic conclusion is that we'll need all the energy forms we know: fossil fuels, nuclear and renewable energy. Nowadays the energy - and particularly the electricity - market is facing large problems: global warming and dependence from OPEC countries (64. 4 % of world oil production comes from only 10 countries) for the fossil fuels; radioactive wastes and public non-acceptance for the nuclear energy; non-competitiveness for the renewables. The actual world electricity supply system can be so summarized: coal 38. 4 %; hydro 18. 4 %; nuclear 17. 7 %; gas 14. 8 %; oil 9. 3 %; others 1. 4 %. But things are going to change quite fast in the future, both for international policies and for intrinsic limits. Coal will remain one of the most important fuels, but his opportunity cost will grow because of the need of lowering his CO 2 emissions in respect of the Kyoto Agreements. Gas is going to improve its importance in the electricity generating market, thanks to its cleaner burning, but it is limited by the fact of being a meagre (scarce) resource. Hydropower has many exploitation possibilities in the developing countries, but not in the industrialized world where almost all the resources are already being used. Renewable energies are still too expensive to produce massive electricity and, in spite of public general acceptance, have shown to produce nearly as much polluting wastes if their complete cycle is considered. Nuclear energy, finally, finds its biggest limits in its relationship with public. In fact from the electricity generating cost point of view it is the cheapest form actually available. However problems with public come from: criticality accidents, radioactive wastes, plutonium traffic and poor knowledge and comprehension of the nuclear fuel cycle and engineering. From such analysis comes out the importance of Nobel Prize Rubbia's project of a new, clean and safe nuclear plant. The Energy Amplifier is an accelerator driven system which furnishes from the outside the energy that is necessary to start the nuclear reaction. The accelerator sends a proton beam into the reactor, here there is a spallation target (made up of lead) that creates neutrons. These neutrons, hitting the fuel's atoms (thorium), start the reaction in a completely safe way as into the Energy Amplifier the criticality factor is less the one, which means that to make the reaction happen there's the continuos need for an external neutrons source. Moreover Rubbia's Amplifier can also burn radioactive wastes (precisely transuranic wastes) and lower the general radioactivity of the remaining <b>wastes</b> (fission products' <b>radiotoxicity</b> is reduced of 200000 times by the end of the cycle). Uranium and plutonium traffic would be easily lowered by the fact that the Energy Amplifier reload operation happens one in five years. Finally, this reactor would be able to use the military plutonium coming from disarmament. The electricity generating cost, calculated over CERN's actual design (but the project is still under study so things could change a little), shows out to be the cheapest (20. 08 USmill/kWh) and particularly it is one half of the same cost for gas and about two thirds of actual nuclear power. It must be said that not everybody agrees with CERN's estimate, but even if the Energy Amplifier cost should be the same of a normal nuclear reactor (about 2450 US$/kWe installed) there would be such a gain in security and cleanness that it's opportunity cost would be the best. Now the real problem is to find the funds (about 1. 3 billion US dollars) to make such a project become reality or, at least, reach the stage of a full-scale experiment The point is: who and why should take the risks of financing it? The answer is not as clear as it seems: the cost is too high for a single State, the European Community has conflicting interests (by 2020 it's energetic autonomy will lower from 50 % to 30 %, but meanwhile there are different countries' positions towards traditional nuclear power, as shown by the enormous economical importance of nuclear power in France and by complete public opposition in Italy) and the private sector is hold back by the fact of getting any possible economic return not before ten - twenty years...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{strategies}} which {{carry on the}} main aim of minimizing MA (Minor Actinides) inventories, transmutation {{is one of the}} most. In fact, FR (Fast Reactors), in addition to energy generation, can also decrease nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>radiotoxicity</b> mainly by transmutation processes. The implementation of this strategy might be helped by some typical features of FR, as high neutron fluxes and high neutron capture cross-sections. Particularly GFR (Gas-cooled Fast Reactor) charged with some moderated DA (Dedicated Assemblies) could supply such requirements for transmutation process. Previously filled with MA, those DA are inserted in the active core pointing to the optimization and improvement in the reactor burning capability. Different configurations have been analysed to maximise reduction in MA amounts but with the constraint to maintain acceptable (from safety point of view) the β values. Two figures of merit have been adopted to evaluate the best solution: The ratio between the masses at EoC (End of Cycle) and at BoC (Beginning of Cycle) limited to the materials contained in DA and the same ratio considering the MA present in the whole core. Finally a “disposal” alternative option (with a longer storage time assumed before reprocessing MA) has been considered, too. Such preliminary optimization and the analysis of the obtained results are the main topics of the work...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the use of a {{symbiotic}} cycle in order to minimize the LWR <b>waste</b> <b>radiotoxicity,</b> improving, on the same line, previous work[1]. The obtained results could be considered rather positive. We will show what is possible to do in this field using new original symbiotic cycles, remarkably improving the previous results. To reach this goal, we investigated innovative fuel cycles by using the gas cooled reactors (both thermal and fast). Their very favourable neutronic economy, supported by an appropriated spectrum, allows to transmute/fission actinides, in particular transuranic ones. In this frame, we developed a strategy based on an original symbiotic fuel cycle. We assume to begin using, as normal, enriched uranium in LWRs. The second step deals with burning all the actinides recovered from LWRs spent fuel in HTRs. One of the major innovative results after this irradiation consists in the strong reduction of the neptunium which represents one of the greatest concerns in long term disposal. The last one consists in adding, as fuel in GCFRs, depleted uranium together with all the residual actinides of HTR spent fuel. As final result we obtain a reduction of the Level Of Mine Balancing Time (LOMBT) from 250000 [11] (LWR once through) to about 200 years (proposed symbiotic cycle). This research has to be considered in progress and needs of further confirmation mainly from a technological point of view...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{prediction}} of heavy actinide concentration in reactor fuel elements and to study {{the reduction of the}} long-term nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>radiotoxicity</b> by using transmutation, cross sections for neutron induced reactions are highly required by nuclear industry for many minor actinides. In this context, a new measurement of the Cm- 245 (n,f) cross section has been performed at the GELINA neutron facility of the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) in Gee], Belgium. This measurement was motivated by {{the fact that in the}} thermal region a strong dispersion between measurements is observed and in the resolved resonance region, only a few old measurements exist with in some cases a poor energy resolution. The energy of the neutrons is determined applying the time of flight method using a flight path length of about 9 m. In the present work, the incident neutron energy covers the resolved and unresolved resonance regions up to a few keV. A highly enriched Cm- 245 sample (98. 48 %) was mounted back-to-back with a B- 10 sample in the centre of a vacuum chamber together with two surface barrier detectors positioned outside the neutron beam. One detector measured the B- 10 (n,alpha) Li- 7 reaction products for the neutron flux determination, while the second one registered the Cm- 245 (n,f) fragments. In this way, the neutron flux can be determined simultaneously with the fission fragments. A control measurement has been performed replacing the Cm- 245 sample with a U- 235 sample in order to check that the well-known U- 235 (n,f) cross section can be reproduced. In comparison with previous Cm- 245 fission cross section measurements, our results show a nice improvement of the energy resolution, in particular below 20 eV. A new set of resonance parameters is determined using the evaluation code CONRAD which was recently developed by CEA-Cadarache...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFull {{recycling}} of transuranic (TRU) isotopes can in theory {{lead to a}} reduction in repository radiotoxicity to reference levels in as little as ∼ 500 years provided reprocessing and fuel fabrication losses are limited. However, over a limited timeframe, the radiotoxicity of the ‘final’ core can dominate over reprocessing losses, leading to a much lower reduction in radiotoxicity compared to that achievable at equilibrium. In Part I of this paper, TRU recycle over up to 5 generations of light water reactors (LWRs) or sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) is considered for uranium (U) fuel cycles. With full actinide recycling, at least 6 generations of SFRs are required in a gradual phase-out of nuclear power to achieve transmutation performance approaching the theoretical equilibrium performance. U-fuelled SFRs operating a break-even fuel cycle are not particularly effective at reducing repository radiotoxicity as the final core load dominates over a very long timeframe. In this paper, the analysis is extended to the thorium (Th) fuel cycle. Closed Th-based fuel cycles are well known to have lower equilibrium radiotoxicity than U-based fuel cycles but the time taken to reach equilibrium is generally very long. Th burner fuel cycles with SFRs are found to result in very similar radiotoxicity to U burner fuel cycles with SFRs for one less generation of reactors, provided that protactinium (Pa) is recycled. Th-fuelled reduced-moderation boiling water reactors (RBWRs) are also considered, but for burner fuel cycles their performance is substantially worse, with the waste taking ∼ 3 – 5 times longer to decay to the reference level than for Th-fuelled SFRs with the same number of generations. Th break-even fuel cycles require ∼ 3 generations of operation before their <b>waste</b> <b>radiotoxicity</b> benefits result in decay to the reference level in ∼ 1000 years. While this is a very long timeframe, it is roughly half that required for waste from the Th or U burner fuel cycle to decay to the reference level, and less than a tenth that required for the U break-even fuel cycle. The improved performance over burner fuel cycles is due to a more substantial contribution of energy generated by 233 U leading to lower radiotoxicity per unit energy generation. To some extent this an argument based on how the radiotoxicity is normalised: operating a break-even fuel cycle rather than phasing out nuclear power using a burner fuel cycle results in higher repository radiotoxicity in absolute terms. The advantage of Th break-even fuel cycles is also contingent on recycling Pa, and reprocessing losses are significant also for a small number of generations due to the need to effectively burn down the TRU. The integrated decay heat over the scenario timeframe is almost twice as high for a break-even Th fuel cycle than a break-even U fuel cycle when using SFRs, as a result of much higher 90 Sr production, which subsequently decays into 90 Y. The peak decay heat is comparable. As decay heat at vitrification and repository decay heat affect repository sizing, this may weaken the argument for the Th cycle...|$|E
40|$|Destruction of {{actinides}} in accelerator-driven subcriticals and in stand-alone critical reactors is {{of contemporary}} interest {{as a means}} to reduce long-term high-level <b>waste</b> <b>radiotoxicity.</b> This topical report is focused on the neutronic design challenges of a pure critical actinide transmuter. The key objectives of the design were set to be (1) the attainment of a high actinide burning rate comparable to that of the ATW and (2) the attainment of plausible reactor physics characteristics so that the reactor safety performance is at least comparable to that of traditional fast breeder reactors. The proposed conceptual design is a Pb-Bi cooled 1800 MWth-core with innovative streaming fuel assemblies that exhibits excellent reactivity performance upon coolant voiding, even for local voids in the core center. The core employs metallic, fertile-free fuel where the transuranics are dispersed in a zirconium matrix. The large reactivity excess at BOL is compensated by a system of double-entry control rods. The arrangement of top-entry and bottom-entry control rods in a staggered pattern allows the achievement of a very uniform axial power profile and a small reactivity change from CRD driveline expansion. Excellent void reactivity performance of the proposed design was demonstrated, together with other desirable features such as a very uniform power profile and tight neutronic coupling. A relatively long refueling interval of one and a half years is achieved using a two-batch refueling scheme. In terms of the TRU destruction rate per MWt per full power year the design is comparable to the accelerator-driven systems and other studied pure burner concepts based on sodium-cooled fast reactors. The effective delayed neutron fraction was found to be about 25 % less than that of typical oxide-fueled fast reactors, making the requirements on reactor control performance more demanding. The Doppler coefficient was found to be negative with a magnitude appreciably lower than the typical values of oxide fuels in sodium-cooled reactors, but comparable to the values observed in IFR cores with metallic U-Pu-Zr fuels. The fuel thermal expansion coefficient is also negative, having a magnitude approximately equal to the Doppler coefficient. The proposed core can also incinerate long-lived fission products with an efficiency of about 2. 6 % of the initial Tc 99 inventory per FPY – about the same as critical sodium-cooled pure burners under investigation elsewhere, but less than Tc 99 incineration efficiency claimed for accelerator driven systems, like ATW. The strategy of mixing Tc 99 uniformly in the fuel within the core at the expense of zirconium matrix was found to yield slightly better Tc transmutation efficiency than the use of designated fuel assemblies with zirconium hydride rods at the core periphery. Thermalized fuel assemblies are penalized by low neutron flux because of self shielding; in addition they increase capture to fission ratio in TRU nuclides in the adjacent fuel assemblies, worsening the TRU burning capability. The incineration of Tc 99 in fast spectrum in the rods placed on the core periphery appears to be a more promising alternative than transmutation in thermalized fuel assemblies.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the application of}} adjoint techniques to fuel cycle analysis, {{in order to provide}} a more accurate description of the effects of nuclides on reactor behaviour. Transmutation and decay processes change the composition of the fuel. Allowing for these changes makes it possible to create different fuel compositions that yield similar reactor behaviour. This approach can then be used to improve the sustainability of nuclear energy, for example by reducing the heat produced by radioactive waste. Chapter 2 reviews and extends the continuous fuel cycle model described in Ott and Borg (1980). This approach approximates the long-term behaviour of the reactor using an eigenvalue problem, removing the complexity associated with the discrete operating cycles. The model provides reasonable predictions of the behaviour of a sodium cooled fast reactor model, although extending it to include additional nuclides decreases the quality of the results significantly. The use of a constant power constraint in place of the reactivity constraint makes little difference to the results. Applying the model to a negative growth system gives worse results than those found for the breeder system, with the growth rate prediction being particularly poor. The effects of fuel cycle strategies such as different feed materials and recycling schemes on the negative growth system are also studied. Recycling additional actinides decreases the <b>waste</b> <b>radiotoxicity,</b> while including more light uranium isotopes in the feed material increases the amount of Pu- 239 and decreases the amount of other plutonium isotopes in the fuel. The double adjoint method is developed in chapter 3. This approach relies on using the nuclide worths found from an adjoint reactivity calculation as the source values for a time adjoint problem. This allows the contributions of nuclides present {{at the start of the}} burn-up period to the reactivity at the end of it to be determined. Combining this measure with reactivity worths found at the beginning of the burn-up period yields a method that can be used to produce a new fuel composition that gives very similar reactor behaviour to that seen with the original composition. This leads to a breeding gain definition that includes the effects of the feed material and that can be applied to non-equilibrium situations. The importance of including the effects of the compound material in the calculation is demonstrated. Results are found for both fast and thermal systems, with the indirect effects causing inaccuraciesin the worths of up to 50 % in the worst cases. The coupled perturbation theory proposed by Williams (1979) is used in chapter 4 to allow for the indirect effects that are neglected in chapter 3. Including the coupling to the flux allows for accurate results to be found for both the fast and thermal systems. The effects of studying a different response are also investigated, with the flux coupling having a larger effect on results for the Pu- 239 response than for the reactivity response. The scale of the coupling effect is illustrated by comparison between the values found using the coupled and uncoupled approaches. The use of longer burn-up periods increases the importance of the flux coupling. This implementation of the coupled model relies on an approximation to produce some of the multi-group cross sections, and it is expected that the use of more accurate data would improve the results. Chapter 5 {{describes the}} application of the coupled model to waste heat production. The model is used with fast and thermal systems, and the effects of different post burn-up decay periods are considered. The waste heat worths for different isotopes are found with no recycling, with plutonium recycling, and with uranium and plutonium recycling. Equivalent fuel compositions using plutonium from different sources are determined and the resulting waste heat is calculated, with the results showing that plutonium from lower burn-up sources tends to produce less waste heat, by up to a factor of 5 in the extreme cases. The effects of different recycling schemes on the waste produced by these fuels are determined, and both the waste heat per unit mass and the total waste mass are examined. The methods developed in this thesis demonstrate some of the potential uses of adjoint techniques in fuel cycle analysis. Quantifying how nuclides present at the beginning of the burn-up period affect the reactor behaviour at the end of the period allows a better comparison of fuels of different compositions. One possible application of such comparisons is demonstrated in the study of the waste heat produced by different fuels. There is a wide range of other possibilities, some of which are described in the recommendations given in the final chapter. RST/Radiation, Science and TechnologyApplied Science...|$|E
