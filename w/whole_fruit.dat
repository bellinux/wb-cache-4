Both S.thiersii and A.aureofloccosa have hollow stems but the latter has a more tapering stipe and the <b>whole</b> <b>fruit</b> body is yellower. A.silvifuga is another species that grows in similar locations in grassland in Texas and H. D. Thiers described the taste of both it and A. thiersii as being bitter. It can be distinguished by its darker coloration and more warted appearance.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{values of}} the {{composition}} and concentrations of trace metals and minerals in Boletus edulis tend to differ considerably, as the mushroom bioaccumulates different elements to varying degrees, and the element concentration in the fruit bodies is often {{a reflection of the}} element concentration of the soils from which they were picked. In general, B.edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium (1317 ppm), a trace mineral essential for good health, though the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low. <b>Whole</b> <b>fruit</b> bodies also contain 4.7μg of vitamin D2 per 100g dry weight. The relatively high ergosterol content (see next section) of the fruit bodies can make the mushroom nutritionally pragmatic for vegetarians and vegans, who would otherwise have a limited intake of vitamin D.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{was focused}} on study of low-molecular {{antioxidants}} present in various kinds of fruits, namely berries. In theoretical part detailed characterization of antioxidants studied in presented work and their biological effects are introduced. Further, principals of processing and storage of specified species of fruits are discussed. Changes observed during storage of specific fruits are described too. In practical part changes in content of selected antioxidants in berries were followed. As studied material strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, red and black currants were used. All kind of these fruits was stored in fridge for six months using several different kind of processing. Berries were stored as <b>whole</b> <b>fruits,</b> <b>whole</b> osmotically processed <b>fruits</b> by sucrose, raw pulp and sweetened pulp. At first, starting values of selected antioxidant parameters were measured in fresh fruits (ascorbate, total antioxidant activity, total phenolics, catechins and individual flavonoids). After freezing the same parameters were measured regularly in two month periods. As the most suitable method of fruit processing, with regard to antioxidant content, storage of the <b>whole</b> <b>fruits</b> or pulp can be recommended. Content of ascorbate decreased in all forms and species of the processed fruits during all the time of storage. Oppositely, the content of other studied antioxidants exhibited fluctuations or increasing trend. Sensory analysis was proved for the <b>whole</b> <b>fruits</b> and also for <b>whole</b> sweetened <b>fruits...</b>|$|R

40|$|Dry {{and mature}} tree fruits are a {{potential}} source of protein for goats in the semi-arid areas of southern Africa, but their chemical composition and feeding value is largely unknown. This study presents the chemical composition and in vitro fermentation of indehiscent <b>whole</b> <b>fruits</b> and separated seed and hull fractions from Acacia nilotica, Acacia erubescens, Acacia sieberiana, Acacia erioloba, Piliostigma thonningii and Dichrostachys cinerea trees. Results indicate that the N contents of <b>whole</b> <b>fruits</b> ranged between 13. 5 g/kg DM (A. nilotica) and 27. 1 g/kg DM (A. erubescens). Seeds had a higher N content than hulls for all tree species. A. nilotica, D. cinerea and P thonningii fruits had high levels of extractable phenolics (758, 458 and 299 g/kg DM, respectively). Soluble phenolics (SPh) and ytterbium precipitable phenolics (YbPh) levels were negatively correlated to in vitro gas production but positively correlated to in vitro organic matter degradability (iOMD). Partition factors for <b>whole</b> <b>fruits</b> at 48 h ranged between 3. 6 mg/ml for A. erioloba and 7. 8 mg/ml for A. nilotica. Seeds of A. erioloba, A. erubescens and P thonningii were consistently fermented more efficiently throughout the incubation period compared to their <b>whole</b> <b>fruits</b> or hulls. Estimating in vitro degradability of phenolic-rich substrates through filtration procedures can give erroneous results due {{to the loss of}} soluble phenolics, which are not necessarily degradable. The feeding value of fruits from D. cinerea and A. nilotica tree species may be reduced due to the presence of high levels of phenolics. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{case study}} on the {{relationship}} between energy density and weight loss in premenopausal women. The case study, Implications of Energy Density on Weight Loss, examined the relationship between the consumption of energy dense foods such as <b>whole</b> <b>fruits,</b> <b>whole</b> vegetables and fiber with weight loss. The case study examined four participants from the LITEN Up study, which focused on the effects of a diet and physical activity intervention on the reduction of risk factors for metabolic syndrome in sedentary, premenopausal (21 - 48 y), overweight (BMI 26 - 32 kg/m 2), abdominally obese (waist circumference [WC> 80 cm; 31. 50 in]), apparently healthy women. Two of the four participants were selected based on their responsiveness (≥ 1 lb/wk weight loss) to the intervention and were referred to as responders (R 1, R 2), while the remaining two participants were selected for their un-responsiveness (≤ 0. 5 lb/wk weight loss) to the intervention and were referred to as non-responders (NR 1, NR 2). The case study concluded that weight loss occurred with an increase in intake of <b>whole</b> <b>fruits,</b> <b>whole</b> vegetables and fiber.

Although fruit lambics are among the most famous Belgian fruit beers, the use of names such as kriek, framboise or frambozen, cassis, etc. does not necessarily imply that the beer is made from lambic.

500|$|Prices of durians are {{relatively}} high {{as compared with}} other fruits. For example, in Singapore, the strong demand for high quality cultivars such as the D24(Sultan), and Musang King (Mao Shan Wang) has resulted in typical retail prices of between S$8 to S$15 (US$5 to US$10) per kilogram of <b>whole</b> <b>fruit.</b> With an average weight of about , a durian fruit would therefore cost about S$12 to S$22 (US$8 to US$15).

60|$|Even among plants which {{trust to}} the {{involuntary}} services {{of animals in}} dispersing their seeds, a great many varieties of detail may be observed on close inspection. For example, in hound's-tongue and goose-grass, two of the best-known instances among our common English weeds, each little nut is covered with many small hooks, which make it catch on firmly by several points of attachment to passing animals. These are the kinds we human beings of either sex oftenest find clinging to our skirts or trousers after a walk in a rabbit-warren. But in herb-bennet and avens each nut has a single long awn, crooked near the middle with a very peculiar S-shaped joint, which effectually catches on to the wool or hair, but drops at the elbow after {{a short period of}} withering. Sometimes, too, the <b>whole</b> <b>fruit</b> is provided with prehensile hooks, while sometimes it is rather the individual seeds themselves that are so accommodated. Oddest of all is the plan followed by the common burdock. Here, an involucre or common cup-shaped receptacle of hooked bracts surrounds an entire head of purple tubular flowers, and each of these flowers produces in time a distinct fruit; but the hooked involucre contains the whole compound mass, and, being pulled off bodily by a stray sheep or dog, effects the transference of the composite lot at once to some fitting place for their germination.|$|E
