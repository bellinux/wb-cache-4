5000|$|An {{account of}} a dream about an {{encounter}} with the apparition of Joan Vollmer who {{was shot to death}} when her husband, William S. Burroughs, in a drunken stupor, decided to play William Tell with a shot glass. Ginsberg had been in Mexico City visiting the Bill and Joan only a short time before the shooting. He says {{at the beginning of the}} poem that he has returned to Mexico City. There he encounters Joan, and they talk about their friends: Jack Kerouac, Herbert Huncke, and someone named Kenney. Then, when Ginsberg realizes it is a dream and that Joan is dead, he asks more profound questions: [...] "what kind of knowledge have the dead? can you still love your mortal acquaintances? <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> of us?" [...] Ginsberg then sees a grave. This paratactical shift, according to Ginsberg, was a major breakthrough. [...] This breakthrough was integral in the development of what he would call his [...] "ellipse" [...] technique or the [...] "eyeball kick." [...] Ginsberg's study of haiku, Ezra Pound, Paul Cézanne, and the poetry of the Surrealists was also important in the development of this technique, but Ginsberg often pointed to [...] "Dream Record" [...] as a breakthrough poem. This was also the poem that Ginsberg sent to Kenneth Rexroth which Rexroth hated because he said it was too stilted. Rexroth told Ginsberg he should free up his voice, write from his heart. [...] Soon after that Ginsberg wrote Howl. Howl shows the effects of his earlier breakthrough: the [...] "eyeball kick," [...] for example, is employed throughout the poem.|$|E

I am sure most of you can relate. For example, did you take swimming lessons, tennis lessons, or attend basketball or baseball camp? Did your teacher or coach urge you to practice at least one hour a day? And do you remember your parents saying, “You can’t expect to improve (or make the team) without prac-ticing. ” Now that I am a parent, I also hear myself saying such things to my daughter as she takes tumbling and dance lessons.

Up stood Tauilo, and addressed the spirit in Sina's foot, and scolded it, and the spirit answered and promised to be a good boy and go away. I do not feel so much afraid of the demons after this. It was Faauma told me about it. I was going out into the pantry after soda-water, and found her with a lantern drawing water from the tank. [...] "Bad spirit he go away," [...] she told me.|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, women {{simultaneously}} {{balance the}} roles of mother, parental carer and worker. However, individual role balance strategies among these working ‘sandwich’ generation women have not been thoroughly explored. Eighteen women combining these three roles were interviewed about their individual role balance strategies. Findings were identified through the framework analysis technique, underpinned by the Model of Juggling Occupations. Achieving and maintaining role balance was explained as a complex process accomplished through a range of strategies. Findings revealed the women used six within-role balance strategies: living with integrity, being the best <b>you</b> can, <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> love, loving <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>remembering</b> why and searching for signs of success. The women also described six between-role balance strategies: maintaining health and wellbeing, repressing perfectionism, managing time and energy, releasing responsibility, nurturing social connection and reciprocating. These findings {{provide a basis for}} health care providers to understand and potentially support working ‘sandwich’ generation women...|$|R
40|$|<b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> {{from the}} {{economics}} class you took in college? Even if you didn’t take economics, what basic ideas {{do you think}} are important for understanding the way markets work? In either case, one thing you might {{come up with is}} that when the demand for a good rises—when more and more people want more and more of that good— its price will tend to increase. This basic piece of economic logic helps us understand the phenomena we observe in many specific markets—from the tendency of gasoline prices to rise as the summer sets in and people hit the road on their family vacations, to the tendency for last year’s styles to fall in price as consumers turn to the new fashions. This notion paints a picture of the price of a good moving together in the same direction with its quantity—when people are buying more, its price is rising. Of course supply matters, too, and thinking about variations in supply— goods becoming more or less plentiful or more or less costly to produce— complicates the picture. But in many cases such as the examples above, we might expect movements up and down in demand to happen more frequently than movements in supply. Certainly for goods produced by a stable industry in an environment of little technological change, we would expect that many movements in price and quantity are driven by movements in demand, which would cause price and quantity to move up and down together.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to find out elementary students knowledge about the environment, their attitudes towards helping the environment and what they actually have done to help the environment. Specifically, during the northern spring of 2002 all grade- 4 and grade- 5 students in one public elementary school in Miami-Dade County, Florida were administered the Children's Environmental Attitude and Knowledge Scale (CHEAKS) instrument. In 2002, some students in both grade levels interviewed each other in pairs to determine why they answered the way they did on the CHEAKS instrument. In the interviews, students discussed what they had been taught in school, compared to what they had learned outside of school that was related to the environment. The following year, during the northern spring of 2003, all grade- 4 and grade- 5 students in the same elementary school were given the CHEAKS instrument. Students at the elementary school were also asked questions which they answered in writing. These included: Which questions on the survey did you feel were difficult?; <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> learning about environmental education in school, at home or elsewhere? In addition, some gifted grade- 6 students, who attended the nearby middle school and other grade- 6 students who were in heterogeneous ability classes also responded to the CHEAKS instrument. Analysis of the data showed that grade- 4 students in this elementary school had a higher commitment to the environment than did grade- 5 students and gifted students had more knowledge than regular students. Only the gifted students in grade- 5 had a high commitment to the environment. Comparing independent t-test results in year 2002 between grade- 5 regular students (n= 105) and grade- 5 gifted students (n= 30), grade- 5 gifted students were statistically less committed to the environment in terms of scores on the Verbal Commitment. There was no difference in knowledge or commitment in grade- 6 students. Girls were more verbally committed to the environment than boys. Having knowledge about the environment did not necessarily mean students were committed to saving the environment or took action to solve environmental problems. The thesis concludes with explanations, discussions about the limitations of the study and suggestions for further research...|$|E
