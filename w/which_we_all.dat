In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford explained that he felt the pardon {{was in the best}} interests of the country, and that the Nixon family's situation [...] "is a tragedy in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the episode's broadcast, the Fox network {{received}} several angry letters and emails from concerned Catholics, who were uneasy with the commercial scene. According to Scully, {{the letters were}} worded the same, and all started with [...] "My family and I have always enjoyed The Simpsons, until last night..." [...] Nevertheless, the letters provoked a reaction from The Simpsons staff, and in an interview, Scully said, [...] "We {{got a couple of}} hundred letters, and it was very obvious from reading a majority of them that [...] had not seen the show. Some of them were from third-graders, all saying the same thing: 'Please don't make fun of my religion.' <b>Which</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> know third-graders are very adamant about." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} then added tambourine, conga drum and bongos over the coda. This last {{section of the}} song came about while the group were working in the studio. Lennon, who was {{otherwise}} highly critical of [...] "Hello, Goodbye", approved of the addition, saying: [...] "The best bit was the end, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> ad-libbed in the studio, where I played the piano. Like one of my favourite bits on 'Ticket to Ride', where we just threw something in at the end." [...] In McCartney's recollection, the coda [...] "didn't sound quite right" [...] until Emerick increased the reverberation on the tom-tom drums, at which point, [...] "it just came alive." [...] Everett cites the [...] "Maori finale" [...] {{as an example of}} the Beatles' pioneering use of codas in their recordings; in this instance, they provided [...] "the cold ending followed by an unrelated coda", having similarly pioneered the [...] "fade-out–fade-in coda" [...] at the end of [...] "Rain" [...] and [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever".|$|E

[...] Dante Harper was hired to rewrite the script, aimed for [...] "having a gory-but-funny Shaun of the Dead vibe." [...] McKay said inspirations included Sam Raimi's early horror comedy films like Army of Darkness but also [...] "John Carpenter's movies, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> love [...] we're all hugely influenced by the first Matrix—obviously a really big one—also the Bourne Supremacy movies and the way Oliver Wood shot those. You kind of throw in all those, mix 'em up in a pot and that's what you get." [...] Wirkola also credited Quentin Tarantino for influencing him [...] "in many ways" [...] and singled out Peter Jackson's Braindead for having been [...] "a game-changer" [...] for him.|$|E
500|$|For Ursula Franklin, {{technology}} {{is a set of}} practices in the [...] "here and now" [...] rather than an array of machines or gadgets. It is also a comprehensive system. [...] "Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset." [...] Her definition is similar to the French thinker Jacques Ellul's concept of technique. Like Ellul, Franklin asserts that technological methods dominate the modern world. [...] "Technology has built the house in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> live," [...] she writes, [...] "today there is hardly any human activity that does not occur within this house." [...] As such, {{technology is}} a central element of the here and now. [...] "In the broadest sense of the term, the here and now is our environment, that is, all that is around us—the ever-changing overlay of nature, the built environment, the institutional and social structures within which human activities take place, as well as the activities themselves—'the way things are done around here.'" [...] Franklin sees her studies of technology as an attempt to understand how technological practices affect the advancement of justice and peace.|$|E
500|$|Poe's {{characterization}} as an uncontrollable alcoholic is disputed. His drinking companion for a time, Thomas Mayne Reid, {{admitted that}} the two engaged in wild [...] "frolics" [...] but that Poe [...] "never went beyond the innocent mirth in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> indulge... While acknowledging this as one of Poe's failings, I can speak truly of its not being habitual". Some believe Poe had a severe susceptibility to alcohol and became drunk after one glass of wine. He only drank during difficult periods {{of his life and}} sometimes went several months at a time without alcohol. Adding further confusion about the frequency of Poe's use of alcohol was his membership in the Sons of Temperance {{at the time of his}} death. William Glenn, who administered Poe's pledge, wrote years later that the temperance community had no reason to believe Poe had violated his pledge while in Richmond. Suggestions of a drug overdose have also been proven to be untrue, though it is still often reported. Thomas Dunn English, an admitted enemy of Poe and a trained doctor, insisted that Poe was not a drug user. He wrote: [...] "Had Poe the opium habit when I knew him (before 1846) I should both as a physician and a man of observation, have discovered it during his frequent visits to my rooms, my visits at his house, and our meetings elsewhere – I saw no signs of it and believe the charge to be a baseless slander." ...|$|E

500|$|Noman spoke over Radio San'a, {{offering}} {{reconciliation and}} inviting [...] "all tribes of all persuasions" [...] {{to meet with}} him the following week at Khamir, 50 miles north of San'a, to achieve [...] "the one thing <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> prize over anything else: peace for the nation." [...] In order to convince al-Badr to come the conference, Noman announced that he personally would head the republican delegation at Khamir, and that Sallal would stay in San'a. Al-Badr and his ranking chiefs did not attend the conference, but a handful of pro-royalist sheiks were present. The conference named a committee of five tribal and four religious leaders who were charged with seeking out the [...] "beguiled brothers", al-Badr and his friends. Noman's effort, including a private promise to reach a withdrawal of Egyptian troops, was backed by Nasser. Radio Cairo hailed the Khamir conference as the [...] "dawn of a new era." [...] Sallal called the talks [...] "a complete success", while al-Badr stated that [...] "It is essential that the conflict which has devastated our beloved country be brought to an end by peaceful negotiations between the Yemeni people themselves." [...] However, by early June, when Noman said that Egypt's 50,000 troops would have {{to be replaced by a}} joint royalist-republican [...] peace force, the Nasserites lost interest in the deal. After Noman flew to Cairo to protest directly to Nasser, Sallal threw seven civilian [...] Cabinet ministers into jail. Noman resigned, saying [...] "It is obvious that Sallal and his cronies are more interested in war than [...] peace". Sallal soon named a new Cabinet to replace Noman's, with 13 military men and two civilians.|$|E
