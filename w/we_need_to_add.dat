Later on the season, Brian Laws left the club after being sacked and went on to take up a Burnley in the Premier League and was succeeded by Alan Irvine.

The contributions of Mr Chiesa to this collection are the Introduction and a long essay on geopolitics called Europa, perché Marte ha sconfitto Venere (Europe: Why Mars Defeated Venus). In October 2007 the Movie Zero: inchiesta sull'11 settembre (Zero: An Investigation Into 9/11) was presented at the International Movie Festival of Rome. It was created by a group - promoted by Giulietto Chiesa - led by Paolo Jormi Bianchi and was directed by Franco Fracassi and Francesco Trento. It began to be distributed from the beginning of 2008. It suggests that officials inside and outside the US Government were directly involved in planning and executing the attacks. In an interview with PressTV, Chiesa stated that the attacks involved a calculated conspiracy implicating US, Israeli, Pakistani and Saudi secret services.

We {{studied the}} {{evolution}} of two small flares (GOES class C 2 and C 1) that developed in the same active region with different morphological characteristics: one is extended {{and the other is}} compact. We analyzed the accuracy and the consistency of different algorithms implemented in RHESSI software to reconstruct the image of the emitting sources, for energies between 3 and 12 keV. We found that all tested algorithms give consistent results for the peak position while the other parameters can differ at most by a factor 2. Pixon and Forward-fit generally converge to similar results but Pixon is more reliable for reconstructing a complex source. We investigated the spectral characteristics of the two flares during their evolution in the 3 – 25 keV energy band. We found that a single thermal model of the photon spectrum is inadequate to fit the observations and <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> either a non-thermal model or a hot thermal one.
