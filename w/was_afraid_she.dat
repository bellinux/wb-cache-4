500|$|The planet Venom's {{forces were}} all but destroyed, and there {{is thought to be}} peace. This is not to be, however, as a race of beings known as the Anglar rise from the acidic oceans of Venom, thought to be unable to support life. The leader of the Anglar plans on {{destroying}} the Lylat system, which Fox McCloud and crew set out to save. The Star Fox team has broken up, but re-assembles to fight the threat. Peppy is made the General of the Cornerian Army, replacing Pepper. Fox flew around the Lylat system with ROB on patrol, and Krystal broke off her relationship with Fox after she left the team, because he <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> would receive injury and it would affect him. Slippy finds love with a frog named Amanda, and spends less time with the team. Falco left the team and went around on solo missions (as he has done before in Star Fox Adventures), spending less time with a team also. Peppy's daughter Lucy joins the team for some missions. There are nine endings depending on paths chosen by the player, though the player is required to finish the game before having the options. Designers have hinted that a possible Star Fox game in the future may begin in the middle of Star Fox Command, revealing a true ending[...]|$|E
2500|$|The 3–5 minutes bought {{enough time}} that the {{majority}} of the women and children did get away. [...] Rachel Plummer, who was pregnant, <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> would not be able to keep up while carrying her two-year-old son, and so she stayed in the fort. [...] She began running after seeing the Indians come into the fort, holding her little boy's hand, while behind her she said she saw Indians stabbing Benjamin with their lances, and then she heard “Uncle Silas shout defiance as though he had a thousand men with him. Alas, he was alone, and soon dead.” [...] Lucy Parker, who also had a small child, stopped to argue with her husband Silas, begging him to come with her. [...] Elizabeth Duty Kellogg stopped to gather up their savings, $100 in coins, before she attempted to escape.|$|E
2500|$|Dolly was the {{youngest}} daughter to be born; doctors <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> wouldn't make it after birth as she only weighed 780grams at birth. She lived a full life and died at the ripe age of 96 years. The oldest son, Louis was very full of himself and had this attitude after studying in England, referring to himself as [...] "Young Lord Louis" [...] , even signing his letters with the initials [...] "YLL". Sammy once entered a party where the coat boy took his hat and jacket and tipped the young man a generous 1 pound. After taking the tip, the boy turned to Sammy {{and asked if he}} could tip him more as his son Louis tipped him five pounds when he came in earlier. Sammy looked at the young man and replied with a well thought comeback: [...] "Remember that my son has a very rich father, I on the other hand, do not." ...|$|E

"Indeed I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> will," [...] replied Henry; [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> will <b>be</b> very constant, {{unless a}} baronet should come in her way; that is Frederick's only chance. I {{will get the}} Bath paper, and look over the arrivals." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kelsey Clarke <b>is</b> very <b>afraid.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>afraid</b> of germs, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>afraid</b> of traffic…even {{the toaster}} {{makes her feel}} very afraid.|$|R

2500|$|Nasya Nenova {{attempted}} suicide. She {{testified that}} she confessed and attempted suicide because she <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> would be tortured again. She was interrogated alongside Ashraf {{and told the}} court they were beaten {{and that there was}} no interpreter. She did not confess to having illegal sexual relations with him. She, along with Vulcheva, are the only nurses who admitted knowing Ashraf by sight beforehand, but she said she had never spoken with him. She denied having attempted suicide out of guilt for what she had done. In court she stated that [...] "I am not guilty on any of the counts. My conscience is clear." [...] and [...] "We had protection from no-one, we had no doctor. We were alone there with those men who did everything they wanted to do". She said she attempted to retract her confession on 17 July 1999, but that a Colonel Juma came and threatened to renew the torture if she persisted.|$|E

6000|$|... "'O doctor!' says Huldy, {{all in a}} tremble; 'cause, you know, she didn't want to {{contradict}} the minister, and she <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> should laugh,--'I never heard that a tom-turkey would set on eggs.' ...|$|E

60|$|Miss Ophelia {{looked very}} much as if she <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> should say something; but she rattled away with her needles {{in a way that}} had volumes of meaning in it, if Marie could only have {{understood}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Really?' and Nan {{looked so}} {{surprised}} that Mrs Jo <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> might be fonder {{of her old}} playmate than she knew; but her next words set the fear at rest, and made everything comfortable and merry at once.|$|E
60|$|All {{she had to}} do {{at present}} was to listen to Miss Bracy, who was sure that Mrs. Rivers thought Mary and Blanche were not improved, and <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>she</b> was ungrateful for all the {{intended}} kindness to her sister.|$|E
