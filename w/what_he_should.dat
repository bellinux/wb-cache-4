5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music was the 18th overall LP Charles had recorded. According to him, {{the title}} of the album was {{conceived}} by producer Sid Feller and ABC-Paramount's executives and management people. The recording sessions for the album took place at three sessions in mid-February 1962. The first two sessions were set on February 5 and 7 at Capitol Studios in New York, New York, at which one half of the album was recorded and produced. The other half was recorded on February 15 of that same year at United Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Instead of drawing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> record from memory and his knowledge of country music, Charles asked Feller, his newly appointed A (Artists and Repertoire) man, to research top country standards through major country music publishers.|$|E
5|$|Schafer {{stated that}} they began the {{development}} with the character of Eddie, and recognizing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be doing in the game—specifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving his hot rod. Once they found this combination of elements to work well in combat and general gameplay, {{they were able to}} expand {{out the rest of the}} game from there, as these elements provided a means of testing the game to make sure it remained enjoyable. The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous game from Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game.|$|E
5|$|At the mall, Michael {{opens to}} the women about his {{discomfort}} with Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and watching it with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car. At the office, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sneaks in{{to the women}}'s bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room. The other men soon join him.|$|E
60|$|Oh! she reflected, <b>what</b> if <b>he</b> <b>should</b> answer--"Rather {{than this}} I hand {{you over to}} Ramiro"? <b>What</b> if <b>he</b> <b>should</b> think of that argument? Happily for her, {{at the moment he}} did not.|$|R

5|$|Later at the tavern, {{a police}} {{inspector}} from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown {{the matter of}} the stolen money. Morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.|$|E
25|$|He {{writes in}} his memoirs that he felt saddened that he had grieved his father. Ginzberg {{recognized}} that his pious father was disappointed that his son had chosen a more liberal path with regards to Jewish law opposed to following the path of his forefathers. Ginzberg first arrived in America in 1899, unsure where he belonged or <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> pursue. Almost immediately, he accepted a position at Hebrew Union College and subsequently wrote articles for the Jewish Encyclopedia. Still, he had not found his niche.|$|E
25|$|Sarah is {{the female}} {{half of the}} lizard couple, the mate of Leslie. Like her mate, Sarah is {{cautious}} and fearful around the humans. Yet like Nancy, she is curious about them and tries to make a connection. Though Sarah defers to Leslie much more than Nancy does to Charlie, she does play a buffer role between the couples. Leslie often consults Sarah on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do and what she thinks about the humans and the situation at hand. At first, Sarah urges wanness, but she also {{emphasizes the importance of}} contact.|$|E

25|$|Just as the Athenians were {{preparing}} to sail home, on August 28, there was a lunar eclipse, and Nicias, described by Thucydides as a particularly superstitious man, asked the priests <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do. They suggested the Athenians wait for another 27 days, and Nicias agreed. The Syracusans took advantage of this, and 76 of their ships attacked 86 Athenian ships in the harbour. The Athenians were defeated and Eurymedon was killed. Many of the ships were pushed on to the shore, where Gylippus was waiting. He killed some of the crews and captured 18 beached ships, but a force of Athenians and Etruscans forced Gylippus back.|$|E
25|$|Stefan said {{he would}} have tried out the last idea at his own house in England. He {{probably}} meant St Thomas's Mills at Stratford, London, which Henry had given him, then taken away in 1544. Stefan seems not to have found work, but he did come back to England. On 9 January 1547, the Imperial ambassador in London, François van der Delft, wrote to Mary of Austria to ask <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do about Haschenperg. Stefan and his wife had come to London thinking that Mary's letters would get his job back. Van der Delft suggested he should not intercede between Henry VIII and his servant. Stefan then became a steward of Jan Dubravius, Bishop of Olmütz, in Bohemia.|$|E
25|$|Kotarō (actually Benten Kozō in disguise) then appears with an {{attendant}} (his fellow thief, Nangō Rikimaru in disguise), {{and the couple}} go into a nearby teahouse on the grounds; Senju has never before met Kotarō, and so {{has no reason to}} know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> look like. Meanwhile, Akaboshi Jūzaburō, another thief, attempting to swindle money intended for the memorial service from members of Senju's party, is discovered. A scuffle erupts, and the group rush to the teahouse, where Benten Kozō is attempting to obtain from Senju a valuable gold incense burner which was a gift to her from Kotarō's family. Tadanobu Rihei, yet another thief, disguised as an anonymous ronin, drives them away, and defuses the situation.|$|E
2500|$|Garson was {{subsequently}} indicted and arrested in April 2003 {{outside of his}} Upper East Side apartment. He was charged with having accepted cash and other gifts from Siminovsky, as payment for preferential treatment. The treatment included Judge Garson privately coaching Siminovsky as to <b>what</b> questions <b>he</b> <b>should</b> ask, and <b>what</b> arguments <b>he</b> <b>should</b> use. [...] Garson would then rule in Siminovsky's favor. This violated the rules of judicial conduct, which prohibit a judge from speaking privately with an attorney who has a case pending, without the presence or permission of the opposing attorney.|$|R

25|$|In 189, the tyrannical warlord Dong Zhuo took {{advantage}} of the power vacuum, created {{in the aftermath of the}} conflict between the regent He Jin and the eunuch faction, to seize control of the Han central government and hold the figurehead Emperor Xian hostage in the imperial capital, Luoyang. Yang Yuan (楊原), the Prefect of Zhongmu County, started panicking and wanted to abandon his post and leave. Ren Jun advised him to stay and urged him to take the lead in calling for everyone to rise up against Dong Zhuo and overthrow him. When Yang Yuan asked him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do, Ren Jun advised him to assume the position of acting Intendant of Henan (河南尹), bring all the counties in Henan Commandery under his leadership, and rally as many men as possible to form an army to fight Dong Zhuo's forces. Yang Yuan appointed Ren Jun as his Registrar (主簿) and proceeded to implement his suggestions.|$|E
25|$|Artemus {{is held by}} {{officials}} of an unnamed government (the nation had an arsenal of Cruise Missiles and Minutemen, though the United States is not directly named) who fear his powers yet want to use them militarily. As part of this plan, they persuade him to construct the Zone, and they present him to the people as an inspiring nationalistic symbol. Once the Zone is completed, the government launches a first strike nuclear attack against an unnamed foe. From that point on, life for the survivors in the Zone becomes distinctly Orwellian, revolving around {{the will of the}} omnipresent Artemus, who is accepted by the people as a benevolent messianic figure. The boy can read the thoughts of anyone in the Zone, and the people find that comforting. He has absolute power, though he is influenced by flattery to enforce the will of the government officials. Throughout much of the story, Artemus is confused and unsure of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do, which adds to his vulnerability to official leadership.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, {{while working}} in New York City, Fanti started the {{psychotherapy}} of a diplomat who was representing his country {{in a series of}} international conferences. His treatment was a man of success with a brilliant career but anguished to the extreme of considering his life senseless. Fanti and his patient completed nine sessions of 45 minutes. Suddenly the diplomat was transferred to another country due to professional requirements and he therefore interrupted his treatment. A few months later, Fanti received a thankful letter from his client for all the work done with him but announcing he had committed suicide. This tragic event disturbed Fanti profoundly. He reflected about the clinical aspects of his client's case, trying to understand <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have done differently so as to avoid his client committing suicide. He had a sense that if during those 15 days the psychoanalysis had lasted they could have done more frequent and longer sessions, his client {{would have been able to}} discharge enough anxiety as to permit him to pull through temporally. At a later stage he could have continued a psychoanalysis to seek a definitive equilibrium.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{the scandal}} behind P.J. {{is that in}} order to receive his trust fund he must marry before he turns 28 years old, and so he proposes to Naomi, unbeknownst to her. Annie finds out about the clause and tells P.J. to come clean to Naomi, which he is about to but {{chickens}} out and ask if she will take his last name instead of saying <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have. Annie and the girls are with Naomi at a wedding dress store and Annie tells Naomi about P.J's secret. As Naomi learns the truth, she breaks off the engagement. While Dixon is away, Austin returns to town and suggests that Adrianna should start a country music career with his help. Adrianna accepts his offer. But as Austin becomes her manager, he also has his eyes set on steering Adrianna away from Dixon. Navid also returns and reveals that he wants to resume his relationship with Silver, who has found out she has the cancer gene. This causes a dramatic turn, as both Liam and Navid want to be with Silver. A fight breaks out between Liam and Navid during the premiere of Liam's new movie. As a result, Silver decides to side with Navid. Meanwhile, Naomi is the event planner for a young woman named Madison who is enthused by her upcoming nuptials. Naomi gets the shock of her life when she learns that the groom-to-be is none other than Max, her ex-boyfriend. At the bachelor party Max questions Naomi, asking her if he is doing the right thing, and before she can reply is interrupted by Max's fiancée. During the rehearsal wedding, Holly's mother offers Naomi a job offer that she cannot refuse. Naomi takes the offer, but at the airport is talked out of it by Austin because she is still in love with Max. As the wedding of Madison and Max begins, Naomi abruptly interrupts the services and confesses her love for Max. Elsewhere, Ivy is seen going off to Mexico to be with Diego, who was deported because he was an illegal immigrant in the U.S., and only ask for a one-way ticket. Diego and Ivy had begun dating and Diego had helped cease the pain she had been feeling after Raj's death. Diego was arrested for illegal graffiti, and that is why he was being deported. Annie and Caleb break off their relationship because Caleb cannot leave the covenant for Annie; nor does she think he should. Navid reveals that he isn't ready to have a baby, which causes Silver to dump him. She still wants to conceive a child and proposes to have a baby...with Teddy. At {{the very end of the}} season finale, Adrianna is boarding a plane to Las Vegas to kickstart her country music career because Dixon has not returned on time from the tour, but little does she know the car broke down and he had to hitchhike. As Dixon is on the phone with Navid telling him to stop Adrianna, a truck hits Dixon's car and it is left unknown if Dixon is still alive.|$|E
500|$|Malcolm, {{thinking}} {{over the}} manifold blessings continually bestowed upon him by God, pondered anxiously {{in his mind}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> give Him in return. At length, the grace of the Holy Ghost working within him, he set his heart upon increasing the worship of God so he established a new episcopal see at Marthillach (Mortlach), {{not far from the}} spot where he had overcome the Norwegians, and gained the victory; and endowed it with churches, and the rents of many estates.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterwards, Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin) {{approaches}} Fox Mulder with Secare's case, {{saying he}} is of major importance to revealing the truth. When investigating the case, Mulder and Dana Scully visit Dr. Terrance Berube (Ken Kramer), a scientist working in Gaithersburg, Maryland, whose car was being driven by Secare. That night, Deep Throat meets a second time with Mulder and insists he continue, despite Mulder's uncertainty on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be looking for. That night, Berube is confronted by the [...] "Crew Cut Man" [...] (Lindsey Ginter), who kills him and makes the death look like a suicide.|$|E

500|$|Growing up in a Jewish-American {{household}} {{where the}} parents demanded high achievement, Juster was intimately familiar with expectations, though {{in his case}} many of his parents' hopes were centered on his older brother, an academic star. The Terrible Trivium, the well-dressed, polite demon who sets the questers to mindless tasks, was Juster's way of representing his own tendency to avoid <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be doing {{in favor of a}} more congenial occupation, such as his evasion of the grant project to write The Phantom Tollbooth. Juster drew on Feiffer's life experiences as well; the Whether Man's adage [...] "Expect everything, I always say, and the unexpected never happens" [...] was a favorite of the cartoonist's mother.|$|E
500|$|Gertrude Bell {{introduced}} Bodley to T. E. Lawrence. Bodley met Lawrence one day {{outside the}} Paris Peace Conference {{and told him}} of his intent to move into politics. Lawrence responded furiously, calling him a moron and a traitor.

[...] Bodley said his conversation with Lawrence, which lasted [...] "less than 200 seconds", proved to be life-changing.

60|$|It {{had never}} {{occurred}} to Moses how or in <b>what</b> capacity <b>he</b> <b>should</b> always stand banker to the whole wealth of love that there was in Mara's heart, and <b>what</b> provision <b>he</b> <b>should</b> make on his part for returning this incalculable debt. But the interview of this evening had raised a new thought in his mind. Mara, as he saw that day, was no longer a little girl in a pink sun-bonnet. She was a woman,--a little one, it is true, but every inch a woman,--and a woman invested with a singular poetic charm of appearance, which, more than beauty, has the power of awakening feeling in the other sex.|$|R
