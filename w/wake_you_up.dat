His singles were moderate hits that year, {{the biggest}} of them on either UA or Epic was a version of [...] "Spanish Eyes", which became a top-20 country hit. Rich appeared as himself in the 1978 Clint Eastwood movie, Every Which Way but Loose, in which he performed the song [...] "I'll <b>Wake</b> <b>You</b> <b>Up</b> When I Get Home". This song hit number three on the charts in 1979 and was the last top-10 single of his career. In 1980, he switched labels again to Elektra Records, and released a number-12 single, [...] "A Man Just Don't Know What a Woman Goes Through" [...] {{in the fall of}} that year. One more top-40 hit followed, the Gary Stewart song [...] "Are We Dreamin' the Same Dream" [...] early in 1981, but Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight. For over a decade, Rich was silent, living off his investments in semiretirement and only playing occasional concerts.

6000|$|... "They didn't do nothing. And they didn't act anyway much, as fur as I see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved {{in there}} to do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing you was up; and found <b>you</b> WARN'T <b>up,</b> and so they was hoping to slide {{out of the way}} of trouble without <b>waking</b> <b>you</b> <b>up,</b> if they hadn't already <b>waked</b> <b>you</b> up." ...|$|R

The {{stewards}} of the White Star Line, besides being the civillest and most obliging body {{of men in}} the world, all have soft and pleasant voices. A White Star steward, <b>waking</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> at six-thirty, to tell you that your bath is ready, when you wanted to sleep on till twelve, is the nearest human approach to the nightingale.|$|R

"Sometimes {{you dream}} that there’s {{someone you love}} who loves you… <b>you</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> & {{for a few minutes}} you know that somewhere there’s someone you love who loves you… & then <b>you</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> into being awake.

5000|$|Designer Storm Thorgerson, {{who also}} {{designed}} {{the cover of}} their previous album, Bury the Hatchet., said: [...] "The idea of red balls came from granules of coffee percolating the atmosphere, settling in your nose and <b>waking</b> <b>you</b> <b>up.</b> These became red (cranberries) and then enlarged to gym balls to satisfy our rampant egos. The location changed from an interior to an open space. Because this idea was preposterous, it needed testing before we did the proper thing {{on a beach in}} Somerset. The test… was done on a small grass aerodrome near London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{the best}} thing you can do is to go down to the waist, slip off your togs, and have a few buckets of water poured over you. That will <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> <b>up,</b> and you will feel ever so much more comfortable, afterwards. I have just told the steward to make us a couple of cups of coffee.

60|$|Remembering my own boyhood on cold mornings, I {{looked behind}} {{him to see}} if he also were under compulsion, but there was no other mouse in sight. He would scoop up a double handful of water in his paws, rub it rapidly up over nose and eyes, and then behind his ears, on the spots that <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> quickest when you are sleepy. Then another scoop of water, and another {{vigorous}} rub, ending behind his ears as before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{a little}} of both," [...] said the clerk. [...] "They're cousins, and they've got an aunt living there that they stay with. They used to go away winters,--teaching, I guess,--but this last year they stayed right through. Been down to Springfield, they said, and just stopped the night because the {{accommodation}} don't go any farther. <b>Wake</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> last night? I had to put 'em into the room next to yours, and girls usually talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you can't understand," [...] she said,--"I couldn't {{make you}} understand--what {{it means to}} {{me to think that}} very soon I shall have a glimpse, at any rate, into the world. If I had met you three weeks ago, {{probably}} I shouldn't have dreamed of <b>waking</b> <b>you</b> <b>up.</b> I should have let you get wet and then laughed at you. If you had ventured to speak to me, I should probably have stuck my nose in the air and walked away. You see how mellowing an influence even the possibility of escape is." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The {{child would}} be heart-broken to lose one day of her promised week. As for yourself, you need a change to <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> <b>up.</b> It is absurd for one so young to refuse the natural enjoyments of youth, and I think your {{determination}} not to dance a pretty but silly affectation. California {{is not the place}} to mourn in. The climate is opposed to dejection. The natives go to funerals in the morning and chase with the hounds in the afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{only put}} thing's {{just as they}} are, and as I've also learned a little, thank heaven, to see them--which isn't, I quite agree with you, at all what any one does. You're in the deep doze of the spell that has held you for long years, {{and it would be}} a shame, a crime, to <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> <b>up.</b> Indeed I already feel with a {{thousand}} scruples that I'm giving you the fatal shake. I say it even though it makes me sound a little as if I thought myself the fairy prince." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the next}} thing and the biggest thing I'll do will be to buy that {{duck-farm}} next door. Few people understand ducks. I can watch 'em for hours. They can march better than any company in the National Guard, and they can play 'follow my leader' better than the entire Democratic party. Their voices don't amount to much, but I like to hear 'em. They <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> a dozen times a night, but there's a homely sound about their quacking that is more musical to me than the cry of 'Fresh strawber-rees!' under your window {{in the morning when}} you want to sleep.|$|E
