500|$|Arsenal {{exited the}} {{competition}} in the semi-finals against Middlesbrough. At Highbury, the setting for the first leg, Juninho scored the only goal of the tie. Arsenal's task of progressing was made more difficult after Keown was sent off in the second leg and Boudewijn Zenden doubled Middlesbrough's aggregate scoreline. Though Edu equalised for Arsenal on the night, Reyes' own goal earnt Middlesbrough the win. Wenger opined of the result: [...] "I don't think we deserved to lose; even when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>down</b> to 10 men we were running the game." ...|$|E
500|$|He was an {{original}} {{owner of a}} Holiday Inn franchise near Orlando, Florida, which is today the Seralago Hotel & Suites Main Gate East. Glenn's business partner was Henri Landwirth, a Holocaust survivor who became his best friend. He remembered learning about Landwirth's background: [...] "Henri doesn't talk about it much. It was years before he spoke about it with me and then only because of an accident. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>down</b> in Florida during the space program. Everyone was wearing short-sleeved Ban-Lon shirtseveryone but Henri. Then one day I saw Henri at the pool and noticed the number on his arm. I told Henri {{that if it were}} me I'd wear that number like a medal with a spotlight on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} in Group E, along with Dutch champions PSV, Greek club Panathinaikos and Norwegian side Rosenborg. An Alex own goal {{was enough for}} Arsenal to claim three points against PSV on the first matchday. The team drew away to Rosenborg and earnt a point at Panathinaikos, despite twice having taken the lead at the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium. In the reverse fixture, Cygan scored an own goal to cancel out Henry's first-half opener; the result left Arsenal in second position. Their next match was against PSV at the Philips Stadion, where after eight minutes the home side took the lead. Henry {{equalised}} for Arsenal, having created the chance following a one-two with Ljungberg. In the second half Lauren and Vieira were both sent off, for two bookable offences. Wenger accepted referee Herbert Fandel's decision, but added his surprise that Mark van Bommel was not cautioned: [...] "If {{you look at the}} number of fouls he made without being punished it is very surprising because he made some deliberate fouls. Some people might criticise Patrick when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>down</b> to 10 men but he felt he had to fight harder to win the ball." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2008, Weitz told The Daily Yomiuri, a Japanese newspaper, that {{he still}} hoped for the sequels' production: [...] "at first it looked like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>down</b> for the count because in the U.S. [...] under{{performed}}, but then internationally it performed [...] than expectations. So, {{a lot depends on}} Japan, frankly... I think if it does well enough here we'll be in good shape for that." [...] Although producer Deborah Forte had, in March 2008, expressed optimism that the sequels would be made, by October 2008, the two planned sequels were officially placed on hold, according to New Line Cinema, because of financial concerns during the global recession. Sam Elliott, however, stated, [...] "The Catholic Church ... lambasted them, and I think it scared New Line off." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{got it from}} Sherman, who is {{a friend}} of mine down in Mississippi, who had bought it down at a Goodwill store. When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>down</b> there last time he says to me, 'I didn't tell you when you bought it off me, but that guitar used to be haunted'. I say, 'What are you talking about, Sherman?'. He says, 'There’s 50 solid {{citizens}} here in Como who'll tell you this guitar is haunted. It's the darnedest thing – we’d leave it over in the potato barn and we'd come back in and it would be moved. You'd put it down somewhere and the next morning you’d come back and it would have moved. When you took that guitar the ghost in the barn left'. He told me this not very long ago and I said to him, 'Sherman! Why didn't you tell me this before?' and he said, 'Well the ghost was gone – I didn't want it around here no more!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The game began {{relatively}} low-scoring, {{with the}} Volunteers holding a 17–3 lead {{for the majority}} of the game. Tennessee leading rusher Cedric Houston missed the game with a torn ligament in his left thumb. Arkansas had injury problems of its own, and became one-dimensional with Cedric Cobbs, the Hogs' starting running back, missing much of the second half with a turf toe injury. The Razorbacks got the ball with ten minutes left in the fourth quarter and scored two touchdowns in a span of 4½ minutes. The tying touchdown was a 92-yard touchdown pass to Richard Smith from Matt Jones. Said Jones of that play after the game, [...] "The coaches have told us never to quit, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>down</b> seven at our own 8, I kept thinking about that." [...] This was at the time the longest offensive play in the history of Arkansas football, since surpassed by Broderick Green's 99-yard rush against Eastern Michigan in 2009.|$|E

6000|$|... "It seems ages since I was here," [...] she remarked. [...] "Sylvia {{was away}} when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>down</b> last, and dad and Colonel Laycey were annoyed {{with one another}} about some repairs. You don't want any repairs, do you, Mr. Thain?" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{an instant}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>down</b> on our knees {{on the hard}} dirt floor, {{and there was a}} man's foot in a moccasin! We both grabbed it and pulled, {{bringing}} to life a person with little blue eyes and stiff blond hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{so sure of}} that" [...] {{returned}} Wilkins, with {{a dubious}} shake of the head. [...] "Every one, you know, cannot be lucky. Some succeed and some don't. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>down</b> just now, that's all. The wheel of fortune is going round, and something will be sure to turn up soon." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ay, {{that they}} are, Master Penrose, for {{in our day}} we do not give {{ourselves}} over the moment <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>down,</b> and lie closed up in our shells like great land tortoises turned on their backs, waiting till some one {{is good enough to}} find his way through our shell with the misericorde." ...|$|R

6000|$|It {{looked like}} a good thing: but wait till I tell you. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>down</b> South, in Alabama--Bill Driscoll and myself--when this {{kidnapping}} idea struck us.

6000|$|... "And have I {{not really}} loved you? Well, never mind. I have said what I came to say, and I will now go.

6000|$|... "And now, {{if we do}} not put {{our best}} foot forward it will be all up with us.

60|$|Soon we {{perceived}} {{two of our}} comrades {{driving a}} flock of springboks towards the river. Mike at once diverged towards a clump of bushes which it seemed probable they would pass.

5000|$|The {{decision}} {{was described as}} [...] "heartbreaking" [...] by the Royal Agricultural Society of England. John Moverley, RASE Chief Executive, said the financial implications of the wet weather and closing the show early were being assessed.
