25|$|A typical ambush predator, it waits {{patiently for}} unsuspecting prey to wander by. Sometimes, {{it is known}} to select a {{specific}} ambush site and return to it every year {{in time for the}} spring migration of birds. Studies have indicated that B. schlegeli learns to improve strike accuracy over time. Sometimes B. schlegelii (especially juveniles) will employ what is known as “caudal luring”, <b>wiggling</b> the tail in worm-like motions to encourage potential prey to move within striking range.|$|E
25|$|In April, Parker {{made his}} first mistake with Presley's career. He had booked him into a four-week Las Vegas engagement, misjudging the {{reaction}} of the slightly older, more reserved audiences that Las Vegas attracted. While Presley was a hit among the youth of America, the middle-aged audiences found him to be something of an oddity. Some viewed him as a clown-like figure, <b>wiggling</b> his hips for screams like a monkey for peanuts, while others found his manner of performance vulgar and more suitable for late-night gentleman's clubs. After a very cool reception during his first few shows, Parker cut Presley's appearance to two weeks. Presley would later remember the event as one of the worst moments of his career.|$|E
25|$|Immobility is a {{significant}} risk factor {{in the development of}} thrombosis. Immediate post-surgical interventions,(out of bed orders (OOB), are typically ordered by the physician to prevent thrombosis. These orders are typically delegated to a nurse, but may include the participation of a physical therapist and others trained to perform the intervention. are to perform range of motion (ROM) activities that include: muscle contractions of the lower legs for those who are very weak, moving the feet, <b>wiggling</b> the toes, bending the knees, raise and lower the legs. In addition, changes in positioning prevents immobility and shifts areas of venous stasis. If the person is too weak to perform these preventative activities, hospital personnel will perform these movements independently. Exercise of the lower extremeties is a post-operative method of prophlaxsis. Nursing personnel will often perform range of motion exercises and encourage frequent moving of the legs, feet, and ankles. Frequent positioning changes and adequate fluid intake. After a surgical procedure, ambulation as soon as possible is prophylactic in preventing the formation of blood clots.|$|E

500|$|In 1991, {{while still}} a student, Field became {{motivated}} to use concepts {{in the field}} of early childhood education to record an album of music for children. [...] The album was dedicated to Field's niece. [...] A song he wrote for The Cockroaches, [...] "Get Ready to Wiggle", inspired the band's name because they thought that <b>wiggling</b> described the way children dance. [...] Like a university assignment, they produced a folder of essays that explained the educational value of each song on the album. [...] They needed a keyboardist [...] "to bolster the rock'n'roll feel of the project", so Field asked his old bandmate Fatt for his assistance in what they thought would be a temporary project.|$|E
500|$|Robert Christgau {{labeled the}} song as a [...] "choice cut" [...] (...) , {{signifying}} that it [...] "is a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money".

While comparing the five The Neptunes-produced tracks on the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found it [...] to be [...] "rather embarrassing" [...] and [...] "cloying and crass", rather than [...] "effortless and effervescent". Lucy Davies, writing for BBC Music, {{described it as a}} [...] "bland filler" [...] that [...] "sums her up [...] coquettish, amusing, annoying and hip <b>wiggling</b> in equal measure".|$|E
500|$|Pinnipeds {{can move}} around on land, {{though not as}} well as {{terrestrial}} animals. Otariids and walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and under the body so they can [...] "walk" [...] on all fours. The fore-flippers move in a transverse, rather than a sagittal fashion. Otariids rely on the movements of their heads and necks more than their hind-flippers during terrestrial locomotion. By swinging their heads and necks, otariids create momentum while they are moving. Sea lions have been recorded climbing up flights of stairs. Phocids are less agile on land. They cannot pull their hind-flippers forward, and move on land by lunging, bouncing and <b>wiggling</b> while their fore-flippers keep them balanced. Some species use their fore-flippers to pull themselves forward. Terrestrial locomotion is easier for phocids on ice, as they can sled along.|$|E

500|$|The {{creation}} of the monster took the series special effects crew approximately eleven days to implement. They created molds of guest actor Neal Huff's head and back, giving him [...] "creature eye" [...] contact lenses and covering the back foam mold with [...] "backbarbs". Eight different dentures were made of Huff's mouth to depict the character gradually losing his teeth, [...] "anything from simple teeth that match his own..., to <b>wiggling</b> teeth that he can start to loosen up, to ones where he's already started to lose a tooth," [...] explained Special Effects Makeup crewman Stephen Kelley. Each denture appliance took about a day to create. The {{final version of the}} creature, Kelley noted, was [...] "very exaggerated... He's got the big giant quills coming off it like a porcupine. And it's also got six nipples on it, which is part of us trying to investigate what this creature actually it is." ...|$|E
500|$|The next day, Presley {{recorded}} [...] "Hound Dog", {{along with}} [...] "Any Way You Want Me" [...] and [...] "Don't Be Cruel". The Jordanaires sang harmony, {{as they had}} on The Steve Allen Show; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, the singer made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis at which he announced, [...] "You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight." [...] In August, a judge in Jacksonville, Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for <b>wiggling</b> his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order. The single pairing [...] "Don't Be Cruel" [...] with [...] "Hound Dog" [...] ruled {{the top of the}} charts for 11 weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for 36 years.

500|$|A typical teleost fish has a {{streamlined}} body for rapid swimming, and locomotion is generally {{provided by a}} lateral undulation of the hindmost part of the trunk and the tail, propelling the fish through the water. There are many exceptions to this method of locomotion, especially where speed is not the main objective; among rocks and on coral reefs, slow swimming with great manoeuvrability may be a desirable attribute. Eels locomote by <b>wiggling</b> their entire bodies. Living among seagrasses and algae, the seahorse adopts an upright posture and moves by fluttering its pectoral fins, and the closely related pipefish moves by rippling its elongated dorsal fin. Gobies [...] "hop" [...] along the substrate, propping themselves up and propelling themselves with their pectoral fins. Mudskippers move {{in much the same}} way on terrestrial ground. In some species, a pelvic sucker allows them to climb, and the Hawaiian freshwater goby climbs waterfalls while migrating. Gurnards have three pairs of free rays on their pectoral fins which have a sensory function but on which they can walk along the substrate. Flying fish launch themselves into the air and can glide on their enlarged pectoral fins for hundreds of metres.|$|E

Jason Stratley from The Philadelphia Inquirer said that [...] "On stage, <b>wiggling</b> and writhing, a rock-video vision of messy, bleached- blond hair, bare skin, sequined paisley and dime store diamonds was the flash-and-trash rock queen Madonna. Behold the Madonna clones—she {{is turning into}} one fine legend." [...] Jeff Sewald from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] "the modus operandi [...] was clear. Madonna was not only selling her music to throngs of teen-agers and adults alike, but she was selling herself and the entire package {{proved to be a}} joy for the 14,500 screaming fans. [...] Madonna's 'Virgin Tour' had torn the cover off Pittsburgh's sexuality." [...] Rachel Lee from The Sacramento Bee felt that [...] "more than any pop star in recent memory, even Boy George and Prince, Madonna is an image. Her hour-long concert here Tuesday night, as professionally performed and well-choreographed as it was, did nothing to give her more dimension than the two already bestowed on her." [...] Arthur Daniels from Lexington Herald-Leader felt that [...] "Madonna looked grim, but the fans were delighted when the blond rock star made her first major concert appearance to kick off her 'Virgin Tour'. [...] She looked blank and did not look up as she passed fans who gathered by the stage door before the show." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{there is}} some {{question}} of whether the fish are a good choice for the typical aquarist. While they are not aggressive carnivores like the piranha, their crushing jaw system, used primarily for eating seeds and nuts, can be hazardous. One toddler needed surgery after a pacu (misreported as a piranha) bit her finger at Edinburgh Butterfly and Insect World in Scotland. Commenting on the incident, Deep Sea World zoological manager Matthew Kane warned, [...] "Pacus will eat anything, even children's <b>wiggling</b> fingers." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "A cinaedus {{is a man}} who cross-dresses or flirts like a girl. Indeed, the word's {{etymology}} {{suggests an}} indirect sexual act emanating a promiscuous woman. This term has been borrowed from the Greek kinaidos (which may itself have come from a language of Ionian Greecs of Asia Minor, primarily signifying a purely effeminate dancer who entertained his audiences with a tympanum or tambourine in his hand, and adopted a lascivious style, often suggestively <b>wiggling</b> his buttocks {{in such a way as}} to suggest anal intercourse....The primary meaning of cinaedus never died out; the term never became a dead metaphor." ...|$|E

Pink-hop engages in receptive anal intercourse with Pinkerton and Sharpless while performing cunnilingus on the women. [...] While having vaginal and anal sex with the women, Pink-hop also fellates Pinkerton and Sharpless. The film ends with Pinkerton waving at the audience.|$|E

2500|$|The major {{activity}} {{for the day}} was mission's first spacewalk (EVA 1) by astronauts Foreman and Satcher. Foreman, the lead spacewalker wore a suit with solid red stripes while Satcher wore an all-white spacesuit. Inside the space station Atlantis Mission Specialist Randolph Bresnik choreographed the activities and coordinated communications between the spacewalkers and Mission Control. Since Foreman and Satcher completed their chores nearly two hours ahead of schedule, planners decided to add a [...] "get ahead" [...] task; Satcher to lubricate the Kibo robotic arm snares while Foreman to route a LAN cable on Zarya and mate power cables on a patch panel at the S0 truss. Towards the end of EVA 1, while deploying the Payload Attach System (PAS) on the Earth-facing side of the Starboard 3 truss, the crew had difficulty loosening a bolt and removing a diagonal brace on the PAS. After hammering on a bolt and <b>wiggling</b> the brace, they successfully deployed the PAS and reinstalled the brace. The spacewalk marked: 228th spacewalk conducted by U.S. astronauts, the 134th in support of space station assembly and maintenance, 106th spacewalk out of the space station, the fourth for Foreman and the first for Satcher.|$|E
2500|$|In oratory, the toga {{came into}} its own. Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria (circa 95 AD) offers {{advice on how}} best to plead cases at Rome's law-courts, before the {{watching}} multitude's informed and critical eye. Effective pleading was a calculated artistic performance, but must seem utterly natural. First impressions counted; the lawyer must present himself as a Roman should: [...] "virile and splendid" [...] in his toga, with statuesque posture and [...] "natural good looks". He should be well groomed – but not too well; no primping of the hair, jewellery or any other [...] "feminine" [...] perversions of a Roman man's proper appearance. Quintillian gives precise instructions on the correct use of the toga – its cut, style, and the arrangements of its folds. Its fabric can be old-style rough wool, or new and smoother if preferred – but definitely not silk. The orator's movements should be dignified, and to the point; he should move only as he must, to address a particular person, a particular section of the audience. He should employ to good effect that subtle [...] "language of the hands" [...] for which Roman oratory was famed; no extravagant gestures, no <b>wiggling</b> of the shoulders, no moving [...] "like a dancer".|$|E
2500|$|Presley {{was even}} {{seen as a}} [...] "definite danger to the {{security}} of the United States."

[...] They were compared with [...] "masturbation or riding a microphone." [...] Some saw the singer as a sexual pervert, and psychologists feared that teenage girls and boys could easily be [...] "aroused to sexual indulgence and perversion by certain types of motions and hysteria,—the type that was exhibited at the Presley show." [...] In August 1956 in Jacksonville, Florida a local Juvenile Court judge called Presley a [...] "savage" [...] and threatened to arrest him if he shook his body while performing at Jacksonville's Florida Theatre, justifying the restrictions by saying his music was undermining the youth of America. Throughout the performance, Presley stood still as ordered but poked fun at the judge by <b>wiggling</b> a finger. Similar attempts to stop his [...] "sinful gyrations" [...] continued {{for more than a year}} and included his often-noted January 6, 1957 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show (during which he performed the spiritual number [...] "Peace in the Valley"), when he was filmed only from the waist up.|$|E
