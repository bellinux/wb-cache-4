5|$|As {{well as his}} {{building}} projects Wilfrid also commissioned works to embellish the churches, including altar cloths made of silk woven with gold threads, and a gospel book written on parchment dyed purple, with gold lettering. The gospels were then enclosed in a gold book cover set with gems. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> he had built at Ripon was consecrated, a three-day feast was held to accompany the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The 12th-century font {{was removed}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was made redundant; {{it is now}} in the nearby church of St Maelog, Llanfaelog. The church now houses a 15th-century {{octagonal}} font made of gritstone, positioned on an octagonal stem. The communion rails are dated 1764 and is of a simple design; the pulpit, also 18th-century, has recessed panels.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the wreck, Mariners' Church in Detroit rang its bell 29times; once for each life lost. The church {{continued}} to hold an annual memorial, reading {{the names of the}} crewmen and ringing the church bell, until 2006 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> broadened its memorial ceremony to commemorate all lives lost on the Great Lakes.|$|E

5|$|The {{red brick}} Trinity Methodist Church was {{completed}} in 1888. It has survived many troubles, including flooding in its opening year, damage {{on the night of}} 8/9 December 1940 by enemy action, and an arson attack on Christmas Eve 1980, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was only just saved from complete destruction by the presence of a police officer in a patrol car nearby, who managed to call the fire brigade.|$|E
5|$|According {{to another}} legend, {{there was once}} a sea where the Dnieper River now flows. When Saint Andrew came to Kiev and erected a cross on the place where the Saint Andrew's Church now stands, the sea went away. The only part that {{remained}} of the sea is under the mountain on which Kiev sits today. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was built there in the 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again and flood the left bank of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|St George's Church is a 14th-century stone {{building}} with slate roof. The roof was thatched until 1863, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was heavily restored. In 1886, it {{was struck by}} lightning and required extensive rebuilding. Today, the church consists of a chancel, nave, north porch, and south vestry. The octagonal bowl font still has an original lead lining. St. George's Church, a Grade II* listed building, {{is part of the}} Ely Team Ministry. The Baptist chapel was erected in 1867 on the site of its 1839 predecessor.|$|E
50|$|A major {{restoration}} {{took place}} in 1928 under supervision of architect Erik Fant, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>church's</b> medieval paintings were recovered. The medieval murals from ca. 1440 are attributed to Albertus Pictor.|$|R
50|$|The Nauvoo Brass Band was an {{official}} musical organization of <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>church's</b> headquarters {{were located in}} Nauvoo, Illinois.

50|$|A {{complete}} set of coins for 1933, including a 1933 penny, one of only seven known examples, was buried <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>church's</b> foundation stone was laid. The coin was stolen in 1970.|$|R
5|$|St Helen's Church is the Anglican parish {{church of}} Ashby-de-la-Zouch, in the deanery of North West Leicestershire and the Diocese of Leicester. There was {{a church in}} the town in the 11th century, but {{the core of the}} present {{building}} mainly dates from work started in 1474, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was rebuilt by William Hastings {{at the same time that}} he converted his neighbouring manor house into a castle. The church was refurbished in about 1670 to create more space, but the large and increasing size of the congregation led to further work in 1829, and a major rebuild in 1878–80, including the widening of the nave by the addition of two outer aisles.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's Church, Bodewryd {{is a small}} medieval {{church in}} the hamlet of Bodewryd, in Anglesey, north Wales. The date of {{construction}} is unknown, {{but there was a}} church on this site in 1254 and the earliest feature to which a date can be given is a doorway in a 15th-century style dating to around 1500. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> was restored in 1867 after being struck by lightning, stained glass with Islamic-influenced patterns was included in the windows, a requirement of Lord Stanley of Alderley, the church's benefactor, who was a convert to Islam.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Windsor married Simpson, who {{had changed}} her name by deed poll to Wallis Warfield, in a private {{ceremony}} on 3 June 1937, at Château de Candé, near Tours, France. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> of England refused to sanction the union, a County Durham clergyman, the Reverend Robert Anderson Jardine (Vicar of St Paul's, Darlington), offered to perform the ceremony, and the Duke accepted. The new king, George VI, forbade {{members of the royal}} family to attend, to the lasting resentment of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Edward had particularly wanted his brothers the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent and his second cousin Louis Mountbatten to attend the ceremony.|$|E
50|$|This {{lasted until}} <b>the</b> 1840s, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> in Shrub Oak and Peekskill {{to the west}} {{received}} their own circuit. In 1860 <b>the</b> <b>church</b> received a major rehabilitation, adding some decoration in the Greek Revival, reducing {{the size of the}} pulpit and adding the gallery.|$|R
50|$|In 1984, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>church's</b> first area presidencies were created, Didier {{was made}} {{president}} of the South America North Area, which included Brazil {{as well as the}} Spanish-speaking nations of South America from Peru north.|$|R
50|$|The Duchess of Newcastle-under-Lyne died in 1822 in childbirth. In {{memory of}} her, the 4th Duke built {{a church and}} {{mausoleum}} at Milton, Nottinghamshire. In 1833, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> new <b>church</b> at Milton was finished, it became <b>the</b> parish <b>church,</b> replacing <b>the</b> old one at West Markham. This situation was reversed, however, in 1949 when All Saints, West Markham, was reinstated as <b>the</b> parish <b>church,</b> and <b>the</b> Duke’s mausoleum was left to decay. Milton Church, now simply a mausoleum, was finally rescued in 1972 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Churches</b> Conservation Trust took it into guardianship.|$|R
5|$|Daun's {{battle plan}} took the Prussians {{completely}} by surprise. The {{east side of}} Frederick's line {{was the first to}} be attacked. Using the starless night and fog as cover, and grouped into small shock units for easier control and stealth, the Austrians fell on the Prussian battery <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> bell signaled 5:00, catching the Prussians completely off guard. Many men were still sleeping, or just waking up, when the attack started. After setting fire to the village, the Croats cut tent ropes, causing the canvas to fall on sleeping soldiers, then bayoneted the men as they struggled to free themselves from canvas and cords. Men tangled in the tents bled to death, in what today is still called Blutgasse, or Blood Alley.|$|E
5|$|As chief {{financial}} administrator, he bore {{the brunt of}} the chronicler's condemnations for extortion and efforts to increase royal revenues. Besides attempts to increase the efficiency of collection and the rate of taxation, Ranulf created new methods of raising money. One of his new measures in revenue collection came in 1094, when the fyrd, or English militia, was assembled to fight in Normandy against the king's brother Robert Curthose. When all the men had assembled, instead of sending them to Normandy, Ranulf dismissed them, after collecting the 10 shillings that each man had been given by their district for maintenance. Ranulf then spent the money on mercenaries. Ranulf also actively pressed lawsuits, including bringing suit against Anselm on the day of Anselm's consecration as Archbishop of Canterbury. Another innovation was the attempt to collect a relief, much like the relief due from vassals at the death of an overlord, from the under-tenants of church lands <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> office changed hands. This attempt came at the death of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester in 1095, when the king sent writs to the free tenants of the bishop, setting the amount of relief owed to the king. This attempt was not repeated, however.|$|E
5|$|The founders' {{hopes that}} their college would produce {{prominent}} Welsh clergy were fulfilled {{in no small}} measure when a former student, A. G. Edwards, was elected the first Archbishop of Wales <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> in Wales was disestablished in 1920. Two later Archbishops of Wales, Glyn Simon (Archbishop from 1968 to 1971) and Gwilym Owen Williams (Archbishop 1971–1982) were also educated at the college. Celticists associated with the college include Sir John Rhys, Sir John Morris-Jones, and Sir Thomas (T. H.) Parry-Williams, whilst the list of historians includes the college's first graduate, David Powel, who published the first printed history of Wales in 1584, and the Victorian historian J. R. Green. Angus Buchanan won the Victoria Cross during the First World War. Record-breaking quadriplegic solo sailor Hilary Lister was also a student here, whilst from the field of arts and entertainment there are names such as Magnus Magnusson, presenter of Mastermind, the National Poet of Wales Gwyn Thomas, and television weather presenters Kirsty McCabe and Siân Lloyd. Nigel Hitchin, the Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford since 1997, studied at the college, as did Edward Hinds (a physicist who won the Rumford Medal in 2008), Chris Rapley (director of the Science Museum), and the zoologists Edward Bagnall Poulton and James Brontë Gatenby.|$|E
