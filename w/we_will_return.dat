25|$|It {{is useful}} to compare the {{situation}} to the classical case. In both cases, the particle behaves as a free particle outside of the barrier region. A classical particle with energy E larger than the barrier height V0 will be slowed down but never reflected by the barrier, while a classical particle with E < V0 incident on the barrier from the left would always be reflected. Once we have found the quantum-mechanical result <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>return</b> {{to the question of}} how to recover the classical limit.|$|E
