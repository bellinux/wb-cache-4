5|$|The weather {{forecast}} {{called for the}} heat inversion to end that day, followed by a cold <b>wind</b> <b>that</b> would disperse the smog. Nevertheless, Heller {{said that if the}} wind did not come, a first-stage alert would likely remain in effect and it might become necessary to declare a second-stage alert if conditions worsened.|$|E
5|$|A monsoon is a {{seasonal}} prevailing <b>wind</b> <b>that</b> lasts {{for several months}} within tropical regions. The term was first used in English in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and neighboring countries {{to refer to the}} big seasonal winds blowing from the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the development off a heat low over the Asian, African, and North American continents during May through July, and over Australia in December.|$|E

5|$|Flower was {{intended}} as a spiritual successor to Flow. Using the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller, the player controls <b>wind</b> <b>that</b> blows a flower petal through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Murphy {{played the}} lead role in Ken Loach's Palme d'Or-winning film The <b>Wind</b> <b>That</b> Shakes the Barley. He teamed up again with Boyle for the science-fiction film Sunshine (2007), and with Nolan for the highly {{successful}} thriller Inception (2010). Since 2013, Murphy has played {{the lead in the}} BBC gangster series Peaky Blinders. He has continued to work on stage, and won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance for Misterman in 2011. Murphy lives {{with his wife and two}} children in Monkstown, Dublin.|$|E
5|$|The {{werewolf}} {{is revealed}} to be Angelika's father, who is under the Queen's spell. It turns out that he is only able to keep on living due to an enchanted spike that is lodged into his chest and, without such, the spell is broken. Angelika is drowned by her father, becoming the 12th victim. The Brothers reach the tower while the Queen breathes an ice <b>wind</b> <b>that</b> puts out the forest fire.

5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game is spent sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail is driven by <b>wind</b> <b>that</b> blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a tailwind behind the boat will give it top speed, while sailing against the wind is difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land. Some items serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea {{with the help of a}} sea chart, which can be updated with information on each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations. On land, dungeons feature similar maps.|$|E
5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar <b>wind</b> <b>that</b> will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the debut}} of women's ski jumping at these championships, the big winner in the jumping events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer. Adding the 10km mass start, the Nordic {{combined}} format was changed from 7.5km sprint and 15km individual Gundersen to 10km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15km event. Despite concern over the lack of snowfall that plagued event preparation prior to the championships, the championships themselves had an abundance of snowfall and <b>wind</b> <b>that</b> caused the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined mass start to be postponed {{for a day and}} the ski jumping individual large hill competition to be limited to one jump.|$|E

The <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> crash into the mountain ascend in an Orographic lift, this cooler air cannot hold the moisture as well as warm air and this effectively raises the relative humidity, creating clouds and frequently precipitation. The clouds that manage to pass over the mountain, move hastily downwards creating foehn <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> raise the temperature of the area west of the Sierra, which include the Santa Marta, and Ciénaga.|$|R
5|$|It {{was during}} this time that the entire sport of ski jumping {{underwent}} a significant transition in technique. Until the early 1990s nearly all athletes used the parallel style (or Däscher technique), in which the skis are held close together and parallel to each other. This had been the norm since the 1950s, with Matti Nykänen creating {{a variation in the}} 1980s with the skis pointed diagonally off to the side in a crude attempt to increase surface area, which yielded more distance. However, this came largely at the expense of stability and balance, akin to 'walking a tightrope' in mid-air and leaving athletes {{at the mercy of the}} elements. Akimoto, Findeisen, Berg, and Goldberger's accidents were all caused by unpredictable gusts of <b>wind</b> <b>that</b> made them lose control at the highest and fastest stage of their jumps, exacerbated by an outdated technique ill-suited to the new extremes of ski flying, as well as the prevalence of older hills featuring very steep slopes.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends on the {{characteristics}} of the prevailing wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong <b>wind</b> <b>that</b> blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the <b>wind</b> <b>that</b> day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
