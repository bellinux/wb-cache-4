25|$|In {{the defence}} {{of a lawsuit}} {{initiated}} against him in 1948, he found himself actually researching and providing detailed instructions to his defence attorney (lawyer) to fight the case in court. When the case was finally decided in his favour, he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> about the outcome {{that he decided to}} change career and enter the legal profession. He therefore applied and gained admission into the famous London School of Economics (LSE) to study law. He departed from the shores of Nigeria in December 1949 on board an ocean liner sailing along the westbound coast of Africa to the UK. He took and passed the LLB (Bachelor of Laws) in June 1952. He passed the English Bar exams, and almost immediately was invited to the Bar association (Inner Temple). He was in fact the first Ijesha man called to the English Bar.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the omer count (i.e. the Sefirat HaOmer), as {{enumerated}} in the Midrash Rabba Parashas Emor, explains that when the Children of Israel left ancient Egypt they were told by Moses that 49 days after the Exodus, they would be given the Torah. The populace <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> {{at the prospect of}} a spiritual liberation, following the physical emancipation from Egypt, they kept a count of the passing days that ended with the giving of the Torah at the foot of Mount Sinai. The Torah itself, in , and , states that it is a commandment to count seven complete weeks from the day after Passover night ending with the festival of Shavuot on the fiftieth day. Shavuot is the festival marking the giving of the Torah to the Hebrew nation on the 6th of the Hebrew month of Sivan.|$|E

I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> to be offered the part because I felt that it was a role which I could really attack. I understand her character and feel that we have lots in common." [...] Dan Stevens was chosen to play Edward Ferrars, Elinor's love interest. The actor revealed to a BBC journalist that he had really wanted the part and was excited by the challenge of the character. Stevens became ill with tonsillitis during the shoot, and quipped that there are very few shots of him in full health still in the series.|$|E

Gemma Whelan, who plays Yara, talked about filming the scene: [...] "Oh my goodness – I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> when I saw that I had a scene with those two [...]" [...] About the dynamic between the two women, Whelan said: [...] "It's clear as the scene plays out that Yara quite likes Dany. We share a lot of little looks and there's some playful language in how we talk to one another – Dany asks if the Iron Islands ever had a queen, and Yara says, 'No more than Westeros.'

500|$|After film {{director}} John Badham learned that Ross {{was going to}} play the part of Dorothy, he decided not to direct the film, and Cohen replaced him with Sidney Lumet. Of his decision not to direct The Wiz, John Badham recalled telling Cohen that he thought Ross was [...] "a wonderful singer. She's a terrific actress and a great dancer, but she's not this character. She's not the little six-year-old girl Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz." [...] Though 20th Century Fox had financially backed the stage musical, they ended up exercising their first refusal rights to the film production, which gave Universal an opening to finance the film. Initially, Universal <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> about the film's prospects that they did not set a budget for production.|$|E
500|$|At the 2015 New York Comic Con, Muto {{revealed}} that the miniseries originated with ideas that were initially developed during the show's second season. He remarked, [...] "There was this idea from season two about Marceline and ... how she got her powers to begin with. We kind of rolled with that and expanded that into eight episodes." [...] Olson was not aware that the producers and writers were working on a Marceline-centric miniseries until the series' head writer, Kent Osborne, casually mentioned it {{to her in a}} conversation; when she learned of this, she reportedly cried because she <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited.</b> Due to the Marceline-centric nature of the miniseries, a new opening was created that features Olson singing the theme song over a bass guitar. This intro was storyboarded by Tom Herpich and was animated by Masaaki Yuasa's company Science SARU.|$|E
500|$|... "Five Short Graybles" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Tom Herpich, Skyler Page, and Cole Sanchez, from a story {{developed}} by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. The episode {{was directed by}} Larry Leichliter. This was the first episode that Page worked on for the series; he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> {{to be working on}} the series that after he finished the storyboard, he traveled to Hawaii as a personal reward. The episode can trace its genesis to a short, but humorous scene involving a high five that Ward had been forced to cut from an episode. Ward was unhappy about the edit, and later jokingly said via his Twitter that he would make an episode entirely about high-fives. Although Ward was being facetious, the idea of using a high five as an overarching plot point was then used in [...] "Five Short Graybles".|$|E

500|$|The {{operetta}} Candide {{was originally}} conceived by playwright Lillian Hellman, as a play with incidental music. Leonard Bernstein, the American composer and conductor {{who wrote the}} music, <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> about the project that he convinced Hellman {{to do it as}} a [...] "comic operetta". Many lyricists worked on the show, including James Agee, Dorothy Parker, John Latouche, Richard Wilbur, Leonard and Felicia Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim and Hellman. Hershy Kay orchestrated all the pieces except for the overture, which Bernstein did himself. [...] Candide first opened on Broadway as a musical on 1 December 1956. The premier production was directed by Tyrone Guthrie and conducted by Samuel Krachmalnick. While this production was a box office flop, the music was highly praised, and an original cast album was made. The album gradually became a cult hit, but Hellman's libretto was criticised as being too serious an adaptation of Voltaire's novel. Candide would be more popular seventeen years later with a new libretto by Hugh Wheeler.|$|E

[...] Nurmi was known to {{emphasize the importance of}} psychological strength: [...] "Mind is everything; muscle, pieces of rubber. All that I am, I am because of my mind." [...] Regarding Nurmi's track antics, Peltzer found that [...] "in his impenetrability he was a Buddha gliding on the track. Stopwatch in hand, lap after lap, he ran towards the tape, subject only to the laws of a mathematical table." [...] Marathoner Johnny Kelley, who first met his idol at the 1936 Olympics, said that while Nurmi appeared cold to him at first, the two chatted for quite a while after Nurmi had asked for his name: [...] "He grabbed ahold of me— he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited.</b> I couldn't believe it!" ...|$|E

500|$|Tess Harper was {{performing}} {{on stage in}} Texas when she attended a casting call for a minor role in the film. Beresford {{was so impressed with}} her that he cast her in the lead. He later said that the actresses he had seen before her demonstrated a sophistication and worldliness inappropriate for the part, while she brought a kind of rural quality without coming across as simple or foolish. Beresford said of Harper, [...] "She walked into the room and even before she spoke, I thought, 'That's the girl to play the lead. Harper said she knew she won the role when Beresford appeared on her doorstep with a bottle of champagne in each hand. Tender Mercies was Harper's feature film debut, and she <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> about the role she bit her script {{to make sure it was}} real.

Gaga performed several songs from her third studio album, Artpop. The singer had collaborated twice with the Muppets in the past; in 2009 Kermit the Frog was her date at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, and she featured Jim Henson's Creature Shop pieces on the Monster Ball Tour (2009–2011).|$|E
500|$|After her promotional {{activities}} {{ended in}} Japan, Carey flew to Hawaii for a three-day music video shoot from June 8–10, 2008. The video {{was directed by}} Chris Applebaum and premiered on BET's 106 & Park on July 3, 2008 at 6:00pm ET/PT and on Yahoo! Music at midnight on the same day. It later appeared on Total Request Live (TRL) on July 7, 2008. Aside from the video's original version, the remix also featured an accompanying video, with some additional scenes from T.I. Some of the scenes were filmed on the beaches of Hawaii, {{while some of the}} smaller parts were shot in Wet'n'Wild Hawaii. According to several reports, Carey was seriously injured on the set of the video during shooting on June 9. Carey's representative quickly denied the allegation, and said [...] "She <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> to be shooting in Hawaii. She wanted all her friends to come down and {{be a part of the}} shoot."

500|$|Criticism of Irwin's career {{following}} his death came from Dan Mathews, vice-president {{of the animal}} rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comparing Irwin to a [...] "cheap reality TV star", Mathews accused him of [...] "antagonising frightened wild animals ... a very dangerous message to send to children", contrasted his methods with the behaviour of [...] "a responsible conservationist like Jacques Cousteau", {{and said it was}} [...] "no shock at all that Steve Irwin should die provoking a dangerous animal." [...] The son of Jacques Cousteau, Jean-Michel Cousteau—also a producer of wildlife documentaries—took issue with Irwin's [...] "very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" [...] and suggested instead that [...] "You don't touch nature, you just look at it." [...] Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., on the other hand, called Irwin [...] "a remarkable individual"; describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, [...] "I think why Steve <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> about it that we were looking at these animals that people think of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the Munich appointment Solti gained a recording contract in 1946. He signed for Decca Records, not as a conductor but as a piano accompanist. He made his first recording in 1947, playing Brahms's First Violin Sonata with the violinist Georg Kulenkampff. He was insistent {{that he wanted to}} conduct, and Decca gave him his first recording sessions as a conductor later in the same year, with the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra in Beethoven's Egmont overture. Twenty years later Solti said, [...] "I'm sure it's a terrible record, because the orchestra was not very good at that time and I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited.</b> It is horrible, surely horrible– but by now it has vanished." [...] He had to wait two years for his next recording as a conductor. It was in London, Haydn's Drum Roll symphony, in sessions produced by John Culshaw, with whose career Solti's became closely linked over the next two decades. Reviewing the record, The Gramophone said, [...] "The performance of the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Georg Solti (a fine conductor who is new to me) is remarkable for rhythmic playing, richness of tone, and clarity of execution." [...] The Record Guide compared it favourably with EMI's rival recording by Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic.|$|E
500|$|U2's {{delivery}} of Zooropa in late May caught PolyGram somewhat off-guard, {{because they were}} not expecting a new album by the group for several years. With Achtung Baby, PolyGram had approximately six months to market the record and plan its release strategy, but the sudden completion of Zooropa necessitated a more hurried promotional plan. PolyGram president/CEO Rick Dobbis explained: [...] "For the last one, we prepared for six months. It was like a marathon. But this is like a sprint, and that is the spirit it was made in. The band <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> about it, they sprinted to complete the album before the ... tour. We want to bring it to the street with that same spirit." [...] Island/PolyGram's and U2's marketing for Zooropa was intended to focus less on singles and more on the record as a whole, and ultimately, only three singles were released, compared to Achtung Babys five singles. The first single [...] "Numb" [...] was released in June 1993 exclusively on VHS as a [...] "video single". The music video was directed by Kevin Godley. The song peaked at number seven in Australia and number nine in Canada, while reaching number two on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. However, it failed to chart on the singles charts in the UK or US.|$|E
