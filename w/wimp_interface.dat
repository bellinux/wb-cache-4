50|$|The reason <b>WIMP</b> <b>interfaces</b> {{have become}} so {{prevalent}} since their conception at Xerox PARC {{is that they are}} very good at abstracting work-spaces, documents, and their actions. Their analogous paradigm to documents as paper sheets or folders makes <b>WIMP</b> <b>interfaces</b> easy to introduce to other users. Furthermore their basic representations as rectangular regions on a 2D flat screen make them a good fit for system programmers, thus favoring the abundance of commercial widget toolkits in this style.|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} a new interaction model called Instrumental Interaction that extends and generalizes {{the principles of}} direct manipulation. It covers existing interaction styles, including traditional <b>WIMP</b> <b>interfaces,</b> {{as well as new}} interaction styles such as two-handed input and augmented reality. It defines a design space for new interaction techniques and a set of properties for comparing them. Instrumental Interaction describes graphical user interfaces in terms of domain objects and interaction instruments. Interaction between users and domain objects is mediated by interaction instruments, similar to the tools and instruments we use in the real world to interact with physical objects. The article presents the model, applies it to describe and compare a number of interaction techniques, and shows how it was used to create a new interface for searching and replacing text.

In contrast to traditional <b>WIMP</b> <b>interfaces,</b> we allow people to directly engage with and influence a rendering. Our system allows {{the creation of new}} stroke primitives as well as provides mechanisms to distribute and then manipulate them on the canvas. We offer a set of natural mappings from hand postures to rendering parameterizations. The resulting system allows an intuitive exploration of SBR without the need for traditional desktop interfaces. ...|$|R
50|$|However, <b>WIMP</b> <b>interfaces</b> are not optimal {{for working}} with complex tasks such as {{computer-aided}} design, working on large amounts of data simultaneously, or interactive games. WIMPs are usually pixel-hungry, so given limited screen real estate they can distract attention from the task at hand. Thus, custom interfaces can better encapsulate workspaces, actions, and objects for specific complex tasks. Applications for which WIMP is not well suited include those requiring continuous input signals, showing 3D models, or simply portraying an interaction {{for which there is}} no defined standard widget.|$|R

25|$|Since the {{commands}} available in command line interfaces can be many, complex operations {{can be performed}} using a short sequence of words and symbols. This allows greater efficiency and productivity once many commands are learned, but reaching this level takes some time because the command words may not be easily discoverable or mnemonic. Also, using the command line can become slow and error-prone when users must enter long commands comprising many parameters or several different filenames at once. However, windows, icons, menus, pointer (<b>WIMP)</b> <b>interfaces</b> present users with many widgets that represent and can trigger some of the system's available commands.|$|R

This is a marked improvement over the previous design, which was also preferred by the target user group but did not compete with dialog boxes in terms of performance.

50|$|RISC OS was a rapid {{development}} of Arthur 1.2 after {{the failure of}} the ARX project. The first release was to be called Arthur 2, but was renamed to RISC OS 2, and was first sold as RISC OS 2.00 in April 1989. The operating system implements co-operative multitasking with some limitations but is not multi-threaded. It uses the ADFS file system for both floppy and hard disc access. It initially ran from a 512 KB set of ROMs. The <b>WIMP</b> <b>interface</b> offers all the standard features and fixes many of the bugs that had hindered Arthur. It lacks virtual memory and extensive memory protection (applications are protected from each other, but many functions have to be implemented as 'modules' which have full access to the memory). At the time of release, the main advantage of the OS was its ROM; it booted very quickly and while it was easy to crash, it was impossible to permanently break the OS from software. Its high performance was due to much of the system being written in ARM assembly language.|$|E

The Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach, which was used for user interface generation since the early eighties in HCI, has recently been revived to address this complex problem. Although MDE has resulted in interesting and convincing results for conventional <b>WIMP</b> user <b>interfaces,</b> it has not fully demonstrated its theoretical promises yet.

40|$|Construction of LEGO {{models is}} a popular hobby, not only among {{children}} and young teenagers, but also for adults of all ages. Following the technological evolution and the integration of computers into the everyday life, several applications for virtual LEGO modelling have been created.

Taking advantage of new trends in of interaction paradigms we developed an innovative solution for virtual LEGO modelling using a horizontal multi-touch surface. To achieve better results, we selected the most common virtual LEGO applications and performed a comparative study, identifying {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each one. In this paper we briefly present that study and describe the application developed upon it...|$|R
5000|$|Because of this, users became {{accustomed}} to {{this style of}} interface, which was common in many productivity products at the time.

40|$|The {{challenge}} of moving past the classic Window Icons Menus Pointer (<b>WIMP)</b> <b>interface,</b> i. e. by turning it ‘ 3 D’, {{has resulted in}} much research and development. To evaluate the impact of 3 D on the ‘finding a target picture in a folder’ task, we built a 3 D <b>WIMP</b> <b>interface</b> that allowed the systematic manipulation of visual depth, visual aides, semantic category distribution of targets versus non-targets; and the detailed measurement of lower-level stimuli features. Across two separate experiments, one large sample web-based experiment, to understand associations, and one controlled lab environment, using eye tracking to understand user focus, we investigated how visual depth, use of visual aides, use of semantic categories, and lower-level stimuli features (i. e. contrast, colour and luminance) impact how successfully participants are able to search for, and detect, the target image. Moreover in the lab-based experiment, we captured pupillometry measurements to allow consideration {{of the influence of}} increasing cognitive load as a result of either an increasing number of items on the screen, or due to the inclusion of visual depth. Our findings showed that increasing the visible layers of depth, and inclusion of converging lines, did not impact target detection times, errors, or failure rates. Low-level features, including colour, luminance, and number of edges, did correlate with differences in target detection times, errors, and failure rates. Our results also revealed that semantic sorting algorithms significantly decreased target detection times. Increased semantic contrasts between a target and its neighbours correlated with an increase in detection errors. Finally, pupillometric data did not provide evidence of any correlation between the number of visible layers of depth and pupil size, however, using structural equation modelling, we demonstrated that cognitive load does influence detection failure rates when there is luminance contrasts between the target and its surrounding neighbours. Results suggest that WIMP interaction designers should consider stimulus-driven factors, which were shown to influence the efficiency with which a target icon {{can be found in a}} 3 D <b>WIMP</b> <b>interface...</b>|$|E

40|$|The basic {{elements}} of <b>WIMP</b> <b>interfaces</b> {{have proven to be}} robust components for building interactive systems, but these standard interactors also have limitations. On many occasions, researchers have introduced augmented GUI elements that are capable of more expressive interactions and that are better suited to user tasks. Although many of these novel designs have been effective, augmented interactors are still invented in an ad-hoc fashion, and there is no systematic way of thinking about or designing augmentations. As a result, there is little understanding of the principles underlying augmentation, the relationships between different designs, or the possibilities for creating new interactors.
