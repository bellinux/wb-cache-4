Veronica confronts Duncan, who abruptly breaks up {{with her in the}} middle of the fight. After their breakup, Veronica slips into a depression; Keith (Enrico Colantoni) attempts to console her to no avail. Logan and Weevil discuss who killed Felix, and they deduce that <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> was in cahoots with the Fitzpatricks. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) comes in and informs Veronica that Duncan has disappeared and kidnapped his daughter, Faith. He arrests Veronica as a supposed accomplice. At the police station, Keith pressures Veronica to tell the truth about her unknowing involvement in supplying the finances for the kidnapping. Afterwards, Sheriff Lamb requires her to write down everything she knows on a notepad. Logan asks Dick (Ryan Hansen) to get some drugs for the Pacific Coast Highway biker gang.

25|$|It {{was widely}} known that Griffin hoped {{to keep his}} job under President Barack Obama so that Constellation and NASA's other {{programs}} could maintain their steady progress. In a phone call on the day after the election, Senator Bill Nelson (D, FL) requested of Lori Garver, who led the incoming Obama Administration's Transition Team, that the Administration allow Griffin to remain as NASA Administrator to provide programmatic and management continuity. However, his resignation (required of and offered by all agency heads due to an incoming President) was accepted. In part, this was because of disagreements between Griffin and Garver over the state of Project Constellation. Griffin gave a farewell address to NASA on 16 January 2009, in which he praised NASA for its recovery from the Columbia disaster and urged employees to support the new administrator, <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> may be. He left office the day President Obama was inaugurated.|$|E
500|$|For the {{remainder}} of the convention, delegates continued to try to conciliate the Clay supporters. A number of speeches were made in tribute to the Kentucky senator, and attendees roared with approval when a pre-written letter from Clay was read, expressing support for the nominee, <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> might be. The magnanimous tone of the letter contrasted with Clay's reaction when on December 8, the day after the convention closed, he became the first Whig presidential hopeful to learn the outcome: [...] "My [...] friends are not worth the powder and shot it would take to kill them." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps {{rated the}} episode an [...] "A", adding [...] "it's not like there's any {{shortage}} of action". He {{felt that the}} effects used in the episode were effective and frightening while still seeming low-key. In his view, the episode's blending of surrealism and horror was similar to scenes from Lynch's 2001 film Mulholland Drive. Phipps described the climactic murder as [...] "one of the most disturbing moments in the Lynch filmography", adding {{that it was a}} recurring Lynchian theme to represent the end of innocence as an actual death. IGN's Matt Fowler included the murder at number16 in a list of the [...] "Top 20Creepiest Moments on TV", describing it as [...] "nightmare fuel". Fowler felt the depiction of the killing was [...] "savage" [...] and unusually long for a television scene; however, he added that the rampant speculation as to the identity of the killer meant that <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> was revealed to have been, it would be [...] "somewhat expected".|$|E

500|$|More {{recently}} {{it has been}} proposed that the true author was Henry Lovelich, a poet, whom Gregory would have known well, since they are both mentioned in the will of a prominent London merchant in July 1434. J.A.F. Thomson has suggested that, actually, the chronicler was a churchman, due among other things to the quantity of Latin aphorisms the later text contains, compared with the pre-1467 section; either way, Thomson agrees that <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> was, {{must have been a}} man with [...] "London connections and a pride in the city." [...] One of the most recent biographers Gregory has noted how, in fact, [...] "a single reference, to a papal indulgence issued in 1455, associates Gregory personally with [...] chronicle... but the extent of his authorship is uncertain." [...] For instance Michael Hicks goes no further than to suggest tentatively that, of all the London chroniclers, “at least one was a mayor,” whilst Jeremy Catto believes that [...] "that we can identify no particular individual writer.“ Mary-Rose McLaren summed up the problem facing historians wishing to establish the authorship of the Edgerton MS when she pointed out that, comparing Gregory's chronicle with others of the period, {{there is more than one}} mayor named in it, and that in any case, it is not the only one to name Gregory as the mayor of London during that time.|$|E
500|$|At around 9:30 on {{the night}} of September 27, 1868, Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his {{newspaper}} with his children. The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss. Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters from the porch of his house. With [...] "perfect composure", Hindman told listeners to [...] "unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people". Hindman hinted at the recent political debate with Powell Clayton as a possible motivation for the shooting and said, [...] "I do not know who killed me; but I can say, <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> was, I forgive him." [...] He asked James H. O'Connor, the husband of Mollie's stepmother, to [...] "take care of my family and be a protector to my wife and dear little ones". After O'Connor accepted, Hindman stated, [...] "I forgive everybody, and hope they will forgive me." [...] Afterwards, he was too weak to continue speaking, and he sat down on a lounge. He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the Gazette said Hindman died as an [...] "able and distinguished man" [...] whose [...] "short but splendid career" [...] {{had a profound impact on}} Arkansan state politics.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens in}} Havana, Cuba. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) surprises a now-bearded Duncan (Teddy Dunn), who denies killing Lilly (Amanda Seyfried). At school, Veronica avoids Logan, but that night, Logan {{shows up at}} Veronica's door. Logan apologizes for owning GHB before Veronica informs him about her rape. Logan denies being her rapist, but Veronica says she'll punish <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> is, even if it's Logan. Veronica talks to Meg (Alona Tal) about the party, and she {{mentions}} seeing Veronica being harassed by some boys before she left. Keith returns Duncan to the Kanes before threatening Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan). Veronica approaches Luke (Sam Huntington) about a trip to Tijuana {{to pick up some}} GHB; he admits getting the drugs, but he says that he gave them to Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen). Luke states that Madison Sinclair was seen writing [...] "slut" [...] on Veronica's car after the party. Veronica confronts Madison, who says that she defaced Veronica's car because she made out with Dick, her boyfriend. However, Veronica doesn't remember this incident due to the effects of the drugs. Veronica attempts to barge in on a fight between Keith and Alicia over Wallace's involvement in the Wiedman case, but her intervention does nothing to defuse the situation. Veronica talks to Casey, who confirms the make out sessions with Dick and Cassidy, and Veronica was also forced to make out with Shelly for the boys' amusement.|$|E

So {{for the first time the}} lyrics started being written before recording begun, with Grohl stating that he [...] "sat in the back of the studio and just wrote every day for about 14 hours a day." [...] Most of the lyrics of the album deal with themes of birth, death and life, which Grohl attributed to the birth of his daughter Violet, considering that having a child [...] "changes your entire outlook on the world", and that he was suddenly more emotional - [...] "So when you're writing music with that in mind or that in your heart, everything just blooms into this fucking incredibly colourful, colourful feeling." [...] Helped by the extensive lyrical preparation, the lyrics also tried to show more of Grohl's feelings, [...] "those things that you've always wanted to do or always wanted to say", with Hawkins adding that he could not listen to [...] "Stranger Things Have Happened" [...] as [...] "I'm one of his best friends, and the last thing I want to do is read a love letter to his wife or <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Iturbide {{met with}} Juan de O’Donoju and hastily {{negotiated}} a treaty, called the Treaty of Córdoba. [...] Similar to the Plan de Iguala, this document tried to guarantee an independent monarchy for New Spain under the Bourbon dynasty. [...] This successor state would invite Ferdinand VII to rule as emperor or, in default, his brother Don Carlos. [...] If both refused, a suitable monarch would be searched for {{among the various}} European royal houses. [...] In the meantime, a regency would replace the viceroy. [...] All existing laws, including the 1812 Constitution, would remain in force until a new constitution for Mexico was written. A key element was added at O'Donojú's suggestion: If Spain refused its right to appoint a regent for the Mexican Empire, then the Mexican congress would have freedom to elect <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> deemed worthy as Emperor. This crucial clause was non-existent in Iturbide's Plan de Iguala, a fact that proves somewhat that Iturbide did not entertain the notion of becoming a ruler when he started his campaign for Mexico's independence.|$|E
