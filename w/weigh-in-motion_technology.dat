40|$|This paper summarises the {{developments}} in the dynamic response of bridges to traffic loading based on {{a large amount of}} simulations and field tests carried out within the 6 th EU framework ARCHES (2006 - 2009). When assessing the total traffic load effect on a bridge, there is a number of alternatives to characterise the associated dynamic component depending on the information available to the engineer. The simplest approach is to adopt the conservative values provided in bridge codes covering for many uncertainties. Nevertheless, if bridge drawings, bridge properties, updated weigh-in-motion data and road profile were known, then validated vehicle-bridge finite element interaction models can be used to reduce these uncertainties. Dynamic allowance can also be experimentally derived from measured total load effects using modern bridge <b>weigh-in-motion</b> <b>technology.</b> Guidelines are provided on how to obtain a site-specific value of dynamic allowance, both numerically and experimentally...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} site-specific lifetime extreme traffic load effects {{is an important}} element in the cost-effective assessment of bridges. In recent years, the improved quality and increasing use of <b>weigh-in-motion</b> <b>technology</b> has meant that better quality and larger databases of vehicle weights are now available. This has enabled measurements of the regular occurrence of extremely heavy vehicles, with weights in excess of 100 t. The collected measurements have been used as the basis for building and calibrating a Monte Carlo simulation model for bridge loading. The computer programs written to implement this model generate simulated traffic in two lanes – for both the same direction and the bidirectional cases – and calculate load effects for bridges of various spans. The research focuses on free-flowing traffic on short to medium-span bridges. This paper summarizes recent advances and their contribution to the highway bridge traffic loading problem...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of Bayesian {{updating}} to improve estimates of characteristic bridge traffic loading. Over recent years the use <b>Weigh-In-Motion</b> <b>technologies</b> has increased hugely. Large Weigh-In-Motion databases are now available for multiple sites on many road networks. The objective of this work is to use data gathered throughout a road network to improve site-specific estimates of bridge loading at a specific Weigh-In-Motion site on the network. Bayesian updating is a mathematical framework for combining prior knowledge with new sample data. The approach is applied here to bridge loading using a database of 81. 6 million truck records, gathered at 19 sites in the US. The database represents the prior knowledge of loading throughout the road network and a new site on the network is simulated. The Bayesian approach is compared with a non-Bayesian approach, which uses only the site-specific data, and the results compared. It is found that the Bayesian approach significantly improves the accuracy of estimates of 75 -year loading and, in particular, considerably reduces the standard deviation of the error. With the proposed approach less site-specific WIM data is required to obtain an accurate estimate of loading. This is particularly useful where there is concern over an existing bridge and accurate estimates of loading are required {{as a matter of}} urgency...|$|R

The dynamic {{weighing}} technology is multi-domain comprehensive technology, including {{the mechanics of}} materials, dynamics, the technology of sensor, the technology of electronic information and so on.

40|$|Bridge codes adopt {{values for}} dynamic {{allowance}} in traffic load models that are necessarily conservative {{to cover for}} an entire range of bridges with different mechanical characteristics, boundary conditions, and {{the large number of}} uncertainties associated to the vehicle-bridge interaction problem. A further level of conservatism occurs due to the independent manner in which the governing static load and the corresponding allowance for dynamics are specified. In particular, certain bridges are not susceptible to high levels of vehicle-bridge interaction when loaded by a critically heavy vehicle or a critical combination of vehicles. Recent advances in Bridge <b>Weigh-In-Motion</b> <b>technology</b> allow not only to collect information on the weights, spacings and speeds of the traffic loads traversing a bridge, but also to separate the maximum static strain from the total measured strain using a filtering procedure. In this paper, maximum static and total load effects are collected and analysed for three different sites as part of the European project ARCHES (6 th RTD framework programme). Bridge measurements are used to discuss the dynamics of the most frequent truck classes and the entire traffic sample. The measurements reveal a decrease in percentage increment in dynamics and a reduction on the variability of the dynamic increment as the static load effect increases. This phenomenon can be of particular relevance in the assessment of the dynamics of extreme loading cases...|$|E
40|$|Run-off {{road and}} head-on crashes {{together}} constitute around 38 % of all casualty crashes {{and a higher}} proportion (closer to 50 %) of all fatality crashes in Queensland, Australia. These statistics are a fair reflection of the national condition. Vehicles leaving the travelled way are a significant contributor to Australian road trauma. The Australian National Road Safety Strategy proposes a number of infrastructure treatments for tackling these two crash types, {{including the use of}} an appropriate road safety barrier. Road authorities deploy longitudinal road safety barriers primarily to prevent errant vehicles from impacting with hazardous roadside objects that could cause an adverse outcome for either the occupants of the errant vehicle or third parties. However, road safety barriers are not equal and are differentiated in the first instance by their capacity to contain impacts of different speed, mass and angle of incidence. While roadway departure speeds and departure angles are well-addressed in contemporary academic literature and methodologies for road safety barrier selection, the mass-distribution of the in-service vehicle fleet is less well represented. This study proposes the use of data obtained from <b>weigh-in-motion</b> <b>technology</b> to represent the mass-frequency distribution of the in-service vehicle fleet. Combined with roadway departures conditions reported by others, a methodology is presented for calculating the likelihood of vehicle-barrier impact exceeding the road safety barrier capacities prescribed by the predominant global test protocols for road safety barriers. The methodology is used to consider how different roadway configurations and traffic compositions might influence the likelihood of barrier capacity exceedance. The results from modelling of various scenarios are reported. The results suggest that the relative likelihood of barrier capacity exceedance varies as a function of cross-sectional geometry as well as traffic composition, so suggesting that a “one-size fits all” approach to road safety barrier selection is not appropriate...|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} of overweight trucks is of increasing importance. Quickly growing heavy vehicle volumes over-proportionally contribute to roadway damage. Raising maintenance costs and compromised road safety are also becoming {{a major concern}} to managing agencies. Minimizing pavement wear is done by regulating overloaded trucks on major highways at weigh stations. However, due to lengthy inspections and insufficient capacities, weigh stations tend to be inefficient. New practices, using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) transponders and <b>weigh-in-motion</b> <b>technologies,</b> called preclearance programs, {{have been set up}} in a number of countries. The primary aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the current issues with regard to the implementation and operation of the preclearance program.

Second, the operators of existing preclearance programs are interviewed for their lessons-learned and the marketing strategies used for promoting their programs. The trucking companies in Queensland are interviewed for their experiences with the current weighing practices and attitudes toward the potential preclearance system. Finally, the estimated benefit of the preclearance program deployment in Queensland is analyzed.

The purpose of the models is to estimate how a vehicle reacts to {{the behavior of the}} vehicle ahead. A weakness in these models is that they do not take the weight of each vehicle into account. It can however be shown that a vehicle?s weight affects its driving behavior. The purpose of this master?s thesis is to investigate the ability of Gipps? car-following model to reproduce differences in driving behavior caused by differences in vehicles? weight. A modified version of the model where weight is included as a parameter is to be estimated and compared to the original model and field data. The method used was to make a Matlab script which simulates vehicle driving on a road section with Gipps? model. The model results were compared to data collected from a point detector equipped with <b>Weigh-in-motion</b> <b>technology.</b> Time-gap distributions were chosen as the measure against which the models were compared. In the estimated modified model the vehicles are assigned a gross weight, which is picked from an inputted weight distribution. The deceleration parameters of the vehicles are then varied according to vehicle weight. The conclusion of the study is that the original Gipps' model can be calibrated to produce accurate results in uncongested flow. However several vehicle types would need to be defined in order for this to hold for all vehicles. A modified version of the model where vehicle weight is included as a parameter rather than separating vehicles according to type, produced accurate time-gap distributions for all vehicles, with a lower number of input parameters than the original model. However there are aspects of the driving behavior and other traffic situation for which the modified model is not compared. The areas of application of this modified model are also limited today because it requires detailed data on the vehicle weight distribution, which is not widely available and of poor quality...|$|E

In order to verify the feasibility of the method, a system prototype based on multiple sensors was designed and deployed on a relatively busy freeway. Field calibration and tests were performed with known two-axle truck wheel loads and the measurement errors were calculated based on the static weights measured with a static weighbridge.

A key to preservation of highways is gathering reliable truck traffic data which is currently being collected using weigh-stations and <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> (WIM) <b>technologies.</b> One developing method of data collection is Bridge Weigh-in-Motion (BWIM), the process by which weight data can be calculated for trucks travelling over bridges whose components have been instrumented with sensors. The research performed in this thesis involves post-processing and analysis of one year’s worth of strain measurements gathered from an existing BWIM system installed on a steel-girder bridge in Meriden, Connecticut. An algorithm is developed to calculate speeds and gross vehicle weights of trucks travelling over the in-service bridge, and the accuracy of the methodology is analyzed using data from test trucks and free-flowing traffic. Information is presented on the traffic pattern on this highway including average daily truck traffic, and truck speeds and weights. The long-term strain responses of critical girders are also used to calibrate the live load factor in the Strength I combinations of the AAHSTO LRFD specifications.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, states have {{utilized}} <b>weigh-in-motion</b> (WIM) <b>technology</b> to reduce delay and increase enforcement of overweight vehicles. Usually a threshold value {{is used to}} filter and sort the trucks by weight. If the WIM reading of a truck is over the threshold, the truck {{would be sent to}} a static scale for further inspection. To fully utilize the WIM technology and enhance the operational efficiency at WIM sites, the authors devised a dynamic weight threshold (DWT) algorithm. The threshold value is increased when the queue at the weigh station is long so as to avoid the closure of the weigh station while still catch the worst weight limit offenders. The threshold value is lowered when the queue at the station is short to maximize the number of trucks inspected. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the design and operations of the dynamic weight threshold algorithm. A microscopic simulation model based on a real-world ramp WIM weigh station site was first developed and calibrated. Subsequently the dynamic threshold adjustment strategy was modeled and tested. The results show that under a wide range of conditions DWT algorithm always outperforms the traditional static threshold operations. Under heavy demand conditions, DWT catches 16 times more overweight trucks than the static operations while keeping the average delay per truck at only 30 % of the delay under static operations. In other words, DWT is both more effective in weight enforcement and more efficient for traffic flow...|$|R

Roads {{are among the}} most important pieces of a nation’s infrastructure. To ensure the continued use of these systems they must be monitored and understood using various <b>technologies.</b> A <b>weigh-in-motion</b> (WIM) system is one such device which is used to obtain traffic flow and vehicle weight data. This sensor monitors all traffic traveling over a stretch of road without requiring the vehicles to stop for measurement. As a result, {{it can be used to}} reduce the number of overloaded trucks through enforcement of weight requirements. This will create a safer driving environment, prolong road life, and reduce maintenance costs. The largest deterrent to implementing current <b>weigh-in-motion</b> <b>technologies</b> is the large costs incurred through purchase, installation, and maintenance. In addition, these systems currently require wires to be routed through the road pavement for the purpose of data travel and power. This paper focuses on the creation of a low cost WIM sensor being developed for the addition of battery-less wireless implementation in the future. Such a system would allow for broader use of the technology and reduce the aforementioned problems caused by overloaded trucks. The final product would not only reduce costs due to road damage but also those costs associated with sensor maintenance. There are many challenges associated with the practical design of a WIM system. First, this system must be large enough to contain the full contact patch of the largest operating vehicle on the road while preventing this design from yielding under vehicle weight. Second, the sensor must be as accurate or more accurate than current WIM technologies under all operating conditions. Finally, it must have a simple and cost effective construction. In the design of such a sensor, the author implemented a two layer design to reduce the number of piezo-electric patches and thus obtain an inexpensive system. The top layer was a frame large enough to bear the weight of the full contact patch of the vehicle. The lower beams served as a mounting location for the piezos. Both layers had to withstand the full weight of the dynamic vehicle load without yielding. The design process also included resonant frequency analysis to understand if the vehicle velocity would cause a change in output of the sensor. Finally, electronics had to be developed to monitor, store, and reset piezo readings for continued operation. In addition to the aforementioned challenges, finding the means to test such a piece of equipment was extremely difficult. First, a stretch of road had to be identified which could be modified for the installation of the sensors. Equipment had to be procured to cut and remove concrete, and pour a new slab before sensor testing could begin. Additionally, vehicles of various weights had to be obtained and a driver found certified to drive them in order to test the equipment at multiple speeds. Finally, this construction and testing had to be completed during the winter outside...|$|R
40|$|Design and {{assessment}} of highway bridge structures requires accurate prediction of the maximum load effects, i. e. shear forces and bending moments etc., which may be expected during the proposed or remaining life of the structure. Traditionally these effects are calculated using conservative deterministic loading models prescribed by codes of practice. The inherent conservatism of these models lies in their need to be widely applicable. While this conservatism is relatively insignificant in design, it may be critical in assessment. In recent years advances in <b>Weigh-in-Motion</b> (WIM) <b>technology</b> {{have led to the}} increased availability of accurate and unbiased site-specific traffic records. These records have been successfully employed in the derivation of site-specific loading models and in calculation of load effects in assessment of bridge structures. The results of these assessments are accepted to be less conservative than those performed using generalised codified loading models. Given this reduction in the conservatism of the calculation it is important to quantify the implication of factors such as data inaccuracy or traffic growth on the calculated maximum load effects. This paper briefly describes the mathematical modelling involved in traffic simulation using WIM statistics. The results of direct simulations performed using WIM data are compared with those obtained through the statistical simulation technique termed Monte Carlo simulation, which is regularly employed where insufficient measured data exists. The implications of the accuracy of the recorded WIM data and the duration of recording on the predicted load effect are assessed along with the sensitivity of the extreme to the method of prediction.

40|$|Transportation by trucks plays a {{major role}} in North America’s economy. The growth of this {{industry}} will increase the loads on existing roads and highways and raises the possibility of overloaded vehicles, which causes significant damage to the pavement and consequently will reduce the lifespan of the roads. <b>Weigh-in-motion</b> (WIM) systems <b>technology</b> helps to address the challenge of overloaded vehicles. This technology provides traffic monitoring, collects data for pavement research and design, and improves the capacity of static weigh station operations. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the behaviour of WIM sensors installed in different environments, which affects reliable and precise data gathering. More knowledge is required on proper installation procedures, pavement design for WIM systems, choice of sensor type for location, and calibration processes. This research is intended to explore the behaviour of WIM piezoelectric sensors under different loads and environmental conditions. Specifically, the effects of air and pavement temperature, and weight and speed of trucks are examined with respect to the estimation accuracy of WIM sensors. To accomplish this, three WIM systems composed of different piezoelectric transducers were installed at the CPATT test site at the Waste Management facility of the Region of Waterloo in 2007, and two WIM systems were installed between exits 238 and 250 on Highway 401 eastbound near Woodstock, Ontario. It was concluded that the output of the polymer piezoelectric sensor is influenced by temperature and weight factors but not by normally observed vehicle speed differences. While temperature can be compensated for, not enough information has been gathered yet does the same for weight factor. It should be noted that very low speeds (e. g. < 50 km/hr) result in significant errors for all the sensors, so that in congested sections WIM results should be interpreted accordingly. These results will be useful for investigating the effects of environmental conditions on other WIM systems and for predicting the responses of sensors in actual installation environments. This will assist in the recommendation of: (1) alternative and transparent calibration procedures for the WIM sensor systems, (2) and improved benefits of least expensive technology...|$|R
