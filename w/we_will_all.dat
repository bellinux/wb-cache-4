I'd love to cast her in a song-and-dance number – I feel so sorry for her always having to wear those terrible blouses".

Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, {{and the beginning of}} what the media would deem the [...] "Big Three" [...] era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. [...] "With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," [...] he said. [...] "That's an inevitable byproduct of television.

500|$|On game night, coach Taylor gives a {{pep talk}} where he warns the players against taking the opponents – Westerby High School – too lightly. They say their {{rallying}} cry, [...] "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose!" [...] and enter the field. The first half is problematic for the Panthers, {{and at the end}} of the second half, the visitors make a potentially game-winning interception. Street is the only one left to make a tackle. He succeeds, but the tackle is so hard that he remains prone on the ground. The crowd is left in silence as the starting quarterback does not move, and has to be taken off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance. Coach Taylor now has to put in the highly unprepared Saracen, who initially makes several silly mistakes. The coach tells him to relax and focus, and Saracen manages to connect with Smash, who scores a touchdown. Riggins recovers the ensuing onside kick for the Panthers. In the final seconds of the game, Saracen throws a long pass to a receiver, who makes it to the end zone for another touchdown. As the Panthers win the game, both teams gather at mid-field to pray for Jason Street. Team members then head over to the hospital, where Street's condition is still unclear. Riggins and Smash reconcile, while Julie tries to comfort Lyla. In a voice-over, coach Taylor is heard saying that [...] "We are all vulnerable, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>all</b> at some point in our lives fall." ...|$|E
