5|$|Across the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} Baja California peninsula, the storm dropped moderate rainfall, {{with a total of}} about 5inches (125mm) reported in Cabo San Lucas; the NHC remarked that higher amounts likely occurred in higher elevations. The rainfall caused minor flooding in and around Cabo San Lucas. Along {{the southern}} coast of the peninsula, Emilia produced tropical storm force winds; two stations reported sustained winds of 43mph (69km/h), <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> reporting wind gusts to 55mph (89km/h). The storm caused minor damage to buildings and utility lines. Waves from the storm left minor damage at several marinas in the region, with several being closed for two days.|$|E
5|$|Although the Hiorns had descendants, {{the estate}} was {{managed by the}} Public Trustee, who put Linwood House up for sale as four {{sections}}, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> holding the house itself. Three of the sections were purchased by Thomas Marker on 4 June 1913 in an auction, including the one containing the building. Marker paid ₤200 each for the building sections, and ₤1,250 for the section containing the house. The furniture of Linwood House was sold in a separate auction. The house was rented to lawyer Francis Ion Cowlishaw, son of prominent provincial councillor William Patten Cowlishaw (1839–1903). Cowlishaw senior had lived nearby in a house named 'Chaddesden', and Cowlishaw Street and Chaddesden Lane are named after the family.|$|E
5|$|The Naval Academy {{would not}} produce another {{football}} team until the 1882 season. The 1882 {{team would be}} the first with a coach, being supported by Academy officials. The 1879 season was the last time that a Navy squad would play the Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy would finish the 1880s with four winning seasons, and an overall record of 14–12–2, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> ties being the game against the Baltimore Athletic Club. Navy would outscore their opponents 292–231, and would finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54–19–3. The lack of a coach for the 1879 season was one of the two times the Naval Academy squad lacked one, the other time being from 1883 through 1891.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} 19 {{managers}} {{in the history of}} the Seattle Mariners Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. The Mariners franchise was formed in 1977 as a member of the American League. Darrell Johnson was hired as the first Mariners manager, serving for just over three seasons before being replaced during the 1980 season. In terms of tenure, Lou Piniella has managed more games and seasons than any other coach in their franchise history. He managed the Mariners to four playoff berths (1995, 1997, 2000 and 2001), led the team to the American League Championship Series in 1995, 2000 and 2001, and won the Manager of the Year award in 1995 and 2001. Piniella is the only manager in Mariners history to lead a team into the playoffs, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> times after a 116-win season, tying the record for most wins in a season. None of the previous managers had made it to the playoffs before. Piniella, however, managed the team in 34 playoff games, winning 15, and losing 19. Dick Williams is the only Mariners manager to have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E

25|$|The {{region was}} {{incorporated}} in the Roman Empire and totally pacified during the rule of Caesar Augustus. In the coastal plain, a Roman villa that was known as Villa Euracini was created, hence it was a property of a family known as the Euracini. The family was joined by Castro people who returned to the coastal plain. An early fish factory and salt evaporation ponds were built near the new villa, and a later one with a cetariæ and a housing complex, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> buildings dating to the 1st century. The Romans built roads, including Via Veteris, a necropolis and exploited the famed local mines, that became known as Aqualata.

25|$|A {{statistical}} learning mechanism {{has also}} been proposed for learning the meaning of words. Specifically, Yu and Smith conducted a pair of studies in which adults were exposed to pictures of objects and heard nonsense words. Each nonsense word was paired with a particular object. There were 18 total word-referent pairs, and each participant was presented with either 2, 3, or 4 objects at a time, depending on the condition, and heard the nonsense word associated <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> objects. Each word-referent pair was presented 6 times {{over the course of}} the training trials; after the completion of the training trials, participants completed a forced-alternative test in which they were asked to choose the correct referent that matched a nonsense word they were given. Participants were able to choose the correct item more often than would happen by chance, indicating, according to the authors, that they were using statistical learning mechanisms to track co-occurrence probabilities across training trials.|$|E
25|$|Justin Myer {{converted}} four of {{his five}} field goal attempts, from 37, 43, 36, and 25 yards respectively. He missed his final attempt from 37 yards in overtime, which allowed Michigan to kick the game-winning field goal on its ensuing possession. Myer also handled the team's kickoff duties, kicking off six times {{for a total of}} 336 yards for an average of 56 yards per kickoff, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> kicks going out of bounds. Coale also acted as Virginia Tech's punter, punting one time for a total of 36 yards. Three Virginia Tech players returned kickoffs during the game. David Wilson returned two kickoffs for a total of 39 yards, with a long of 25 yards. Jayron Hosely returned one kick for a total of 29 yards. Tony Gregory returned one kick for 23 yards, but also was responsible for the fumble that led to Michigan's field goal {{at the end of the}} first half.|$|E
25|$|In a very {{different}} vein, much later, in the 1980s, a talented generation of players revived the club's spirit. They carried {{it back to the}} top of French rugby thanks to their performances on the pitch, but they also wanted to bring the fun back into the game, to take rugby out of its Parisian anonymity. They did so through a combination of serious football, humour and self-mockery. Their famous antics were invented by the club's backs (including France flyhalf Franck Mesnel and France wing Jean-Baptiste Lafond) who once played a game in Bayonne with berets on their heads as a tribute to the tradition of attacking play of the Basque club Aviron Bayonnais (11 Jan 1987). As members of a gang which they called le show bizz, they played other matches with black make-up on (10 April 1988 at Stade Toulousain), hair dyed yellow, bald caps (26 Feb 1989 against Béziers), wigs and even dressed up as pelote players (white shirts, black jackets and berets, again) in March 1990 at Biarritz Olympique. In April 1989, they wore long red and white striped shorts to celebrate the sans-culotte who took the Bastille on 14 July 1789. They wore long white trousers to look like players of old in the French championship semi-final on 26 April 1987—and won. Their best prank was in the next game though: they played the 1987 final against Toulon with a pink bow tie (2 May). Just before kick-off, Lafond presented French president François Mitterrand, who always attended the national final, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> bow ties. They lost that match but went on to play the 1990 final with the same bow ties. At half-time, they had a drink of champagne on the pitch to recover from the efforts of the first half—and won what proved to be the club's last top-flight title for a quarter-century.|$|E

500|$|The break, and challenge, that Hextall was {{afforded by}} McLennan's call-up {{helped him to}} recover his form, and in February, he made {{consecutive}} shutouts against the Ottawa Senators and Washington Capitals. He recorded another shutout in his next home game, against the Flyers, and was shortly thereafter named as the NHL's player of the week. [...] During the regular season with the Islanders, Hextall recorded a career-best five shutouts, and a GAA of3.08, the best since his rookie year. Maloney described Hextall's time with the team as having [...] "a slow start and a disastrous finish". The Islanders reached the playoffs, but were swept 4–0 by their rivals, the New York Rangers. Hextall played {{three of the four}} games, conceding 16goals for a GAA of6.08, the worst average of his NHL career by some distance. After the season had concluded, Maloney said that he believed that only two Islanders players had distinguished themselves during the 1993–94 season, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> being Jamie McLennan. He also praised Hextall's play during his long sequence of starts, but five months later, Maloney traded Hextall back to Philadelphia. He described the move as being two-pronged: it would appease the fans and prevent the derisory calls when the team were struggling, and it would give McLennan a chance to establish himself as the number-one goaltender. Hextall, along with a sixth round draft pick was traded to the Flyers in return for goaltender Tommy Söderström.|$|E
