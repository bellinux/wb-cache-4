5|$|While Iridomyrmex ants {{are known}} for their aggression, some are more timid and shy; <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> run and hide if they are {{disturbed}} and avoid contact with other ant species. When nests are disturbed, <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> not attack; instead, they will relocate their brood and disregard other disturbances should they occur. <b>Workers</b> <b>will</b> hide in leaves and other vegetation, and in some cases, I. victorianus workers may remain still until any threat or danger subsides.|$|E

5|$|Banded sugar ants {{will often}} attack the nests of other ant species at random, while {{ignoring}} other ants nearby. They use their mandibles to hold opponents, and use formic acid to kill them. Foraging workers use visual cues {{to help them}} find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles to fend off an attacker. If further provoked, it can defend itself by spraying formic acid from its abdomen to deter predators.|$|E
50|$|When a cell {{has been}} completed, the queen will fixate {{on the cell}} for {{inspection}} and push away workers from the cell. A <b>worker</b> <b>will</b> provision food into the cell and quickly escape. Sometimes, when the queen is not around, a <b>worker</b> <b>will</b> lay an egg in the cell and quickly escape from the area similar to when provisioning cells. During worker oviposition, or egg laying, the <b>worker</b> <b>will</b> be quiet with her wings closed and keep her body completely still as not to attract the queen. <b>Worker</b> oviposition <b>will</b> last an average of 7 seconds. A worker's egg is about 2/3 the size of eggs laid by the queen.|$|R

50|$|If {{the average}} {{productivity}} {{is that of}} a worker who produces a commodity in one hour, while a less skilled worker produces the same commodity in four hours, then in these four hours the less skilled <b>worker</b> <b>will</b> have only contributed one hour's worth of value in terms of socially necessary labour time. Each hour worked by the unskilled <b>worker</b> <b>will</b> only produce a quarter of the social value produced by the average worker.|$|R
5|$|Mature adult ants of {{this species}} mostly eat sweet substances, so dead insects are given to their larvae {{collected}} while foraging. However, larvae are only fed insects when they have reached a particular size. <b>Workers</b> <b>will</b> mostly collect small insects, sap-sucking insects along with the honeydew which is taken to their nest to feed their young. Observations have been made of fly predation by jack jumper ants; they would only attack the smaller fly species and ignore larger flies.|$|E
5|$|Ochetellus ants are omnivores {{that feed}} {{primarily}} on arthropods, but they show {{a preference for}} fluids and sweets when they enter human houses. <b>Workers</b> <b>will</b> prey on Ornithoptera richmondia eggs, fruit fly pupae, Plutella larvae and attack wasp nests. Honeydew, nectar, Pacific reef heron feces, carrion, Pandanus fruits, plants, seeds, sucrose, fats and grease will also be consumed. O. glaber is known to exploit the extrafloral nectaries on plants without providing protection.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by toad, that usually kill the cane toad's predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce the cane toad population. One way of doing this is by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get rid of them. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants aggression, <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> pour out of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest.|$|E

5|$|By June 2007, {{the project}} was delayed by half a year. One of the major delays in the project has been the {{development}} of the software for the health sector's communication centers—which consist of emergency wards, casualty wards, emergency dispatch centers and aircraft coordination centers. The system is being developed by Frequentis in Austria, who have stated that they did not receive sufficient specifications. In December 2009, the state granted NOK110 million extra for development of the system. Health <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> therefore be taking the network into use in May 2010, after the police and fire departments in Follo and Østfold. Representatives for the Police Directorate have criticized the implementation model and stated that in most other countries, the system was implemented first just for the police and afterwards taken into use by the fire and paramedic agencies. For instance, Østfold Police District had installed a new center in February 2008, but had to wait 21 months to take it into use while waiting for Public Safety Radio.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, 2013, the {{government}} announced that a four-year tentative agreement had been reached with the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public and Private Employees (NAPE), the province's largest public sector union. The deal between the two was reached after 18 months of negotiations, during at which point NAPE released radio and television advertisements criticizing {{the government}} for saying the province's economy was booming while they laid off employees and told unions to expect a modest increase in pay. The tentative deal included a wage freeze {{during the first two}} years of the deal, a two per cent increase in pay during year three and a three per cent wage increase in year four. Full-time employees will also receive a $1,400 signing bonus, while temporary, seasonal and part-time <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> get a pro-rated bonus. As well a new job evaluation system would see significant monetary benefits for some employees. Two weeks after reaching an agreement with NAPE, {{the government announced}} tentative agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Association of Allied Health Professionals (AAHP). Both agreements had a similar structure as the one government reached with NAPE.|$|E
5|$|The production-possibility {{frontier}} can {{be constructed}} from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) {{is the most common}} form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the opportunity cost of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun industry will move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other Novomessor species, workers forage {{early in}} the morning and late {{afternoon}}, whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening. However, it is unknown whether or not these ants are active during the night. Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen during the middle of the day when temperatures reach 95–100°F (35–38°C), although the ground temperature is considerably higher. Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground, but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds. Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds, and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest. N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft (7 m) away from their home nest. N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on, consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps, bembicine wasps and small moths. When a worker discovers a dead insect, it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately, and other nestmates will join once they detect it. Workers do not cooperate with each other and pull the insect from all directions, accidentally tearing it apart. However, the <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests, but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown.|$|E

Workers occasionally will remove both liquid and solid feces, but in many cases the <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> consume the liquid feces but leave behind the solids. Occasionally, <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> feed the liquid to the larvae after drinking up the wastes. Sanitation behaviors are seen at a decreased rate during periods of colony decline.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} their individual fitness, <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> try to reduce the reproduction of other wasps. This is known as worker policing. As previously mentioned, <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> attempt to suppress other workers. Worker policing also plays {{a large role in}} modulating the number of queens per colony. As cyclical oligogyny progresses, new queens will attempt to assert their dominance after the death of the old queens. Any worker could be morphologically able to function as a new queen, but the number of new queens is restricted by workers as they aggressively interact with potential new queens. This suppresses the development of the female’s ovaries, preventing her from becoming queen.|$|E
25|$|When {{temperatures}} are high, <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> often raise their abdomens, draw their legs in, and fan their wings rapidly {{in an effort}} to cool down the nest. They also continually construct {{and take care of the}} cells in the comb.|$|E

25|$|Pharaoh ants have a {{sophisticated}} strategy for food preference. They implement two related behaviors. The first {{is known as}} satiation. The <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> at first show a strong preference for a particular food type. However, if this food is offered alone, with no other options, for several weeks, <b>workers</b> <b>will</b> afterward show a distinct preference for {{a different type of}} food. In this way, the ants become satiated on a certain food group and will change their decision. The second behavior is called alternation. If given the continuous choice between food groups, pharaoh ants will tend to alternate between carbohydrate-rich foods and protein-rich foods. These satiation and alternation behaviors are evolutionarily adaptive. The decision to vary the type of food consumed ensures that the colony maintains a balanced diet.|$|E
