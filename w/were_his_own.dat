5|$|American {{businessman}} and philanthropist Armand Hammer, {{well known to}} the Soviet Union for his financial pursuits and humanitarian ties, left Los Angeles for Armenia on board a Boeing 727 loaded with 2,300 pounds of medical supplies that were provided by the American Red Cross. Hammer, known for his decades of work with the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, had spoken with Gorbachev prior to leaving and was carrying with him $1 million in relief funds. Half of those funds were from World Vision International, a California-based relief and development umbrella organization, {{and the other half}} <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> personal donation. The flight also carried Robert Seiple (president of World Vision) and a UCLA doctor who had worked {{in the aftermath of the}} 1985 Mexico City earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Darwin made long {{journeys}} inland with travelling companions {{from the}} locality. He {{spent much of}} the time away from the ship, returning by prearrangement when the Beagle returned to ports where mail could be received and Darwin's notes, journals, and collections sent back to England. He had ensured that his collections <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> and they were shipped back to Henslow in Cambridge to await his return. Several others on board including FitzRoy and other officers were able amateur naturalists, and they gave Darwin generous assistance as well as making collections for the Crown, which the Admiralty placed in the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|Technically, a slave {{could not}} own property, but a slave who {{conducted}} business might be {{given access to}} an individual account or fund (peculium) that he could use as if it <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> The terms of this account varied depending {{on the degree of}} trust and co-operation between owner and slave: a slave with an aptitude for business could be given considerable leeway to generate profit, and might be allowed to bequeath the peculium he managed to other slaves of his household. Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves.|$|E

He has been compared to Mick Jagger and Alice Cooper, both who <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> personal idols, and is often called Raudmees (Iron man).|$|E
25|$|As was the penchant at the time, {{much of what}} Rubinstein played <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> compositions. At several concerts, Rubinstein alternated between {{conducting}} his orchestral {{works and}} playing as soloist {{in one of his}} piano concertos. One high point for him was leading the Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestra in his Ocean Symphony on November 16, 1854. Although reviews were mixed about Rubinstein's merits as a composer, they were more favorable about him as a performer when he played a solo recital a few weeks later.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} warlord Yuan Shao {{had maintained}} {{good relations with}} the Wuhuan beyond Chinese borders during his campaign against rival warlord Gongsun Zan, their common enemy, in the 190s. Yuan Shao gave the chieftains of his Wuhuan allies seals and insignia as chanyu after the final destruction of Gongsun Zan in the Battle of Yijing, and reinforced the alliance by marrying the daughters of his subordinates to the Wuhuan leaders, pretending as though the daughters <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> The Wuhuan war leader Tadun was especially powerful and was thus very well-treated by Yuan Shao.|$|E
25|$|The party seeking title by adverse {{possession}} {{may be called}} the disseisor, meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. Although the elements of an {{adverse possession}} claim are different in each state, adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect {{the title of the}} disseisor. These are that the disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, {{in a manner that is}} open and notorious, keep out others, and use it as if it <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> Some states impose additional requirements.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} attacks, several sources {{reported}} that Salem al-Hazmi, 26, {{was alive and}} working at a petrochemical plant in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia.

On September 19, Al-Sharq Al-Awsat published his photograph alongside Badr Alhazmi's, who they claimed was the actual hijacker who had stolen his identity.|$|E

Bonded with the four symbiotes, Deadpool tricked Shriek into {{thinking}} she killed Carnage. After that, Deadpool tricked Carnage by forcing Shriek to impersonate Deadpool and Carnage wounded Shriek in the process. Afterwards, Carnage, now broken that he almost killed Shriek, allows himself to be arrested by authorities and placed in an unlocked cell, waiting to <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> man.

25|$|Balance {{sheets and}} Profit and Loss {{statements}} served one major purpose, {{if not the}} only one, for Ivar and that was {{they had to be}} helpful in his fund raising efforts. Often they were just pure fantasy to be revised at will to please investors. He also frequently treated the assets of corporations he controlled as if they <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> However, things should be seen {{in the context of the}} time. IBM, for example, consolidated all its accounts in one named Plant, Property, Equipment, Machines, Patents and Goodwill. American Can doubled its reported net earnings in 1913 by claiming only $1 million of depreciation after having claimed $2.5 million the previous year. Many companies set up arbitrary reserves in good times to be used in bad years and few holding companies published consolidated financial statements.|$|E
25|$|The {{two were}} the result of an {{experiment}} in genetic recombination in which two parent cells were separated into complementary haploid gametes, and recombined into two embryos. The resulting zygotes were implanted in a woman and gestated by her, with the result that although both have the same mother and genetic parents, they are no more closely related genetically than any two people taken at random. They have been prevented from sexual relations by a chastity belt; but having confirmed that there is no risk of genetic disease in their offspring (described as the only valid reason against incest), Lazarus solemnizes their marriage and later establishes them as the owners and operators of a thriving business. At the end of the story, he reveals a belief that they <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> descendants, from an earlier period when he had been a slave on the same planet.|$|E
25|$|Columbo's {{wardrobe}} {{was personally}} provided by Peter Falk; they <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which {{made its first}} appearance in Prescription: Murder. Falk would often ad lib his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets {{for a piece of}} evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point in a conversation with a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine. Some of the episodes established that Columbo carried a Colt snub-nosed revolver in his raincoat, which he pulled in rare episodes, and would occasionally remark that his wife, 'the Mrs.', would not allow him to buy a new car because it 'wasn't necessary', portraying the detective throughout the series as permanently driving an aged and battered 1959 Peugeot 403 Cabriolet.|$|E

25|$|According to Prof. Dennis Hudson, Navalar's {{contributions}} although {{began in}} Jaffna, spread to both in Sri Lanka {{as well as}} Southern India, thus establishing two centres of reform. He had two schools, two presses and pressed on against Christian missionary activity on both sides as well as against Hindus who he thought were unorthodox. He produced approximately ninety-seven Tamil publications, twenty three <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> creations, eleven were commentaries, and forty were his editions of those works of grammar, literature, liturgy, and theology that were not previously available in print. With this recovery, editing, and publishing of ancient works, Navalar laid the foundations for the recovery of lost Tamil classics that his successors such as U. V. Swaminatha Iyer and C.W. Thamotharampillai continued. He {{was the first person}} to deploy the prose style in the Tamil language and according to Tamil scholar Kamil Zvelebil in style it bridged the medieval to the modern.|$|E
25|$|A genius swordsman and {{officer of}} the Shinsengumi. He has strong bonds with Kondōwho raised Okita {{from the age of}} nine after Okita's mother and {{siblings}} could no longer afford to care for him, and Hijikatawhom he loves and respects like a brother. He is the first person to discover Sei's true sex and he is her main confidant on matters relating to it. He had wanted her {{to go back to a}} normal girl's life after she had gotten her revenge because of the brutality of the life of a samurai. After the Ikedaya Affair, he admits he has affections for Sei as if she <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> kin. Over a year after those events he realizes he is in love with her. When he was 17, a woman he rejected attempted suicide in front of him and Okita came to the conclusion that falling in love was not worth such pain, and he has kept his distance from women ever since. Another hindrance to romance is that he has dedicated his life to the path of the samurai and has vowed to himself that he will never marry. The character is based on the historical figure of Okita Sōji.|$|E

Between 23:42 and 23:44, Helena and Boise reported their contacts to Scott on San Francisco who mistakenly believed that the two cruisers were actually tracking the three U.S. destroyers that were thrown out of formation during the column turn. Scott radioed Farenholt to ask if the destroyer was attempting to resume its station {{at the front of}} the column. Farenholt replied, [...] "Affirmative, coming up on your starboard side," [...] further confirming Scott's belief that the radar contacts <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> destroyers.|$|E

Melmotte, as he thought of this, became almost proud {{of what he had}} done, {{thinking}} that if the evidence were suppressed the knowledge of the facts could do him no harm. But the evidence must be suppressed, and with the view of suppressing it he took the little bag and all the papers down with him to the study. Then he ate his breakfast,--and suppressed the evidence by the aid of his gas lamp.|$|R
500|$|Victorian {{society had}} a fascination for the rapidly {{expanding}} field of science. In [...] "Dr. Ox's Experiment", {{a short story}} written by Jules Verne in 1872, the eponymous doctor uses electrolysis of water to separate oxygen and hydrogen. He then pumps the pure oxygen throughout the town of Quiquendone, causing the normally tranquil inhabitants and their animals to become aggressive and plants to grow rapidly. An explosion of the hydrogen and oxygen in Dr Ox's factory brings his experiment to an end. Verne summarised his story by explaining {{that the effects of}} oxygen described in the tale <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> invention. There is also a brief episode of oxygen intoxication in his [...] "From the Earth to the Moon".|$|E
500|$|Among other composers {{whose work}} carries the {{influence}} of Mahler, Mitchell lists America's Aaron Copland, the German song and stage composer Kurt Weill, Italy's Luciano Berio, Russia's Dmitri Shostakovich and England's Benjamin Britten. The American composers Leonard Bernstein and Samuel Barber were also influenced by Mahler's work. In a 1989 interview the pianist-conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy said that the connection between Mahler and Shostakovich was [...] "very strong and obvious"; their music represented [...] "the individual versus the vices of the world." [...] Mitchell highlights Britten's [...] "marvellously keen, spare and independent writing for the wind in... the first movement of the Cello Symphony of 1963 [...] clearly belongs to that order of dazzling transparency and instrumental emancipation which Mahler did so much to establish." [...] Mitchell concludes with the statement: [...] "Even <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> music not to survive, Mahler would still enjoy a substantial immortality in the music of these pre-eminent successors who have embraced his art and assimilated his techniques." ...|$|E
500|$|All {{characters}} {{are designed to}} speak with their own internal voices to capture their views of the world. The Atlantic pondered whether Martin ultimately intended the readers to sympathize with characters {{on both sides of}} the Lannister–Stark feud long before plot developments force them to make their emotional choices. Contrary to most conventional epic fantasies, the Ice and Fire {{characters are}} vulnerable so that, according to The Atlantic, the reader [...] "cannot be sure that good shall triumph, which makes those instances where it does all the more exulting." [...] Martin gets emotionally involved in the characters' lives during writing, which makes the chapters with dreadful events sometimes very difficult to write. Seeing the world through the characters' eyes requires a certain amount of empathy with them, including the villains, all of whom he has said he loves as if they <b>were</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> children. Martin found that some characters had minds of their own and took his writing in different directions. He returns to the intended story if it does not work out, but these detours sometimes prove more rewarding for him.|$|E
