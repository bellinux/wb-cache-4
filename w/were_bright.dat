25|$|The first vinyards {{planted in}} California, were planted {{at the mission}} in 1769. Father Junípero Serra planted these initial vines. The vines were of the Mission variety, which <b>were</b> <b>bright</b> to Mexico in the 16th Century. Unfortunately, the initial plantings did not survive, with Mission San Juan Capistrano having the first {{surviving}} plantings. By at least 1781, wine was being produced at the mission. One source claims that the vineyard on mission lands reached up to fifty thousand acres. The mission vineyards were around until at least 1823.|$|E

Mahatabchand was appointed additional member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council and in 1877 was allowed to use the title of His Highness before his name. Bijoy Chand Mahatab was conferred the title of Maharajadhiraj by Lord Minto in 1908. Uday Chand Mahtab took over in 1941 and served till abolition of the zamindary system in 1954, after independence of the country.|$|E

Lacaille charted and designated 11 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Lambda Horologii in 1756. Baily removed the designations of Epsilon and Theta Horologii as he held they were too faint to warrant naming. He was unable to find a star that corresponded to the coordinates Lacaille's Beta Horologii. Determining that the coordinates were wrong, he assigned the designation to another star. Kappa Horologii, too, was unable to be verified, yet was most likely the star HD 18292. Gould assigned designations to what became Mu and Nu Horologii as he felt they <b>were</b> <b>bright</b> enough to warrant them.|$|E
25|$|For 2010, {{the last}} year of {{production}} for the PT Cruiser, there was only one trim level available: the PT Cruiser Classic. It included a 2.4L Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) engine producing 150 horsepower, a standard four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player, 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack and six speakers, a rear-mounted spoiler, standard air conditioning, standard cruise control, standard tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), standard front and front and rear side SRS airbags, standard keyless entry with two remotes and panic alarm, standard ABS anti-lock brakes, standard sixteen-inch alloy wheels, and more. Optional features included leather seating surfaces, a power front driver's bucket seat, an engine block heater, a power tilt-and-sliding sunroof, and heated dual front bucket seats.

500|$|Laptop Magazines Michael Prospero {{praised the}} 2010 15-inch model's display, calling it [...] "bright and crisp". He further commented, [...] "While {{reflections}} from the glossy display weren't overwhelming, it's also {{nice to know}} there's an antiglare option—though only for the higher resolution display. Still, colors <b>were</b> <b>bright,</b> blacks were deep and dark, and viewing angles were excellent both vertically and horizontally." [...] He also lauded {{the quality of the}} iSight webcam, the responsiveness of the touchpad, the microphone and speakers, as well as the performance of the new CPUs for the 15" [...] model and the long battery life. Complaints included the price of the laptop, the low number of USB ports, and the lack of HDMI.|$|E
500|$|Writers for Famitsu {{thought that}} the {{combination}} of suspense and romance made for a strange feeling. They found the game system to be characteristic of KID, calling it user-friendly, and saying that it made repeated playthroughs pleasant. Chandran liked the game's graphics, saying that while they only consist on still 2D images on static backgrounds, the character designs were appealing and the backgrounds <b>were</b> <b>bright</b> and detailed. He called the game's sound [...] "top notch", saying that the voice actors did an excellent job with their characters, and that the music was very good; he liked how it was varied, feeling that it represented the various scenarios and moods in the game well, and that it was a big improvement over the music in the previous game in the series.|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{has said}} that her teenage years were unhappy.

Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as [...] "not exceptional" [...] but [...] "one {{of a group of}} girls who <b>were</b> <b>bright,</b> and quite good at English". Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia which she says inspired a flying version that appeared in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. At this time, she listened to the Smiths and the Clash. Rowling took A-levels in English, French and German, achieving two As and a B and was Head Girl.|$|E

500|$|In July 1931 as a {{steam shovel}} was making ready to level enough land to {{accommodate}} the great castle, Hearst {{put a stop to}} all his construction plans. The Great Depression had greatly diminished his income, and he could not pay for his $50million project at Wyntoon {{while at the same time}} indulging his expansion at San Simeon. Abandoning the massive castle idea, Hearst instead asked Morgan to design a [...] "Bavarian Village" [...] with multiple half-timbered buildings in the medieval style of Germany or Austria. Hearst sent Morgan to Europe to study suitable buildings; she brought fine artist Doris Day with her to investigate architectural inscriptions and painting styles. In 1932, Morgan put together a master plan for Wyntoon. It described a group of guesthouses with romantic names such as Cinderella House, Fairy House and Bear House, arranged not in a cramped medieval style but symmetrically around a common green in the Beaux-Arts style. These three-story structures with steeply gabled roofs were completed in 1933. Swiss artisan Jules Suppo and his assistants carved much of the German Gothic decorations. Day painted fine inscriptions and exterior decorative patterns. Hungarian illustrator Willy Pogany painted exterior murals depicting Russian and Germanic fairy tales such as those from the Brothers Grimm, but Pogany's versions <b>were</b> <b>bright,</b> humorous and cheerful, not dark and grim.|$|E
500|$|Underwood {{performed}} [...] "Two Black Cadillacs" [...] at the 40th American Music Awards on November 18, 2012.

The singer was {{the centerpiece of the}} performance, and her look was jaw-droppingly gorgeous. [...] There <b>were</b> <b>bright</b> lights above the stage and images of two black Cadillacs on the screens behind her, but that was about the extent of her production. And the simplicity worked for her. She performed an acoustic version of the song during the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. During the performance, the singer's gown became a screen on which images varying from roses to butterflies and fireworks were projected. Underwood also performed [...] "Two Black Cadillacs" [...] at the 2013 Country Music Association Awards, in a medley with [...] "Good Girl", [...] "See You Again" [...] and [...] "Blown Away". [...] "Two Black Cadillacs" [...] was the third song in the medley, and Coti Howell of Taste of Country noted that, in that part, [...] "lighting ripped across the screen and everything went black, except Underwood and her sparkly microphone."

2500|$|Neon was {{discovered}} in 1898 by the British scientists William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers. After obtaining pure neon from the atmosphere, they explored its properties using an [...] "electrical gas-discharge" [...] tube that {{was similar to the}} tubes used for neon signs today. Georges Claude, a French engineer and inventor, presented neon tube lighting in essentially its modern form at the Paris Motor Show from December 3–18, 1910. Claude, sometimes called [...] "the Edison of France", had a near monopoly on the new technology, which became very popular for signage and displays in the period 1920-1940. Neon lighting was an important cultural phenomenon in the United States in that era; by 1940, the downtowns of nearly every city in the US <b>were</b> <b>bright</b> with neon signage, and Times Square in New York City was known worldwide for its neon extravagances. [...] There were 2000 shops nationwide designing and fabricating neon signs. The popularity, intricacy, and scale of neon signage for advertising declined in the U.S. following the Second World War (1939–1945), but development continued vigorously in Japan, Iran, and some other countries. In recent decades architects and artists, in addition to sign designers, have again adopted neon tube lighting as a component in their works.|$|E
