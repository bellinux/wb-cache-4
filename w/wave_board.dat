50|$|Wave boards: Smaller, lighter, more maneuverable {{boards for}} use in {{breaking}} waves. Characteristically, sailors on wave boards perform high jumps while sailing against waves, and they ride {{the face of a}} wave performing narrow linked turns (bottom turns, cutbacks, and top-turns) in a similar way to surfing. Wave boards usually have a volume between 65 and 90 liters, with a length between 230 and 260 centimeters, and 50 to 60 centimeters in width. A general rule is for a sailor to use a <b>wave</b> <b>board</b> whose volume in liters is about the same as the sailor's weight in kilograms - more volume providing additional flotation for sailing in light winds, and less for high winds, where less volume is needed to achieve planing. In recent years, the average width of wave boards has increased slightly, as the length has shrunk, while the range of volume has been maintained the same more or less—according to board designers this makes wave boards easier to use under a wider range of conditions by sailors of differing abilities. The most common sizes of sails used with wave boards are in the range of 4.0 to 6.0 square meters, depending on the wind speed and the weight of the sailor.|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} concerns optimum wave absorption in numerical wave tanks.

While (i) and (ii) have been shown individually, their combination has never been demonstrated. To address this, a cosh shaped wavemaker is implemented in a time-domain numerical wave tank. Comparisons are presented between simple proportional controllers and the IIR approach, where the latter is demonstrated to offer excellent absorption performance over a very broad range of incident wave conditions.

For a flat bottom wave basin when the interaction between two frequencies are considered bounded sub harmonics or bounded low frequency waves are generated at the difference frequency and bounded super harmonics or bounded high frequency waves are generated at the sum frequency and they travel locked with their generating / fundamental wave components along with some unwanted free waves. These free waves are, free waves due to first order motion of the wave boards, free wave due to displacement of the <b>wave</b> <b>board</b> from its zero position and free wave due to local disturbances.

40|$|A proper {{design of}} {{offshore}} and coastal structures requires further knowledge about extreme wave events. Such waves are highly nonlinear and may occur unexpectedly due to diverse reasons. One of these reasons is wave-wave interaction and the wave focusing technique represents one option to generate extreme wave {{events in the}} laboratory. The underlying mechanism is the superimposition and phasing of wave components at a predefined location. To date, most of the existing methods to propagate target wave profile backwards {{to the position of}} the wave generator apply linear wave theory. The problem is that the generated waves with different frequencies generate new components which do not satisfy the linear dispersion relation. As a result, small changes in the <b>wave</b> <b>board</b> control signal generally induce large and random shifts in the resulting focused wave. This means that iterations are necessary to get the required wave profile at the correct position in the flume. In this study, a Self Correcting Method (SCM) is applied to optimize the control signal of the wave maker in a Numerical Wave Tank (NWT). The nonlinearities are included in the control signal and accurate wave focusing is obtained irrespective of the prevailing seabed topography (horizontal or sloping) and type of structure (reflective or absorbing).

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Random {{waves are}} often {{expressed}} as a mathematical superposition of {{an infinite number of}} sinusoidal components. The mean square spectral density of the water surface elevation is often called the wave spectrum. The zero upcrossing wave heights usually have a Rayleigh probability distribution. However, the design wave concept is still used for design of many marine structures. It is common to use periodic wave theory to predict the velocity distribution in the design wave even though it is known that actual waves are quite irregular and their shape and kinematics may not conform to the periodic theory. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the validity of applying periodic wave theory to a wave in a random wave train. The magnitude of the errors are quantified in a statistical manner.

The relative error is expressed as ε = umeasured⁻upredicted/upredicted. The relative error turned out to be normally distributed and the standard deviation varied from 0. 1 to 0. 6 according to the size of the wave sample, although the mean value of the error remained almost constant.

40|$|A {{mechanical}} 2 -dimensional {{wave maker}} with a flexible surface {{was used to}} create waves similar to those formed at the bow of a moving ship. Utilizing the 2 D+T approximation, the wave maker was programmed so that its deformable <b>wave</b> <b>board</b> creates a time sequence of shapes that simulate the line of intersection between {{one side of the}} hull of a slender ship model moving at constant speed and an imaginary vertical plane oriented normal to the ship model track. Instead of trying to simulate a particular ship hull, however, the wave maker simulates a parametric set of flat plate motions that contain components of typical bow shapes. The resulting surface waves were measured using a cinematic laser-induced fluorescence technique and the resulting wave profiles were analyzed. A tremendous variation of wave shapes was observed. A variety of wave characteristics including the peak contact point height, peak wave height, wave crest speed and plunging jet thickness distribution were measured and related to the corresponding wave maker motion parameters. Despite the complexity of the wave maker motions, it was observed that wave maker velocity and acceleration along the water line were the wave maker parameters with the strongest influence on many of the measured wave characteristics. Additional analysis reveals that the initial acceleration of the wave maker affects some wave characteristics, especially those related to plunging jet behavior, but does not significantly affect the overall size and shape of the wave. It was also observed that the behavior of wave formation and breaking ranged between two distinct modes. The first mode consists of an overdriven wave that contains a pronounced vertical jet along the face of the wave maker. The overdriven wave breaks close to the wave maker, before a wave crest has fully formed. The second mode is a more slowly developing wave that breaks further away from the wave maker. The developing waves do not contain the pronounced vertical jet observed in overdriven waves. The two modes appear {{to be related to the}} initial wave maker acceleration and amount of water displaced by the wave maker...|$|E

40|$|Designing breakwaters on steep foreshores faces some problems. At present, it is {{not known}} what the {{influence}} of the steepness of the bottom slope is. Design formulae for armour layers don't take the bottom steepness into account in a direct manner. In theory, in irregular waves, wave average heights in shallow water become higher as the bottom becomes steeper, but clear formulae don't exist. In this report, an attempt has been made to investigate the influence of the slope of the sea bottom on the stability of an armour layer. The two main questions were: is there an influence of the foreshore slope at all? if yes, how large is this influence? In a literature study, no answer could be found to these questions, so a model investigation has been done in order to measure the influence of the foreshore steepness. In the investigation, two foreshore steepnesses have been compared (1 : 30 and 1 : 8) and four different wave periods have been used. In most experiments, the armour existed of stone. Two comparisons have been made: one was with the same wave conditions at the <b>wave</b> <b>board,</b> the other was with similar wave conditions close to the toe of the breakwater. The experiments showed a clear influence of the steepness of the foreshore: with equal offshore wave conditions, the damage is significantly higher at a steep foreshore. if the wave conditions near the breakwater are known, even then the damage on the steep foreshore is higher than on the mild foreshore. interlocking units showed more rocking. As, for the last case, the wave heights and the wave spectra were equal at the toe, these cannot explain the differences. Therefore, another explanation has been tried to be found. It appeared that the wave shape, or more precise: the steepness of the wave front, changes. On the steep foreshores, the wave fronts are steeper. This may explain the larger damage levels at the steep foreshore. At present, there are no wave theories that can calculate such a steepness of the wave front. Therefore, an empirical correction factor has been derived, which can take several values, depending on the situation. Until more research has been done on this topic, it is recommended to pay special attention to areas with steep foreshores if model tests are performed in the breakwater design process.

40|$|Artificial Surf Reefs (ASR) {{are built}} {{to improve the}} surf {{conditions}} of the waves. Three ASR have been realized {{over the last decade}} and many more are planned to be constructed within a period of ten years. Even though a hot topic, ASR design is often done fairly ad hoc and there remains great uncertainty as to what the optimal dimensions of the ASR should be. Through combination of numerical and experimental modeling efforts, this study aims at: 1) Improving our general understanding of how ASR design affects the actual surfability; 2) Designing an optimal reef shape; 3) Obtaining measurements of the surfability parameters to verify the predicted surfability by the numerical wave model. The quality of a surf break is expressed in four measurable parameters: breaker height, breaker shape, peel angle and the attendant currents. Usually a surf break differs from other places along the coast by the ability to make waves peel along their crest. Therefore the peel angle is studied thoroughly. By considering idealized topographies, the important reef properties that affect the peel angle become clear. The model applied in the numerical study is a state-of-the-art, deterministic amplitude evolution model that takes into account quadratic interactions (triad interactions). Optimal shape dimensions were estimated in the numerical study for varying reef shapes and wave conditions. The resulting ASR design was constructed in a wave basin in the laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of the Faculty of Civil Engineering. Unidirectional incident waves (regular and bichromatic) were generated by three piston type wave makers with second-order <b>wave</b> <b>board</b> control. The laboratory observations were used to verify three parameters that were predicted with the numerical study: breaker height, breaker shape and the peel angle. The combined numerical and experimental study shows that: Two reef properties are needed to obtain surfable peel angles. First there must be a certain angle enclosed between the reef normal and the offshore wave direction. Secondly, the depth at which the reef starts needs to be sufficiently shallow. The reef shape performs optimal when the tip of the reef is relatively sharp. This results in less intense breakers suitable for the take-off. The predicted surfability parameters by the numerical wave model agreed well with the laboratory measurements. The experiment showed that the water depth over the reef crest significantly affects the breaker shape. Also the currents over and around the reef {{have a significant impact on}} the surfability of the surf break. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Dune erosion is a {{relatively}} fast developing cross-shore transport process which occurs during severe wave attack combined with high water levels. Large quantities of sand coming from the dunes are transported seaward. If no seaward or lateral losses occur, the sand balance will be closed in cross-shore direction. The eroded sand will deposit {{on the beach and}} foreshore {{in such a way that}} a so-called erosion profile appears. For the judgement of the safety of the Dutch dune coast a method is used to compute, for given design conditions, the amount of dune erosion. The core of the method is the so-called DUROS-model. This model does not take into account the effect of the wave period on the amount of dune erosion and was developed for the at that time supposed reach of peak wave periods for the Dutch coast (Tp <= 12 s). According to present understanding one has to take longer wave periods into account (Tp up to 16 or 18 s). In addition, preliminary explorations supposed the dune erosion process to be dependent on the wave period. However, the used model was not validated for these high wave periods. Recently, a series of small scale physical model tests, with peak wave periods varying from about 10 to 19 s (prototype), have been carried out by WL | Delft Hydraulics in the Schelde flume. According to that research dune erosion is clearly dependent on the wave period. The aim of this study was to analyse the above mentioned test series and to verify the model DUROSTA (and briefly UNIBEST-TC) concerning the wave period influence on dune erosion (based on recent small scale tests). (These time-dependent cross-shore transport models take the wave period into account.) Most important conclusion about the physical model research was that assuming the applied scale relations and {{a relatively}} long storm duration an increase of dune erosion volume above storm surge level of 2535 % is found for a prototype peak wave period of Tp = 18. 4 s with respect to Tp = 12 s. The conclusions about the model DUROSTA are more complicated. Since the wave heights were measured at several locations along the cross-shore profile, it became clear that the model (with default settings) did not completely reproduce the measured cross-shore wave height development. The wave height has been tuned for each test to the measured (incident) wave height near the <b>wave</b> <b>board.</b> This resulted in a good reproduction of the measured relative increase of dune erosion with increasing wave period. From several ways of tuning more near the dune appeared that DUROSTA only computes consistently more dune erosion for a longer wave period if the wave height near the dune is larger. This in contrast to a number of the tests where, although approximately equal measured wave heights near the dune (including reflection and long waves), the larger the wave period clearly results in more dune erosion.
