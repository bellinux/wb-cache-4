25|$|Throughout {{the years}} Russian {{officials}} have often {{announced that the}} war is over. In April 2002, President Vladimir Putin's declared that the <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> was over.|$|E
25|$|On 22 December 1997, over a {{year after}} the signing of the Khasav-Yurt treaty {{and the end of the}} first <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> the Arab mujahideen and a group of Dagestani rebels raided the base of the 136th Armoured Brigade of the 58th Division of the Russian Army in Buinaksk, Dagestan.|$|E

40|$|The {{normative}} {{problem that}} faces us <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> is addressed through {{an analysis of}} the Chechen Revolution in 1991, of the two <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> and their consequences. The historical account of the Chechen past is considered in this normative analysis, as well as the underdevelopment of the Chechen state...|$|R
25|$|Yeltsin campaigned energetically, dispelling {{concerns}} about his health, and maintained a high media profile. To boost his popularity, Yeltsin promised to abandon {{some of his}} more unpopular economic reforms, boost welfare spending, end the <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> and pay wage and pension arrears. Yeltsin's campaign also got a boost from the announcement of a $10billion loan to the Russian government from the International Monetary Fund.|$|E
25|$|The Khasav-Yurt Accord {{paved the}} way for the signing of two further {{agreements}} between Russia and Chechnya. In mid-November 1996, Yeltsin and Maskhadov signed an agreement on economic relations and reparations to Chechens who had been affected by the 1994–96 war. In February 1997, Russia also approved an amnesty for Russian soldiers and Chechen separatists alike who committed illegal acts in connection with the <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> between December 1994 and September 1996.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 he {{conducted}} a 40-day hunger strike in protest at the renewed <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya.</b> Afterwards, he {{became involved in}} attempts to restore contacts between Chechen Republic President Aslan Maskhadov and the Russian federal authorities. During the Second Chechen War, Popkov often was arbitrarily detained by the security forces and his humanitarian activities were severely hindered by the Russian military. He was also frequently detained and threatened {{by some of the}} Chechen field commanders.|$|E

25|$|On 15 May 1999, Yeltsin survived {{another attempt}} of impeachment, {{this time by}} the Democratic and {{communist}} opposition in the State Duma. He was charged with several unconstitutional activities, including {{the signing of the}} Belavezha Accords dissolving the Soviet Union in December 1991, the coup-d'état in October 1993, and initiating the <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> in 1994. None of these charges received the two-thirds majority of the Duma which was required to initiate the process of impeachment of the president.|$|E
25|$|Declining productivity, a high fixed {{exchange}} rate between the ruble and foreign currencies to avoid public turmoil, and a chronic fiscal deficit were the reasons {{that led to the}} crisis. The economic cost of the first <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> estimated at $5.5billion (not including the rebuilding of the ruined Chechen economy), also contributed to the crisis. In the first half of 1997, the Russian economy showed some signs of improvement. However, soon after this, the problems began to gradually intensify.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, at {{the start}} of the Second Chechen War, Zhirinovsky, an ardent {{supporter}} of the first <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> in the mid-1990s, advocated hitting some Chechen villages with tactical nuclear weapons. He has also advocated using nuclear weapons and naval blockade-imposed starvation in the event of a Russian war against Japan. In 2008, during the resulting political row between the United Kingdom and Russia, he suggested dropping nuclear bombs over the Atlantic Ocean in an effort to flood Britain.|$|E

Chernyshov died March 20, 2010 saving others' lives.|$|R
25|$|In June 2005, Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov, {{a deputy}} prime {{minister}} in the Kremlin-controlled Chechen administration, said about 300,000 {{people have been killed}} during two <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> over the past decade; he also said that more than 200,000 people have gone missing. Every resident of Chechnya has scores of relatives who have been killed or gone missing, he said.|$|R

25|$|On 9 August 1999 Yeltsin {{fired his}} prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, {{and for the}} fourth time, fired his entire cabinet. In Stepashin's place he {{appointed}} Vladimir Putin, relatively unknown at that time, and announced his wish to see Putin as his successor. In late 1999 Yeltsin and President Clinton openly disagreed on the <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya.</b> At the November meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Clinton pointed his finger at Yeltsin and demanded he halt bombing attacks that had resulted in many civilian casualties. Yeltsin immediately left the conference.|$|E
25|$|We cannot {{ignore the}} fact that {{thousands}} of Chechen civilians have died and more than 200,000 have been driven from their homes. Together with other delegations, we have expressed our alarm at the persistent, credible reports of human rights violations by Russian forces in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. There are also reports that Chechen separatists have committed abuses, including the killing of civilians and prisoners.... The <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> has greatly damaged Russia's international standing and is isolating Russia from the international community. Russia's work to repair that damage, both at home and abroad, or its choice to risk further isolating itself, is the most immediate and momentous challenge that Russia faces.|$|E
25|$|The {{violations}} {{committed by}} members of the Russian forces were usually tolerated by their superiors and were not punished even when investigated (the story of Vladimir Glebov serving as an example of such policy). However, television and newspaper accounts widely reported largely uncensored images of the carnage to the Russian public. As a result, the Russian media coverage partially precipitated a loss of public confidence in the government and a steep decline in president Yeltsin's popularity. Chechnya was one of the heaviest burdens on Yeltsin's 1996 presidential election campaign. In addition, the protracted <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> especially many reports of extreme violence against civilians, ignited fear and contempt of Russia among other ethnic groups in the federation.|$|E

The rebel Ingush commanders are veterans of Ossetian-Ingush conflict, <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> Daud Khalukhayev from Ingush village of Palanazh (Katsa), and a descendant of Ingush deportees of 1860's Syrian-born Ingush Walid Didigov.|$|R
2500|$|Doku Khamatovich Umarov ( [...] ; [...] ); {{also known}} as Dokka Umarov {{as well as by}} his Arabized name of Dokka Abu Usman; (13 April 1964 – 7 September 2013) was a Chechen radical Islamist militant in Russia. Umarov was a major {{military}} figure <b>in</b> both recent <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> during the 1990s and 2000s, before becoming the leader of the greater insurgency in the North Caucasus. He was active mostly <b>in</b> south-western <b>Chechnya,</b> near and across the borders with Ingushetia and Georgia.|$|R
5000|$|Russian SOBR units, {{staffed by}} senior-ranking police officers, {{received}} better training than {{the members of}} OMON (which is a cross between riot police and paramilitary police). They carried out SWAT-type special operations {{under the jurisdiction of}} the MVD, including the apprehension of dangerous criminals, high-profile raids, etc. They also fought during the <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya.</b> <b>In</b> 2007, Russia had 87 OMSN units, with over 5,000 officers stationed in major Russian cities, such as OMSN [...] "Rys" [...] (English: OMSN [...] "Lynx", Russian: ОМСН [...] "Рысь").|$|R
25|$|The First Chechen War, {{also known}} <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> was a {{conflict}} between the Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, fought from December 1994 to August 1996. After the initial campaign of 1994–1995, culminating in the devastating Battle of Grozny, Russian federal forces attempted to seize control of the mountainous area of Chechnya but were set back by Chechen guerrilla warfare and raids on the flatlands despite Russia's overwhelming advantages in manpower, weaponry, combat vehicles and air support. The resulting widespread demoralization of federal forces and the almost universal opposition of the Russian public to the conflict led Boris Yeltsin's government to declare a ceasefire with the Chechens in 1996 and sign a peace treaty a year later.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> spawned {{new forms}} of separatist {{activities}} in the Russian Federation. Resistance to the conscription of men from minority ethnic groups to fight in Chechnya was widespread among other republics, many of which passed laws and decrees on the subject. For example, the government of Chuvashia passed a decree providing legal protection to soldiers from the republic who refused {{to participate in the}} Chechen war and imposed limits {{on the use of the}} federal army in ethnic or regional conflicts within Russia. Some regional and local legislative bodies called for the prohibition on the use of draftees in quelling internal conflicts, while others demanded a total ban on the use of the armed forces in such situations. Russian government officials feared that a move to end the war short of victory would create a cascade of secession attempts by other ethnic minorities.|$|E
25|$|The PT-76 {{was used}} as the {{standard}} reconnaissance tank of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact armies. It was also intended for water obstacle fording operations and naval infantry landings. It served in the reconnaissance subunits of tank divisions and mechanized divisions of the Red Army and Soviet marines divisions. Although it has been replaced in front line service by the BMP-1, it may still be found in the reconnaissance companies and battalions of some motorized rifle and tank regiments and divisions, as well as in naval infantry units. Aside from its reconnaissance role, it is also used for crossing water obstacles in the first wave of an attack and for artillery support during the establishment of a beachhead. The main disadvantage of the BMP-1 and the BRM-1 when compared to the PT-76 is the absence of a powerful main armament. However, the BRM-1 is fitted with more modern reconnaissance equipment. Also, both vehicles have stronger front armor and superior mobility features and the BMP-1 can carry up to 8 fully equipped soldiers inside. The PT-76 is still on active service in a number of countries mainly in the third world. The Russian Army is reported to have used PT-76 units in the ongoing <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya.</b>|$|E
50|$|Doku Khamatovich Umarov (Ӏумар КӀант Доккa, 'Umar K'ant Dokka; Доку Хаматович Умаров, Doku Khamatovich Umarov); {{also known}} as Dokka Umarov {{as well as by}} his Arabized name of Dokka Abu Usman; (13 April 1964 - 7 September 2013) was a Chechen radical Islamist militant in Russia. Umarov was a major {{military}} figure <b>in</b> both recent <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> during the 1990s and 2000s, before becoming the leader of the greater insurgency in the North Caucasus.

50|$|Shchekochikhin's last {{published}} {{book was}} Slaves of the KGB: 20th Century. The Religion of Betrayal, telling the real stories {{of some of}} the many people forcibly recruited by the Russian KGB (the domestic operations of which later became the FSB) to work as undercover informers or agents. These people virtually became their KGB controllers' slaves, betraying their relatives, close friends and colleagues. When he died, he had not finished {{working on a book about}} the 20th Century <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya.</b>|$|R
50|$|For several years, Procházková {{concentrated}} on <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> and was <b>in</b> Groznyi {{when it was}} bombed for the first time. In June 1995, during the hostage-taking raid at Budyonnovsk in southern Russia, she offered herself in exchange for hostages taken from the hospital. Procházková reported the horrors of both {{the first and second}} Chechen War, often to the dismay of Russian authorities. During that time, she started to organize relief efforts for families ravaged by <b>war.</b> <b>In</b> 2000 she limited her work as a journalist and dedicated herself to humanitarian work, establishing a shelter for orphans in Groznyi. Her critique of Russian politics <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya</b> brought punishment—in 2000 she was forbidden to stay in Russia for a period of several years (and returned there only in late 2011).|$|R
25|$|A {{criminal}} {{investigation of the}} bombings was completed in 2002. The results of the investigation, and the court ruling that followed, concluded that they were organized by Achemez Gochiyaev, who remains at large, and ordered by Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif (both of whom were later killed), {{in retaliation for the}} Russian counteroffensive against their incursion into Dagestan. Six other suspects have been convicted by Russian courts. However, many observers, including State Duma deputies Yuri Shchekochikhin, Sergei Kovalev and Sergei Yushenkov, cast doubts on the official version and sought an independent investigation. Some others, including David Satter, Yury Felshtinsky, Vladimir Pribylovsky and Alexander Litvinenko, as well as the secessionist Chechen authorities, claimed that the 1999 bombings were a false flag attack coordinated by the FSB in order to win public support for a new full-scale <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya,</b> which boosted Prime Minister and former FSB Director Vladimir Putin's popularity, brought the pro-war Unity Party to the State Duma in the 1999 parliamentary election and him to the presidency within a few months. Felshtinsky and Litvinenko had links with the late Boris Berezovsky, an exiled oligarch who advocated the forcible overthrowing of the Russian Government. For example, Berezovsky sponsored Litivinenko's book.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{represents}} the brief analysis {{of one of}} the most important problems of the Russian Federation – the ethnic conflicts. Such a phenomenon has various dimensions and manifestations: from discrimination on the labor market to the extreme of ethnic cleansing during <b>wars</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chechnya.</b> The author focuses on the previously unexplored side of the problem: structural oppression conducted by minorities against the cultural majority of the country with a special regard to the republics of North Caucasus where the scope and intensity of ethnic strife found the most dangerous and explosive forms threatening with disintegration of the state...|$|R
