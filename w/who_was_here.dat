2500|$|... "Landa" [...] {{is derived}} from a Chichimeca {{expression}} [...] "lan-há", which means muddy place. [...] "de Matamoros" [...] {{was added to the}} name in 1919, by a state decree to honor insurgent Mariano Matamoros <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> during the Mexican War of Independence. The coat of arms contains a number of symbols related to its history. The indigenous phrase (lan-há) and an image of the mission relate to its indigenous past and Spanish conquest. The name of Matamoros appears for historical reasons as well. Concentric circles signify the encounter of indigenous and Spanish cultures. The lifestyle of the area is represented by a maguey plant, an ear of corn, the sun, the mountains, a drum and a book. Leaves and fruits found in the upper and lower parts indicate the indigenous respect for nature as well symbols of greatness. To the left of the mission church, there is a representation of the native dance of San Francisco de Asis church in Tilaco. Landa's identity as Mexican is represented by the national seal, the Mexican flag, and the flag of the Landa mission.|$|E
