5|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, Cedar Point <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> {{financial}} help. The wood of the Cyclone {{roller coaster}} was rotting, the boardwalk was cracked in many places, and the fishing dock <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> repair. In 1946, Cedar Point's oldest still-existing ride, the Midway Carousel, was installed. By 1951, the Cyclone coaster was razed because of its poor condition, leaving the resort without a roller coaster. As the Cyclone was being removed, the Laff-in-the-Dark, Rocket Ships, and Loop-A-Plane attractions were installed. Cedar Point Causeway was built in 1957, and is still in use. The president of Cedar Point, Bernie Zeiher, was replaced by George Roose around 1958, and Emile Legros was elected chairman that same year.|$|E

5|$|According to Dutton, Sigourney Weaver {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for his casting. In the years leading up the production of Alien 3, she promised him {{a role in the}} third film. While he was working on Broadway in December 1990, Weaver phoned him that the studio approved his casting and wanted him to fly to London. Although Dutton liked Alien 3, he found its production tumultuous; director David Fincher encountered resistance from 20th Century Fox, and Pinewood Studios <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> renovation.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, {{when the}} stadium <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> {{redesign}} to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters {{the opportunity to}} inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, {{and thousands of people}} paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu. In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline. It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.|$|E

5|$|There {{was little}} {{in way of}} work {{opportunities}} for Heaphy in Nelson and he based himself in Motueka.

It had clashed with Māori in the Wairau Affray in the Wairau Valley, to the south-east of Nelson and several company employees, including Arthur Wakefield, were killed.

5|$|Upon release, Halo Wars 2 {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} professional critics.

Several nuisances present in the game's keyboard and mouse controls left some critics disappointed, however, enhancements made to the gamepad control scheme from the first Halo Wars were praised. Post-release, the game has been supported with additional content and updates such as support for cross-platform play. A campaign expansion, titled Awakening the Nightmare, was released in 2017.|$|E
