5|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This {{can be a}} valid way of forecasting the weather when {{it is in a}} steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant <b>weather</b> <b>pattern.</b> Therefore, when in a fluctuating <b>weather</b> <b>pattern,</b> this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.|$|E

5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring <b>weather</b> <b>pattern</b> over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E

The {{objective is to}} assess their suitability for reliability analysis that is dependent on an accurate representation of <b>weather</b> <b>patterns.</b> Two WSTS models were analysed for their suitability against these criteria.

Minute variations in the initial values of variables in his twelve-variable computer weather model (c. 1960, running on an LGP-30 desk computer) would result in grossly divergent <b>weather</b> <b>patterns.</b> This sensitive dependence on initial conditions, which {{came to be known as}} the butterfly effect, meant that weather predictions from more than about a week out are generally fairly inaccurate.|$|R

5|$|The typical summer <b>weather</b> <b>pattern</b> is for heat-produced thermals, {{powered by}} either the Gulf or Atlantic sea breeze (and {{occasionally}} both simultaneously), to build puffy white cumulus clouds into threatening thunderheads over {{the interior of the}} Florida peninsula. Usually, the resulting storms drift slowly westward to the bay area, though they may rain themselves out before reaching Tampa if the easterly winds are light or the sea breeze from the Gulf of Mexico is too strong. Occasionally, the storms survive to move out over the Gulf of Mexico, where they can be seen at night from the beaches as spectacular light shows. Nighttime storms offshore are driven by the land-breeze front which is the dermal counterpart of the daytime sea-breeze front.|$|E
5|$|Constant {{pressure}} charts normally contain plotted {{values of}} temperature, humidity, wind, and the vertical height {{above sea level}} of the pressure surface. They {{have a variety of}} uses. In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the <b>weather</b> <b>pattern</b> than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward vertical motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft. The 500 hPa pressure surface {{can be used as a}} rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones. Shallower tropical cyclones, which have experienced vertical wind shear, tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{are also}} classified, {{according}} to their geographical location and dominant <b>weather</b> <b>pattern,</b> as trade wind, mid-latitude, rain shadow, coastal, monsoon, or polar deserts. Trade wind deserts occur {{either side of the}} horse latitudes at 30° to 35° North and South. These belts are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale descent of dry air moving from high-altitudes toward the poles. The Sahara Desert is of this type. Mid-latitude deserts occur between 30° and 50° North and South. They are mostly in areas remote from the sea where most of the moisture has already precipitated from the prevailing winds. They include the Tengger and Sonoran Deserts. Monsoon deserts are similar. They occur in regions where large temperature differences occur between sea and land. Moist warm air rises over the land, deposits its water content and circulates back to sea. Further inland, areas receive very little precipitation. The Thar Desert near the India/Pakistan border is of this type.|$|E

5|$|The 2000 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane season}} without a tropical cyclone {{in the month of}} July since 1993. The hurricane season officially began on June1, and ended on November30. It was slightly above average due to a La Niña <b>weather</b> <b>pattern</b> although most of the storms were weak. The first cyclone, Tropical Depression One, developed in the southern Gulf of Mexico on June7 and dissipated after an uneventful duration. However, it would be almost two months before the first named storm, Alberto, formed near Cape Verde; Alberto also dissipated with no effects on land. Several other tropical cyclones – Tropical Depression Two, Tropical Depression Four, Chris, Ernesto, Nadine, and an unnamed subtropical storm – did not impact land. Five additional storms – Tropical Depression Nine, Florence, Isaac, Joyce, and Leslie – minimally effected land areas.|$|E
5|$|While {{temperatures}} are somewhat lower on Gerlachovský štít {{because of its}} elevation, the weather and its potential impact on visitors is little different from other summits in the High Tatras both with and without marked trails. The typical daily <b>weather</b> <b>pattern</b> in the summer is a clear morning, clouds gathering by mid-morning—noon, occasional showers and storms in the afternoon. The chance of rain is lowest between 9–10 am and peaks between 2–3 pm, with a drop-off after 6pm. The frequency of storms with lightning (as opposed to rainstorms) on Gerlach's summit {{and on the other}} highest ridges is little different from lower elevations, too, but people exposed to wind, (sometimes freezing) rain, and lightning have greater difficulty to cope. The nearest shelter for those who ascend Gerlach is the Sliezsky Dom Hotel, there are no natural shelters along the route.|$|E
5|$|Along the San Francisco peninsula, {{gaps in the}} Santa Cruz Mountains, one {{south of}} San Bruno Mountain and another in Crystal Springs, allow oceanic weather into the {{interior}} and causing a cooling effect for cities along the Peninsula and even {{as far south as}} San Jose. This <b>weather</b> <b>pattern</b> is also the source for delays at San Francisco International Airport. In Marin county north of the Golden Gate strait, two gaps north of Muir Woods bring cold air across the Marin Headlands, with the cooling affect reaching as far north as Santa Rosa. Further inland, the East Bay receives oceanic weather that travels through the Golden Gate strait, and further diffuses that air through the Berkeley Hills, Niles Canyon and the Hayward Pass into the Livermore Valley and Altamont Pass. Here, the resulting breeze is so strong that it is home to one of the world's largest array of wind turbines. Further north, the Carquinez Strait funnels the ocean weather into the San Joaquin River Delta, causing a cooling effect in Stockton and Sacramento, so that these cities are also cooler than their Central Valley counterparts in the south.|$|E

5|$|Following the extratropical {{transition}} of Typhoon Gay on May26, a spring-like <b>weather</b> <b>pattern</b> {{returned to the}} West Pacific, including a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) and a strong ridge, which extended from the International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula. On June1, the monsoon trough re-developed over the South China Sea. Thunderstorm activity increased considerably on June8. Three days later, a weak disturbance was first noted {{just north of the}} equator. Although most of the convection was initially displaced from the center, the system began to show signs of organization on June15. Three days later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the disturbance. On June19, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first identified the system; however, strong wind shear caused all the deep convection to become displaced to the south of the center. At 1800UTC, wind shear began to decrease, and the cyclone developed a well-defined circulation. Based on this, the JTWC upgraded the system into Tropical Storm Hal. Early the next day, the JMA classified Hal as a severe tropical storm. Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Kuring.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of another aviary and captive reproduction center was considered throughout 2013, with {{the municipalities of}} Maricao and Isabela being analyzed. In November 2013, plans {{for the establishment of}} a third population in the Maricao State Forest were formally announced. The following month, ten amazons were released at Río Abajo. 2013 set a new record for the reproduction program, which produced 51 fledglings and shattered the previous record of 34 that was established in 2011. The wild population grew by 15 chicks, an improvement from the 12 born during the previous year. During this time frame, the known number of amazon specimens rounded 500 individuals. A severe drought caused by the emergence of El Niño began during the spring of 2015 and extended throughout the summer, benefitting the breeding of the amazons in El Yunque by extending their reproductive season. However, this <b>weather</b> <b>pattern</b> also increased the number of mongooses present in the forest, representing a risk for the population. On August 13, 2015, a group of 25 amazons was moved from the other aviaries to a repurposed installation in Maricao. Each member was brought individually in order to ensure their safety while being transported and later placed in an acclimation program that is expected to last a year, before they are released to create a new population in the region.|$|E

25|$|Weather {{conditions}} during 1350-1600 CE {{were better}} suited for maize growing on the upper Ohio Valley and West Virginia's tributary valleys. In the same time frame, the central and southwest Ohio (Till Plains) had cooler and wetter conditions, which affected the 'silking', pollination and grain filling stages that likely caused lower yields. Corn consumption decreased in the middle Ohio valley. The following <b>weather</b> <b>pattern</b> had intermittent droughts. This research also includes isotope analysis of samples from 47 archaeological sites in West and South Ohio, and western West Virginia (Staller, Tykot and Benz 2006:219,220).

40|$|Smallholder {{farmers in}} the Himalayan {{district}} of Nainital in Uttarakhand, India depend on predictable <b>weather</b> <b>patterns</b> for both food and cash crop cultivation.

In an analysis of a 307 -household survey of smallholder farmers, I find that respondents perceive changes in <b>weather</b> <b>patterns</b> and report adverse effects on their agricultural productivity. Despite describing traditional grains as crops best suited to adverse weather, respondents still choose to grow cash crops that they believe to be the most vulnerable to these <b>weather</b> <b>patterns.</b> The competing motivations of sustainability and profitability are explained by the growing prominence of the Indian Public Distribution System, which has created a buffer against the drought-precipitated famine by providing heavily subsidized grain but, in turn, diminished the profitability of locally produced grain. I argue that overall food security and sustainability can be improved by reorienting the objectives of agricultural policy and welfare policy to value local preferences and to treat smallholder farmers as agents rather than welfare recipients...|$|R
