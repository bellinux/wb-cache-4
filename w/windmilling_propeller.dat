50|$|Canadian {{accident}} {{investigators found}} that a bevel gear in the oil pump drive had failed, shutting off lubrication to the propeller. This caused the propeller to decouple from the engine, allowing it to windmill at high speed. Moreover, during the emergency descent, the pilots had allowed the aircraft's airspeed to increase {{too close to the}} maximum allowable. This put significant strain on the <b>windmilling</b> <b>propeller</b> and in all probability caused it to fail in flight. The possibility of the bevel gear drive failing causing the propeller to windmill had not been foreseen by Vickers engineers, and there was therefore no mention of it in the training or operations manual.|$|E
50|$|By 1918 a Clerget {{handbook}} advised maintaining {{all necessary}} control {{by using the}} fuel and air controls, and starting and stopping the engine by turning the fuel on and off. The recommended landing procedure involved shutting off the fuel using the fuel lever, while leaving the blip switch on. The <b>windmilling</b> <b>propeller</b> made the engine continue to spin without delivering any power as the aircraft descended. It was important to leave the ignition on to allow the spark plugs to continue to spark and keep them from oiling up, so that the engine could (if all went well) be restarted simply by re-opening the fuel valve. Pilots were advised to not use an ignition cut out switch, as it would eventually damage the engine.|$|E
5000|$|In {{subsequent}} {{correspondence between}} the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), {{included in the final}} report, the NTSB questioned the then-available operating procedures and manuals for the aircraft. The NTSB found that there was insufficient guidance to pilots in the handling of [...] "Cruise Pitch Lock Stuck" [...] condition. For example, it was not clear based on existing instructions and guidelines whether a missed approach would be indicated and/or possible under these circumstances, and if so, what would be the recommended procedure to successfully execute the maneuver. Also, the condition of a shut down but unfeathered engine, i.e. <b>windmilling</b> <b>propeller</b> with high asymmeteric drag and minimum control implications, which was encountered in this accident, was insufficiently covered, according to the NTSB.|$|E
40|$|Force {{and flight}} tests were {{performance}} on an all-wing model with <b>windmilling</b> <b>propellers.</b> Tests {{were conducted with}} deflected and retracted flaps, with and without auxiliary vertical tail surfaces, and with different centers of gravity and trim coefficients. Results indicate serious reduction of stick-fixed longitudinal stability because of wing-tip stalling at high lift coefficient. Directional stability without vertical tail is undesirably low. Low effective dihedral should be maintained. Elevator and rudder control system is satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|A {{flight test}} has been {{conducted}} to determine the longitudinal stability and control characteristics of a 0. 133 -scale model of the Consolidated Vultee XFY- 1 airplane with <b>windmilling</b> <b>propellers</b> for the Mach number range between 0. 70 and 1. 13. The variation of lift-curve slope C(sub L(sub alpha) with Mach number was gradual with a maximum value of 0. 074 occurring at a Mach number of 0. 97. Propellers had little effect upon the values of lift-curve slope or the linearity of lift coefficient with angle of attack. At lift coefficients between approximately 0. 25 and 0. 45 with an elevon angle of approximately -l 0 deg, there was a region of neutral longitudinal stability at Mach numbers below 0. 93 introduced {{by the addition of}} <b>windmilling</b> <b>propellers.</b> Below a lift coefficient of 0. 10 and above a lift coefficient of 0. 45, the model was longitudinally stable throughout the Mach number range of the test. There was a forward shift in the aerodynamic center of about 3 -percent mean aerodynamic chord introduced by the addition of propellers. The aerodynamic center as determined at low lift moved gradually from a value of 28. 5 -percent mean aerodynamic chord at a Mach number of 0. 75 to a value of 47 -percent mean aerodynamic chord at a Mach number of 1. 10. There was an abrupt decrease in pitch damping between Mach numbers of 0. 88 and 0. 99 followed by a rapid increase in damping to a Mach number of 1. 06. The propellers had little effect upon the pitch damping characteristics. The transonic trim change was a large pitching-down tendency with and without <b>windmilling</b> <b>propellers.</b> The elevons were effective pitch controls throughout the speed range; however, their effectiveness was reduced about 50 percent at supersonic speeds. The propellers had no appreciable effect upon the control effectiveness...|$|R

The results of these calculations differ somewhat from those previously made for this airplane by Republic Aviation Corporation personnel {{under the direction of}} Langley flight division personnel. Due to these differences the neutral point for the airplane is predicted to be 37. 8 percent mean aerodynamic chord, instead of 40. 8 percent mean aerodynamic chord as previously reported...|$|R
50|$|On December 16, 1984, Air Resorts Airlines Flight 953 {{experienced}} an in-flight engine failure, fire, and ground collision during the landing roll following {{an emergency landing}} at the airport. The flight was carrying the East Tennessee State University basketball team to Oxford, Mississippi from Birmingham, Alabama. Two of the 39 occupants of the Convair CV 440 airplane were seriously injured during the accident, 11 others received minor injuries. As the airport did not have on-field emergency services, the nearby Jasper Fire Department was called by the airport manager moments before the emergency landing after being alerted by the Birmingham Approach air traffic controller. During the landing the aircraft veered off Runway 27 and crossed the north-south taxiway, at which time the right landing gear separated and the airplane skidded to a stop. The aircraft was subsequently destroyed by fire. The NTSB concluded the accident resulted from {{the failure of the}} Number 6 cylinder in the right engine which caused a complete loss of power with a subsequent <b>windmilling</b> <b>propeller</b> and engine fire.|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of using a}} forward mounted <b>windmilling</b> <b>propeller</b> to extract momentum from the flow around an axisymmetric body to reduce total drag has been studied. Numerical calculations indicate that a net drag reduction is possible when the energy extracted is returned to an aft mounted pusher propeller. However, net drag reduction requires very high device efficiencies. Results of an experimental program to study the coupling between a propeller wake and a turbulent boundary layer are also reported. The experiments showed that a complex coupling exists and simple modes for the flow field are not sufficiently accurate to predict total drag...|$|E
40|$|An {{implicit}} approximate factorization {{algorithm is}} employed {{to quantify the}} parametric effects of Courant number and artificial smoothing on numerical solutions of the unsteady 3 -D Euler equations for a <b>windmilling</b> <b>propeller</b> (low speed) flow field. The results show that propeller global or performance chracteristics vary strongly with Courant number and artificial dissipation parameters, though the variation is such less severe at high Courant numbers. Candidate sets of Courant number and dissipation parameters could result in parameter-dependent solutions. Parameter-independent numerical solutions can be obtained if low values of the dissipation parameter-time step ratio {{are used in the}} computations. Furthermore, it is realized that too much artificial damping can degrade numerical stability. Finally, it is demonstrated that highly resolved meshes may, in some cases, delay convergence, thereby suggesting some optimum cell size for a given flow solution. It is suspected that improper boundary treatment may account for the cell size constraint...|$|E
50|$|In road transport, an {{oversize}} load (or overweight load) is a load that exceeds the standard or ordinary legal size and/or weight limits for a specified portion of road, highway or other transport infrastructure, such as air freight or water freight. There are also {{load per axle}} limits. However, a load that exceeds the per-axle limits, but not the overall weight limits, is considered overweight. Examples of oversize/overweight loads include construction machines (cranes, front loaders, backhoes, etc.), pre-built homes, containers, construction elements (bridge beams, generators, <b>windmill</b> <b>propellers,</b> rocket stages, industrial equipment).|$|R
40|$|A {{flight test}} of a rocket-propelled model of the Convair XFY- 1 {{airplane}} was conducted to determine the lateral stability and control characteristics, The 0. 133 -scale model had <b>windmilling</b> <b>propellers</b> for this test, which covered a Mach number range of O. 70 to 1. 12. The center of gravity was located at 13. 9 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord. The methods of analysis included both a solution by vector diagrams and simple one- and two-degree-of-freedom methods. The model was both statically and dynamically stable throughout the speed range of the testa The roll damping was good, and {{the slope of the}} side-force curve varied little with speed. The rudder was effective throughout the test speed range, although it was reduced to about 43 percent of its subsonic value at supersonic speeds...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel on a l/ 23 -scale model of the Lockheed XFV- 1 airplane {{to determine the effects}} of control setting and movement upon the erect-spin and recovery characteristics for a range of airplane loading conditions. A <b>windmilling</b> <b>propeller</b> was simulated on the model for some of the tests. The investigation included determination of the size of tail parachute required for emergency recovery from demonstration spins. The tumbling tendencies of the model were also investigated. The results indicated that any erect or inverted spin obtained on the airplane will be satisfactorily terminated if recovery is attempted by full rudder reversal accompanied by simultaneous lateral and longitudinal movement of the stick to neutral, The model test results showed that an 11. 5 -foot flat-type tail parachute (drag coefficient approximately 0. 73) with a 27. 5 -foot towline will be effective as an emergency spin-recovery device during demonstration spins of the airplane. The model results also indicate that the airplane will not tumble for any. loading condition indicated possible...|$|E
40|$|Results of an {{experimental}} investigation of propeller whirl flutter are presented for a model consisting of an isolated, rigid system of propeller and simulated power plant mounted with flexibility in {{pitch and yaw}} on a rigid sting. A range of propeller blade angles, restraint stiffnesses, and restraint damping coefficients was investigated for a system symmetrical i n pitch and yaw with a <b>windmilling</b> <b>propeller.</b> Measurements of the static-stability derivatives were also made by using a simple balance and were compared with two sets of theoretical derivatives. Whirl-flutter calculations were made with the theoretical and measured derivatives. Some limited results were obtained for the whirl flutter of the model mounted on a cantilever semispan wing. The measured whirl-flutter speeds and frequencies of the isolated model were in very good agreement with those predicted by calculations in which measured derivatives and viscous damping were used. This agreement was better than that obtained by using structural damping. Predicted whirl-flutter speeds for the isolated model were lower when theoretical stability derivatives were used than when measured derivatives were used. The theoretical and experimental static-stability derivatives exhibited the same trends, but in certain instances differed appreciably in magnitude. the measured whirl-flutter boundary for the one configuration considered...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel on a l/ 20 -scale model of the Consolidated Vultee XFY- 1 airplane with a <b>windmilling</b> <b>propeller</b> simulated {{to determine the effects}} of control setting and movements upon the erect spin and recovery characteristics for a range of airplane-loading conditions. The effects on the model's spin-recovery characteristics of removing the lower vertical tail, removing the gun pods, and fixing the rudders at neutral were also investigated briefly. The investigation included determination of the size parachute required for emergency recovery from demonstration spins. The tumbling tendencies of the model were also investigated. Brief static force tests were made to determine the aerodynamic characteristics in pitch at high angles of attack. The investigation indicated that the spin and recovery characteristics of the airplane with propeller windmilling will be satisfactory for all loading conditions if recovery is attempted by full rudder reversal accompanied by simultaneous movement of the stick laterally to full with the spin (stick right in a right spin) and longitudinally to neutral. Inverted spins should be satisfactorily terminated by fully reversing the rudder followed immediately by moving the stick laterally towards the forward rudder pedal and longitudinally to neutral. Removal of the gun pods or fixing the rudders at neutral will not adversely affect the airplane's spin-recovery characteristics, but removal of the lower vertical tail will result in unsatisfactory spin-recovery characteristics. The model-test results showed that a 13. 3 -foot wing-tip conventional parachute (drag coefficient approximately 0. 7) should be effective as an emergency spin-recovery device during demonstration spins of the airplane. It was indicated that the airplane should not tumble and that no unusual longitudinal-trim characteristics should be obtained for the center-of-gravity positions investigated...|$|E

40|$|Spin {{tests of}} a 1 / 16 -scale {{model of the}} Chance Vought XF 5 U- 1 {{airplane}} have been performed in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel. The effect of control position and movement upon the erect and inverted spin and recovery characteristics ae well as the effects of propellers, of stability flaps, and of various revisions to the design configuration have been determined for the normal fighter loading. The investigation also included spin recovery parachute, tumbling, and pilot-escape tests. For the original design configuration, with or without <b>windmilling</b> <b>propellers,</b> the recovery characteristics of the model were considered unsatisfactory. Increasing the maximum upward deflection of the ailavators from 45 deg to 65 deg resulted in greatly improved recovery characteristics. Dimensional revisions to the original airplane configuration, which satisfactorily improved the general spin and recovery characteristics of the model, consisted of: (1) a supplementary vertical tail 34 inches by 59 inches (full-scale) attached to a boom 80 inches aft of {{the trailing edge of}} the airplane in the plane of symmetry, (2) a large semispan undersurface spoiler placed along the airplane quarter-chord line and opened on the outboard side in a spin, or (3) two additional vertical tails 64 inches by 52 inches (full-scale) located at the tips of the ailavators. A satisfactory parachute arrangement for emergency spin recovery from demonstration spins was found to be an arrangement consisting of a 13. 3 -foot parachute attached by a 30 -foot towline to the arresting gear mast on the airplane and opened simultaneously with an 8 -foot parachute on the outboard end of the wing attached by a 3 -foot towline. Tests indicated that pilot escape from a spin would be extremely hazardous unless the pilot is mechanically ejected from the cockpit. Model tumbling tests indicated that the airplane would not tumble...|$|R

40|$|A report {{proposes a}} method of {{utilizing}} solar-radiation pressure to keep the axis of rotation of a small spin-stabilized spacecraft pointed approximately (typically, within an angle of 10 deg to 20 deg) toward the Sun. Axisymmetry is not required. Simple tilted planar vanes would {{be attached to the}} outer surface of the body, so that the resulting spacecraft would vaguely resemble a rotary fan, <b>windmill,</b> or <b>propeller.</b> The vanes would be painted black for absorption of Solar radiation. A theoretical analysis based on principles of geometric optics and mechanics has shown that torques produced by Solar-radiation pressure would cause the axis of rotation to precess toward Sun-pointing. The required vane size would be a function of the angular momentum of the spacecraft and the maximum acceptable angular deviation from Sun-pointing. The analysis also shows that the torques produced by the vanes would slowly despin the spacecraft [...] an effect that could be counteracted by adding specularly reflecting "spin-up" vanes...|$|R

2500|$|Hughes did {{not follow}} the agreed testing program and {{communications}} protocol, and remained airborne almost {{twice as long as}} planned. An hour into the flight (after onboard recording cameras had run out of film), a leak caused the right-hand propeller controls to lose their effectiveness and the rear propeller subsequently reversed its pitch, disrupting that engine's thrust, which caused the aircraft to yaw hard to the right. The USAAF account said that, [...] "It appeared that loss of hydraulic fluid caused failure of the pitch change mechanism of right rear propeller. Mr. Hughes maintained full power of right engine and reduced that of left engine instead of trying to fly with right <b>propeller</b> <b>windmilling</b> without power.

40|$|The XF- 12 {{airplane}} is {{a high-performance}} photo-reconnaissance aircraft {{designed for the}} Army Air Forces by the Republic Aviation Corporation. An investigation of a 1 / 8. 33 - scale powered model {{was made in the}} Langley l 9 -foot pressure tunnel to obtain information relative to the aerodynamic design of the airplane. The model was tested with and without the original vertical tail. and with two revised tails. For the revised tail no. 1, the span of the original vertical. tail was increased about 15 percent and the portion of the vertical tail between the stabilizer and fuselage behind the rudder hinge line was allowed to deflect simultaneously with the main rudder. Revision no. 2 incorporated the increased span, but the lower rudder was locked in the neutral position. For all the tail arrangements investigated it was indicated that the airplane will possess positive effective dihedral and will be directionally stable regardless of flap or power condition. The rudder effectiveness is greater for the revised tails than for the original tail, but this is offset by the increase in directional stability caused by the revised tail.
