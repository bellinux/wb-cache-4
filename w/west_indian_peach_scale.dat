40|$|White <b>peach</b> <b>scale,</b> Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni-Tozetti) (He- miptera: Diaspididae) is {{a serious}} {{economic}} and quarantine pest of papaya, Carica papaya L. The parasitic wasp Encarsia diaspidicola (Silvestri) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) was brought from Western Samoa into a quarantine containment facility in Hawaii for evaluation and potential release against white <b>peach</b> <b>scale.</b> E. diaspidicola was considered an ideal biological control candidate for release in Hawaii because it is reportedly highly host specific. Host range testing in quarantine with several exotic diaspidids and related taxa, including a native palm scale, indicated that E. dispidicola is unlikely to attack non-target species or cause {{harm to the environment}} if released for control of white <b>peach</b> <b>scale</b> in Hawaii. The Hawaii Department of Agriculture and USDA APHIS issued permits for its release. Releases of E. diaspidicola were made beginning in February 2013 in a papaya field in Kapoho on the Big Island. Yellow sticky trap monitoring suggests that the wasp has established in the area of release. Infested papaya logs are being used to spread the wasp to new areas...|$|R

Thirteen districts were infested with harmful white peach scale; infestation was most common in parks, roadsides, private and institution gardens in centrum and old silkroad parts of Ankara. Twenty-two host plant species were found in these 13 districts, five of which (Aesculus carnea, Hibiscus sp., Paulownia tomentosa, Rhus thyphina and Salix babylonica) had not previously been recorded as host plants in Turkey. Some host plant species, including Catalpa bignonioides, Cornus alba, Fraxinus americana, F. excelsior, Forsythia intermedia, Morus alba, M. nigra and Sophora japonica, {{were found to be}} very highly infested.

40|$|Halogenated very {{short-lived}} substances (VSLSs) {{are naturally}} {{produced in the}} ocean and emitted to the atmosphere. When transported to the stratosphere, these compounds can have a significant influence on the ozone layer and climate. During a research cruise on RV Sonne in the subtropical and tropical <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean in July and August 2014, we measured the VSLSs, methyl iodide (CH 3 I) {{and for the first}} time bromoform (CHBr 3) and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2), in surface seawater and the marine atmosphere to derive their emission strengths. Using the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART with ERA-Interim meteorological fields, we calculated the direct contribution of observed VSLS emissions to the stratospheric halogen burden during the Asian summer monsoon. Furthermore, we compare the in situ calculations with the interannual variability of transport from a larger area of the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean surface to the stratosphere for July 2000 – 2015. We found that the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean is a strong source for CHBr 3 (910  pmol m− 2  h− 1), very strong source for CH 2 Br 2 (930  pmol m− 2  h− 1), and an average source for CH 3 I (460  pmol m− 2  h− 1). The atmospheric transport from the tropical <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean surface to the stratosphere experiences two main pathways. On very short timescales, especially relevant for the shortest-lived compound CH 3 I (3. 5 days lifetime), convection above the Indian Ocean lifts oceanic air masses and VSLSs towards the tropopause. On a longer timescale, the Asian summer monsoon circulation transports oceanic VSLSs towards India and the Bay of Bengal, where they are lifted with the monsoon convection and reach stratospheric levels in the southeastern part of the Asian monsoon anticyclone. This transport pathway is more important for the longer-lived brominated compounds (17 and 150 days lifetime for CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2). The entrainment of CHBr 3 and CH 3 I from the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean to the stratosphere during the Asian summer monsoon is lower than from previous cruises in the tropical west Pacific Ocean during boreal autumn and early winter but higher than from the tropical Atlantic during boreal summer. In contrast, the projected CH 2 Br 2 entrainment was very high because of the high emissions during the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean cruise. The 16 -year July time series shows highest interannual variability for the shortest-lived CH 3 I and lowest for the longest-lived CH 2 Br 2. During this time period, a small increase in VSLS entrainment from the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean through the Asian monsoon to the stratosphere is found. Overall, this study confirms that the subtropical and tropical <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean is an important source region of halogenated VSLSs, especially CH 2 Br 2, to the troposphere and stratosphere during the Asian summer monsoon...|$|R
2500|$|Prunus persica {{grows to}} [...] tall and 6 in. in diameter. The leaves are lanceolate, [...] long, [...] broad, pinnately veined. The flowers are {{produced}} {{in early spring}} before the leaves; they are solitary or paired, 2.5–3cm diameter, pink, with five petals. The fruit has yellow or whitish flesh, a delicate aroma, and a skin that is either velvety (peaches) or smooth (nectarines) in different cultivars. The flesh is very delicate and easily bruised in some cultivars, but is fairly firm in some commercial varieties, especially when green. The single, large seed is red-brown, oval shaped, approximately 1.3–2cm long, and {{is surrounded by a}} wood-like husk. Peaches, along with cherries, plums and apricots, are stone fruits (drupes).

40|$|The parents' {{evaluation}} of aural/oral performance of children (<b>PEACH)</b> <b>scale</b> {{was developed to}} assess the effectiveness of amplification for children, based on a systematic use of parents' observations of children's performance in real-world environments. Objective: The {{purpose of the present}} study was to adapt the <b>PEACH</b> <b>scale</b> into the Malay language, and to collect normative data on a group of children with normal hearing. Study sample: The participants were parents of 74 children aged between 3 months and 13 years of age. Parents were requested to observe their children's auditory/oral behavior in everyday life and to record their observations in the PEACH booklet. Results: High internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 93) and item-total correlation were found (0. 520. 85). Similar to the published norms for English-speaking children, near-perfect scores were achieved by Malaysian children around 40 months of age. Conclusions: The adapted version can be used to evaluate amplification for children in the Malay speaking environment. The normative curve relating age to scores for the Malay PEACH can be used as a reference against whic h functional aural/oral performance of hearing-impaired Malaysian children can be evaluated. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The white <b>peach</b> <b>scale,</b> Pseudaulacaspis pentagona (Targioni Tozzetti) (PP) is {{considered}} a main pest of peach orchards in the East Mediterranean region of Turkey. Peach is grown traditionally in the mountain area, {{but in the last}} two decades the number of peach orchards increased significantly in the coastal plains of the East Mediterranean region. PP is distributed in all peach-growing localities and heavy infestation occurs in orchards of the coastal plain. During this study two parasitoids — Encarsia berlesei (Howard) and Azotus perspeciosus (Girault) — and four predators — Cybocephalus fodori minor (Endrody-Younga), Chilocorus bipustulatus (L.), Rhyzobius lophanthae (Blaisdell) and Pharoscymnus pharoides Marseul — were found. The white <b>peach</b> <b>scale</b> occurs in Turkey on 14 host plants including several fruit trees, ornamental plants and some herbaceous plants under the canopy of heavily infested peach trees. Population fluctuations from November 1991 through November 1993 were observed at four locations representing two different ecological conditions. In the mountain area two distinct generations were recorded, the first in June/July and the second in September/October. In the coastal plain three generations were observed, the first in mid-April, the second in June/July and the third in October/November. PP population peaks are not followed by the parasitoid and predator populations, suggesting that the effectiveness of these natural enemies is not sufficient to control the pest...|$|R
