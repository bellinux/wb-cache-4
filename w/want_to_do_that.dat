25|$|CBS had {{originally}} planned {{on making the}} As the World Turns expansion {{at the beginning of}} the new season in September 1975. ABC's daytime schedule was full at the time, and the earliest they could have a spot open on the schedule would be December. This meant that it would be approximately three months at least before Edge would air its first episode on ABC and the network did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> Instead, a compromise was struck. CBS would keep The Edge of Night on its schedule for the time being, and once ABC found a place for it, which it did when they cancelled You Don't Say! in November 1975, the expansion and network change would take place.|$|E

So he said, 'Oh, you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> happy stuff? All right, all right.' He was not into doing it. Then we started listening to a lot of different and old loops and we used the 'Blind Alley' loop and I started singing the melody over it." ...|$|E
500|$|To date, the Fred Walecki tribute concert {{appearance}} in 2000 represents {{the last time}} that the Byrds have performed together. [...] However, Hillman and Crosby have both expressed an interest in working with McGuinn again on future Byrds projects, but the lead guitarist and head Byrd remains adamant that he is not interested in another reunion. [...] During an interview with music journalist John Nork, McGuinn replied [...] "absolutely not," [...] when asked if he had any plans to revive the Byrds, explaining, [...] "No, I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I just want to be a solo artist. The Byrds are well documented. I don't think we need anymore from the Byrds." ...|$|E

5000|$|His most {{successful}} recording period was between 1970 and 1980, {{though he has}} since recorded ten studio albums up to 2015. Speaking in 2009 he said, [...] "I write pop songs. End of story. <b>That's</b> all I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>That's</b> all I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> And <b>that's</b> all I continue <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I {{have no interest in}} just touring, and living in the past." ...|$|R
500|$|The network–ugh–they're {{so stupid}} sometimes. The shows [...] were doing good, they weren't big hits, {{but they were}} doing good. They felt that if they could put Paul [...] and Cleavon Little {{together}} {{that they would have}} a big hit. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I said I won't do it, not at the sacrifice of the show. It's wrong. I don't think it's a good idea. But they wanted to bring in somebody else {{as the head of the}} hospital. They wanted his [...] mother to be head of the hospital and his conflicts would be with her and I just didn't think it was right. I didn't want to write it. I just didn't want to do it [...] I didn't. Someone else came in. It was a big thing with the network. They cancelled The Paul Lynde Show and put Paul in Temperatures Rising." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Actor James Doohan {{claimed that}} Paramount chief Frank Mancuso had fired Bennett {{following}} negative {{reaction from the}} core cast, Roddenberry, and fans. Bennett claimed that after he rewrote the script to include Shatner and Nimoy, Paramount had still rejected it and that he {{decided it was time}} he left the franchise. He said, [...] "My term was up. I was offered $1.5million to do Star Trek VI and I said 'Thanks, I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I want to do the Academy.'" [...] Actor Walter Koenig approached Mancuso with a new script outline codenamed [...] "In Flanders Fields"; in it, the Romulans join the Federation and go to war with the Klingons. The Enterprise crew, except Spock, are forced to retire for not meeting fitness tests. When Spock and his new crew are captured by a monstrous worm-like race of aliens (which Koenig described as [...] "things that the monsters in Aliens evolved from"), the old crew must rescue them. In the end, all of the characters except McCoy and Spock die.|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}} what the fellow <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> for." [...] Then he smiled back at Frank. [...] "These are decadent days. He wouldn't have got away with his scalp on if he'd come creeping into the room of the James boys." ...|$|R
5000|$|An infuriating know-it-all {{father who}} advised various people with both {{household}} tasks and diverse jobs, {{such as a}} football pundit. This was Enfield's take on the traditional [...] "mother-in-law" [...] stereotype. His catchphrase, on encountering someone, or entering a room is [...] "Only me!" [...] When his interfering goes wrong he tends to blame everyone but himself, using the catchphrase [...] "Now I do not believe you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>did</b> you?" ...|$|R
500|$|Bowie {{elected to}} play less {{well-known}} {{songs on the}} tour and avoided some of his bigger hits. He was eager to not repeat the formula that made the Serious Moonlight Tour a success, saying, [...] "It seemed so easy. It was cheers from the word go. You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, take the money and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, and that was a bit yawn-making. There was one I was humming to myself the other day: [...] 'Baby, baby, I'll never let you down' – oh lord, what's that one? Jesus, I can't remember it. ... 'Sons of the Silent Age!' [...] Ah! That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for me now is a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E
500|$|In July 1969, Hammill {{had begun}} {{performing}} solo at The Marquee in London, and {{since there was}} no group, he decided to record what was intended to be his first solo album at Trident Studios on 31 July and 1 August, with Banton, Evans, and Ellis as session musicians. However, through a deal worked out by Stratton-Smith, the album, The Aerosol Grey Machine, was released in September 1969 by Mercury under the band's name in return for releasing the band from their contract. The album was initially only released in the United States with hardly any promotion at all, so sales were minimal, but the group decided to reform {{in the middle of the}} recording session. Ellis had already committed to joining Juicy Lucy and was replaced by Evan's former bandmate in The Misunderstood, Nic Potter. The band had also enjoyed flautist Jeff Peach's contributions to the album and wanted to recruit a further instrumentalist. [...] "There was always the idea of having another melodic instrument," [...] recalled Evans. [...] "He 'll play a solo, sure, and really give it something, but he doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> all the time." [...] Peach was approached to become a full-time member, but dropped out after one rehearsal. The position was eventually filled by saxophonist and flautist David Jackson, who had previously played in a band called Heebalob with Smith. Hammill had already sat in with Heebalob at the Plumpton National Jazz Festival on 9 August, and, impressed by Jackson's playing, invited him to join the band, partly because he also needed a flatmate to help pay with the rent.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 July 2005 Michael Todd, then Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, England, {{let himself}} be {{shot in the}} back with a Taser, to {{demonstrate}} his confidence that Tasers can be used safely. This was captured on video, and the video was released to the BBC on 17 May 2007. He was wearing a shirt and no jacket. When tased, he fell forward onto his chest on the ground, and (he said afterwards) [...] "I couldn't move, it hurt like hell," [...] he said after recovering. [...] "I wouldn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> again." ...|$|E
60|$|You see, if the Laughing Brook {{would never}} laugh any more, and the Smiling Pool would never smile any more, {{there was nothing}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but <b>to</b> {{go down to the}} Big River to live, and no one <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> {{especially}} Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was giving}} voice {{in a rock}} 'n' roll setting to the Oedipus complex, {{at the time a}} widely {{discussed}} tendency in Freudian psychology. He wasn't saying he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> his own mom and dad. He was re-enacting a bit of Greek drama. It was theatre! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{thought we}} were going to fight the Genoese galleys. It <b>does</b> not seem <b>to</b> me that a week is <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> A day <b>to</b> go to Chioggia, a day to fight, and a day to return. What can you want more than that for?" ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 27 November, the {{government}} {{declared a state of}} emergency around the two occupied airports and ordered police to clear out PAD forces. The state of emergency allowed the military to ban public gatherings of more than five people. The Navy was assigned to aid police at Suvarnabhumi, while the Air Force was assigned to aid police at Don Muang. The Army's spokesman noted, [...] "The army disagrees with using troops to resolve the problem. The army does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and it is not appropriate to do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, {{while in}} St. Louis for his ninth All-Star appearance, Ichiro made {{a trip to}} Sisler's grave. He later told reporters, [...] "There's not many chances to come to St. Louis. In 2004, {{it was the first}} time I crossed paths with him, and his family generously came all the way to Seattle. Above all, it was a chance. I wanted to do that for a grand upperclassman of the {{baseball}} world. I think it's only natural for someone to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> to express my feelings in that way. I’m not sure if he's happy about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It was a {{tough thing}} for me. I kicked two calls {{in the fourth quarter}} and I {{impacted}} the game and as an official you never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> It left me with a lot of sleepless nights and I think about it constantly. I'll go to my grave wishing that I'd been better. I know that I did my best at that time, but it wasn't good enough. When we make mistakes, you got to step up and own them. It's something that all officials have to deal with, but unfortunately when {{you have to deal with}} it in the Super Bowl it's difficult." ...|$|E
5000|$|Banks later commented, [...] "The Fugitive was a {{slightly}} different approach, where I sang everything. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> once in my life! I purposely kept the vocal lines straightforward, so that I could sing them. The album has quite a strong instrumental bias, {{but it was a}} little more stark. I like the record very much." ...|$|R
5000|$|Houck {{subsequently}} put recording as Phosphorescent on hiatus stating, [...] "I put Phosphorescent on hold, {{outside of}} on tour, {{for about a}} year. I don’t think it’s normal to shut down from record to record, but I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I wasn’t sure if I {{was going to make}} another Phosphorescent record at that time." ...|$|R
5000|$|Recalling this period, Chadwick said: I {{actually}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{produce a}} sort of touchable object, a tangible object. I really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> rather than be involved with intangible things like architecture which was slightly intangible to me because it had meant, in my case, drawing after drawing after drawing for projects which were never realised. In my case, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it <b>to</b> have some reality in front of me.|$|R
2500|$|By a month later, McCain demurred {{from putting}} too much {{stress on the}} effect the {{economic}} crisis had had on his {{chance to win the}} presidency: [...] "That would sound like I am detracting from President-elect Obama's campaign. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that...</b> Nobody likes a sore loser." [...] McCain said, [...] "I spent a period of time feeling sorry for myself. It's wonderful. It's one of the most enjoyable experiences that you can have. But the point is: You've got to move on ... I'm still a senator from the state of Arizona. I still have the privilege and honor of serving this country, which I've done all my life, and it's a great honor to do so." ...|$|E
2500|$|During this period, Tidwell {{would often}} return home from New York to Virginia Beach, to be [...] "rejuvenated" [...] and {{teach at the}} studio with his mother. [...] While still active in dance, Tidwell's career was losing focus, and his mother feared that he was losing his love for dance. That changed in late 2006 when the two went to see Tidwell's brother, Travis, perform in the So You Think You Can Dance tour in Madison Square Gardens. Travis had come in second place during the {{previous}} season, and was heavily featured in the touring show. His mother recalled, [...] "At Madison Square Garden, Danny {{looked at me with}} tears in his eyes and said, 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> My brother's up there on that stage, dancing and living, and I want to do that.'" [...] The following season he attended the show's open auditions in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|Owen said he grew {{up around}} [...] "a mob of entertaining, troublesome, fascinating" [...] actors {{involved}} in challenging the Lord Chamberlain during {{some of the most}} exciting days of a very controversial Royal Court Theatre. When he was at Highgate School, because his father was an actor, his teachers thought that {{he should be able to}} act, too. However, at first he was not interested. [...] "I was always made to read plays at school but I never wanted to. Then I was made to take part in a school play and I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> either but I started to get approval for my acting. I was reasonably academic, good at sport, but somehow with the acting, people said 'that was fantastic'. So I thought,'Ok, I'll carry on doing this for a bit and the next thing you know that's how I make my living these days".|$|E
50|$|After {{scoring a}} first half try, Greg Alexander {{performed}} a gymnastic backflip (Alexander {{claimed he had}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> {{during one of the}} English games but felt the timing hadn't been right given the circumstances with Australia under pressure due to their first test loss). The Kangaroos won the second test 34-10 against a much more committed French team at the Stade Gilbert Brutus in Perpignan.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{think you}} could," [...] {{said the girl}} gratefully. [...] "But now, if I left {{her when she was}} sick and {{depended}} on me, it would look wohse, yet--as if I did it because she was going to give her money to Mr. Landa's family.

2500|$|This band dynamic {{has played}} a role in their public image as well. Early in their career, the duo were {{frequently}} accused of lacking stage presence, said to be a deliberate reaction to the hyper-cheerful music of the time, demonstrated by bands such as Wham!. A typical early performance featured Lowe in the background playing the bassline on a Fairlight synthesiser keyboard and Tennant singing, but otherwise passive, in the foreground. Tennant and Lowe both became well known for standing still throughout performances. In a 2016 interview, Chris Lowe said the duo's live performances was a response to the music scene in the 1980s: [...] "Everyone was so active. It was a big party where everyone was having a great time and smiling at the camera. Thumbs aloft! We just didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> So we ignored the cameras and the jollity of the situations. Let’s face it, it’s easier to stand stock-still isn’t it?".|$|E
2500|$|Basically, they [...] {{wanted us}} to re-sign and do a new {{contract}} before our old one was done and we didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> We wanted to fulfil our original contract {{and then go on}} from there because {{there were a number of}} labels that were interested in working with us. [...] We were playing hardball back and forth with the label and that's why that record ... it was a difficult period for us. We were all pretty pissed off and angry and that shows in the music. Our budget got slashed for that record just because of the fact that we had not re-signed. I think it came down to [...] "Well, re-sign now or this is your budget because that's what is says in your contract." [...] You can't argue with that. We didn't re-sign. We didn't buckle under and I think it paid off in the end because we got what we wanted [...] We got everything that we wanted in our new record deal ... everything that we've worked ten fucking years for and deserve, we got. We learned how to play the game and we played it very well.|$|E
2500|$|Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton {{were mainly}} {{responsible}} for the single player campaign's story, while Chet Faliszek focused on the lines for GLaDOS in the cooperative campaign. Portal 2 was originally not intended to feature GLaDOS or Chell, the player-character from Portal. However, the demand {{for all of these}} to be implemented into Portal 2 was great enough that they chose to do so. Originally, the character Cave Johnson was intended to be the antagonist instead and Portal 2 to be a prequel. Before implementing Chell, they considered introducing a new player-character who would at one point inadvertently reactivate GLaDOS. During play testing, Wolpaw found that there were two groups that were [...] "at-odds": one group was excited to see GLaDOS return, while the other did not want to wake her up and questioned why players would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> As such, the character Wheatley was introduced, who inadvertently wakes GLaDOS while trying to escape the facilities with Chell. Wheatley and GLaDOS served as a contrasts to each other; where GLaDOS has a more [...] "computery-sounding" [...] voice due to her intelligence, Wheatley [...] "sounded perfectly human" [...] due to his lack of it. Play testers were also bothered {{by the fact that the}} new protagonist was not recognized by GLaDOS when she awoke; as such, they changed the new character back into Chell. Wolpaw and the designers were not sure what to do with GLaDOS and were wary to do the same thing as the last game. They felt that she should [...] "go someplace" [...] and that since GLaDOS is [...] "kind of likeable in the first game" [...] and players [...] "enjoy being with her", they would utilize Wheatley as an [...] "other, external threat". In the early part of the game, GLaDOS introduces each chamber and congratulates the player on completing it; though they could have included intermediate dialog from GLaDOS while the player attempts to solve each chamber, they found this would be distracting to players and limited her presence in the game to only these points.|$|E
5000|$|David Janollari, {{president}} of entertainment at The WB said in January 2006 that [...] "We'd love <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a Spike movie with Joss Whedon." [...] However {{he added that}} [...] "Joss Whedon is busy, fast becoming {{a kind of a}} big feature filmmaker. He's simply not available to us. But he knows, and you guys all know, the door is open any time <b>that</b> he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> for us <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> movie." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the same}} interview, Tryon also hinted {{that he had}} been {{initially}} considered to direct the film before Mulligan was hired for the job: [...] "It was all step-by-step up to the point of whether I was going to become a director or not. The picture got done mainly because the director who <b>did</b> it <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> property, and he was a known director; he was a known commodity." ...|$|R
5000|$|The musical {{tastes of}} the guys then evolved, first into hiphop and then electronics. Matt {{explains}} that [...] "when these bands came along incorporating electronics and rock, we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> too. We started a new group, and that's when Corey LeRue started performing with us." [...] LeRue was a Halifax-based DJ and producer, and his influence would be crucial {{to the development of}} the Neon Dreams sound.|$|R
