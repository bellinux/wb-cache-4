5|$|Genesis of the Daleks is {{the fourth}} serial of the twelfth season of the British science fiction {{television}} series Doctor <b>Who.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> written by Terry Nation and directed by David Maloney, and originally broadcast in six weekly parts from 8 March to 12 April 1975 on BBC1.|$|E
5|$|Henry went to {{convoluted}} legal {{means to}} justify his succession. Many Lancastrians asserted {{that his mother had}} had legitimate rights through her descent from Edmund Crouchback, <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> claimed was the elder son of Henry III of England, set aside due to deformity. As the great-grandson of Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, was the heir presumptive to Richard II and Henry used multiple rationales stressing his Plantagenet descent, divine grace, powerful friends, and Richard's misgovernment. In fact Mortimer never showed interest in the throne. The later marriage of his sister Anne to Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge consolidated this claim to the throne with that of the more junior House of York. Henry planned to resume war with France, but was plagued with financial problems, declining health and frequent rebellions. He defeated a Scottish invasion, a serious rebellion by Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland in the North and Owain Glyndŵr's rebellion in Wales. Many saw it as a punishment from God when Henry was later struck down with unknown but chronic illnesses.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September 1896, Victoria surpassed her {{grandfather}} George III as the longest-reigning monarch in English, Scottish, and British history. The Queen requested that any special celebrations be delayed until 1897, {{to coincide with}} her Diamond Jubilee, which was made a festival of the British Empire {{at the suggestion of}} Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain. The prime ministers of all the self-governing dominions were invited to London for the festivities. One reason for including the prime ministers of the dominions and excluding foreign heads of state was to avoid having to invite Victoria's grandson, Wilhelm II of Germany <b>who,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> feared, might cause trouble at the event.|$|E

25|$|Embezzlement is the {{unlawful}} taking of property by someone <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> entrusted to.

Again in 2006, plans by Muslim terrorists to destroy the Basilica were thwarted by Italian police. The terrorists claimed that a 15th-century fresco inside was insulting to Islam. The fresco, painted by Giovanni da Modena, depicts Muhammad in Hell being devoured by demons.|$|E

Munir Mizhar Sultan, Salim Mizhar Sultan and Saddam Mizhar Sultan were arrested in Hamrin, 55km north-east of Baqubah.

25|$|The Test Act of 1673 {{had driven}} all Catholics {{out of public}} office, and anti-Catholic {{feelings}} intensified {{in the years to}} come. Although she was not active in religious politics, in 1675 Catherine was criticised for supposedly supporting the idea of appointing a bishop to England <b>who,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> hoped, would resolve the internal disputes of Catholics. Critics also noted the fact that, despite orders to the contrary, English Catholics attended her private chapel.|$|E
25|$|During the Decian persecution, many Christians {{obtained}} signed statements (libelli) {{certifying that}} they had sacrificed to the Roman gods {{in order to avoid}} persecution or confiscation of property. When these lapsi later wished to once again be admitted to the Christian community, some of the lapsi presented a second libellus purported to bear the signature of some martyr or confessor <b>who,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> held, had the spiritual prestige to reaffirm individual Christians. Bishop Cyprian of Carthage insisted that none of the lapsi be admitted without sincere repentance.|$|E
25|$|Although Berengar had {{the support}} of the major Roman nobility and the Pope, he had enemies elsewhere. In 923, a {{combination}} of the Italian princes brought about the defeat of Berengar, again frustrating the hopes of a united Italy, followed by his assassination in 924. Then in 925 Theophylact of Tusculum and Alberic I of Spoleto also died; this meant that within the course of a year, three of Pope John’s key supporters had died, leaving John dangerously exposed to the ambitions of Theophylact’s daughter, Marozia, <b>who,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> said, resented John’s alleged affair with her mother Theodora.|$|E

25|$|Napoleon's {{original}} plan for 16 June {{was based on}} the assumption that the Coalition forces, who had been caught napping, would not attempt a risky forward concentration; and he intended therefore to push an advance guard as far as Gembloux, for the purpose of feeling for and warding off Blücher. To assist this operation the reserve would move at first to Fleurus to reinforce Grouchy, should he need assistance in driving back Blücher's troops; but, once in possession of Sombreffe, Napoleon would swing the reserve westwards and join Ney, <b>who,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> supposed, would have in the meantime mastered Quatre Bras.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a wooden}} {{model of the}} dome, showing its outer shell as hemispherical. When Michelangelo died in 1564, the {{building}} had reached {{the height of the}} drum. The architect who succeeded Michelangelo was Giacomo della Porta. The dome, as built, has a much steeper projection than the dome of the model. It is generally presumed that it was della Porta who made this change to the design, to lessen the outward thrust. But, in fact it is unknown <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that made this change, and it is equally possible and a stylistic likelihood that the person who decided upon the more dynamic outline was Michelangelo himself at some time during the years that he supervised the project.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{international}} {{awareness of the}} danger that Russian nuclear technology might {{fall into the hands}} of terrorists or rogue officers <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> feared might want to use nuclear weapons to threaten or attack other countries, the Federal government of the United States and many other countries provided considerable financial assistance to the Russian nuclear forces in the early 1990s. Many friendly countries gave huge amounts of money in lieu for Russian Arms purchase deals which kept Russian Agencies functioning. This money went in part to finance decommissioning of warheads under international agreements, such the Cooperative Threat Reduction programme, but also to improve security and personnel training in Russian nuclear facilities.|$|E

25|$|John Rhys-Davies was {{the first}} star of the series to leave, officially due to {{creative}} differences, although different stories circulate about the reasons behind it. While Rhys-Davies had been {{an outspoken critic of}} the show's writing since the first season, Fox supported him; only David Peckinpah, who was assigned to the show in its third season, wanted him out. Some sources suggest that he was fired for insulting a Fox executive at a party who was later promoted to a high-level position with control of several shows, including Sliders. Other sources claim that he was fired in order to make way for Kari Wührer, <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> felt would increase the show's ratings with teenage boys and young men.|$|E
25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew. He {{was a kind}} of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes and you knew <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E

The lukewarm response of the Congress was {{more than he could}} accept. Broken, tired and again opposed by Congress, he retired from the army in 1779 and returned to New Hampshire. Around this time, Sullivan was approached by British agents who tried to persuade him to switch sides. This was part of a concerted effort of approaches to other Generals such as Moses Hazen, Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold <b>who</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> believed were unhappy with their treatment by Congress and had lost their faith in the goal of American independence. It was a strategy with mixed results—but which produced the notable defection of Arnold.|$|E
