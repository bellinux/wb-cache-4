500|$|During {{the first}} half of its first season, Fringe staff and critics noted that the series was still trying to define itself and its characters. The writers worked on {{balancing}} serialized storytelling with standalone plots and had to contend with continuous rewrites and expensive last-minute reshoots. For them, [...] "Safe" [...] marked {{a turning point in the}} series. They turned David Robert Jones into a recurring character and began to give Olivia more of a personal life. Actor Lance Reddick, who portrays Agent Broyles, later explained in an interview how important the episode was to the evolution of the series, [...] "We found who we were in episode 10, the episode where Olivia got kidnapped... We were trying to hedge our bets and trying to be too many kinds of shows at once. I'm not saying <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the procedural element because each episode still is on a case – a case in terms of the quote-unquote police work — but it's not formulaic, not like the early episodes. What keeps the show most watchable is the fact that it is character-based." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charlie Bachman, in {{his first}} game as Michigan State's head coach, used a passing game to attempt a comeback. [...] The Spartans {{completed}} five of 18 passes for 74 yards. [...] The Wolverines completed one of four passes. [...] After the game, Bachman told reporters: [...] "I am pleased with the outcome of the game, despite the loss, because <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> that inferiority complex with Michigan. [...] My two sophomore backs [...] [...] [...] played as if they never heard of Michigan. [...] To them, Michigan was just another football team." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, several {{state legislatures}} passed new voting laws, {{especially}} pertaining to voter identification, with the stated purpose of combating voter fraud; the laws were attacked, however, by the Democratic Party as attempts to suppress voting among its supporters {{and to improve}} the Republican Party's presidential prospects. Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia's state legislatures approved measures to shorten early voting periods. Florida and Iowa barred all felons from voting. Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin state legislatures passed laws requiring voters to have government-issued IDs before they could cast their ballots. This meant, typically, that people without driver's licenses or passports had to gain new forms of ID. Obama, the NAACP, and the Democratic Party fought against {{many of the new}} state laws. Former President Bill Clinton denounced them, saying, [...] "There has never been in my lifetime, since <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the poll tax and all the Jim Crow burdens on voting, the determined effort to limit the franchise that we see today". He was referring to Jim Crow laws passed in southern states near {{the turn of the twentieth}} century that disenfranchised most blacks from voting and excluded them from the political process for more than six decades. Clinton said the moves would effectively disenfranchise core voter blocs that trend liberal, including college students, Blacks, and Latinos. Rolling Stone magazine criticized the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) for lobbying in states to bring about these laws, to [...] "solve" [...] a problem that does not exist. The Obama campaign fought against the Ohio law, pushing for a petition and statewide referendum to repeal it in time for the 2012 election.|$|E

6000|$|... "Neither did we. As {{soon as the}} men {{found their}} senses Mr. Wright {{brought a lot of}} them up here, an' <b>we</b> soon <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> Billings' friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank {{goodness}} <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> that idiot,' exclaimed the two elder. 'Now let us {{have some}} breakfast.' And they sat down by the roadside and began to eat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] I cried, [...] "the squire's a gentleman. And besides, if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the others, {{we should}} {{want you to}} help work the vessel home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{place is}} as good as any other. For the matter of that I like the Beargarden since <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> two or three not very charming characters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't worry, Dick, I am not minding it a bit. I am only glad <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> that {{intoxicated}} chauffeur. He {{might have}} gotten us into far more trouble than this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A Norman, is he? I thought <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the robbers! <b>We</b> want no robbers here! Scourge him soundly, Perron, {{and teach}} {{him how to}} stop my way!" ...|$|R
6000|$|My first {{inquiries}} {{were for}} the Count. Had <b>we</b> really <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> him? Yes--he had gone away by the afternoon train. Had he lunched, and if so, upon what? Entirely upon fruit-tart and cream. What a man! What a digestion! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You are right," [...] he said. [...] "It {{is three}} inches over the four feet. I {{fear that the}} bumping of the mizzen, before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> it, must have started a butt. She could hardly have made so much water from straining." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} very inconvenient, though," [...] said Harry, [...] "to put the whole {{apparition}} under a bell-glass: in fact, we have none big enough. Besides, suppose we were to find that by exhausting the air <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the object altogether, as is very possible, that would awkwardly interfere with the future prosecution of our researches into its nature and properties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and it will}} {{interfere}} with my business. Certainly we are better off than when the Spaniards were here; but the taxes are heavy, and things don't go as people expected they would when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the Spaniards. All the governments seem jealous of each other. I don't take any interest in these matters except so far as they {{interfere with}} trade. If every man would attend to his own affairs {{it would be better}} for us all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he said, [...] "never {{heard it}} before. But I {{was saying that}} after we had {{eliminated}} Death, and Food, and Change, <b>we</b> had practically <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> Events, and----" ...|$|R
6000|$|The youth {{laid his}} ear {{to the ground and}} at once reported: 'An old man is saying to his wife, [...] "Heaven be praised that <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> Moscione, for perhaps, when he has been out in the world a little, he may gain some common sense, and return home less of a fool than when he set out."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I felt sure," [...] said she, [...] "that <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> him, {{and that}} after this {{we would not be}} a party of thirteen. It does seem to me as if it is wicked to take such a {{creature}} back to civilized people. It's like carrying diseases about in your clothes, as people used to do in olden times." ...|$|R
60|$|After <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> Colonel No. 2, Marble and I {{continued}} our walk. We passed several {{persons of}} my acquaintance, {{but not one}} of them recognised me in my present attire. I was not sorry to see this, as I was wearied of my story, and could gladly remain in a species of incognito, for a few days. But, New York was comparatively a small town in 1804, and everybody knew almost everybody's face who was anybody. There was little real hope, therefore, of my escaping recognition for any great length of time.|$|E
60|$|The {{arrival of}} the {{carriages}} was the signal for the {{arrival of the}} rain. It poured as if it meant to pour all night. With the exception of the doctor, whose gig was waiting for him, the rest of the company went home snugly, under cover, in close carriages. I told Mr. Candy that I was afraid he would get wet through. He told me, in return, that he wondered I had arrived at my time of life, without knowing that a doctor's skin was waterproof. So he drove away in the rain, laughing over his own little joke; and so <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> our dinner company.|$|E
60|$|Dunning was in {{his library}} on the second floor, where he passed most of his evenings. His {{surprise}} was equal to that which my uncle had just experienced, when he saw us two standing before him. A significant gesture, however, caused him to grasp his friend and client's hand in silence; and nothing was said until the Swiss had left the room, although the fellow stood with the door in his hand a most inconvenient time, just {{to listen to what}} might pass between the host and his guests. At length <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> him, honest, well-meaning fellow that he was after all; and the door was closed.|$|E
6000|$|Ewbert had {{not thought}} of these points himself before, and he was pleased with his discovery, though {{afterwards}} {{he was aware that}} it was something like an intellectual juggle. [...] "You see," [...] he temporized, [...] "we have <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> two of the passions already, fear and greed, which are the potentialities of our unhappiest experience in this life. In fact, <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> three, for without fear and greed men cannot hate." ...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking of the {{rotation}} of Euromaidan activists he recalled {{the activities of the}} Ukrainian Insurgent Army or UPA: “In the 1940s and 1950s conditions in the underground were worse: people did not leave temporarily to go back to work, but because a comrade had gone forever. That is why we shall succeed!” He also commented: “We do not intend to halt after the regime has changed in Ukraine, when <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the rule of Yanukovych.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} her chiefly {{as she talked}} and wept upon the bridge below the old castle. <b>We</b> had <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> some amateurish reporters from Biarritz, and had walked together in the hot morning sunshine down through Port Luzon. There, for a time, we stood leaning on the parapet of the bridge and surveying the distant peeks, the rich blue masses of the Pyrenees. For a long time we said nothing, and then she began talking.|$|R
60|$|We left Bathurst {{more than}} ever {{convinced}} that the sooner <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the wretched station, miscalled a colony, the better. It still supplies hides from the tipper country, ivory, bees'-wax, and a little gold. The precious metal is found, they say, in the red clay hills near Macarthy's Island; but the quality is not pure, nor is the quantity sufficient to pay labour. The Mandengas, locally called 'gold strangers,' manage the traffic with the interior, probably the still mysterious range called the 'Kong Mountains.' They are armed with knives, sabres, and muskets; and for viaticum they carry rude rings of pure gold, which, I am told, are considered more valuable than the dust.|$|E
60|$|In {{the evening}} {{we had a}} dance. Cathy begged {{that he might be}} liberated then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and I was {{appointed}} to supply the deficiency. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> all gloom in the excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a trombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides singers. They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to hear them. After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs and glees. Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.|$|E
6000|$|... “As to attacking them by daylight,” he {{said when}} talking over the matter with Captain Crosbie and Stephen, “it would be {{altogether}} too desperate. Were this ship manned with English sailors I would do it without hesitation, and even with Chilians a good deal might be effected; but although the crew have gained greatly in discipline since <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the Portuguese, I could not count upon them. The Chilians had gradually gained experience and confidence in themselves, but our crew are altogether new to the work {{and could not be}} trusted to fight against such enormous odds. Still, by going up at night we might get in among their fleet unnoticed, and might even capture one or two vessels. At any rate, it would heighten their alarm even to know that we had got up through the channel into their midst.” ...|$|E
60|$|We believe it, I think, {{more firmly}} than our forefathers did {{five hundred years}} ago, on some points; and {{therefore}} <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> many dark and blasphemous superstitions about witches and devils, about the evil {{of the earth and}} of our own bodies, of marriage, and of the common duties and bonds of humanity, which tormented them, because they could not believe fully that Jesus Christ had created, and still ruled the world and all therein.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{believe him}} at the time; {{but a few days}} afterwards, I found out that the Feringhees were really marching from Allahabad. And when we killed the ladies, they were almost at the door. They fought like demons, and we know that the demons must all be on their side. Many times we went out to meet them, but in four {{separate}} battles they cut our men to pieces like sheep. At last, just after <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the ladies, they got to Cawnpore.|$|R
60|$|A full {{stomach is}} a great aid to poetry, and indeed no {{sentiment}} of any kind can stand upon an empty one. We have not time or inclination to indulge in fanciful troubles until <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> our real misfortunes. We do not sigh over dead dicky-birds with the bailiff in the house, {{and when we do}} not know where on earth to get our next shilling from, we do not worry as to whether our mistress' smiles are cold, or hot, or lukewarm, or anything else about them.|$|R
60|$|The {{scheme was}} very simple, though I {{do not think}} it was at all {{difficult}} of execution. The black-hole cells were beneath the prison, and we broke through the floor, into one of them, from our bay. A large mess-chest concealed the process, in the day-time. We worked in gangs of six, digging and passing up the dirt into the night-tubs. These tubs we were permitted to empty, every morning, in a tide's way, and thus <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the dirt. At the end of two months we had dug a passage, wide enough for two abreast, some twenty or thirty yards, and were nearly ready to come up to the surface. We now began to recruit, swearing in each man. On the whole, we had got about four hundred names, when the project was defeated, by that great enemy which destroys so many similar schemes, treachery. We were betrayed, as was supposed by one of our own number.|$|E
6000|$|... "'No {{sooner had}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> these birds, which occasioned us great annoyance, {{than we were}} terrified by the {{appearance}} of a fowl of another kind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs which I met in my former voyages; for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on your seraglio, oh, most Munificent of Caliphs. This terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive, but was fashioned entirely of belly, which was of a prodigious fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking substance, smooth, shining and striped with various colors. In its talons, the monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens, a house from which it had knocked off the roof, and in the interior of which we distinctly saw human beings, who, beyond doubt, were in a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which awaited them. We shouted with all our might, in the hope of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey, but it merely gave a snort or puff, as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand!'" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, {{this was}} viewing my {{relation}} to the Mertons in any point of view but that in which I wished it to be viewed, or indeed was just. Still it was natural; and the gentleman who spoke, a man of standing and character, no doubt fancied he was, saying that which must prove particularly acceptable to me; another proof how dangerous it is to attempt to decide on other men's feelings or affairs. I could not decline the discourse; and, while the Wallingford went slowly past the Gull, I was compelled to endure the torment of hearing the Mertons mentioned, again and again, in the hearing of Lucy and Grace; on the nerves of the latter of whom I knew {{it must be a}} severe trial. At length <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> this troublesome neighbour, though not until Lucy and her father were recognised and spoken to by several of the ladies in the other party. While my late guardian and his daughter were thus engaged, I stole a glance at my sister. She was pale as death, and seemed anxious to go below, whither I led her, most happily, I have every reason to think, as things turned out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our good friends, I hope," [...] said Zenobia, with {{an inspiring}} smile; [...] "but I have heard nothing about that yet. I {{am a little}} sorry about Lord Dudley, as I think they have drawn him into their mesh; but as for the other three, {{especially}} Huskisson and Lord Palmerston, I {{can tell you the}} Duke has never had a quiet moment since they joined him. We shall now begin to reign. The only mistake was ever to have admitted them. I think now <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> Liberalism for ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear UNCLE," [...] Helene exclaimed, [...] "you {{have arrived}} most opportunely. <b>We</b> have just <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> a few dinner people, {{and we are}} going on to Carmarthen House presently.

6000|$|Lady Bracknell. He {{seems to}} have had great {{confidence}} in the opinion of his physicians. I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice. And now that <b>we</b> have finally <b>got</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr. Worthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now holding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner? ...|$|R
