Standardization of St. John's <b>Wort</b> <b>extracts</b> has to cope with several factors that affect the phytochemical profile of the plant, with geographic location, seasonal variations and subspecies all being important. To address this issue, three different subspecies of Hypericum perforatum L. were profiled in relation to different maturation phases, evaluating the variations {{in the context of the}} major secondary metabolites from this plant. HPLC analysis indicated that H. perforatum subsp. perforatum is richer in secondary metabolites than the other subspecies, and that the three subspecies show a different profile during the developmental stages.

40|$|St. John's <b>Wort</b> herb <b>extracts</b> often contain {{undesirable}} or volitional polysaccharides. As polysaccharides exhibit structure-dependent biological {{functions in}} the present study water-soluble polysaccharides were extracted from herb material, fractionated by anion exchange chromatography into four main polysaccharide fractions (denominated as Hp 1, Hp 2, Hp 3 and Hp 4) and characterized by HPAEC-PAD, CE, IR and GC-MS. Biological activity on human skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts was assessed by investigation of their effect on proliferation, metabolism, cytotoxicity, apoptosis and differentiation. The underlying mechanisms were investigated in gene expression studies. Polysaccharide fraction Hp 1 was mainly composed of β-D-glucose. Hp 2, Hp 3 and Hp 4 contained pectic structures and arabinogalactan proteins varying in composition and quantity. Polysaccharides of Hp 1 induced the keratinocyte differentiation by inhibiting the gene expression of the epidermal growth factor and insulin receptor. While the collagen secretion of fibroblasts was stimulated by each polysaccharide fraction only Hp 1 stimulated the synthesis. The fibroblast proliferation was reduced by Hp 1 and increased by Hp 4. This effect was related to the influence on genes that referred to oxidative stress, metabolism, transcription processes and extracellular proteins.

40|$|Objectives The {{most widely}} applied {{qualitative}} and quantitative analytical methods in the quality control of Hypericum perforatum extracts will be reviewed, including routine analytical tools and most modern approaches. Key findings Biologically active components of H. perforatum are chemically diverse, therefore different chromatographic and detection methods are required for the comprehensive analysis of St. John’s <b>wort</b> <b>extracts.</b> Naphthodianthrones, phloroglucinols and flavonoids are the most widely analysed metabolites of this plant. For routine quality control, detection of major compounds belonging to these groups seem to be sufficient, however closer characterisation requires the detection of minor compounds as well. Conclusions TLC and HPTLC are basic methods in the routine analysis, whereas HPLC-DAD is the most widely applied method for quantitative analysis due to its versatility. LC-MS is gaining importance in pharmacokinetic studies due to its sensitivity. Modern approaches, such as DNA barcoding, NIRS and NMR metabolomics may offer new possibilities for the more detailed characterization of secondary metabolite profile of Hypericum perforatum extracts...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol-free beers {{are usually}} criticized for two major defects: {{a lack of}} fruity aroma and a strong worty flavor. 3 -Methylbutanal and 2 -methylbutanal are {{described}} in the literature as being predominantly responsible for the worty taste. Although detected in large amounts in most malt and <b>wort</b> <b>extracts,</b> both compounds have proven unable to confer worty taste to beers. In this work, we <b>extracted</b> volatiles from <b>wort</b> with a Likens-Nickerson microextractor. The resulting extract had a strong worty aroma. Following GC/MS and GC/olfactometry analysis, 3 -methylthiopropionaldehyde {{turned out to be}} the key feature since it remained the most organoleptically active compound through extract dilution. In vitro assays showed that 3 -methylthiopropionaldehyde is a substrate for several Saccharomyces cerevisiae reducing enzymes. Screening of various strains led us to conclude that the higher the 3 -methylbutanal reductase activity, the higher the 3 -methylthiopropionaldehyde reductase activity. Monitoring of 3 -methylthiopropionaldehyde concentration through an in vivo cold contact process has also been undertaken...|$|R

40|$|This {{study in}} mice {{investigated}} whether hyperforin {{accounts for the}} inductive effects on cytochrome P 4503 A enzymes of St. John’s <b>wort</b> <b>extracts</b> (SJW; Hypericum perforatum), {{one of the most}} popular herbal preparations because of its alleged activity in mild to moderate depression. A hydroalcoholic extract containing 4. 5 % hyperforin was given at a dose of 300 mg/kg, bis in die (b. i. d.), for 4 and 12 days. Hyperforin, its main phloroglucinol component, was given as dicyclohexylammonium (DCHA) salt (18. 1 mg/kg, b. i. d.) on the basis of its content in the extract, to ensure compa-rable exposure to hyperforin. The extract increased hepatic eryth-romycin-N-demethylase (ERND) activity, which is cytochrome P 450 enzyme (CYP) 3 A-dependent, about 2. 2 -fold after 4 days of dosing, with only slightly greater effect after 12 days (2. 8 times controls).

40|$|Aim The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review {{was to assess the}} quality and outcomes of clinical trials investigating the effect of St John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>wort</b> <b>extracts</b> on the metabolism of drugs by CYP 3 A. Methods Prospective clinical trials assessing the effect of St John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>wort</b> (SJW) <b>extracts</b> on metabolism by CYP 3 A were identified through computer-based searches (from their inception to May 2005) of Medline, Cinahl, PsycINFO, AMED, Current Contents and Embase, hand-searches of bibliographies of relevant papers and consultation with manufacturers and researchers in the field. Two reviewers selected trials for inclusion, independently extracted data and recorded details on study design. Results Thirty-one studies met the eligibility criteria. More than two-thirds of the studies employed a before-and-after design, less than one-third of the studies used a crossover design, and only three studies were double-blind and placebo controlled. In 12 studies the SJW extract had been assayed, and 14 studies stated the specific SJW extract used. Results from 26 studies, including all of the 19 studies that used high-dose hyperforin extracts (> 10 mg day(- 1)), had outcomes consistent with CYP 3 A induction. The three studies using low-dose hyperforin extracts (< 4 mg day(- 1)) demonstrated no significant effect on CYP 3 A. Conclusion There is reasonable evidence to suggest that high-dose hyperforin SJW extracts induce CYP 3 A. More studies are required to determine whether decreased CYP 3 A induction occurs after low-dose hyperforin extracts. Future studies should adopt study designs with a control phase or control group, identify the specific SJW extract employed and provide quantitative analyses of key constituents...|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to profile the major constituents of St John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>wort</b> <b>extracts</b> using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS). The objective was to simultaneously separate, identify and quantify hyperforin, hypericin, pseudohypericin, rutin, hyperoside, isoquercetrin, quercitrin and chlorogenic acid using HPLC-MS. Quantification was performed using an external standardisation method with reference standards. The method consisted of two protocols: one {{for the analysis of}} flavonoids and glycosides and the other for the analysis of the more lipophilic hypericins and hyperforin. Both protocols used a reverse phase Luna phenyl hexyl column. The separation of the flavonoids and glycosides was achieved within 35 min and that of the hypericins and hyperforin within 9 min. The linear response range in ESI-MS was established for each compound and all had linear regression coefficient values greater than 0. 97. Both protocols proved to be very specific for the constituents analysed. MS analysis showed no other signals within the analyte peaks. The method was robust and applicable to alcoholic tinctures, tablet/capsule extracts in various solvents and herb extracts.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the optimization procedure for the quantitative assay of naphthodianthrones in St. John's <b>Wort</b> dry <b>extract</b> by reversed phase liquid chromatography. Lately, a project for European Pharmacopoeia monograph including an HPLC assay for the active moieties in St. John's <b>Wort</b> dry <b>extract</b> was published {{with a view to}} provoking reactions from other researchers. We therefore decided to use different chemometric approaches to evaluate the influence of both analytical and preparative factors to demonstrate the robustness of the optimized method. An asymmetric screening design was built in order to evaluate the weight of each level for each factor – the sonication duration, the light exposure duration, the flow rate and the type of column – on the response: the total hypericin content. Considering the results so obtained, we were compelled to modify some parameters. Thus we built a screening design to apprehend the reliability of the new sample pre-treatment process, the interpretation and identification of active factors were performed according to various methods. We used a third chemometric approach: a sequential bifurcation to check out the method's robustness. In a second step, an eluent compatible with Mass Spectrometry detection was determined by a combined design. To cope with both separation and analysis time, desirability functions were used. Optimal conditions are finally given by ternary system at an optimized temperature (40 °C) and all the naphthodianthrones are separated in 10 min on conventional endcapped octadecyl silica gel column...|$|R

Pretreatment of tissues with atropine (0. 1 μM) abolished the stimulatory effect of Sw. Aq, suggesting that the spasmogenic effect of St. John’s wort is mediated possibly through muscarinic receptor activation. In the in-vivo studies, Sw.
