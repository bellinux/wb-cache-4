500|$|A {{group of}} rookie {{pitchers}} including Shelby Miller, Trevor Rosenthal, Kevin Siegrist, Carlos Martínez, Seth Maness and Michael Wacha proved {{key to the}} Cardinals' 2013 Central division title run. [...] Miller credited Molina's leadership behind the plate and preparation: [...] "Yadi knows everything about every single hitter, exactly what to throw. [...] If you execute your pitches and throw them <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> the ball, you're going to get hitters out, have a better ERA, win the game. [...] I seriously believe that all the success I've had is totally on him." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2013, filming was {{scheduled}} to take place at Shepperton Studios in London, United Kingdom, and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in 3D. Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June. She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created {{through a combination of}} CGI and motion capture, going on to say that [...] "You can't do any motion capture with a raccoon – they won't let you put the suit on. But we will do rotomation, probably, for some of the behavior... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be, the behavior and the performance. He's very clear on <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to take the characters." [...] In March 2013, Feige discussed Guardians of the Galaxy in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, [...] "It's much more of a standalone film. It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been {{on the other side of}} that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time." [...] Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space. In mid-March, Dave Bautista was signed to play Drax the Destroyer. Other actors who had been considered for the role included Isaiah Mustafa, Brian Patrick Wade and Jason Momoa. By the following week, sculptor Brian Muir, who sculpted Darth Vader's mask for the Star Wars films, was revealed to be working on the film.|$|E

2500|$|Burr is a {{lead role}} in the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton, which was written by playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda and {{inspired}} by historian Ron Chernow's 2004 biography of Hamilton. The role of Burr was originated by Leslie Odom, Jr., who won the 2016 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical {{for his work in}} the role. In Hamilton, Burr is both the main narrator of events as well as a sympathetic yet growing antagonist to Hamilton. He is portrayed as ambitious but indecisive, liking to smile and gladhand rather than make any strong commitment or action—something Hamilton constantly questions and calls him out on. Burr's prominent songs include [...] "Wait For It", which explains his willingness to wait for fate to decide his place and what he deserves, and [...] "The Room Where It Happens", which demonstrates his desire for more influence in decision making when he realizes waiting is not getting him <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to be. This puts him increasingly at odds with Hamilton, who views Burr as lacking morals or ideals and being willing to change positions for small gain. During the final duel, Burr is shown to have regret and sorrow for the duel and his role in Hamilton's death and his eventual villainous slant in history, rather than the more callous and dismissive regards records tend to show.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer was one {{of three}} MSU players to be invited to the NFL combine, along with QB Brian Hoyer and safety Otis Wiley. Ringer took part in Michigan State's 2009 NFL Pro Day at the Duffy Daugherty indoor facility. Ringer's shuttle time was 3.89, which was faster than the fastest time at the NFL combine. Ringer said of the workout, [...] "I think I did pretty well, {{especially}} coming back from my knee injury. I'm still not 100 percent, probably around 85 or 90. This is basically another big stepping stone from what I did at the combine. Now that I was able to do some training, I felt like my change of direction was superb. I feel like I did really well in the shuttle and in the three-cone drill." [...] He participated in an MSU-sponsored podcast after the event discussing the event. Ringer improved his forty time from a 4.59 at the combine to a 4.42 during Pro Days. When asked about <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to get drafted, Ringer responded, [...] "I'll go anywhere. To get picked up somewhere will be a blessing." [...] Ringer's performance at Pro Day [...] "absolutely blew NFL teams away", due to putting up impressive numbers while not fully recovered. With his draft stock on the rise, Ringer has worked out with several NFL teams, including the Denver Broncos, the Tennessee Titans and the San Diego Chargers. He has also drawn interest from the Seattle Seahawks. He has since received workouts from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Buffalo Bills, and the New York Jets. A website that predicts him as a 3rd to 4th rounder also compares him to Priest Holmes. Ringer stated about his knee right before the draft, [...] "My leg feels fine. Right now, I'll give it between 90-95%." [...] One site calls Ringer a [...] "willing, if undersized, workhorse", but also questions his durability. When talking about draft day, Ringer responded [...] "I'm not nervous at all. I'm just kind of really mellow, calm ... knowing that whatever happens is going to happen, and whatever team I go to, that's the team where I'm meant to be." [...] Mel Kiper said of Ringer [...] "He's only 5-9, 205, but he's remarkably strong, a good athlete and just a tough kid with great character. He blocks extremely well, and he'll be a very serviceable No. 2 back. He'll probably end up being a fourth- or fifth-round pick." [...] Ringer spent time with his family in Dayton, Ohio, on April 25 watching the draft and celebrating his mother's birthday, waiting to get selected.|$|E

6000|$|Deering agreed, but Jimmy {{thought he}} hesitated before he resumed: [...] "In some ways, the fellow's the {{standard}} type of highbrow Englishman. He's urbane and won't dispute; {{he smiles and}} lets you down. He wears the proper clothes and uses the proper talk. If you're his friend, he's charming; but that's not all the man. Stannard doesn't plunge; he calculates. He knows just <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to go and gets there. I guess if I was an obstacle, I'd pull out of his way. The man's fine, like tempered steel, and about as hard-- Well, the doctor stated you wanted quiet and I'll quit talking." ...|$|E

On reconsideration, I would suggest the substitution of a wire fencing-mask for the goggles. For days I looked at that whip. It fascinated me, and the fascination was composed mostly of fear. At my first attempt, Charmian and Nakata became afflicted with the same sort of fascination, {{and for a long time}} afterward, whenever they saw me reach for the whip, they closed their eyes and shielded their heads with their arms.|$|E
60|$|Cousin Feenix {{has come}} over from abroad, {{expressly}} {{to attend the}} marriage. Cousin Feenix was a man about town, forty years ago; {{but he is still}} so juvenile in figure and in manner, and so well got up, that strangers are amazed when they discover latent wrinkles in his lordship's face, and crows' feet in his eyes: and first observe him, not exactly certain when he walks across a room, of going quite straight to <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to go. But Cousin Feenix, getting up at half-past seven o'clock or so, is quite another thing from Cousin Feenix got up; and very dim, indeed, he looks, while being shaved at Long's Hotel, in Bond Street.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Jimmy {{declared}} with a {{touch of}} enthusiasm Laura saw was sincere. [...] "Mr. Stannard has all the qualities I'd like to cultivate. My habit, so to speak, is to shove along laboriously; he gets <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> without an effort. On the trains and steamers he gets for nothing things another couldn't buy, and at the hotel the waiters serve him first. People trust him and are keen about his society. He's urbane and polished, but when you go with him on the rocks you note his steely pluck. When I'm stuck and daunted he smiles, and somehow I get up the awkward slab. Besides, he stands for much I wanted but couldn't get until he helped." ...|$|E
60|$|B.'s intellect {{generally}} {{gives way}} about this point, and he becomes simply drivelling. He discovers trains that run from Munich to Heidelberg in fourteen minutes, {{by way of}} Venice and Geneva, with half-an-hour's interval for breakfast at Rome. He rushes {{up and down the}} book in pursuit of demon expresses that arrive at their destinations forty-seven minutes before they start, and leave again before they get there. He finds out, all by himself, {{that the only way to}} get from South Germany to Paris is to go to Calais, and then take the boat to Moscow. Before he has done with the timetable, he doesn't know whether he is in Europe, Asia, Africa, or America, nor <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to get to, nor why he wants to go there.|$|E
60|$|Horses scratch {{themselves}} by nibbling {{those parts of}} their bodies which they can reach with their teeth; but more commonly one horse shows another <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to be scratched, and they then nibble each other. A friend whose attention I had called to the subject, observed that when he rubbed his horse's neck, the animal protruded his head, uncovered his teeth, and moved his jaws, exactly as if nibbling another horse's neck, for he could never have nibbled his own neck. If a horse is much tickled, as when curry-combed, his wish to bite something becomes so intolerably strong, that he will clatter his teeth together, and though not vicious, bite his groom. At the same time from habit he closely depresses his ears, so as {{to protect them from}} being bitten, as if he were fighting with another horse.|$|E
