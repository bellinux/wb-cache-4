5|$|Having {{misunderstood}} {{the news}} about an upsurge of piracy in the Indian Ocean, Cartman excitedly tells his friends the classic era of piracy has returned, and asks the boys {{to join him in}} becoming a pirate in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> a responsibility-free life in a warm tropical paradise. Sensing an opportunity to get rid of Cartman once and for all, Kyle encourages him to go, even offering to help pay for his ticket. Although Butters, Ike, Clyde and Kevin are the only students who agree to join his crew, an undaunted Cartman uses his mother's credit card to book a trip to Somalia. After a long flight and a 49-hour bus ride, the boys arrive in Mogadishu dressed as stereotypical pirates. Once there, however, they are shocked to find themselves in a desolate land, the complete opposite of their expectations.|$|E

25|$|While {{it seemed}} {{baffling}} that a player of his quality {{was allowed to}} leave any Superleague team, Turner noted in 2012, had he not departed Irish shores, temporarily as it happened, {{he would never have}} enjoyed <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> his most enjoyable experience away from Ireland: winning the Swiss Division Two league title and MVP honors in 2004–05 with Vacallo.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the support he gave to bilingual education during his early career, his book attacks <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> obstacles to assimilation, such as bilingual education, and urges Hispanics to eschew government solutions and adopt instead the cultural values that have made previous generations of American immigrants prosperous and successful. His view is that Hispanics will soon make up 25% {{of the population of}} the United States and that their failure to excel would be tragic for them and the nation.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Baskerville {{states that}} laws {{establishing}} no-fault divorce {{can be seen}} as one of the boldest social experiments in modern history that have effectively ended marriage as a legal contract. He states that {{it is not possible to}} form a binding agreement to create a family, adding that government officials can, at the request of one spouse, end a marriage over the objection of the other. He states that no-fault divorce has left fathers with no protection against <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> the confiscation of their children.|$|E

Like most members of PAC, he is opposed to the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Fallas has also expressed an interest in rural poverty in Costa Rica and Central America.

Fallas says he is sensitive to the middle class, workforce development, and social programs.|$|E
25|$|Authors Anthony A. Hoekema, Ron Rhodes and Alan W. Gomes claim Jehovah's Witnesses is a {{religious}} cult. Hoekema bases his judgment {{on a range of}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> general characteristics of a cult, including the tendency to elevate peripheral teachings (such as door-to-door preaching) to great prominence, extra-scriptural source of authority (Hoekema highlights Watch Tower teachings that the Bible may be understood only as it is interpreted by the Governing Body), a view of the group as the exclusive community of the saved (Watch Tower publications teach that Witnesses alone are God's people and only they will survive Armageddon) and the group's central role in eschatology (Hoekema says Witness publications claim the group was called into existence by God to fill in a gap in the truth neglected by existing churches, marking the climax of sacred history).|$|E

25|$|For Grayling, work on {{technical}} problems {{is only one}} aspect of philosophy. Another aspect, one which has been at the centre of philosophy's place in history, has more immediate application to daily life: the questions of ethics, which revolve upon what Grayling calls the great Socratic question, 'How should one live?'. In pursuit of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> 'contributing to the conversation society has with itself about possibilities for good lives in good societies.' Grayling writes widely on contemporary issues, including war crimes, the legalisation of drugs, euthanasia, secularism, and human rights. He has articulated positions on humanist ethics and on the history and nature of concepts of liberty as applied in civic life. In support of his belief that the philosopher should engage in public debate, he brings these philosophical perspectives to issues of the day in his work as a writer and as a commentator on radio and television.|$|E

All you can see is these glowing teeth." [...] Borland's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series Babylon 5.|$|E
500|$|Goffman’s {{key idea}} is that most {{conversation}} is simply a replaying of a strip – <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> a personal experience or event. When we talk with others, the speaker’s goal is often always the same, to provide “evidence for the fairness or unfairness of his current situation and other grounds for sympathy, approval, exoneration, understanding, or amusement. And what his listeners are primarily obliged {{to do is to}} show some kind of audience appreciation." [...] Essentially, through interaction, we are only looking to be heard, not inspire any kind of action but simply to know that someone listened and understood. This is why often a simple head nod or grunt is accepted as an appropriate response in conversation.|$|E
