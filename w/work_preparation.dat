50|$|The Miss Slovensko {{beauty pageant}} {{begins with a}} media {{campaign}} to announce the annual contest process. The application forms are published in selected print media for several weeks running and must be submitted by applicants with a photo showing both face and body to the FORZA Production House. Potential contestants must: be single, have no children, be {{a citizen of the}} Slovak Republic, be over 170 cm tall and {{on the day of the}} contest finale, they must be between the ages of 18 and 24. On the basis of these criteria, the girls are divided into regional casting sections. Each year, finalists go through a complex preparation process for the beauty contest. In addition to individual <b>work,</b> <b>preparation</b> includes two, week-long training sessions. These two sessions are devoted primarily to choreography and voice training for the girls. For these girls who are competing to be the most beautiful Slovak woman, the most interesting part is working with renowned experts in cosmetics, make-up, and hair styling. In the end, every detail can play a role in the beauty pageant itself. During this preparatory period, contestants go through their first costume and accessory fittings, rehearsals of choreography for the final evening and work with a speech and diction coach. The climax of the annual MISS Slovakia contest is the grand finale shown live on TV JOJ. Each year, finalists’ rewards include contracts with an agency, automobiles, exotic vacations and eventual nomination to prestigious international beauty contests, such as Miss World, Miss International, and Miss Europe.|$|E

This study aims {{to reveal}} {{the effects of the}} <b>work</b> <b>preparation</b> and {{coaching}} system for mechanical engineering students of the Engineering Faculty of the Yogyakarta State University on the 3 rd Machinery Practicum. This study was a classroom action research study. The population comprised all the students and the sample consisted of 19 3 rd semester students. The data were collected through questionnaires, observations, and documents and analyzed by quantitative and qualitative descriptive techniques. The results are as follows. 1) The <b>work</b> <b>preparation</b> and coaching system ran well and was conducted in 10 weeks (2 cycles). The <b>work</b> <b>preparation</b> was made by the students before the class started. They consulted the lecturer 10 minutes before. The coaching was effective if it was carried out every 30 minutes since that class started. 2) The students passed this practicum if they obtained a score of 78. 15 and successfully finished 5 of 7 jobs. 3) The process ran well and the students showed a good attitude towards work and worked seriously.

40|$|Economist Edmund Phelps {{argues that}} second-class workers should be helped through wage {{subsidies}} to employers. This {{is because the}} lack of work among such workers has social costs that could be significantly curtailed by these subsidies. I argue that Phelps’ analysis is questionable because of his misapplication of the tools of welfare economics. I also suggest that a basic income might be a more efficient means of addressing poverty than wage subsidies would be. In recent years social policy has intensified efforts to provide able-bodied recipients of benefits with an incentive to sell their labor. This is most evident in the welfare reform proposal {{signed into law by}} President Clinton in 1996. This reform stipulates that states cannot use federal funds to provide benefits {{for more than five years}} over one’s lifetime or more than two years per “spell ” on welfare. Also, states must require recipients to work or engage in some type of <b>work</b> <b>preparation</b> activity in return for their benefits. This requirement was also a provision of the welfare reform law of 1988, the Family Support Act, but the required hours of work or <b>work</b> <b>preparation</b> wer...|$|E

40|$|The cost {{of turning}} on NC-lathes is {{substantially}} sensative to cutting conditions. The use of optimum cutting conditions {{is limited by}} {{a large number of}} constraining factors such as chip disposal, chucking possibility, available power, required accuracy etc. The present way of <b>work</b> <b>preparation,</b> even when using the available workpiece programming systems, does hardly allow of generating acceptable values for the cutting variables. Moreover, the combination of geometrical and a technological processor in one workpiece programming system will save substantial time in <b>work</b> <b>preparation.</b> Starting from a former reported development, this article deals with the development of a technological processor of improved design and extended possibilities, as for instance the handling of the chucking problem, {{as a part of a}} complete workpiece programming system. At choice the output of this processor may be presented in graphes, showing the limited working area and indicating the preferential working point. Another feature is the possibility of automatic tool selection by comparing the working area of the machine tool with the working areas of the different potential tools. The overall system design is modular and well structured to further portability and flexibility...|$|E
