She was a nationally ranked junior tennis player, played {{football}} (soccer) {{in her hometown}} team Bro IK, and <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> skier that {{the coach of the}} Swedish national ski team suggested the family move to northern Sweden to improve her skiing year round.|$|E
25|$|His {{continued}} unpaid {{promotion of}} Eastern Air Lines {{earned him the}} undying gratitude of good friend Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace who {{was the president of}} the airline. He <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> friend of the airline that Rickenbacker took a retiring Douglas DC-3, fitted it out with an executive interior and DC-4 engines, and presented it to Godfrey, who then used it to commute to the studios in New York City from his huge Leesburg, Virginia, farm every Sunday night.|$|E
25|$|Every day {{she begged}} {{to be able}} to enter a temple and become a nun instead of marrying. Her father {{eventually}} allowed her to work in the temple, but asked the monks to give her the toughest chores in order to discourage her. The monks forced Miaoshan to work all day and all night while others slept in order to finish her work. However, she <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> person that the animals living around the temple began to help her with her chores. Her father, seeing this, became so frustrated that he attempted to burn down the temple. Miaoshan put out the fire with her bare hands and suffered no burns. Now struck with fear, her father ordered her to be put to death.|$|E

500|$|Recasner <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{free throw}} shooter that once in 1998 during {{the midst of}} a 36 {{consecutive}} successful free throw streak he was fouled in a two-shot foul situation with his team down by three points and 2.3 seconds left. [...] His team needed him to make the first and miss the second, but he was unable to miss.|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{appreciation}} of his work, many of Glicken's associates considered him eccentric and highly disorganized. Chatty, noted for being extremely sensitive, Glicken also paid meticulous attention to detail. One {{of his friends}} writes, [...] "Harry was a character his whole life.... Everyone who knew him was amazed he <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> scientist." [...] Regarding Glicken's driving habits, the same acquaintance describes him as [...] "a cartoon character" [...] who [...] "would drive at full speed down the road, talking about whatever was important to him, and... come to a four-way stoplight and he'd sail through it, never knowing he'd just gone through".|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} seventh win {{of the season in}} front of 90,000 who attended the race. Johnson also earned $267,001 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "I guess {{it could have been a}} statement we were sending. There was a lot of pressure. All week long, we wondered if we could step up like we did today. I'm very proud how we rose to the occasion.", he continued, [...] "When I go home tonight, I'm going to be (mentally) driving laps, what I think I need to do in qualifying trim so I can put my best effort in on Friday. Same thing for race practice on Saturday, and go racing Sunday. Texas <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> lesson. And I hope that the points we lost in Texas isn't what keeps us from winning this championship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not, but I'm not {{speaking}} from {{his point of}} view." [...] Nash was perfectly lucid. [...] "Moreover, I thought you just now said it would <b>be</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing for her." ...|$|R

50|$|Because water <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> solvent, {{it almost}} always has some solute {{dissolved}} in it, often a salt. If water has even a tiny amount of <b>such</b> <b>an</b> impurity, {{then it can}} conduct electricity far more readily.|$|R
500|$|David Duchovny {{initially}} suggested {{having a}} Walter Skinner-centric episode {{as a way}} to give himself a break, although ultimately he still ended up having a large part in the episode. Duchovny felt that Skinner was a good character who was not utilized to his full extent on the show. Duchovny's idea, which was written in collaboration with writer Howard Gordon, also surrounded the conceit that what Mulder and Skinner do comes with a tremendous price. Skinner's popularity amongst fans had risen with his increased role in the episodes [...] "The Blessing Way" [...] and [...] "Paper Clip" [...] and these episodes helped re-establish the ground rules regarding where Skinner stood in regards to the X-Files. Writer Vince Gilligan noted that Skinner was originally intended to be a bad guy, but because Mitch Pileggi <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> actor the writers decided to not take his character in that direction.|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{was born}} 7 October 1762 in Canterbury to John Abbott, a barber, {{and his wife}} Alice. Abbot lived in a [...] "small, mean-looking house" [...] near the Cathedral, and was {{initially}} educated at a dame school. During his childhood he was noted as [...] "industrious, apprehensive, regular and correct in all his conduct". He attended The King's School, Canterbury, from 1769, where he <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> student that he received an exhibition scholarship on his matriculation at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in March 1781. At the time {{there were only two}} awards at Oxford: the Chancellor's medals for English and Latin prose. After an initial attempt to win them which failed, he won the Latin prize in his second year and the English prize in the third. Abbot was then elected a fellow of Corpus Christi where, acting as a tutor to the son of Sir Francis Buller, he first considered becoming a barrister. On 16 November 1787 he {{became a member of the}} Middle Temple, transferring to the Inner Temple in 1793, and worked for two years under Sir George Wood as a special pleader; it was said that he had finished his work as a special pleader faster than [...] "any man before or since". He was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1796.|$|E

5000|$|Infinite Hollywood {{reviewed}} the film for Halloween 2011, [...] "This movie <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> concept, horribly wasted. The dialogue isn't so badly written (with a few notable exceptions), but spoken by these stiffs it comes across horribly".|$|R

2500|$|The {{location}} of Moore's grave is not known. His grandson, John, said: [...] "The odd {{thing is that}} my father <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> story-teller but he couldn't or wouldn't tell me where my grandfather was buried. It was {{if there was some}} unfinished business, some sort of mix-up, something I never understood. It's a mystery." [...] Moore believes the site may be near the Welsh Harp reservoir – also known as Brent Reservoir – in north London. By chance, what {{is believed to have been}} the first cycle race in Britain took place at the Welsh Harp the day after Moore won in the Parc de St-Cloud. The race was won by Arthur Markham, who for many years had a bicycle shop nearby at 345 Edgware Road.|$|E
2500|$|Turner was big for his day ( [...] , [...] ); however, he {{was smart}} and very fast. Turner later boasted about his talent as a blocker: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> blocker, that the men they {{put in front of}} me – and some were stars who were {{supposed}} to be making a lot of tackles – they would have their coaches saying, 'why ain't you making any tackles?' they'd say, 'that bum Turner is holding.' Well that wasn't true[...] [...] [...] I could handle anybody that they'd put in front of me." [...] According to George Halas, Turner was [...] "perhaps the smartest player" [...] he had in 40 years as the Bears' coach, a player who [...] "knew every assignment for every player on every player." [...] Teammate George Musso once said of Turner, [...] "Who knows what kind of player he would have been if he ever got to rest during a game?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The role of DS Ellie Miller was {{the second}} role cast. Producer Jane Featherstone first {{suggested}} Olivia Colman {{for the role of}} Ellie Miller, to which Chibnall (having also had her in mind) immediately agreed. Chibnall then specifically wrote the role of Ellie Miller for Colman, hoping she would agree to join the cast. Colman remained Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and there was consensus among the producers to offer the job to her without the need for an audition. Colman says she was immediately drawn to the role: [...] "From the off I really liked the idea of the story, a hard story and an upsetting one, but I liked the idea of a whole community being affected by something and I liked the character of Ellie. ... And I liked Ellie. I find it hard to play a character if I can't feel any of me in them. Especially {{if you are going to}} be playing that person through the whole series you need to feel that connection." [...] She was also highly impressed with the script she read, calling the script one she [...] "couldn't put down" [...] and that she turned the pages [...] "frantically" [...] because it <b>was</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> read. Colman says she also had heard that David Tennant and actress Vicky McClure were under consideration for roles as well, and she wanted very much to work with them. She accepted the role immediately after reading the script.|$|E
