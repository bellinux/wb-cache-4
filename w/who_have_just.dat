5|$|Using {{the power}} of a {{powerful}} substance known as aer, mankind is in an age of discovery and prosperity. The crystallized form of aer, which is known as Apatheia, {{is considered to be a}} very powerful energy source as it is essential to human life. To protect towns from attacks by monsters, large amounts of Apatheia are being produced to create barriers around towns. One day, in a forest near the town of Shizontania, Yuri Lowell and Flynn Scifo, two knights <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> joined the Niren Corps, together with two of their senior knights and fellow Corps members, Hisca and Chastel, are sent on a mission to investigate an abnormal gushing of aer in the area.|$|E

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} production team IKIOI. It opens with a birds-eye view shot from the ground, showing several buildings and trees; just before the first verse, a short shot of Amuro is seen. The first verse opens with Amuro walking down a street in Los Angeles, California, singing to the track. During the verse, intercut scenes include various shadows of children holding instruments behind Amuro. The chorus opens with Amuro walking down along a bridge with the children playing their instruments behind her. When the second chorus starts, the camera pans over to several buildings and landscapes around Los Angeles. The camera then pans into several individuals citizens in the city: an elderly couple, {{a man in his}} car, a couple <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> finished surfing, and a woman walking her dog.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Walt's partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) has just shot Gale {{to death on}} orders from Walt to foil Gus' plot to kill and replace them. Gus' henchman Victor (Jeremiah Bitsui) arrives at Gale's {{apartment}} and finds him dead, surrounded by neighbors <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> called the police. Victor finds a stunned Jesse sitting in his car outside and forces him at gunpoint {{to return to the}} meth lab, where Gus' employee Mike (Jonathan Banks) is holding Walt hostage. Mike, who is concerned that Victor was seen by bystanders at the murder scene, calls to inform Gus of the events. Victor, who has often watched Walt work, starts cooking meth himself to prove they do not need him or Jesse. Walt grows concerned when Victor proves better at the process than he expected.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a long shot {{of a group of}} dancers <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> {{finished}} rehearsing a dance routine. As the dancers walk out of view, Rihanna walks onto the middle of the floor, where the singer turns, and faces the camera, and closes her eyes. Standing still, Rihanna begins to click her fingers, whereby the screen begins to cut between a scene of Rihanna, who is noticeably in a different setting, and black fades. As the song's audio begins to play, it becomes apparent that the setting has changed from a rehearsal studio into a nightclub, which Rihanna in the centre. The scene is fairly dark with different colour lights projected into different areas of the nightclub, as dancers infiltrate the dance floor surrounding Rihanna. This scene is used for the first verse-chorus-verse part of the song, but changes to a scene of Rihanna, accompanied by several dancers, situated in a gym locker room for the second chorus. For the bridge, the scene changes back to Rihanna in the nightclub, but this time in a different change of attire. This scene is used for the final chorus. The video ends with a close-up of Rihanna in the nightclub standing still as the audio finishes, where she closes her eyes, which prompts the scene to change back to Rihanna {{in the middle of the}} rehearsal studio from the beginning of the video, to which she walks out of view of the camera.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{the level}} of players has been defined using kyu and dan ranks. Kyu ranks are {{considered}} student ranks. Dan ranks are considered master ranks. Beginners <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> learned {{the rules of the}} game are usually around 30th kyu. As they progress, they advance numerically downwards through the kyu grades. The best kyu grade attainable is therefore 1st kyu. If players progress beyond 1st kyu, they will receive the rank of 1st dan, and from thereon will move numerically upwards through the dan ranks. In martial arts, 1st dan is the equivalent of a black belt. The very best players may achieve a professional dan rank.|$|E

In Japan, many of the larger companies {{as well as some of}} the ministries still offer to their newly graduated freshmen a room in a dormitory. A room in such a dormitory often comes with a communal cook (for the men) or rooms with furnished kitchen blocks (for the women). Usually the employees pay a very small amount of money to enable the men (especially) to save money to buy a house when they get married.|$|E

25|$|The {{lifetime}} prevalence, or {{the proportion}} of individuals expected to stutter at one time in their lives, is about 5%, and overall males are affected two to five times more often than females. However, {{there is not much}} information known about the underlying cause for such a skewed sex ratio. Most stuttering begins in early childhood, and studies suggest that 2.5% of {{children under the age of}} 5 stutter. As seen in children <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> begun stuttering, there is an equivalent number of boys and girls who stutter. Still, the sex ratio appears to widen as children grow: among preschoolers, boys who stutter outnumber girls who stutter by about a two to one ratio, or less. This ratio widens to three to one during first grade, and five to one during fifth grade, as girls have higher recovery rates. Due to high (approximately 65–75%) rates of early recovery, the overall prevalence of stuttering is generally considered to be approximately 1%.|$|E
25|$|Since November 2009, 14 deaths as {{a result}} of swine flu in Northern Ireland have been reported. The {{majority}} of the victims were reported to have pre-existing health conditions which had lowered their immunity. This closely corresponds to the 19 patients who had died in the year prior due to swine flu, where 18 of the 19 were determined to have lowered immune systems. Because of this, many mothers <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> given birth are strongly encouraged to get a flu shot because their immune systems are vulnerable. Also, studies have shown that people between the ages of 15 and 44 have the highest rate of infection. Although most people now recover, having any conditions that lower one's immune system increases the risk of having the flu become potentially lethal. In Northern Ireland now, approximately 56% of all people under 65 who are entitled to the vaccine have gotten the shot, and the outbreak is said to be under control.|$|E

500|$|The Word for World is Forest begins {{from the}} point of view of Captain Davidson, who is the {{commander}} of a logging camp named Smith camp.

The novel begins with Davidson travelling to [...] "Centralville", the headquarters of the colony, hoping to have a sexual encounter with one of a number of women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> arrived on the predominantly male colony. When Davidson returns to Smith Camp, he finds the entire camp burned to the ground, and all of the humans dead. He lands to investigate, and while on the ground is overpowered by four Athsheans. He recognizes one of them as Selver, an Athshean who was a personal servant at the headquarters of the colony, and later an assistant to Raj Lyubov, the colony anthropologist. A few months prior to the attack, Davidson had raped Selver's wife Thele, who died in the process, prompting an enraged Selver to attack Davidson. Davidson nearly kills him, before he is rescued by Lyubov; however, he is left with prominent facial scars, which render him easily recognizable. The Athsheans allow Davidson to leave and carry a message about the destruction of the camp back to the colony headquarters.|$|E

They find Carver's stealth ship, which has been built with stolen stealth material, in Ha Long Bay, and board it to prevent him from firing the stolen British cruise missile at Beijing. During the attempt, Wai Lin is captured, forcing Bond to devise a second plan. Bond captures Gupta to use as his own hostage, but Carver kills Gupta, claiming he has [...] "outlived his contract." [...] Bond detonates an explosive which damages the ship, causing it to be visible to radar to both Chinese and British navies, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> been warned of the plot, and thus making it vulnerable to a subsequent Royal Navy attack by HMS Bedford. While Wai Lin disables the engines, and is captured by Stamper, Bond attempts to halt the missile. After killing Carver with his own sea drill, Bond attempts to destroy the warhead with detonators, but Stamper appears and attacks him after sending Wai Lin into the water, bound in chains. Bond traps Stamper in the missile firing mechanism and dives to save Wai Lin as the missile explodes, destroying the ship and killing Stamper. Later, Bond and Wai Lin share a romantic moment amidst the wreckage as the Bedford searches for them.|$|E
