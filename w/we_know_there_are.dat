2500|$|MEMRI {{argues that}} they are quoting the government-controlled press and not obscure or extremist publications, a fact their critics acknowledge, {{according}} to Marc Perelman: [...] "When we quote Al-Ahram in Egypt, {{it is as if}} we were quoting The New York Times. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> people questioning our work, probably those who have difficulties seeing the truth.

He appeared at Bath and at Cheltenham, where, as <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many old Indians.

6000|$|One of {{the most}} {{misleading}} of words is that of [...] "aborigines." [...] Its use dates from {{the time when the}} cosmogony was thought to be young and life to be of very recent appearance. Its usual meaning seems to be derived from the supposition that nations disseminated themselves like colonists from a common centre about four thousand years, say 120 generations ago, and thenceforward occupied their lands undisturbed until the very recent historic period with which the narrator deals, when some invading host drove out the [...] "aborigines." [...] This idyllic view of the march of events is contradicted by ancient sepulchral remains, by language, and by the habits of those modern barbarians whose history <b>we</b> <b>know.</b> <b>There</b> <b>are</b> probably hardly any spots on the earth that have not, within the last few thousand years, been tenanted by very different races; none hardly that have not been tenanted by very different tribes having the character of at least sub-races.|$|E

"'Tis {{a mighty}} fleet," [...] Sir John said; [...] "and {{the worst of}} it is that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more to follow; still, I doubt not we shall send them back defeated. Our defences are all complete; our recent peace with Egypt has enabled us to fill up our {{magazines}} with provisions of all kinds; the inhabitants of the Island have had ample warning to move into the town, carrying with them everything of value; so the Turks will obtain but little plunder, and will be able to gather no means of subsistence on the island, as every animal has been driven within the walls, and even the unripe corn has been reaped and brought in. However long the siege lasts, we need be in no fear of being reduced to sore straits for food. Look over there. There is a small craft under sail, and it comes not from the direction of Phineka. See! one of the Turkish galleys has separated from the rest and is making off in that direction. It may be that the little craft contains one or two of our comrades who are late in coming to join us." ...|$|E
60|$|As marriage, therefore, {{is rooted}} in an {{aboriginal}} unity of instincts, you cannot compare it, even in its quarrels, {{with any of the}} mere collisions of separate institutions. You could compare it with the emancipation of negroes from planters&mdash;if it were true that a white man in early youth always dreamed of the abstract beauty of a black man. You could compare it with the revolt of tenants against a landlord&mdash;if it were true that young landlords wrote sonnets to invisible tenants. You could compare it to the fighting policy of the Fenians&mdash;if it were true that every normal Irishman wanted an Englishman to come and live with him. But as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no instincts in any of these directions, these analogies are not only false but false on the cardinal fact. I do not speak of the comparative comfort or merit of these different things: I say they are different. It may be that love turned to hate is terribly common in sexual matters: it may be that hate turned to love is not uncommon in the rivalries of race or class. But any philosophy about the sexes that begins with anything but the mutual attraction of the sexes, begins with a fallacy; and all its historical comparisons are as irrelevant and impertinent as puns.|$|E
