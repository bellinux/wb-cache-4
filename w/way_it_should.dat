25|$|It is {{nonsensical}} and counter-intuitive {{to believe}} that Nature (or God) created human life only {{to allow it to}} end after a definite period of time. A human being must be able to live indefinitely, or to put it in another <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not be allowed to die through ageing. There must be something inside us, that can be modified (perhaps at conception) that will shift the entire death pathway into another, parallel pathway, that will have no predetermined end. This ‘something’ is in fact, the evolutionary impetus to achieve higher levels of complexity in the quickest way possible. There should be a way to enhance this process and accelerate our transition from the process of evolution by natural selection to a post-Darwinian, transhumanist domain where indefinite life-spans are the norm.|$|E

IGN contributor Robert Canning {{felt that}} the episode [...] "didn't have the same comedic appeal" [...] as [...] "Klaus and Greta", but did say there were [...] "some funny moments to be sure", but overall the episode lacked. He commented that the main plot had its faults, but that the weak link in the story was Cheyenne Jackson's Danny. He wrote that the Sue character had been great in the past, but that her [...] "expanded role" [...] in this episode was less successful. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff wrote that [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] was [...] "dead in spots. I mean, I laughed out loud a number of times, {{but not nearly as}} much". He noted he liked Liz and Jack battling over Danny, but [...] "something about it never landed in the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> have", and opined that the show {{did not know what to}} do with Jackson. Overall, he gave the episode a B rating. Sean Gandert for Paste {{felt that the}} Liz, Jack, and Danny plot was less interesting [...] "and in general pretty meh."

500|$|Asmussen {{said that}} one of the {{greatest}} challenges in developing God of War III for the PlayStation 3 was the [...] "complexity of everything"; individual tasks, such as designing Helios' decapitation, could take a year because the [...] "level of detail [...] expected [...] so high and intricate, it [...] multiple departments." [...] He said that the PlayStation 3's hardware capabilities allowed more flexibility in character creation and interaction with the environment. The character model for Kratos in the PlayStation 2 (PS2) games used about 5,000 polygons; the PS3 model was about 20,000 – a high number, but less than that used by other models such as Nathan Drake in , who used 35,000. Ken Feldman, the art director, commented that the polygon count was not the only factor, and cited the increased texture detail as {{one of the reasons for}} Kratos's realistic appearance. The developers used a new technique called blended normal mapping to add realism to the basic model and hugely enhance the range of animation available (e.g., muscle movement, including visible veins, and facial animations). All of the main protagonists were animated by hand because the animators produced more effective work than basic motion capture, though the voice actors' facial movements were recorded by Image Metrics's performance capture system. For animating things like hair, the animators created a secondary animation code, known as Dynamic Simulation, which allows the PS3 itself to mathematically calculate the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> look; it accurately generates motion that previously took the animators long hours to replicate.|$|E

500|$|Casino Royale reboots the series, {{establishing}} a new timeline and narrative framework {{not meant to}} precede or succeed any previous Bond film. Barbara Broccoli stated that [...] "For years, my father wanted to make Casino Royale—it's the Holy Grail...

Wilson agreed, commenting [...] "We felt the last film was too fantastical, so we {{decided to go back to}} the basics and update". Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay at the end of February 2004, while Pierce Brosnan was still Bond. Paul Haggis was brought in later, and his main contribution included rewriting the climax of the film. He explained that [...] "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that Vesper [...] had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her". In February 2005 Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director and the next Bond film was revealed to be Casino Royale, although the identity of the new Bond was still unknown; the producers had chosen not to renew Pierce Brosnan's contract, and in October Eon announced that the part of Bond would be taken by Daniel Craig.|$|E

500|$|The Book of Lucifer {{contains}} a long chapter titled [...] "Satanic Sex", discussing Satanism's view on sexual activity {{as well as}} misconceptions surrounding these views. He denies the belief that sex {{is the most important}} element in LaVeyan Satanism, and that participation in orgies or other promiscuous behavior is forced. He explains that sexual freedom is encouraged, but only in the sense that believers should be free to explore their own sexualities as they please, without harming others. Along with the rumors regarding Satanic views on sex, LaVey also addresses those about animal and human sacrifice. He explains that the only time a LaVeyan Satanist would perform a human sacrifice would be to accomplish two goals: to [...] "release the magician's wrath" [...] as he or she performed a curse, and to kill someone who deserved to die. He considers the action of hurting another person a request to be destroyed, and explains that the Satanist is morally required to grant this request {{in the form of a}} curse. LaVey also says that a Satanist would never sacrifice a baby or an animal, as they are pure carnal beings and considered to be sacred. In The Book of Lucifer, LaVey outlines LaVeyan Satanism's views on death. He explains that one who has lived a full life will dread death, and that this is the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be. He also does not agree with the idea of reincarnation. He encourages a strong will to live, comparing it to animals' instincts to fight viciously for their lives. Suicide is discouraged except in cases of euthanasia, where it would end extreme suffering. Because the Satanist is considered his or her own god, birthdays are celebrated as the most important holidays. Following one's birthday in importance are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween. Solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated.|$|E
