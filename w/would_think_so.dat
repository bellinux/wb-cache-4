2500|$|On 14 May 2009, Baillie was a {{guest on}} the BBC {{politics}} and current affairs programme This Week. She was questioned by host Andrew Neil and regular guests Michael Portillo and Diane Abbott about the Brand row within discussion of the general subject of the present day worth and genuineness of public figures saying sorry, {{in the wake of}} public apologies from members of parliament (MP's) and Prime Minister Gordon Brown following the events of the MP's expenses row. Asked by Neil if receiving an apology from Brand and Ross had mattered to her, she said yes, as she had been [...] "publicly offended and humiliated", and her father [...] "had been humiliated too". When asked by Abbott if all the publicity surrounding the Brand row had helped her career, she responded [...] "not necessarily ... one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> but not really." [...] Neil further asked if the apology she received had helped, she replied yes, stating [...] "definitely" [...] to the follow-up comment from Neil of [...] "better to get it than not get it?" [...] When asked finally on the row by Neil if she thought the apologies from Brand and Ross were genuine, she replied that she thought Ross's was, but the fact that Brand had joked about the row on his later tour negated his apology.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{producer}} Billy Sherrill and Jones himself, {{the singer}} hated the song {{when he first}} heard it. In Bob Allen's biography of the singer, Sherrill states, [...] "He thought it was too long, too sad, too depressing and that nobody would ever play it...He hated the melody and wouldn't learn it." [...] Sherrill also claims that Jones frustrated him by continually singing the song to the melody of the Kris Kristofferson hit [...] "Help Me Make It Through the Night". In the Same Ole Me retrospective, Sherrill recalls a heated exchange during one recording session: [...] "I said 'That's not the melody!' and he said 'Yeah, but it's a better melody.' I said 'It might be—Kristofferson <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> too, it's his melody!'" [...] In the same documentary, Sherrill claims that Jones was in such bad physical shape during this period that [...] "the recitation was recorded 18 months after the first verse was" [...] and added that the last words Jones said about [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] was [...] "Nobody'll buy that morbid son of a bitch". Although he had disliked [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] {{when it was first}} offered to him, Jones ultimately gave the song credit for reviving his flagging career, stating that [...] "a four-decade career had been salvaged by a three-minute song". Jones earned the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1980. The Academy of Country Music awarded the song Single of the Year and Song of the Year in 1980. It also became the Country Music Association's Song of the Year in both 1980 and 1981.|$|E

6000|$|... "You <b>would</b> {{naturally}} <b>think</b> <b>so</b> and {{the thought}} has cost several their lives before now. You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Charlie Ward. Stop. I won't {{have you}} talking about that story here. Why <b>would</b> they <b>think</b> <b>so</b> much of the curse of one saint, and saints so plenty? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, she doesn't try. But she {{probably}} thought you a monster of conceit, and she <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> still more {{if she were}} to hear you talk about her trying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anybody <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> {{from the}} way Mr. Trumbull talks," [...] said Jane. Then, after a pause, [...] "He talks as if my daughters wasn't to be trusted to give drops." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sure}}," [...] he declared, [...] "that upon {{reflection}} you <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> I {{was sure of}} it. I have always found you very fair, Trent, and very reasonable. Now shall we say two hundred?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought not}} to think {{such a thing as}} that for one minute," [...] cried Dickory. [...] "I <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> <b>so</b> about my mother, no matter what happened!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Get breakfast, {{the best}} you can get," [...] Skinner ordered; [...] "and show me to a room where there is plenty of water and towels. These are Englishmen, though you <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> <b>so</b> from their appearance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> {{like the}} woman of a hundred years old, who said on her daughter's death at eighty, 'Ah, poor girl, I knew I never should rear her!' How shall I {{get to see the}} Infirmary here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{a use for}} it," [...] Agatha {{replied with}} a twinkle. [...] "I don't suppose I shall carry out my plans, and after all, they are too ridiculous to talk about. Anyhow, you <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> You're very practical." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, Roger, {{that you}} are one of the {{descendants}} of Quetzalcoatl; and I think my countrymen <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> too, and would hold you in great honor, if the priests, who are very powerful, did not turn them against you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, how nice!" [...] she cried--and {{wondered}} {{at the same}} time whether, on second thoughts, she <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it <b>so.</b> [...] "I suppose he wants you to be the counsel for one of his trusts. When--when do you come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> <b>so</b> if he {{had saved}} your life, sister," [...] Jeanne broke in impetuously. [...] "It was very brave of them both to kill the wolf; but I think it was ever, ever so much braver to attack a great mad dog without weapons. Don't you <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> papa?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And he said, [...] "Very well, Una, I {{am sorry}} you <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> You <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> <b>so</b> {{if you really}} cared {{anything}} for me.

6000|$|... "And {{there must}} be an end of what you call everything, Captain Aylmer," [...] said she, smiling. [...] "It cannot be for your good to bring into your family a wife of whom your mother <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> badly as she thinks of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{morning to}} night; {{and now we}} must work harder than ever, {{with one of the}} boys in Montreal and wheat going down.

60|$|Does {{the vision}} Moore has tracked occupy that chair? You <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> {{could you see}} him {{standing}} before it.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you say, good man, but I am lost in this forest, and belong to King Hudibras' town. I am {{on my way to}} visit the hunter of the Hot Swamp, and I <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it <b>so</b> very, very kind if you would guide me to his hut." ...|$|R

60|$|You <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> <b>so</b> {{to look at}} him, but {{his only}} faults are that he is so young and light-headed. There is good in him, however, and he {{will no doubt be}} steady enough when he grows up. All the young men of the {{neighborhood}} worship him and the girls love him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! my dear Mr. Kendal, {{and what}} does poor Maria say? It is so kind in you. I hope you have taken her in hand, and told her it is quite another thing now, and her poor dear papa <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> She must not let this {{opportunity}} pass, for she may never have another. Did you tell her so?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, you <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Standing; {{but then}} you see, you know not to within a good many points where our journey tendeth. Wait till I have {{finished}} my dinner, for man cannot talk and eat together, with comfort. Then, when my boy has removed the trenchers, I will tell you, over an extra mug of cider, what all this is about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From the way {{his papers}} and letters read one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> Fred. But, as I said before, Spell was a very queer kind of man. In fact, some of the fellows in our company {{thought he was a}} little bit out of his mind at times. It is just {{possible}} that he only imagined that he possessed valuable oil land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One <b>would</b> like to <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> But as {{we seem to}} {{be getting}} serious, isn't the {{question}} whether it prevails or not another matter from an altruistic point of view?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Look at him now. True, he is {{not what}} you would term muscular, but still he has muscles, which is more than he had when he came aboard. Also, he has legs to stand on.

60|$|Adela {{could only}} say that were she in her friend's place she <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> <b>so</b> much about income; but her gentle speech, the eloquence of which had an inward, rather than an outward tendency, {{had no effect on}} Caroline. If Bertram could not persuade her, it {{certainly}} was not probable that Adela Gauntlet should do so.|$|R
60|$|I {{did write}} it for you; and I hoped in writing it, that you <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> All those remembrances are fresh in my mind, {{as they often}} are, and gave me an {{extraordinary}} interest in recalling the past. I should have been grievously disappointed if you had not been pleased, for I took aim at you with a most determined intention.|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so</b> if you {{saw some}} of them. They are a great deal too {{inquisitive}} and familiar for Reynolds. He detests them. It is far more interesting {{to think of that}} Catholic priest who was here the other day. He lingered about the place as though he had known it all his life, and loved it; and, Reynolds says, he prayed for two hours in the chapel." ...|$|E
60|$|Wild. One <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> but I cannot help it. Gad, I {{think the}} reason is, because there's {{something}} more of sin in thy colour than in ours.

6000|$|... 'It is preposterous,' thought Mrs. Prendergast. 'I won't {{tell the}} Doctor. He <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it <b>so</b> foolish in him, and {{improper}} in her; I verily {{believe it is}} her influence that keeps him at Wrapworth!
