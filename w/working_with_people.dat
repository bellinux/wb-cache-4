Admiral Nurses are specialist dementia nurses, working in the community, with families, carers and supporters of people with dementia.

The Admiral nurse role is to work with family carers as their prime focus, provide practical advice, emotional support, information and skills, deliver education and training in dementia care, provide consultancy to professionals <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> with dementia and promote best practice in person- centred dementia care.|$|E

40|$|Throughout {{the world}} populations are aging {{and there is}} a {{concomitant}} global need for increasing numbers of nurses who are skilled in <b>working</b> <b>with</b> older <b>people.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a web-based resource for use in nursing schools to help educate undergraduate nursing students about <b>working</b> effectively <b>with</b> older <b>people.</b> This paper details the process of developing the <b>working</b> <b>with</b> older <b>people</b> website, www. workingwitholderpeople. edu. au, which was launched at the end of 2006. The <b>working</b> <b>with</b> older <b>people</b> website was designed for use as a stand alone or self directed program and/or as a set of modules suitable for integration within individual undergraduate nursing programs. The resource is unique in its portrayal of older adults and the challenges they face in a way that is appealing to undergraduate students, and engages them in meaningful learning activities, based on authentic cases, while also providing comprehensive resources and links...|$|R
25|$|The cult {{success of}} the series won it the BAFTA for Best Drama Series in 1998. It was notable for {{featuring}} comic characters and sub-plots that lent a lot of humour to the series. Unusually, it was produced by the BBC's in-house Entertainment department rather than the Drama department – this was because Renwick preferred <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> he knew rather than the people at Drama who might not share his vision. It has included guest-stars such as Bob Monkhouse, Griff Rhys Jones, Rik Mayall, Jack Dee, Bill Bailey, John Bird and Nigel Planer; who are mainly associated with comedy, but who gave straight performances.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} little study on the {{interaction}} of cultures that exist within a peacekeeping force and the population within which they operate. However, in 1976 Galtun and Hveem studied Norwegian personnel who participated in UNEF-1 (in Gaza) and ONUC (Congo). They posited that knowledge of the culture {{and an understanding of}} the inhabitants in a given country were not only necessary, but crucial for the success of the mission. They found that personnel from the Norwegian contingent wanted greater insight into the conflict and the culture in which they operated. They also wanted more robust training with regard to <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> from other countries. Yet the study revealed the troops received very little from briefings and {{that the majority of the}} information regarding the conflict was gained through the news, reading books or speaking with other UN personnel—rather than any established UN training program.|$|E

25|$|Double {{depression}} {{occurs when}} a person experiences a major depressive episode {{on top of the}} already-existing condition of dysthymia. It is difficult to treat, as sufferers accept these major depressive symptoms as a natural part of their personality or as a part of their life that is outside of their control. The fact that people with dysthymia may accept these worsening symptoms as inevitable can delay treatment. When and if such people seek out treatment, the treatment may not be very effective if only the symptoms of the major depression are addressed, but not the dysthymic symptoms. Patients with double depression tend to report significantly higher levels of hopelessness than is normal. This can be a useful symptom for mental health services providers to focus on when working with patients to treat the condition. Additionally, cognitive therapies can be effective for <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> with double depression in order to help change negative thinking patterns and give individuals a new way of seeing themselves and their environment.|$|E

[...] "It just seemed like a very good role." [...] Beckinsale had just separated from her long-term boyfriend Michael Sheen {{at the time of}} filming and appreciated the warm atmosphere created on set by director Stephen Sommers and co‑star Hugh Jackman: [...] "I really did find that <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> like Stephen and Hugh made it possible to get through what I was going through." [...] The film grossed over $120 million at the U.S. box office and over $300 million worldwide, but it was not well-reviewed. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described her as [...] "a pretty actress doing her best to maintain dignity, vainly trying to craft a feminist statement from a filmmaker's whimsy" [...] while Rex Reed of The New York Observer felt she was [...] "desperately in need of a new agent." ...|$|E
500|$|He wrote [...] "Day 'n' Nite" [...] {{after the}} death of his uncle. The two were not on {{speaking}} terms after his uncle forced him out of his home before Cudi could find another living situation. A [...] bitter Cudi never apologized to him before his death, which he now regrets. Other songs on the album expand upon themes discussed in that single. Back in 2007, Drake, who was one of Cudi's first supporters, had shown interest in doing an official remix of [...] the song with him. However, Cudi chose against it since he was not interested in <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> who are in the [...] "same creative realm" [...] as him and because he was in the midst of creating his own works. Beginning in the fourth grade, and getting more tense after his father's death when he was 11, Cudi began dreaming of his own death (which usually was an automobile accident). He channeled these things into his material. Speaking to BlackBook in May 2009, Cudi said of the album and its content, [...] "Each song is a message. All the hooks are stadium-worthy, crowd sing-along, powerful joints that I can't wait for people to hear in stadium magnitude. My album definitely needs to be heard loudly, but it's also a great album if you're smoking and you need to go to sleep. So far I have the lineup of how I want the first seven tracks on my album and if I play the first seven from the beginning to the end, I'm zoned out and it's the best trip ever. You need to be high to appreciate the instrumentation and how everything is put together on the album—but you don't have to be high just to enjoy it in general." ...|$|E

In December 2009, Tedder {{said that}} he was no longer angry over the accusations Clarkson made, but warned, [...] "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. [...] I don't wanna get some crazy-ass backlash or get my head snapped off for writing a hit song." [...] He later told The Denver Post that he had gotten over the situation and is working on new material for Clarkson's fifth album. Clarkson, however, told the Daily Star that she is writing and recording new songs with new, low-profile producers. [...] "I don’t like <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> who have worked with everyone. Sometimes I get blackmailed into doing so by my label," [...] she said, [...] "but I prefer collaborating with people who aren't on the grid. I don’t want to sound exactly like other people's records." [...] In May, an unreleased electro-pop song by Clarkson called [...] "Wash, Rinse, Repeat" [...] was leaked on the Internet. The song contains auto tuned lyrics that Idolator say are likely written about Tedder: [...] "I can't take the pressure of new. Give me old, rip it off. / Let's see if it sticks to the wall again. / Does it sound familiar? Does it linger in your ear? / Like something you remember from just last year?" [...] and [...] "Music from the past, from the present, well, just last week / We will change a note and get away with it, wait and see." [...] Tedder {{said that he}} thinks the song was written about him, too, but admitted he likes the song. [...] "I think Kelly speaks her mind regardless of anything. She's great with lyrics, and I love that she is her own person. She's no puppet." ...|$|E

But he made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better. And unless he changes his way of <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>people,</b> I hope he never directs anything of mine. In fact, now that this is in print, I can fairly guarantee that he will never direct anything of mine. Life is too short to collaborate with selfish, cruel people."
