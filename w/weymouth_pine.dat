25|$|Pinus strobus, {{commonly}} denominated {{the eastern}} white pine, northern white pine, white pine, <b>Weymouth</b> <b>pine</b> (British), and soft pine {{is a large}} pine native to eastern North America. It occurs from Newfoundland, Canada west through the Great Lakes region to southeastern Manitoba and Minnesota, United States, and south along the Appalachian Mountains and upper Piedmont to northernmost Georgia and perhaps very rarely {{in some of the}} higher elevations in northeastern Alabama.|$|E
500|$|North of Stokeleigh Camp are {{a series}} of {{limestone}} and mineral quarries, overlooking the River Avon, which are now disused. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries this had an important celestine quarry and a tramway which linked it to a dock on the Avon; both are now derelict. The area has in recent years been restored as an arboretum. At the northern end of the woods is Paradise Bottom. This is included in the Leigh Court Estate and was part of the ground laid out by Humphry Repton for Philip John Miles. Some of the first plantings of the giant redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum) and the <b>Weymouth</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus strobus), among other [...] "exotics" [...] imported to the UK, were made here by Sir William Miles in the 1860s.|$|E
50|$|Much of the moor {{was used}} for {{industrial}} peat-cutting. The {{northern part of the}} moor was converted to pasture, but is no longer farmed.In order to renaturalise it {{about a third of the}} nature reserve was re-flooded. The areas that were overgrown with <b>Weymouth</b> <b>pines</b> were cleared. These areas now form breeding grounds and staging areas for many species of bird, some of them rare. The nature reserve's terrain falls almost entirely within the European Union bird reserve of Sittensen Moor (Moore bei Sittensen). The district of Rotenburg (Wümme) acts as the local nature reserve authority.|$|R
50|$|Early in the 20th century, the {{grandfather}} of James Boyd, a well-known North Carolina author, purchased a substantial {{tract of land}} east of Southern Pines to save the longleaf pines from logging. He named the estate <b>Weymouth</b> because the <b>pines</b> reminded him of trees in Weymouth, England. In April 1963, Boyd's widow, Katharine, donated 403 acre of land to the state, establishing the first natural area in the North Carolina state parks system. Additional land has been acquired, including a satellite area of 153 acre known as the Boyd Round Timber Tract, which was added in 1977.|$|R
5000|$|Aymar Embury {{graduated}} from Princeton University in 1900 {{with a degree}} in Civil Engineering and further received a Masters of Science degree in 1901. Following graduate studies, Embury taught architecture at Princeton while also working for various firms in New York City, including Cass Gilbert, George B. Post, Howells & Stokes, and Palmer and Hornbostel. During this period he developed a keen interest in the architecture of small country houses, publishing several books and pamphlets on the subject. In 1905, Embury won both the first and second prize in a design contest sponsored by the Garden City Company for a modest country house in Garden City, Long Island. This gave him visibility as a [...] "society architect"; he acquired a reputation as a builder of country houses for the upper middle class and received many further commissions for such houses in the years surrounding World War I. He designed the James Boyd House, also known as <b>Weymouth,</b> at Southern <b>Pines,</b> North Carolina, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.|$|R

60|$|Meanwhile Bessie {{made herself}} a {{companion}} to Gillian and Dolores, and though so much older, seemed to consider herself as a girl like them. Then, living {{for the most part}} in town, she could talk about London matters to Dolly, and this was a great treat, while yet she had country tastes enough to suit Gillian, and was not in the least afraid of a long walk to the fir plantations to pick up <b>Weymouth</b> <b>pine</b> cones, and the still more precious pinaster ones.|$|E
50|$|He {{held the}} office of First Lord of Trade and Foreign Plantations between 30 May 1702 and April 1707. In this role he is reputed to have {{introduced}} the Lord <b>Weymouth</b> <b>Pine</b> (Pinus strobus), in 1705 and planted it extensively on the estate at Longleat. The Lord <b>Weymouth</b> <b>Pine</b> was useful for ship masts in that it grew tall and slender, but in truth this {{was a bit of}} a cheat, in that the name really derived from George Weymouth, totally unrelated, who first discovered this pine growing in Maine. All Thomas did was to arrange for its importation, and prefix a Lord in front of the Weymouth in the tree's official appellation.|$|E
50|$|Sofiyivka is {{a scenic}} {{landmark}} of world gardening design {{at the beginning}} of 19th century. The park accounts for over 2,000 types of trees and brush (local and exotic) among which are taxodium (marsh cypress), <b>Weymouth</b> <b>Pine,</b> tulip tree, platanus, ginkgo, and many others.|$|E

50|$|Schwarzenberg {{is located}} in the midst of forested hills in the Erzgebirge/Vogtland Natural Park. The flat Galgenberg dome is mostly covered by {{coniferous}} forest. Thick copse of sycamore, aspen, mountain ash, hazel and wild cherry grows on the terraces at the forest edge. Sporadic beech and <b>Weymouth</b> <b>pine</b> {{can be found on the}} Ottenstein. The feverfew-like Tanacetum parthenifolium, known locally as Schwarzenberger Edelweiß, has found a curiously isolated habitat in Schwarzenberg and has resisted attempts at shifting or cultivation.|$|E
50|$|Just to {{the north}} of the viaduct, the Makatote Tramway has a Category 2 listing by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, with {{remnants}} of rails, skid sites, a log hauler, water pits and bogie wheels. In the 1930s Western Red Cedar and Lawson's Cypress were planted near the tramway by the State Forests Service as part of a wider experimental high-altitude planting programme. Japanese Cedar, Douglas Fir, Ponderous Pine, <b>Weymouth</b> <b>Pine</b> and Sugar Pine were also considered for the experiment.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, spruce, Douglas fir, larch, and <b>Weymouth</b> <b>pine</b> are not {{native to}} the forested {{mountain}} range. Spruce prefer cool, shady locations and are therefore often found in valleys, hollows and on the lower slopes of hills, while the Douglas fir is found in widely differing locations due to its high adaptability. The sweet chestnut was not originally an indigenous tree species, but was naturalized by the Romans {{in the area of}} the present-day Palatinate. Since it prefers a mild climate (see temperature) like the grape vine it is found on the eastern edge of the Palatinate Forest, the Haardt, in pure or nearly monocultures and represents about 4 percent of the forest area there.|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} {{composed}} of deciduous and evergreen trees. Predominant is oak, both pedunculate and sessile. Beech is common and sweet chestnut has grown here for many centuries. The forest is home to foxgloves and other wild flowers. Conifers include some <b>Weymouth</b> <b>Pine</b> from 1781, Norway spruce, Douglas fir and larch. The deer are predominantly fallow deer and have been present {{since the second world}} war and number around 300 (there were no deer from about 1855 when they were removed in accordance with an Act of Parliament). A number of fallow deer in the central area are melanistic. Small numbers of roe deer and muntjac deer have spread in from the east.|$|E

50|$|This {{ecological}} balance was permanently destroyed, however, by the colonization and clearing of woodland {{that took place}} during the Middle Ages. Clearance by burning, the use of land for the production of straw and the unrestricted exploitation of the forest for raw materials and fuel led, little by little, to the devastation of wide areas of woodland, something that reached its peak in the 17th and 18th centuries (see Settlement history). This situation made the introduction of properly regulated forest management pressingly urgent - management that not only put a priority on controlled exploitation, but above all on care and sustainability. So in the 18th and 19th centuries, cleared land was reforested, mainly with undemanding, rapid-growing pines, which were followed in the 19th century by other non-native coniferous species such as spruce, larch, <b>Weymouth</b> <b>pine</b> and Douglas fir. In the Palatine Forest, this regulated management produced mixed woodland, in which coniferous trees formed around two-thirds of the total stock in areas that had historically comprised mainly oak and beech. Not until recent decades were there increasing attempts to turn larger areas of the forest into near-natural mixed woodland with a better ratio of deciduous to coniferous trees of around 50% (see adjacent table).|$|E
