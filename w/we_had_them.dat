500|$|Quesada sees Peter's {{making a}} [...] "deal with the Devil" [...] as a villain (Mephisto) taking {{advantage}} of someone at his weakest moment. This, he feels, is a better resolution than Peter and Mary Jane getting divorced, which would indicate [...] "they gave up on their love, that their life in love together was so awful, so stressful, so unfulfilling {{that they had to}} raise a red flag and walk away from it. They quit on their marriage and even more tragic, (they) quit on each other. Instead, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>them</b> make a deal with the devil. [...] 'Cause that isn't as bad." [...] Quesada went on to say, [...] "Peter and MJ didn't quit on their love, they sacrificed it to save a life, that to me is a pretty heroic story." ...|$|E
500|$|On 20January, a {{force of}} over 100Japanese aircraft, {{comprising}} bombers, dive bombers and fighter escort, converged on Rabaul. It was led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, who had controlled the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7December 1941. Two patrolling Wirraways of No.24 Squadron attacked {{the first wave of}} Japanese raiders. Lerew's six remaining Wirraways then scrambled, one crashing on take-off. Of the seven that were airborne, three were shot down into the sea by Mitsubishi Zero fighters, two others crash landed with severe damage, one escaped with minor damage, and one remained unscathed. The ten-minute action killed six RAAF aircrew and wounded five. An Australian soldier on the ground later recalled, [...] "We sat at our guns, shocked by the massacre we had just observed". The Japanese fighters compounded the humiliation by executing aerobatics over the bombed airfield. Lerew signalled headquarters, [...] "Two Wirraways useless defence. Will you now please send some fighters?", receiving the reply, [...] "Regret inability to supply fighters. If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>them</b> you would get them." [...] The next day he was ordered to attack the approaching Japanese fleet with [...] "all available aircraft". As his two serviceable Wirraways had no bomb racks, this left only the one remaining Hudson with which to execute the order; it duly took off to search for the enemy ships but was unable to locate them by nightfall, and returned to base.|$|E

"I {{feel like}} we could have scored more, but we never want to embarrass a team," [...] said Notre Dame wide {{receiver}} Golden Tate, who ran 21 yards for his first career touchdown on an end around in the opening quarter.

2500|$|With {{his other}} {{companies}} in blocking positions, Cheatham hoped {{to catch the}} enemy against the Truoi River. While inflicting casualties, the events in Huế were to interfere with his plans. At 10:30, January 31, Company G departed for Phu Bai as the Task Force reserve. Later that afternoon, the battalion lost operational control of Company F. Captain Downs years later remembered the company [...] "disengaged ... where <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>them</b> pinned up against a river, moved {{to the river and}} trucked into Phu Bai." [...] With the departure of Company F about 16:30, the PAVN successfully disengaged and Companies H and E took up night defensive positions. 2/5 Marines killed 18 enemy troops, took 1 prisoner, and recovered sundry equipment and weapons including 6 AK-47s, at a cost of three Marines killed and 13 wounded.|$|E

60|$|But with {{a closer}} {{knowledge}} of our fellow-creatures has come toleration, pity, sympathy. And as that sympathy has been freely obeyed, it has justified itself more and more.
