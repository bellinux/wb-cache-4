Until {{the opening of}} the Battle of France, which began on 10 May 1940, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's war cabinet met at the War Rooms only once, in October 1939. Following Winston Churchill's {{appointment}} as Prime Minister, Churchill visited the Cabinet Room in May 1940 and declared: 'This is the room from <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> direct the war'. In total 115 Cabinet meetings were held at the Cabinet War Rooms, the last on 28 March 1945, when the German V-weapon bombing campaign came to an end.|$|E

25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and <b>which,</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E
500|$|Swift's {{other works}} were {{previous}} {{collected in a}} four-volume set edited by Alexander Pope called Miscellanies, but Swift {{wanted to have a}} [...] "proper" [...] edition of his works. Some critics speculate that Swift turned to having his work printed without public sponsorship because he was afraid of breaking his commitments to Pope and his publisher Motte. Regardless of what Swift {{may or may not be}} planning, he wrote to Motte in December 1732 and said: [...] "I have cause to believe that some of our printers will collected all they think to be mine, and print them by subscription, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> never encourage nor oppose." ...|$|E

500|$|According to a diary entry made by John Roberts of Paradise, Utah in 1902, Joseph Smith {{gave the}} White Horse Prophecy in early May 1843, {{during the period}} in which the Latter Day Saints were {{headquartered}} in Nauvoo, Illinois. [...] Smith is recorded as saying that the Mormons [...] "will go to the Rocky Mountains and will be a great and mighty people established there, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> call the White Horse of peace and safety." [...] Adding that [...] "I shall never go there" [...] and predicting continued persecution by enemies of the church, Smith reportedly said that [...] "You will see the Constitution of the United States almost destroyed. [...] It will hang like a thread as fine as a silk fiber.... I love the Constitution; it was made by the inspiration of God; and it will be preserved and saved by the efforts of the White Horse, and by the Red Horse who will combine in its defense." [...] Smith additionally said, according to the diary, that the Mormons would send missionaries to [...] "gather the honest in heart from among the Pale Horse, or people of the United States, to stand by the Constitution of the United States as it was given by the inspiration of God." [...] Roberts' account quotes Smith as predicting numerous wars involving Great Britain, France, Russia, China, and other countries, and saying that the European nobility [...] "knows that [...] is true, but it has not pomp enough, and grandeur and influence for them to yet embrace it." [...] He is also reported to have said that a temple which the Latter Day Saints had planned to build in Jackson County, Missouri [...] "will be built in this generation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Geithner's {{employer}} at the time, the International Monetary Fund, gives its American employees the employer's half of {{the payroll}} taxes, expecting that the employees will deposit the money with the Internal Revenue Service. A report from the Senate Finance Committee documented Geithner's errors. While working for IMF, Geithner signed a tax worksheet stating his [...] "obligation of the U.S. Social Security tax, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> pay on my fund income" [...] and another annual worksheet stating [...] "I wish to apply for tax allowance of U.S. federal and state income taxes {{and the difference between}} the 'self-employed' and 'employed' obligation of the U.S. Social Security tax <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> pay on my Fund income." ...|$|E

2500|$|Independent {{analyses}} of the documents {{by a number of}} U.S. academics and journalists have challenged the Colombian interpretation of the documents, accusing the Colombian government of exaggerating their contents. According to Greg Palast, the claim about Chavez's $300 million is based on the following (translated) sentence: [...] "With relation to the 300, which from now on we will call 'dossier', efforts are now going forward at the instructions of the cojo , <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> explain in a separate note." [...] The separate note is allegedly speaking of a hostage exchange with the FARC that Chavez was supposedly helping to negotiate at that time. Palast suggests that the [...] "300" [...] is supposedly a reference to [...] "300 prisoners" [...] (the number involved in a FARC prisoner exchange) and not [...] "300 million".|$|E
2500|$|A famous {{legend has}} persisted from ancient times. As deacon in Rome, St Lawrence was {{responsible}} for the material goods of the Church and the distribution of alms to the poor. St Ambrose of Milan relates that when the treasures of the Church were demanded of St Lawrence by the Prefect of Rome, he brought forward the poor, to whom he had distributed the treasure as alms. [...] "Behold in these poor persons the treasures which I promised to show you; to <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> add pearls and precious stones, those widows and consecrated virgins, which are the Church's crown." [...] The Prefect was so angry that he had a great gridiron prepared with hot coals beneath it, and had Lawrence placed on it, hence St Lawrence's association with the gridiron. After the martyr had suffered pain for a long time, the legend concludes, he cheerfully declared: [...] "I'm well done. Turn me over!" [...] From this derives his patronage of cooks, chefs, and comedians.|$|E

2500|$|Although Whig grandees such as Portland and Fitzwilliam privately {{agreed with}} Burke's Appeal, they {{wished he had}} used more {{moderate}} language. Fitzwilliam saw the Appeal as containing [...] "the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since". Francis Basset, a backbench Whig MP, wrote to Burke: [...] "...though for reasons <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not now detail I did not then deliver my sentiments, I most perfectly differ from Mr. Fox & from the great Body of opposition on the French Revolution". Burke sent {{a copy of the}} Appeal to the king and the king requested a friend to communicate to Burke that he had read it [...] "with great Satisfaction". Burke wrote of its reception: [...] "Not one word from one of our party. They are secretly galled. They agree with me to a title; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting Fox. ... They leave me to myself; they see that I can do myself justice". Charles Burney viewed it as [...] "a most admirable book—the best & most useful on political subjects that I have ever seen" [...] but believed the differences in the Whig Party between Burke and Fox should not be aired publicly.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1628, Buckingham was assassinated, {{leaving a}} gap {{at the royal}} court. Henrietta Maria's {{relationship}} with her husband promptly began to improve and the two forged deep bonds of love and affection, marked by various jokes played by Henrietta Maria on Charles. Henrietta Maria became pregnant {{for the first time}} in 1628 but lost her first child shortly after birth in 1629, following a very difficult labour. In 1630, the future Charles II was born successfully, however, following another complicated childbirth by the noted physician Theodore de Mayerne. By now, Henrietta Maria had effectively taken over Buckingham's role as Charles's closest friend and advisor. Despite the ejection of the French staff in 1626, Charles's court was heavily influenced by French society; French was usually used in preference to English, being considered a more polite language. Additionally, Charles would regularly write letters to Henrietta Maria addressed [...] "Dear Heart." [...] These letters showcase the loving nature of their relationship. For example, on 11 January 1645 Charles wrote, [...] "And dear Heart, thou canst not but be confident that there is no danger <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not hazzard, or pains that I will not undergo, to enjoy the happiness of thy company" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 13 January 2012, Chris Evans began {{negotiations}} {{to star in}} the film adaptation, and was later confirmed as the film's male lead. On 17 January 2012, Tilda Swinton and Jamie Bell were confirmed to be in talks to join the project. Swinton first met Bong at the Cannes Film Festival, where she was of the mind {{that she did not}} want to make any other films, a decision she takes after each film: [...] "And that one (and only) condition in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> make another film is that I will have some fun. So we started to play with the idea of what would amuse us about this." [...] Bong and Swinton experimented with voices, mannerisms and the general appearance of the character of Mason. On 18 January 2012, John Hurt was confirmed to have been cast, with Hurt stating, [...] "All the film crew refer to , with great reverence, as 'Director Bong'. I love the fact that I am working for Director Bong." [...] On 2 February 2012, Octavia Spencer had joined the cast of Bong's project in the role of a [...] "passenger on the train who joins the revolt in order to save her son." [...] Ed Harris spoke of his love of Bong Joon-ho's films and wanted to work with him, [...] "I want to do this. I don't care what he's asking me to do because he's a really great filmmaker." [...] On 27 February 2012, Ewen Bremner had joined the cast of Bong's film. On 3 April 2012, Luke Pasqualino was confirmed to have joined the cast.|$|E
