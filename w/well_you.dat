5|$|<b>Well</b> <b>you</b> can't believe it, but the Sturmovik, {{which was}} their main ground-attack aircraft, flew like B-17s in {{formation}} and didn't {{attempt to make}} any evasive manoeuvres. And all they had was one peashooter {{in the back of}} each plane. Also, some of the pilots were women. Their peashooter was no threat unless they had a very lucky hit on you. I didn't open fire til the aircraft filled my whole windscreen. If I did this, I would get one every time.|$|E
5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so <b>well.</b> <b>You</b> did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E

25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having {{a sense of accomplishment}} if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how <b>well</b> <b>you</b> do in the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as how <b>well</b> <b>you</b> do in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for the Main).|$|E

Now, if I can be of any help on that, I'm prepared to send my driver with an officer of mine to escort you to safety. And we can get you on my jet aircraft, and I'm sure I can deliver on that. One of my officers will ride {{in the front seat}} of my limousine with the chauffeur.|$|E

25|$|Channing {{continued}} {{her return to}} the stage by teaming up again with playwright John Guare. She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: <b>Well,</b> <b>you</b> like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else is not my job.|$|E

Journalist Maureen Freely wrote of Millett's viewpoint regarding activism in her later years: [...] "The best thing about being a [...] is that she can say what she pleases because 'nobody's giving me a chair in anything.

500|$|A. J. A. Nelson, {{who succeeded}} Eberle as {{director}} of the adult education program, recalled in 1987 the conversation he had with Madgwick when Nelson arrived at the university in 1955.

500|$|Kristina Wilson, {{associate}} professor in the Department of Visual and Performing Arts at Worcester's Clark University, asked people on campus what they thought of Turtle Boy. One person replied [...] "Oh, that's Worcester's monument to bestiality." [...] Wilson said the sculpture is intended to portray [...] "innocence, joy, and rebirth," [...] and that historically Charles Y. Harvey came from an artistic tradition in which [...] "the human figure is the apex of beauty, and how <b>well</b> <b>you</b> can capture that is the demonstration of your artistic talents." [...] Regarding the artistic merit of the work, Wilson said: [...] "It's unfortunate, because it really does look like something untoward is going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Ponting {{started his}} 1994–95 {{campaign}} with a century against eventual Shield champions Queensland in Brisbane, {{in a performance}} that impressed Queensland captain Allan Border, who had just retired from international cricket after leading the national team for a decade. Border said of Ponting: [...] "He's just an outstanding prospect. The thing I like about him is he's very aggressive, he plays all the shots, he's equally {{at home on the}} front foot as the back foot. He cuts and pulls well, and he drives <b>well.</b> <b>You</b> don't often see that, the ability to get on [...] front foot and back foot and play equally well." ...|$|E

500|$|Describing the {{selection}} process, early contributor Chris Vrenna told Gannett News [...] "coming {{from the same}} emotional background, I feel, {{is more important than}} how <b>well</b> <b>you</b> can play your instrument. That's one reason that makes our shows more intense when we're up there ... We found people that understood that. It makes us stronger". [...] Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying [...] "I'm not in the position to offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ... So I took some young guys who were malleable, who would basically do what I want them to do but expand on it. [...] The only context I've worked with them in so far is, 'Here are the songs, here are your parts, learn them.' [...] " ...|$|E
500|$|Kolbe {{thought at}} first that casting Robinson was [...] "really off-the-way" [...] but he felt the actor made the episode [...] "bloom". He gave general {{guidelines}} to Robinson about how he could approach the character, but it was Robinson who developed the traits of the character. Kolbe also praised the writing saying that [...] "I wish there was more writing like this for television. I think we'd have a much healthier industry." [...] Robinson said that Garak was a complicated character which required the use of subtext, adding that it wasn't {{a simple way to}} portray a character [...] "but when you do it <b>well,</b> <b>you</b> really get people's attention". He was told by the producers that they intended to bring him back onto the show, but in a later interview, he said that this was commonplace in the industry and doesn't usually occur. When he was brought back for the second-season episode [...] "", executive producer Ira Steven Behr apologized for not bringing him back sooner.|$|E
