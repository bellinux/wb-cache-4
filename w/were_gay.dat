5|$|Homosexuals in Miami {{were not}} well-connected or {{experienced}} enough {{to combat the}} coalition led by Bryant, so they invited two political organizers to the city: Ethan Geto from New York City and Jim Foster from San Francisco, both of whom <b>were</b> <b>gay.</b> Foster and Geto faced battles {{not only with the}} Save Our Children campaign, but the disjointed and often closeted gay community in Miami. When organizations outside of Florida promoted boycotting Florida orange juice, Jack Campbell disagreed, worried that an economic backlash in the state would work against local gay men and lesbians. Ruth Shack saw the issue simply, as one of civil rights; Geto and Foster agreed. Bob Kunst soon broke away from the campaign to promote the orange juice boycott, and his views were often printed in the newspapers to Geto's alarm.|$|E

25|$|It Gets Better is an Internet-based 501(c)3 nonprofit {{founded in}} the United States by gay activist, author, media pundit, and {{journalist}} Dan Savage and his husband Terry Miller on September 21, 2010, {{in response to the}} suicides of teenagers who were bullied because they <b>were</b> <b>gay</b> or because their peers suspected that they <b>were</b> <b>gay.</b> Its goal is to prevent suicide among LGBT youth by having gay adults convey the message that these teens' lives will improve. The project has grown rapidly: over 200 videos were uploaded in the first week, and the project's YouTube channel reached the 650 video limit in the next week. The project is now organized on its own website, the It Gets Better Project, and includes more than 50,000 entries from people of all sexual orientations, including many celebrities; the videos have received over 50 million views.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} of Hedwig was originally a supporting {{character in the}} piece. She was loosely inspired by a German female babysitter/prostitute who worked for Mitchell's family {{when he was a}} teenager in Junction City, Kansas. The {{character of}} Tommy, originally conceived as the main character, was based on Mitchell himself: both <b>were</b> <b>gay,</b> the sons of an army general, deeply Roman Catholic, and fascinated with mythology. Hedwig became the story's protagonist when Trask encouraged Mitchell to showcase their earliest material in 1994 at NYC's drag-punk club Squeezebox, where Trask headed the house band and Mitchell's boyfriend, Jack Steeb, played bass.|$|E
25|$|The Middle Assyrian Law Codes (1075 BC) state: If {{a man has}} {{intercourse}} with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a eunuch. This is the earliest known law condemning the act of male-to-male intercourse in the military. Despite these laws, homosexuality {{was an integral part}} of temple life in parts of Mesopotamia, and no blame appears to have attached to its practice outside of worship. Some kings had male lovers — both Zimri-lin (king of Mari) and Hammurabi (king of Babylon) slept with men. Some Assyrian priests <b>were</b> <b>gay</b> men who cross-dressed.

25|$|Hirschfeld {{played a}} {{prominent}} role in the Harden–Eulenburg affair of 1906-09, which turned to be the most explosive sex scandal of Imperial Germany. During the libel trial in 1907 when General Kuno von Moltke sued the journalist Maximilian Harden after the latter had run an article accusing Moltke of having a homosexual relationship with the politically powerful Prince Philipp von Eulenburg, who was the Kaiser's best friend, Hirschfeld testified for Harden. Hirschfeld in his role as an expert witness testified that Moltke was gay, and thus what Harden had written was true. The homosexual Hirschfeld — who passionately wanted to make homosexuality legal in Germany — believed that proving that Army officers like Moltke <b>were</b> <b>gay</b> would help his case for legalization, and as such he also testified that he believed {{there was nothing wrong with}} Moltke.|$|E
500|$|Speculation {{has been}} {{recorded}} about the sexual orientation of a few justices who were lifelong bachelors, but no unambiguous evidence exists that they <b>were</b> <b>gay.</b> Perhaps the greatest body of circumstantial evidence surrounds Frank Murphy, who was dogged by [...] "umors of homosexuality [...] all his adult life".|$|E
500|$|Anita Bryant's public {{campaign}} opposing {{homosexuality and}} the multiple challenges to gay rights ordinances across the United States fueled gay politics in San Francisco. Seventeen candidates from the Castro District entered the next race for supervisor; {{more than half}} of them <b>were</b> <b>gay.</b> The New York Times ran an exposé on the veritable invasion of gay people into San Francisco, estimating that the city's gay population was between 100,000 and 200,000 out of a total 750,000. The Castro Village Association had grown to 90businesses; the local bank, formerly the smallest branch in the city, had become the largest and was forced to build a wing to accommodate its new customers. Milk biographer Randy Shilts noted that [...] "broader historical forces" [...] were fueling his campaign.|$|E

500|$|By 4:00 in {{the morning}} the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or {{gathered}} nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be [...] "electricity in the air". One commented: [...] "There was a certain beauty {{in the aftermath of the}} riot... It was obvious, at least to me, that a lot of people really <b>were</b> <b>gay</b> and, you know, this was our street." [...] Thirteen people had been arrested. Some in the crowd were hospitalized, and four police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken. Inspector Pine had intended to close and dismantle the Stonewall Inn that night. Pay phones, toilets, mirrors, jukeboxes, and cigarette machines were all smashed, possibly in the riot and possibly by the police.|$|E
500|$|Thousands {{of people}} had {{gathered}} {{in front of the}} Stonewall, which had opened again, choking Christopher Street until the crowd spilled into adjoining blocks. The throng surrounded buses and cars, harassing the occupants unless they either admitted they <b>were</b> <b>gay</b> or indicated their support for the demonstrators. Sylvia Rivera saw a friend of hers jump on a nearby car trying to drive through; the crowd rocked the car back and forth, terrifying its occupants. Another of Rivera's friends, Marsha P. Johnson, an African-American street queen, climbed a lamppost and dropped a heavy bag onto the hood of a police car, shattering the windshield. As on the previous evening, fires were started in garbage cans throughout the neighborhood. More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Precincts, but after 2:00a.m. the TPF arrived again. Kick lines and police chases waxed and waned; when police captured demonstrators, whom the majority of witnesses described as [...] "sissies" [...] or [...] "swishes", the crowd surged to recapture them. Street battling ensued again until 4:00a.m.|$|E

500|$|Shilts {{decided to}} write And the Band Played On after {{attending}} an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer Bill Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke: [...] "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're Haitian." [...] Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it [...] "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go {{in front of a}} journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they <b>were</b> <b>gay,</b> they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at that. To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that, to me, it was never something that happened to those other people." ...|$|E
500|$|Within {{two years}} of the Stonewall riots there <b>were</b> <b>gay</b> rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe. People who joined activist {{organizations}} after the riots had very little in common other than their same-sex attraction. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place. Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after Barbara Gittings exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist Jean O'Leary protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by cross-dressers and drag queens in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, Sylvia Rivera and Lee Brewster jumped on the stage and shouted [...] "You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and these bitches tell us to quit being ourselves!" [...] Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.|$|E
500|$|Hindley lodged an {{unsuccessful}} appeal against her conviction {{immediately after the}} trial. Brady and Hindley corresponded by letter until 1971, when she ended their relationship. The two remained in sporadic contact for several months, but Hindley {{had fallen in love}} with one of her prison officers, Patricia Cairns. A former assistant governor claimed that such relationships were not unusual in Holloway at that time, as [...] "many of the officers <b>were</b> <b>gay,</b> and involved in relationships either with one another or with inmates". Hindley successfully petitioned to have her status as a category A prisoner changed to category B, which enabled Governor Dorothy Wing to take her on a walk round Hampstead Heath, part of her unofficial policy of reintroducing her charges to the outside world when she felt they were ready. The excursion caused a furore in the national press and earned Wing an official rebuke from the then Home Secretary Robert Carr. With Cairns's assistance and the outside contacts of another prisoner, Maxine Croft, Hindley planned a prison escape, but it was thwarted when impressions of the prison keys were intercepted by an off-duty policeman. Cairns was sentenced to six years in jail for her part in the plot.|$|E
