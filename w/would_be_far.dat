5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{computer}} users and manufacturers were becoming {{concerned about the}} rising cost of programming. A 1959 survey had found that in any data processing installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000. At a time when new programming languages were proliferating at an ever-increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> cheaper and faster.|$|E
5|$|At this distance, {{the land}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> beyond the maximum {{anticipated}} {{size of the}} city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that {{the speed of the}} railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E
5|$|For {{financial}} and scripting reasons the last book {{was divided into}} two films, shot back to back, which drew criticism from the series' fanbase. Radcliffe defended the split, stating {{that it would have}} been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast-paced with a lot of action, while the first part <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more sedate, focusing on character development; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut. Filming lasted for a year, concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting, like most of the cast and crew, Radcliffe openly wept.|$|E

5|$|Over time, Dmowski {{became more}} {{receptive}} to Russian overtures, particularly neoslavism, warming up {{to the idea that}} Poland and Russia may have a common future, particularly due to Germany being their common enemy. In light of what he regarded as Russian cultural inferiority, Dmowski felt that a strong Russia was more acceptable than a strong Germany. In Dmowski's view, the Russian policy of Russification would not succeed in subjugating the Poles, while the Germans <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more successful with their Germanisation policies. He explained those views in his book Niemcy, Rosja i kwestia Polska (Germany, Russia and the Polish Cause), published in 1908.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie's talents, {{and seeking}} to {{divide and conquer}} his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former {{opponent}} might be of use. The president's onetime advisor, Justice Felix Frankfurter, had suggested to Van Doren on New Year's Eve that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate bipartisan support of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.|$|E
5|$|On , 1889, the Land Run saw the {{founding}} of Norman, with at least 150 residents spending the night in makeshift campsites; {{by the next morning}} a downtown was already being constructed. Almost immediately two prominent Norman businessmen, former Purcell railroad freight agent Delbert Larsh and railroad station chief cashier Thomas Waggoner, began lobbying for the territorial government to locate its first university in Norman. The two were interested in growing the city and had reasoned that, rather than try to influence legislatures to locate the heavily contested territory capital in Norman, it made sense to attempt to secure the state's first university instead (a move that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> less controversial). On , 1890, Larsh and Waggoner were successful with the passage of Council Bill 114, establishing the University of Oklahoma in Norman approximately 18 years before Oklahoma statehood.|$|E

5|$|On 19 August, Göring {{read the}} {{reports on the}} losses of 18 August, and unhappy with {{the extent of the}} losses, {{recalled}} both pilots. Hitler's Directive 17 had ordered the Luftwaffe to achieve air superiority, but remain strong enough for when, or rather if, Sea Lion was launched. Moreover, Göring recognised that the Luftwaffe was his power base. A failure would be damaging, but a severe weakening of the Luftwaffe <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> worse. He emphasised to his commanders the need to preserve the Luftwaffe's strength. Essentially, the core theme of the conference was fighter protection. The fighter leaders advocated sweeps to clear the skies in advance of attacks. Other commanders present thought a combination of sweeps and close escort would be more effective in reducing losses. Göring agreed and listed a number of forms that the sweeps could take. The most important tactical change he made was instituting a wholesale purge of older Geschwaderkommodore in favour of younger men. From now on, leaders were to be drawn from the ranks, given responsibility based on skill and experience rather than rank, while allowing them to have a free rein in tactical engagements (a form of aerial Auftragstaktik).|$|E
5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> easier to implement with the Taliban in control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian assault {{began at}} Lazarevac, a {{strategically}} located town {{just south of}} Belgrade whose capture would have given them access to the Mladenovac railway line {{and the ability to}} outflank the Serbian forces holding the road to Belgrade. Further south, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbian 1st Army. During this assault, they made the mistake of attacking its stronger right flank and were met with determined Serbian resistance which prevented them from gaining any ground. Military historian David Jordan notes that had the Austro-Hungarians attacked the junction splitting the 1st and Užice armies, they {{might have been able to}} split the Serbs down the centre and gotten hold of an unimpeded passage to the Morava River. The Serbian 1st Army was quick to reinforce its left flank, realizing that any subsequent attack against it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> less easy to repel.|$|E

5|$|The {{continuing}} {{success of}} the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, {{and the other to}} determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more costly than any Earth-based telescope. The U.S. Congress questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, public spending cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.|$|E
5|$|To the Milanese, Sforza's victory {{now seemed}} certain, {{but he found}} his Venetian allies {{beginning}} to have doubts about their Captain-General. They decided that Milan run by Sforza <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more dangerous and detrimental to their interests than if it were run by a weak Republic. The last of the territory claimed by Venice, namely Crema, was now captured. Venice went behind Sforza's back and signed a peace treaty with the Republic. They conceded conquered land to the Republic in return for peace, and let Sforza keep only Pavia, Cremona, Piacenza, and a narrow strip of land. They ordered him to accept the treaty or find Venice his enemy. The Republic rejoiced, and the citizens were confident {{the war was over}} and their future was secured. But Sforza could not accept the conditions of the treaty, and decided to persevere in the struggle. He was already very powerful, and moreover was close to Milan. The Milanese in their assurance of peace had nearly exhausted their resources to plant crops and return to the old way of life. He was confident that Milan would quickly fall to him. After reinforcing his peace with Savoy with the concession of a few unimportant castles, he defeated the Venetians under his rival Sigismondo Malatesta and continued the siege.|$|E

25|$|Rousseau {{continues}} {{to say that}} though Greek and Roman society functioned well with tragic and violent content in theatres because {{it was part of}} the traditions specific to the time and place, putting these plays in a French context <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more dangerous. However, tragedies are not as dangerous as comedies, because the characters more closely resemble French citizens.|$|E
25|$|Values {{are also}} given for trees, {{equipment}} {{and parts of}} the human body.

The first connection with the bridge opened in October 1938; a second connection opened in 1942 to link it to the Pentagon road network.|$|E
