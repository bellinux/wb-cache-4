25|$|In 1927, {{because of}} cost and {{technical}} restrictions, Disney and his chief animator Ub Iwerks decided {{to end their}} work on the Alice Comedies series in search of new creative opportunities. Coincidentally, Universal Studios <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the cartoon business and needed a cartoon character of its own. So Disney's distributor Charles Mintz told Disney and Iwerks {{to create a new}} character they could sell to Universal. Wanting to make cartoons with an all-animated look, Disney signed a contract with Universal Studios leading to the creation of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and Universal's first cartoon series. Work on both the character and series began soon after Disney moved his studio to Hyperion Avenue.|$|E

500|$|The {{creation}} of Jane developed {{a different way}} to the usual process and there was no regular audition sessions. Aspiring actress Annie Jones spent two months ringing the Neighbours production company asking for a role on the show. She said [...] "I had appeared on several other Australian TV shows, but desperately <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Neighbours". Jones originally auditioned for the role of Charlene Mitchell, before she was given the small role, for what was a planned six weeks of appearances.

[...] Had {{it not been for}} World War II, Bump and Pete likely would have attended the University of Illinois, which was about 50 miles from their home in Bloomington. [...] However, both brothers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the V-12 Navy College Training Program, and Illinois did not have such a program. [...] Bump enlisted in the United States Marine Corps while still {{a senior in high school}} and was called to active duty in 1943. [...] He was assigned to the V-12 officer training program at Purdue University. [...] His brother, Pete, also enlisted and was assigned to officer training at Michigan.|$|E

[...] His previous album, His Band and the Street Choir, had been released in November 1970. [...] In an interview with journalist Sean O'Hagan in 1990, he described this period as being {{in contrast to the}} laid back atmosphere pictured on the album cover: [...] "When I went to the West Coast these people [...] weren't that available so I had to virtually put a completely new band together overnight to do [...] So it was a very tough period. I didn't want to change my band but if I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the studio I had to ring up and get somebody. That was the predicament I was in." ...|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Threshold" [...] {{is about}} {{reaching}} one's limit {{with a person}} in a situation where one is about to break—and are about to blow up as they get [...] "under your skin", while [...] "Cast Down" [...] features a fallen angel who falls into drugs. [...] "God Send Death" [...] and [...] "Deviance" [...] take up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs were written by Hanneman. Having read several books on serial killers, Hanneman came to the conclusion he could only kill someone if they really [...] "pissed him off", and decided he was unable to kill someone he did not know just for power. He later admitted {{he was trying to get}} into that person's mind; [...] "why do they get off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and getting off on it. I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> that mindset." ...|$|E
500|$|The United States entered World War II {{with the}} attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Feller heard about the bombing while {{returning}} from a visit to his terminally ill father at Des Moines to Chicago where he was to sign a new Indians contract. Two days later, he volunteered for the United States Navy, becoming the first American professional athlete to enlist. Originally he tried to enlist as a fighter pilot but failed hearing tests. Feller attended basic training at Norfolk Naval Base {{and served as a}} physical fitness instructor there. He also pitched in baseball games hosted by the military. Although he had received a military exemption owing to his father's failing health, he wanted to serve in combat missions. Feller said, [...] "I told them I <b>wanted</b> <b>to...</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> combat; wanted to do something besides standing around handing out balls and bats and making ball fields out of coral reefs."

500|$|Wall Street enjoyed renewed {{interest}} in the film in 1990 when the cover of Newsweek magazine asked, [...] "Is Greed Dead?" [...] after 1980s icons like Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky ran afoul of insider trading laws. Over the years, the film's screenwriter Stanley Weiser has been approached by numerous people who told him, [...] "The movie changed my life. Once I saw it I knew that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> such and such business. I {{wanted to be like}} Gordon Gekko". In addition, both Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas still have people come up to them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film. In recent years, Stone was asked how the financial market depicted in Wall Street has changed and he replied, [...] "The problems that existed in the 1980s market grew and grew into a much larger phenomenon. Enron is a fiction, in a sense, {{in the same way that}} Gordon Gekko's buying and selling was a fiction ... Kenny Lay—he's the new Gordon Gekko". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Owen Gleiberman recently commented that the film, [...] "reveals something now which it couldn't back then: that the Gordon Gekkos of the world weren't just getting rich—they were creating an alternate reality that was going to crash down on all of us".|$|E

500|$|... "Pusher" [...] {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave it an A–, describing it as [...] "smart, well-paced, and exciting, and Modell is memorable {{for being a}} very human monster who manages to be both well-drawn and unsympathetic". Though he praised Modell and the climax, he felt that Holly was a stereotype and [...] "the implication that Modell is {{able to get through}} to her because of her fear walks that weird line between plausible and not entirely necessary". Handlen also felt that it was [...] "an excellent starting point" [...] for someone who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the series. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Pusher" [...] a B+, writing, [...] "Much inscrutable warmth between Mulder and Scully parallels some inscrutable detective work. But the climactic mental tug-of-war between Mulder and Pusher makes up for any lapses in logic". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two called Gilligan's script [...] "witty and clever" [...] and noted that it was [...] "a triumph". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised Wisden's performance as Robert Modell, calling his portrayal [...] "spot on". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it a rare four stars out of four. She called it an [...] "intense nail biter" [...] that [...] "ranks with the best of The X-Files".|$|E
500|$|Gary Mulholland of The Observer {{considers}} {{the release of}} Is This It a [...] "world-changing moment" [...] and notes that its impact was [...] "immediate and dramatic" [...] on both music and attire. BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe suggests that the album moved popular opinion from DJs and pop music to [...] "skinny jeans and guitars", [...] "the template for rock 'n' roll in the modern day". Tam Gunn of FACT agrees and explains that it [...] "caused a sea change" [...] in mainstream music in the US and the UK, while Anthony Miccio of Stylus {{points out that the}} Strokes' success created the commercial context for [...] "other new-wavers" [...] to flourish. Rolling Stone writes that Is This It inspired [...] "a ragged revolt" [...] in Britain, led by the Libertines and Arctic Monkeys, and continued its influence in the US on the success of bands like Kings of Leon. The Observer shares a similar view and concludes that [...] "a fine brood of heirs", like the Libertines and Franz Ferdinand, would not have existed and been successful if the Strokes had not reinvigorated [...] "rock's obsession with having a good time". Jared Followill of Kings of Leon notes that the album {{was one of the main}} reasons that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a band; he states, [...] "The title track was one of the first basslines I learned... I was just 15 at the time." ...|$|E

I told her {{if you want to}} just do a girl/girl scene, we can do that. She said she wanted to work with Kylie Ireland, so I set it up. When the sex started, she just fucking rocked! I knew Jenna was special right off the bat. I figured she'd be the next Ginger Lynn, but nobody had any idea {{she was going to be}} as big as she turned out to be.

2500|$|Filmed in Spain, Chimes at Midnight {{was based}} on Welles's play, Five Kings, in which he drew {{material}} from six Shakespeare plays {{to tell the story}} of Sir John Falstaff (Welles) and his relationship with Prince Hal (Keith Baxter). The cast includes John Gielgud, Jeanne Moreau, Fernando Rey and Margaret Rutherford; the film's narration, spoken by Ralph Richardson, is taken from the chronicler Raphael Holinshed. Welles held the film in high regard: [...] "It's my favorite picture, yes. If I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Guitar Mix" [...] {{features}} Vernon Reid of Living Colour. Reid stated, [...] "'Black Cat' {{was one of}} {{my favorite}} tracks on Rhythm Nation. I had the song and learned the parts, the structure of it, and just went in and did it. I think we used the second take. I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> that arena thing. It's meant to sound really big." [...] Jesse Johnson provided a guitar solo which was not used for the album version, but is featured in each of its remixes. The remixes have the added component of live drumming performed by Derek Organ of Switch, showcasing more of a heavy metal feel in the extended solo and double kick drums. Both versions omit the panther roar introduction and vocal refrain closing from the album edit.|$|E

Preparations have been made to meet such an emergency. Where with a private house you would probably have to wander round heaving rocks and end by climbing up a water-spout, when you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> an inn you simply ring the night-bell, which, communicating with the boots' room, has that hard-worked menial up and doing in no time.|$|R

2500|$|Hiroki is one {{of several}} Japanese film {{directors}} who got their start in the Japanese softcore pornographic film genre of pink film.

Hiroki made his first film as a director with Sexual Abuse! Exposed Woman for Million Film in 1982. His debut met with poor reviews and was [...] "terrible" [...] according to Hiroki and he went back to being an assistant director for a time.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Senate primary, Roosevelt refocused on the Navy Department. World War I broke out in July 1914, with the Central Powers of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Ottoman Empire seeking to defeat the Allied Powers of Britain, France, and Russia. The Wilson {{administration}} initiated {{an expansion of the}} Navy after the sinking of the RMS Lusitania by a German submarine, and Roosevelt helped establish the United States Navy Reserve and the Council of National Defense. In March 1917, after Germany initiated its unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, Roosevelt asked Wilson for permission to fit the naval fleet out for war; the request was denied. After the U.S. entrance into World War I in April 1917, he very much <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a military uniform, but the armistice took shape before this could materialize.
