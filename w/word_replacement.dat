40|$|A {{major issue}} {{in the study of}} word {{perception}} concerns the nature (perceptual or nonperceptual) of sentence context effects. The authors compared effects of legal, <b>word</b> <b>replacement,</b> nonword replacement, and transposed contexts on target word performance using the Reicher–Wheeler task to suppress nonperceptual influences of contextual and lexical constraint. Experiment 1 showed superior target word performance for legal (e. g., “it began to flap/flop”) over all other contexts and for transposed over <b>word</b> <b>replacement</b> and nonword replacement contexts. Experiment 2 replicated these findings with higher constraint contexts (e. g., “the cellar is dark/dank”) and Experiment 3 showed that strong constraint contexts improved performance for congruent (e. g., “born to be wild”) but not incongruent (e. g., mild) target words. These findings support the view that the very perception of words can be enhanced when words are presented in legal sentence contexts. A well-documented finding in the word recognition literature is that responses to words are facilitated when they are preceded by a legal sentence context (e. g., Duffy, Henderson, & Morris, 1989...|$|E

This study aimed {{to find out the}} Acehnese archaic <b>words</b> and their <b>replacement</b> that younger spearkers often use today. Hikayat Prang Sabi was the source of the archaic words for this study. Therefore, the research design of this study was descriptive qualitative. The data from Hikayat Prang Sabi consisted of 59 words were distributed to 20 speakers of Acehnese who lived in Pidie Regency. They were asked to verify the words. The speakers were divided into 2 groups, i. e. group with 20 to 25 years old and 26 to 30 years old. The research results showed that there were 5 archaic words, 49 semi-archaic words, and 5 words are estimated non-archaic.

This paper presents an algorithm that detects and corrects speech repairs based on finding the repair pattern. The repair pattern is built by finding word matches and <b>word</b> <b>replacements,</b> and identifying fragments and editing terms.

50|$|Historian Gérard Bouchard, {{who also}} {{published}} a book critical of Lionel Groulx, has been very critical of The Traitor and the Jew. In a letter to Le Devoir, published on May 1, 2003, he contended that only 14 of 58 quotes of Lionel Groulx in Delisle's thesis are accurate, and that the 44 other quotes contain 56 irregularities, including additions and amputations of the text, <b>word</b> <b>replacements</b> that change the meaning, and quotes that are {{not found in the}} text where Delisle claims they are. He asserts that the magnitude of inaccuracy discourages him from even considering Delisle's work as a basis for his own criticism of Groulx (Les Deux Chanoines - Contradiction et ambivalence dans la pensée de Lionel Groulx, 2003). Delisle admitted to 13 irregularities in the references of her book and later corrected citations for some of the disputed quotations.|$|R
40|$|Textual data holds {{a number}} of {{properties}} {{that can be taken}} into account in order to improve compression. Pre-processing deals with these properties by applying {{a number of}} transformations that make the redundancy “more visible ” to the compressor. One of the most commonly used concepts in text pre-processing is called Capital Conversion. Words with capital letters are converted to their lowercase versions while signaling the change with a flag. This way, not only context similarities are increased but also dictionaries used for <b>word</b> <b>replacement</b> only need to contain words in their lowercase versions. <b>Word</b> <b>replacement</b> consists of replacing words with shorter codes which are references to their location in a dictionary. We propose the creation of “online ” dictionaries presenting different alternatives for word orderings- by frequency, prefix, sufix and frequency x size-of-word- and a new implementation of the Capital Conversion technique. In our implementation of Capital Conversion, only two flags are needed to deal with words that have capital letters.

40|$|The encoder-decoder {{framework}} for {{neural machine translation}} (NMT) has been shown effective in large data scenarios, but is much less effective for low-resource languages. We present a transfer learning method that significantly improves Bleu scores {{across a range of}} low-resource languages. Our key idea is to first train a high-resource language pair (the parent model), then transfer some of the learned parameters to the low-resource pair (the child model) to initialize and constrain training. Using our transfer learning method we improve baseline NMT models by an average of 5. 6 Bleu on four low-resource language pairs. Ensembling and unknown <b>word</b> <b>replacement</b> add another 2 Bleu which brings the NMT performance on low-resource machine translation close to a strong syntax based machine translation (SBMT) system, exceeding its performance on one language pair. Additionally, using the transfer learning model for re-scoring, we can improve the SBMT system by an average of 1. 3 Bleu, improving the state-of-the-art on low-resource machine translation.

40|$|Neuropsychological {{characteristics}} of verbal working memory (memory capacity, permanency, and {{different types of}} memory errors) of 43 healthy subjects of older age were compared with the anatomical {{characteristics of}} their brain structures (volume of the hippocampi and the caudate nuclei, size of the cingulate-cortex regions of both hemispheres). The obtained data demonstrate a correlation between the permanency of verbal- information maintenance and left caudate-nucleus volume and {{a positive correlation between}} associative-memory capacity and left hippocampus volume. A {{decline in the number of}} verbal-memory errors (confabulations) is related to the increased size of the left anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, verbal working-memory capacity and permanency correlate negatively with the size of the left posterior dorsal cingulate cortex, whereas the number of fluctuations and <b>word</b> <b>replacements</b> correlate positively with the increased size of this brain region.

40|$|Linguistic {{evolution}} mirrors cultural evolution, {{of which}} one of the most decisive steps was the "agricultural revolution" that occurred 11, 000 years ago in W. Asia. Traditional comparative historical linguistics becomes inaccurate for time depths greater than, say, 10 kyr. Therefore {{it is difficult to determine}} whether decisive events in human prehistory have had an observable impact on human language. Here we supplement the traditional methodology with independent statistical measures showing that following the transition to agriculture, languages of W. Asia underwent a transition from biconsonantal (2 c) to triconsonantal (3 c) morphology. Two independent proofs for this are provided. Firstly the reconstructed Proto-Semitic fire and hunting lexicons are predominantly 2 c, whereas the farming lexicon is almost exclusively 3 c in structure. Secondly, while Biblical verbs show the usual Zipf exponent of about 1, their 2 c subset exhibits a larger exponent. After the 2 c > 3 c transition, this could arise from a faster decay in the frequency of use of the less common 2 c verbs. Using an established frequency-dependent <b>word</b> <b>replacement</b> rate, we calculate that the observed increase in the Zipf exponent has occurred over the 7, 500 years predating Biblical Hebrew namely, starting with the transition to agriculture...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} study {{aimed to}} research the origins and languages from which the picture storybooks were translated and published in Taiwan in year 2001, to identify the major themes and genres of those translated picture storybooks, and also to examine the language and cultural suitability of {{a small number of}} translated picture storybooks. A two-step research design of content analysis was applied as research methodology, and two sets of research questions were asked. The subject that was investigated in the study was English-to-Chinese picture storybooks from Taiwan. Step one was to survey the picture storybooks in Chinese translation in aspects of country of origin, language, publishers, themes, and genre. A total of 276 children's picture storybooks in Chinese translation were included for examination. Step two was to analyze the translations of 13 books through a content analysis. The in-depth content analysis tried to answer the question: What are patterns in the changes made in the Chinese translation of picture storybooks at the lexical, semantic, aesthetic and cultural levels? The findings of the broad survey showed that the picture storybooks that publishers in Taiwan selected for translation and publication in year 2001 were mostly imported from English speaking countries (the United States and Great Britain), Japan and German speaking countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland). English, German and Japanese were the three predominant languages from which the Chinese versions of the stories were translated. A wide range of themes were found in the stories, and fantasy and realistic fiction were the two major genre identified. It was found in the study {{that the majority of the}} books selected to be translated and published in Taiwan in 2001 were universal books, rather than culturally specific books.

Standard SMT features are enhanced with a number of new features aimed at scoring translations produced by using different replacements. Active learning is used to discriminatively train the model parameters from human assessments of the quality of translations. The learning framework yields an SMT system which is able to deal with sentences containing OOV words but also guarantees that the performance is not degraded for input sentences without OOV words. Results of experiments on English-French translation show that this method outperforms previous work addressing OOV words in terms of acceptability. ...|$|R
40|$|Because {{chains of}} {{semantic}}ally related words express semantic continuity, such lexical chains {{can play an}} important role in the detection of malapropisms. A malapropism is a correctly spelled word that does not fit in the context where it is used because it is the result of a spelling error on a different word that was intended. I first assume that such a word has much less probability of being inserted in any chain with other words. If this assumption is correct, words that failed to be inserted with other words can be considered as potential malapropisms. A mechanism that generates spelling replacements can then be used to generate replacement candidates. The second assumption is that whenever a spelling replacement can be inserted in a chain with other <b>words,</b> this <b>replacement</b> is likely to be the intended word for which a malapropism has been substituted.
