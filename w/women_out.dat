5|$|In {{addition}} to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagon loads of machinery {{and raw materials}} to the new factory. Few if any useful artillery shells were produced at the plant. When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory's low output, Schindler bought finished goods {{on the black market}} and resold them as his own. The rations provided by the SS were insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the workers, so Schindler spent most of his time in Kraków, obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and other basic needs. Schindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3,000 Jewish <b>women</b> <b>out</b> of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war.|$|E
5|$|The Navy {{established}} five separation {{centers for}} the demobilization of the WAVES and Navy nurses, one in Washington, D.C., Memphis, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. The separation process began on 1 October 1945, {{and within a}} month about 9,000 WAVES had been separated. By the end of 1946, almost 21,000 more had been discharged. It soon became apparent that more centers were needed and ten additional centers were soon opened. By September 1946, demobilization of the WAVES was all but completed. Most women spent {{two or three days}} at separation centers before being discharged, having physical exams; orientation on rights as veterans; final settlement of pay, and then the price of a ticket home. At the time, it was not clear whether demobilization meant phasing <b>women</b> <b>out</b> of the military services altogether.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 <b>women</b> <b>out</b> {{of the sex}} trade. Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E

25|$|Also spelled langsuir or lang suyar, {{it is said}} to be {{the ghost}} of a woman who died while giving birth to a {{stillborn}} child which turns into a pontianak, or during pregnancy before the forty days of uncleanness have expired. The mother's grief changes her into a type of flying banshee. To prevent a pregnant woman's corpse from becoming a lang suir, glass beads are placed into the mouth, an egg is placed in each armpit, and needles are placed in the hands. The lang suir can appear as a beautiful woman with long nails (a traditional mark of beauty), ankle-length hair and dressed in green. They also have the ability to take the form of an owl with long talons. Being fond of eating fish, they usually haunt coastal areas and attack pregnant <b>women</b> <b>out</b> of jealousy. It is possible to tame a lang suir by cutting off her long nails and stuffing the hair into the hole at the back of her neck.|$|E

Initially offered freedom if he can solve the puzzle in a dark room, this {{turns out to be a}} feint to further provoke his neuroses. He then finds himself in a medieval castle where his love Ellen is apparently slowly dying due to a spell cast on her by her wicked stepmother. The castle is full of deceptive characters who make contradictory demands and whom Ted cannot decide whether to trust, and surrounded by wolves who are slowly closing in. Ted eventually finds a way to redeem both himself and Ellen, and is presented with a door to the surface world, which is irradiated and uninhabitable.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Germanic {{societies}} {{were reported}} by the Romans to drink ale, made predominantly of fermented honey, produced by women. Until monasteries took over the production of alcoholic beverages in the 11th century, making it a profession for monks and nuns, brewing was the domain of tribal Germanic women. Migratory Germanic tribe women typically brewed their meads and ales in the forest, to avoid pillages by invaders. Their beverages did not contain hops, which was first recommended as an additive by St. Hildegard of Bingen. Because hops served as a preservative, the shelf life of beer became longer, though the addition of it, also increased the cost of brewing. In the decades before the Black Death, in Europe, many households required {{a large amount of}} ale and women used the opportunity to make extra money at home. In Brigstock, some women obtained licenses to brew over several months. Women in northern England were the main brewers for the community. As with other places in Europe, the founding of guilds often forced <b>women</b> <b>out</b> of the brewing industry; however, in Haarlem, in the Netherlands, because women were allowed to inherit guild membership from spouses, many women continued in the profession. Data collected on the period between 1518 and 1663, showed that 97 brewsters three-quarters of whom were widows, were operating among the 536 total brewers in the city.|$|E
