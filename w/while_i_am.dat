25|$|Our apprehensions {{are raised}} by very {{different}} objects. You seem to dread {{the prevalence of}} Paine's opinions (which in most parts I detest {{as much as you}} do) <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> much more afraid of the total annihilation of all principles of liberty and resistance, an event which I am sure you would be as sorry to see as I. We both hate the two extremes equally, but we differ in opinions with respect to the quarter from which the danger is most pressing.|$|E
25|$|After God created Adam, who was alone, He said, 'It is {{not good}} for man to be alone.' He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith {{immediately}} began to fight. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to be the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.' But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

500|$|Foraker {{became popular}} during his {{governorship}} for [...] "waving the bloody shirt", that is, castigating the South for the Civil War. [...] President Cleveland in 1887 requested northern governors to return captured Confederate battle flags. [...] When Foraker {{was asked by}} a supporter if he would allow the banners to go South, he responded by telegraph, [...] "No rebel flags will be returned <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> governor." [...] Cleveland backed down, and Foraker was hailed as a hero by many, receiving thousands of congratulatory messages. Foraker criticized the President for vetoing a bill increasing war pensions and for going fishing on Decoration Day. When the governor visited Philadelphia later that year for the centennial of the Constitution, he rode {{at the head of}} a regiment of Ohio militia past the reviewing stand on which Cleveland stood. [...] When Foraker saluted, Cleveland removed his hat, but did not bow slightly as he had for other state governors. [...] Later that day, Foraker led a troop of Grand Army of the Republic veterans past Cleveland's reviewing stand in another parade, bearing an array of captured battle flags.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Craigie {{bought the}} house in 1791; Craigie {{had been the first}} Apothecary General of the American army. In his ballroom, Craigie hosted Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the father of Queen Victoria. While living in the home, he married the {{daughter}} of a Nantucket clergyman, 22-year-old Elizabeth Craigie, 17 years her elder. Craigie overspent in trying to restore the home and, when he died in 1819, he left his wife Elizabeth in great debt; Mrs. Craigie took in boarders to support herself, most often people connected to nearby Harvard University. Short-term residents of the home included Jared Sparks, Edward Everett, and Joseph Emerson Worcester. Sparks, who moved into the home in April 1833, was then preparing a biography of Washington based on original documents. He recorded in his journal: [...] "It is a singular circumstance that, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> engaged in preparing for the press the letters of General Washington which he wrote at Cambridge after taking command of the American army, I should occupy the same rooms that he did at that time." [...] Another lodger was Sarah Lowell, an aunt of James Russell Lowell.|$|E
500|$|On November 24, 2015, Frusciante {{announced}} that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008-2013 on his own official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t read my press, but I heard about this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] Obviously I have a public audience. I am aware of them, and they know who they are." [...] He continues, [...] "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, at this point, I have no particular audience in mind <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> making music." ...|$|E

500|$|After Alexander's {{death in}} 323BC, Demosthenes again urged the Athenians to seek {{independence}} from Macedon in {{what became known}} as the Lamian War. However, Antipater, Alexander's successor, quelled all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides, among others. Following his request, the ecclesia adopted a decree condemning the most prominent anti-Macedonian agitators to death. Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of Kalaureia (modern-day Poros), where he was later discovered by Archias, a confidant of Antipater. He committed suicide before his capture by taking poison out of a reed, pretending he wanted to write a letter to his family. When Demosthenes felt that the poison was working on his body, he said to Archias: [...] "Now, as soon as you please you may commence the part of Creon in the tragedy, and cast out this body of mine unburied. But, O gracious Neptune, I, for my part, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> yet alive, arise up and depart out of this sacred place; though Antipater and the Macedonians have not left so much as the temple unpolluted." [...] After saying these words, he passed by the altar, fell down and died. Years after Demosthenes's suicide, the Athenians erected a statue to honour him and decreed that the state should provide meals to his descendants in the Prytaneum.|$|E
500|$|A paid-content {{expansion}} titled [...] "GoatZ" [...] {{was released}} on 7 May 2015 as downloadable content for the game on personal computers and a stand-alone application for mobile devices. It was developed by Coffee Stain's partner studio Gone North Games. The expansion's content spoofs zombie-based survival games, such as DayZ, and includes a new map and gameplay aspects such as fighting off zombies and crafting. The title itself plays off DayZ {{as well as a}} play on the Internet meme goatse.cx. In a cross-promotional [...] "GoatBread" [...] update with Bossa Studios' I am Bread to be offered in late 2015, a free update to Goat Simulator will allow the players to select a piece of bread as their avatar, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Bread will add in a [...] "RAMpage" [...] mode based on Goat Simulator. Another add-on, the [...] "Super Secret DLC" [...] package part of a cross-promotion with Overkill Software's Payday 2; the Payday-inspired content for Goat Simulator included additional playable characters including a camel, flamingo, and a dolphin in a wheelchair, while Goat Simulator content will be added to Payday 2. These were released in January 2016. Goat Simulator decorative content will be added to Rocket League in a mid-2016 update. Another expansion, [...] "Waste of Space", was again developed by Gone North Games and released on 26 May 2016. The expansion features a new map based on a space colony, and spoofs much of the recent science fiction media genre.|$|E

2500|$|With his new brigade, Potts {{had a new}} set of {{battalion}} commanders, who {{he proceeded}} to push to meet his high standards. His methods did not always meet with approval from his superiors. Meanwhile, he was distressed to hear news of his former charges in 21st Brigade. Under Dougherty at Gona they had been thrown against an entrenched Japanese force, which had been massively underestimated in strength. Many good men who had fought alongside Potts in the Middle East and Kokoda died at Gona.

He wrote that “the (guns) will never go (to Italy) <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> CIGS”. He also urged him not to promise, on his forthcoming visit to London, that he could win the war that year but simply to say that his Flanders plan was the best plan, which Robertson agreed it was, so that the politicians would not “dare” overrule both men.|$|E
