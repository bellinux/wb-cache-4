5|$|Until {{the recent}} past, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the interests of Third World countries. This is because most international relations scholars have come from the industrialized, First World nations. As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests of the world have slowly started to shift. However, First World nations still have many more universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has made it very difficult for Third World countries to gain legitimacy and respect <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> ideas and methods of looking at the world.|$|E

5|$|British Railways {{undertook}} a massive programme to establish itself by repainting all its locomotives <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> BR numbers and replacing their previous corporate identity with its own. Gone were the tenders proclaiming the railway companies' logos, emblems and even coats of arms, {{to be replaced}} by the stark 'BRITISH RAILWAYS' lettering. The enormity of this task meant that the necessary repainting was not necessarily carried out to coincide with an overall repaint. For the Coronation Class, all locomotives had been through this process by the end of 1948 except for Nos. 6223, 6238, 6248, 6250, and 6252–6255, a total of 29 locomotives.

Realizing none of their powers are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit Professor Frink. They visit his house to find him not there, but they stumble upon a portal that sends them to a place called the Game Engine where all video games are made. After saving him from a giant gorilla, Frink gives them The Simpsons Games player's guide to teach them how to better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid Captain McCallister in beating back mind-controlled dolphins that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the Lard Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they rescue Cletus from the aliens.|$|E
5|$|Iori is {{a violent}} and sadistic person {{who suffers from}} trauma because of his clan's past. In ancient times, the Yagami clan {{was known as the}} Yasakani. With the help of the Yata and Kusanagi clans, they sealed the demon Orochi. As time passed, the Yasakani, tired of living {{in the shadow of the}} Kusanagi, made a blood pact with Orochi. This gave them greater powers, but in return, they and their {{descendants}} were forever cursed. They renamed their clan the Yagami and set out to destroy the Kusanagi <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> powers.

5|$|Milk's {{early career}} {{was marked by}} {{frequent}} changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at George W. Hewlett High School on Long Island. In 1956, he met Joe Campbell, at the Jacob Riis Park beach, a popular location for gay men in Queens. Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. Even after they moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems. Growing bored <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>New</b> York lives, they {{decided to move to}} Dallas, Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York, where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm. Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years; it would be his longest relationship.|$|E
5|$|Okehampton Castle is {{a medieval}} motte and bailey castle in Devon, England. It was built between 1068 and 1086 by Baldwin FitzGilbert {{following}} a revolt in Devon against Norman rule, and formed {{the centre of}} the Honour of Okehampton, guarding a crossing point across the West Okement River. It continued in use as a fortification until the late 13th century, when its owners, the de Courtenays, became the Earls of Devon. <b>With</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> wealth, they redeveloped the castle as a luxurious hunting lodge, building a new deer park that stretched out south from the castle, and constructing fashionable lodgings that exploited the views across the landscape. The de Courtenays prospered and the castle was further expanded to accommodate their growing household.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{teaching}} style differed from conventional music instruction {{at the time}} in that she required instrumental students to study voice. Piano, organ and violin instruction was offered by 1907. Organ was under the instruction of Gertrude Madeira Smith, Eleanor's sister, and violin was taught by Charles Moerenhout of the Chicago Orchestra. Five assistants also helped the teachers. Smith felt that adding vocal training gave a level of experience that was neglected by singular focus on memorization of scales and structural drills usually prevalent for those learning instruments. She also incorporated songs from the students' homelands as a way to intermingle their old cultures <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> lives and made effort to involve the parents {{in the development of the}} curricula. As a progressive reformer, Smith advocated that inclusive diversity was a means of building a cosmopolitan citizenry united by pursuit of music excellence. She also encouraged students to compose music from their earliest instruction and to recover songs from their cultural backgrounds.|$|E

5|$|The England {{selectors}} {{surprised the}} cricket public <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> appointment as captain, selecting {{a player who}} many believed owed his appointment more to his father than his own ability. Chris Cowdrey {{was the son of}} Colin Cowdrey, an England captain in the 1960s and later given a knighthood and then life peerage for his services to the sport; Chris Cowdrey was also godson of the chairman of selectors, Peter May. Cowdrey was a successful captain of Kent in county cricket, but had played just five Tests previously, during the 1984–85 tour to India, captained by David Gower. He became only the second son to follow his father as captain of the England cricket team, after George Mann in the 1940s followed Frank Mann in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The Pacifist run can be {{obtained}} only after the player has completed one Neutral run through the game {{in which he has}} not murdered any of the monsters and has befriended Papyrus and Undyne. The player befriends Alphys and discovers her true laboratory. It is revealed that Asriel was reincarnated as Flowey, created by Alphys as a vessel of determination (the power that allows Frisk and Flowey to save game files in order to resurrect) as well as an intended surprise for Asgore. The player then returns to fight Asgore, but Toriel intervenes and is joined by the other monsters the human has befriended. Flowey ambushes the group, using the souls of all the monsters to take an older Asriel's form to fight the human and initiate an Apocalypse. The human connects <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> friends during the fight, eventually triumphing. Asriel reverts to his child form, destroys the barrier, and expresses his remorse to the others before leaving. The human falls unconscious, and is awoken to see their friends surrounding them, with the knowledge of the human's name – Frisk. The monsters reintegrate with the humans on the surface, while Frisk has the option of accepting Toriel as their adoptive mother or striking out on their own.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{revolution in}} England and the tariff {{policies of the}} British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute for saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called kambli. This economic fallout {{led to the formation}} of community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.|$|E

5|$|The two new Panther battalions – the 51st and 52nd – {{together}} {{equipped with}} 200 Panthers, {{for which the}} offensive had been delayed, were attached to the Großdeutschland Division in the XLVIII Panzer Corps of Army Group South. With the 51st and 52nd Battalions arriving on 30 June and 1 July, the two units had little time to perform reconnaissance or to orient themselves to the terrain they found themselves in. This was a breach of the methods of the Panzerwaffe, considered essential for the successful use of armour. Though led by experienced panzer commanders, many of the tank crews were new recruits and had little time to become familiar <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> tanks, let alone train together {{to function as a}} unit. The two battalions came direct from the training ground and lacked combat experience. In addition, the requirement to maintain radio silence until the start of the attack meant that the Panther units had little training in battalion-level radio procedures. Furthermore, the new Panthers were still experiencing problems with their transmissions, and proved mechanically unreliable. By the morning of 5 July, the units had lost 16 Panthers due to mechanical breakdown, leaving only 184 available for the launching of the offensive.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} familiar <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> shadows, {{the party}} travels to Talta village, befriending Marumaro on the way, who also possesses a magical shadow. Finding that the villagers from Talta {{have started to}} head towards {{the capital city of}} Jibral, the party takes off after them. Just outside Jibral, the party finds the villagers attacked by Steel-Eating Tigers. They are saved by the arrival of King Jibral and his forces, including Zola. Once the villagers are brought to Jibral, the King decides to implement a plan to destroy one of Nene's bases near Jibral using Shu and his friends along with Zola. Together, the party works with the warriors of Talta Village the Jibral Kingdom to besiege Nene's Mechat base. After the base is destroyed, the party heads north in search of Nene. Nene captures Kluke, and places a collar around her neck which Nene alleges will explode. After reaching Nene, Zola separates from the party to buy them time to attack Nene. When the party attempts to remove Kluke's collar, Nene absorbs the party's shadows by placing collars on all of them. After taking their powers and placing them in himself, he removes their collars and attempts to kill them before they recover. Shu, despite being drained of magical ability, unconsciously teleports the party to the distant Devour village.|$|E
5|$|After the {{televised}} draft, Joey Styles, the Director of Digital Media Content for WWE's official website, interviewed the draftees on their reactions. The drafted wrestlers generally expressed {{approval of the}} draft and described what they hoped their experiences would be <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>new</b> brand. Seven of the wrestlers were champions with their original brand, and as outlined in the draft regulations, they carried their titles over to their new brand; this affected seven of nine championships. Champion draft selections included: Unified Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Carlito and Primo), United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter, WWE Champion Triple H, and Divas Champion Maryse from SmackDown to Raw; Women's Champion Melina and Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio from Raw to SmackDown. Since Triple H was drafted to Raw, it left SmackDown without a top contested title, as Raw now featured {{two of the three}} top contested championships in WWE: the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships (although Edge would later brought the World Heavyweight Championship title back to SmackDown as its exclusive-top title following his win against John Cena at Backlash). When Mysterio and Porter switched brands, the two secondary championships switched brands {{for the first time in}} WWE's history. This also occurred when Melina and Maryse switched brands, as the two female contested titles also switched brands for the first time. Though the Unified Tag Team Champions were both drafted over to Raw from SmackDown, the titles were able to be defended on all three brands due to being unified.|$|E
