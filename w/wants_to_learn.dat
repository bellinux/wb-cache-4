Meanwhile in New York, Michael is nervous about why David Wallace wants to meet with him. But as the meeting begins, David tells him Scranton is the most successful Dunder Mifflin branch amid a difficult economic climate, and he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> why Michael's management has been so successful.

500|$|On {{a stormy}} Cambridge night, Nina lets herself in to an office, {{where she is}} found by Professor Nigel Squires. He is holding a gun, {{but it is not}} loaded. Nina's boyfriend Simon is a fan of cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. She has come to the office of Squires—a classicist who sets crosswords for Varsity as the Sphinx—to seek the answers to the next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: [...] "I teach wild {{creature}} without hospital building" [...] results in ARCHITECTURE, which Simon studies. They turn to the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the Sphinx because she would asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was [...] "devious and deadly". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the cut-throat world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered DOWNANDOUT and WRAP; Squires answers DESI and helps with TRENT. Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; with her excuse being that she only <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn.</b> Together, they deduce SWAMPLANDS, meaning [...] "bog". Nina, though, suggests that is should be bogs, otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly spluttering, Squires takes a seat, as Nina begins on the next clue. She suddenly displays clear proficiency, answering ASPHYXIATION.|$|E
