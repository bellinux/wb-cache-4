Guest's application was accepted by return of post and {{he was asked to}} report early in July 1910. Champion's practice, as Deputy Sheriff, consisted mainly of debt-collecting and lending money to doubtful borrowers at a high rate of interest.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{prior to}} The Beatles' first American visit, Brian Epstein <b>wanted</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> manage the {{escalating}} volume of merchandising requests that NEMS found itself unable to cope with, and asked his lawyer, David Jacobs, to oversee this task. Jacobs knew Nicky Byrne {{and asked him}} if he would be interested in taking over the merchandising subdivision from NEMS altogether, paying NEMS a commission. Byrne accepted the offer subject to a 90% rate, leaving only 10% for the Beatles and NEMS combined. Completely unaware of the potential market that existed, particularly in America, Epstein agreed to the deal, and subsequently lost The Beatles an estimated $100,000,000 in possible income.|$|E

500|$|Mather, who <b>wanted</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> help {{publicize}} {{the need for}} an independent agency to oversee the national parks movement, personally paid Yard's salary from his independent income. [...] The United States had authorized 14 parks and 22 monuments over the previous forty years (1872–1915), but there was no single agency to provide unified management of the resources. [...] In addition, some resources were managed by political appointees without professional qualifications. [...] Together Mather and Yard ran a national parks publicity campaign for the Department of the Interior, writing numerous articles that praised the scenic qualities of the parks and their possibilities for educational, inspirational and recreational benefits. [...] The unprecedented press coverage persuaded influential Americans about the importance of national parks, and encouraged Congress to create an independent parks agency.|$|E
500|$|When Dean Winters {{departed}} from the show and a permanent replacement for the Brian Cassidy character was needed, Hurd had trouble convincing network officials she was correct for the part. Ted Kotcheff, the show's co-executive producer, {{said it was too}} redundant to have two man-woman sets of partners, with protagonists Elliot Stabler and Olivia Benson already partnered together. Kotcheff felt Munch and Jeffries pairing diluted the relationship of Stabler and Benson because it was a [...] "mirror image" [...] of their partnership. Although Hurd felt more female characters should be part of a sex crimes unit, she said, [...] "I understand the industry, and what networks want, and they <b>wanted</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> have an impact, a rating."

Popjustice commented that every song on the album has [...] "gone through a bit of a Stuart Price filter so that it doesn't sound like some dickhead [...] A has just aimlessly scooped a load of tracks off a shelf". Aphrodite marked the first time Minogue enlisted an executive producer; discussing the process, she said [...] "It was just the best experience, and funnily enough I think it's the most cohesive album I've had since the beginning of my career, back in the PWL days, where by its very nature made it cohesive. There's a lot to be said for working with different producers and trying different stuff which has worked really well for me in the past but I definitely <b>wanted</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> tie this together as Stuart has done so beautifully [...] so that it existed as a real body of work". Minogue and Price subjected songs on Aphrodite to a [...] "Parton Test", as they [...] "knew a song would work if it made sense when sung in the style of Dolly Parton".

2500|$|After {{switching}} to ABC Records {{in the late}} 1960s, he found himself {{at the top of}} the charts again, beginning with the first song he recorded, [...] "I'll Take Care of Your Cares". Written as a waltz in the mid-1920s, [...] "Cares" [...] had become the unofficial theme song of the Las Vegas call girls, but was virtually unknown outside of the Strip. Laine recorded a swinging version that made it to number 39 on the national and number 2 on the adult contemporary charts.

The last song was a number one hit on the adult contemporary chart (#24 national), and proved that Laine was as big a hit-maker as ever. His last single to hit the Billboard Hot 100 chart (peaking at No.86 national) was [...] "Dammit Isn't God's Last Name".|$|E

Condit's attorney said that Dunne's comments [...] "conveyed that Gary Condit was involved in her kidnapping and in her murder, that friends of Gary Condit had her kidnapped, put in an airplane and dropped in the Atlantic Ocean." [...] Dunne paid an undisclosed amount to settle that lawsuit in March 2005. [...] Dunne said he had been [...] "completely hoodwinked" [...] by an unreliable informant. [...] Subsequently Condit sued Dunne again, charging him with [...] "revivifying" [...] the slander in an appearance on Larry King Live in November 2005.

[...] He thus <b>wanted</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> go to the capital Chang'an to help him maintain good relations with powerful individuals on his behalf. [...] Xianyu recommended Yang Zhao.

[...] The sisters and cousins of Consort Yang thus repeatedly praised and recommended both Zhangqiu and Yang Zhao, and further pointed out to Emperor Xuanzong Yang Zhao's abilities to entertain by gambling.

2500|$|Australia {{toured the}} West Indies in 1954–55, and their all-rounder Keith Miller thought that Sobers {{would become a}} better batsman than bowler despite batting in the lower-order. Sobers was not {{selected}} for the First Test, which the West Indies lost by nine wickets. However, he regained his place for the Second Test in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The match was a high-scoring draw, with Sobers scoring 47 and eight not out. He was barely used with the ball, bowling three overs for ten runs, as Australia amassed a first-innings total of over 600. Sobers was given a further opportunity in the next Test in Georgetown, Guyana (British Guiana at the time) in South America. Despite scoring only 12 and 11 with the bat, he took three wickets in the Australians' first innings. Nevertheless, Australia won by eight wickets. West Indian captain and opening batsman Jeff Stollmeyer twisted his ankle after treading on a ball ahead of the Fourth Test in Barbados, [...] "triggering huge debate about who should open." [...] Eventually, Sobers was chosen to open the innings after Australia had amassed another total of over 600. Sobers had a suspicion he might be asked to do the job. [...] "I couldn't see them sending in anyone else — I was a bowler with a little ability as a batsman and they <b>wanted</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> help see off the shine and protect the three W's." [...] Sobers struck his first three deliveries for boundaries, all from the bowling of Miller. In the fast-bowler's second over, Sobers hit him for another three fours. He was eventually dismissed for 43 out of a first-wicket partnership of 52 with JK Holt. The match was drawn, and Sobers took one wicket in the Australians' only innings, before scoring 11 in the West Indies second innings. The home team were again defeated in the Fifth and final Test in Jamaica. Sobers performed with the bat, however, scoring 35 not out and 64.|$|E
2500|$|On March 2, 1981, Stern {{began his}} third morning job at WWDC, a rock station in Washington, D.C. He was {{determined}} to become a success, and noticed the importance of news segments for satire. He wished for a news person to riff {{with him in the}} studio. Management paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a news anchor and consumer reporter from WFBR in Baltimore, who agreed to meet Stern after hearing him interview a prostitute on the air. Quivers at first [...] "thought I would come in and do the news...but it wasn't that way...he <b>wanted</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> play off of...he wanted a real live person there with him". The show began to break format, and Stern held a lesbian edition of [...] "Dial-a-Date" [...] in May 1981. He formed the Think Tank, a cohesive trio of male listeners who conversed with Stern and played along with quizzes and routines, which helped the show sound more natural. By January 1982, Stern had the second highest-rated morning program in the city. On January 14, one day after the crash of Air Florida Flight 90, Stern made believe he asked Air Florida the price of a one-way ticket to the 14th Street Bridge, the location of the disaster. [...] "Is that going to be a permanent stop?" [...] asked Stern. On June 29, 1982, Stern's contract at WWDC was terminated. He writes that the Air Florida segment was not the reason for his departure, nor did anyone complain about it. He had signed a contract with WNBC in March, and began to berate management and other DJ's on the air. Quivers, who left the show early on June 17, worked at WCBM in Baltimore until rejoining with Stern on October 18, 1982. Stern presented a farewell show two weeks later on competing station WAVA-FM. He had more than tripled the station's ratings during his stay.|$|E
