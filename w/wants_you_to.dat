A Simple Plan marked the second on-screen collaboration between Paxton and Thornton after One False Move (1992). Thornton recalled, [...] "I {{got a call from}} one of my agents who said, 'John Boorman <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do a script that I sent you a year ago and you never read,' I said, 'Send it to me again, and this time I'll really read it.'

500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> grow and He <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> have a purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able}} to get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E
500|$|Certain {{aspects of}} Windows 8.1 were also {{cause for concern}} because of their privacy implications. In his review of Windows 8.1, Joel Hruska noted that Microsoft had {{deliberately}} made it harder for users to create a [...] "Local" [...] account that is not tied to a Microsoft account for syncing, as it [...] " [...] clear that the company really, really, <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> share everything you do with it, and that’s not something {{an increasing number of}} people and businesses are comfortable doing." [...] Woody Leonhard of InfoWorld noted that by default Windows 8.1's [...] "Smart Search" [...] system sends search queries and other information to Microsoft, which could be used for targeted advertising. Leonhard considered this to be ironic, given that Microsoft had criticized Google's use of similar tactics with its [...] "Scroogled" [...] advertising campaign.|$|E

500|$|All of {{the music}} was written by Cute Is What We Aim For, while all of the lyrics were written by Hacikyan. Typically, when Hacikyan wrote lyrics he had a melody in mind, which the band fit the music around. Hacikyan {{described}} the album as being about [...] "the everyday ins-and-outs of social cliques. It’s about the pressure that they put on you, {{to live up to}} something that you’re not, to be somebody that someone else <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be." [...] The Academy Is... vocalist William Beckett provides guest vocals on [...] "There's a Class for This," [...] while All Time Low performed group vocals on [...] "Teasing to Please (Left Side, Strong Side)" [...] and [...] "Sweet Talk 101." [...] Hacikyan described Beckett as [...] "definitely an idol of mine." [...] Beckett was unable to come to the studio to record his part as he was on tour at the time. Instead, his part was recorded at the back of a tour bus and sent to the band.|$|E
500|$|Other critics voiced more {{negative}} {{opinions of the}} track. Richard S. He of The Guardian heard [...] "zero pitch correction on her vocal", and criticized this decision by adding that [...] "Gaga <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hear the blue notes, the cracks in her voice. Unfortunately the cracks are all you hear." [...] Spin referred to the single as a [...] "swing and a miss". USA Today likened the track to Gaga's past work and said, [...] "While not perfect, it's buoyant and fun enough, we suppose. Just not groundbreaking." [...] Pitchforks Jillian Mapes felt that [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] did {{not live up to}} its significant anticipation, criticizing the song's production and Gaga's vocal performance. While ranking Lady Gaga's lead singles from worst to best, Billboard listed [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] as second-worst, ahead of only [...] "Applause" [...] (2013). Rolling Stone ranked it number 28 on their Best Songs of 2016 list, stating, [...] "Gaga fuses her neo-folkie Lilith-hippie mode with her disco roots in this Mark Ronson-produced dance-floor confession." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{unexpected}} {{success of their}} first album, there was tremendous demand for new music from Casting Crowns. Although lead vocalist Mark Hall, who either wrote or co-wrote all the songs on the album, felt [...] "a little worried" [...] about the band's follow-up album, fellow recording artists Steven Curtis Chapman (who co-produced the band's first album) and Mac Powell of Christian rock band Third Day encouraged Hall to [...] "say what God <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> say". They also advised him to not worry about commercial expectations or whether [...] "people are going to like it". Ultimately, Hall [...] "absorbed" [...] the feedback their first record had received, using it as inspiration.

Hall responded to critics who felt the band's material was [...] "preaching to the choir" [...] by saying [...] "How can writing songs that challenge the church, songs that ask Christians to consider their actions, be a bad thing?

500|$|Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses is Slipknot's {{first album}} {{that does not}} warrant a Parental Advisory label, mainly because the lyrics of Vol. 3, {{compared}} to other Slipknot albums, are much less explicit in terms of profanity and obscure dark themes. The special edition still has a Parental Advisory label. In a 2008 interview, guitarist Mick Thomson explained that vocalist Corey Taylor {{made a point of}} avoiding the use of profanity in response to claims that he relied on use of it. Only two instances of profanity occur; {{the use of the word}} [...] "bitched" [...] in Duality and [...] "bastards" [...] which appears in the monologue leading into [...] "Pulse of the Maggots". According to AllMusic, the lyrics of Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) include metaphors and touch on themes that include anger, disaffection, and psychosis. Taylor's diversity in his vocal delivery was praised; Burns considered tracks like [...] "Vermilion Pt. 2" [...] to have [...] "stately vocal harmonies". Taylor's performance on the closing track [...] "Danger – Keep Away" [...] was specifically praised; Stylus called it the most [...] "depressing and emotional" [...] track on the album.

Roy's portrayer, David Denman, reported he was [...] "really grateful" [...] that executive producer Greg Daniels allowed his character to develop, [...] "where all of a sudden, he wasn’t just a complete idiot but felt bad for being a bad boyfriend and wanted to try to get the girl back. It’s so rare to have that on a television show, because so often everyone <b>wants</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be the same character every week. It was quite refreshing creatively to get to do that." [...] Referring to Jim and Pam, Denman felt it was [...] "inevitable that Romeo and Juliet had to get together" [...] and end the series' love triangle. [...] "Otherwise," [...] he explained, [...] "it gets kind of tiring and old. I think it was the appropriate time , and I had such a great experience working with all those guys." [...] Denman also added that Daniels' decision stemmed from a desire to advance the Jim–Pam storyline [...] "to the next stage," [...] rather than having anything to do specifically with Denman himself. Denman briefly returned in the series' fifth, seventh, and ninth seasons.|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work.
