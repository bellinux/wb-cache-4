40|$|Marginal {{agricultural}} land provides opportunities to diversify landscapes by producing biomass for biofuel, and through floral provisioning that enhances arthropod-mediated ecosystem service delivery. We {{examined the effects}} of local spatial context (adjacent to woodland or agriculture) and irrigation (irrigation or no irrigation) on wildflower bloom and visitation by arthropods in a biofeedstocks-wildflower habitat buffer design. Twenty habitat buffer plots were established containing a subplot of Napier grass (Pennisetum perpureum Schumach) for biofeedstock, three commercial wildflower mix subplots, and a control subplot containing spontaneous weeds. Arthropods and flowers were visually observed in quadrats throughout the season. At {{the end of the season}} we measured soil nutrients and harvested Napier biomass. We found irrespective of buffer location or irrigation, pollinators were observed more frequently early in the season and on experimental plots with wildflowers than on weeds in the control plots. Natural enemies showed a tendency for being more common on plots adjacent to a <b>wooded</b> <b>border,</b> and were also more commonly observed early in the season. Herbivore visits were infrequent and not significantly influenced by experimental treatments. Napier grass yields were high and typical of first-year yields reported regionally, and were not affected by location context or irrigation. Our results suggest habitat management designs integrating bioenergy crop and floral resources provide marketable biomass and habitat for beneficial arthropods...|$|E

40|$|Some habitat {{traits and}} haematic {{parameters}} were studied {{to understand the}} relationships between the hare densities, habitat characteristics and physiological and nutritional condition of the animals. A total of 33 protected areas, reserved for wild game reproduction, located in the Province of Florence (Central Italy), were monitored during a 2 -year period. In each protected area the hares were submitted to census. The habitat features of the protected areas were studied and the following parameters were categorised: altitude; cleared-land/total-land ratio; main exposure; main ground composition; water availability; main slope; anthropogenic presence; predator presence; wooded borders; presence of trees and shrubs; surveillance against hunting; demographic predator control; kind of cultivation; un-harvested crops for game. After the census the hares were captured for translocation outside in "free" hunting areas. During capture the hares were put in darkened, wooden capture-boxes and remained inside for a variable period of time (10 min to 3 h). A sample of 3 to 7 hares, captured per year and per each protected area, were removed from the boxes (physically restrained, with covered eyes) for blood sample collection, sex, age and live weight determination. The following analyses were performed on frozen plasma samples: ALanine aminoTransferase (ALT), ASpartate aminoTransferase (AST), glucose, cholesterol, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, and Cl concentrations. The relationship between hare density and habitat characteristics was analysed by single regressions analysis. Then the habitat characteristics were subjected to multivariate analysis in relationship to hare body condition. The haematic parameters were analysed by least square means considering habitat traits, animal density, age and sex, as main categorical factors, interaction sex*age, and "pregnant and non-reproducing" nested within sex. Results showed that the highest density and best body conditions can be found in highlands, open fields with low tree presence and <b>wooded</b> <b>borders,</b> medium mixture soils, scarce predator presence and limited anthropogenic presence and with abundant water availability and shrubbiness. The study of the absolute values of metabolic profile, indicator of the physiological and nutritional condition of the reared animals, did not show any nutritional winter deficiency in wild hares and, as census data, should be repeated for several years since, probably, only their variations can be used as indicators of preliminary problems...|$|R

5000|$|At Lilac, I-270 constricts to four lanes as {{it crosses}} the Mississippi River on the New Chain of Rocks Bridges. Approaching Missouri and {{entering}} Illinois, I-270 transitions from a suburban Interstate to an exurban Interstate with farm fields and <b>wooded</b> land <b>bordering</b> the Interstate {{in the area}} to the immediately east and west of the river crossing. Once it crosses the Chain of Rocks Canal, I-270 will intersect four different highways providing access to communities in eastern Madison County: IL 3, Old Alton Road, IL 203 and IL 111. The interchange with IL 3 is a partial cloverleaf with the loop ramps in the northeast and southeast quadrants. The remaining two are cloverleaf interchanges, with the Old Alton Road/IL 203 interchange using a collector-distributor system with two folded diamonds due to the presence of railroad tracks between the two roadways. Once it passes IL 111, the speed limit increases to 65 mph as the highway briefly becomes six lanes again with the junction with I-255. The highway then reverts to a four-lane highway offering diamond interchanges with IL 157 and IL 159 before meeting up with I-55/I-70 at the interchange that IDOT refers as the [...] "3 I's". The eastbound I-270 meets the northeastbound combination of I-55 and I-70 which leave the intersection as northbound I-55 and eastbound I-70 which has adopted I-270's mile markings.|$|R

40|$|Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s {{headwater}} prairie streams, once meandering {{within a}} landscape of tall grasses, marshes and <b>wooded</b> riparian <b>borders,</b> today exist {{in direct contact with}} an agricultural matrix. This study determined historic changes in surface water features of four small agricultural watersheds. Bear Creek watershed was once part of the 2 ̆ 2 wet prairie 2 ̆ 2 region located in the Des Moines Lobe landform of north-central Iowa. Storm Lake watershed, located in the Northwest Iowa Loess Prairies landform, was of a similar original condition with limited stream channel development. The Walnut Creek and Three Mile Creek watersheds are located in the Southern Iowa Rolling Loess Prairies landform, a more erosionally-mature region. Historical information about natural surface hydrology features of the four watersheds were obtained from General Land Office survey records of the mid- 18002 ̆ 7 s, original drainage districts maps from the early 19002 ̆ 7 s, county atlases and other historical sources. These data were integrated into a Geographical Information System and compared with modern features depicted on USGS topographical maps. Study results for the northern watersheds showed that nearly all of the original wetland features have been eliminated since settlement and replaced by streams largely of artificial origin. This historical acceleration of stream development includes dramatic increases in channel lengths and incision. In contrast, the southern watersheds have had many natural stream segments altered or eliminated by channelization and construction of impoundments (farm ponds). These findings are useful for establishing 2 ̆ 2 reference conditions 2 ̆ 2 of prairie hydrologic features and documenting historical effects of agricultural activity...|$|R
50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} for service as a Machine Gunner with Company I, Third Battalion, Twenty Seventh Marines, First Marine Division in the Republic of Vietnam on May 17, 1968. While on Operation ALLEN BROOK, Company I was approaching a dry river bed with a heavily <b>wooded</b> treeline that <b>bordered</b> the hamlet of Le Nam (1), when they suddenly came under intense mortar, rocket propelled grenades, automatic weapons and small arms fire from a large, well concealed enemy force which halted the company's advance and wounded several Marines. Realizing that key points of resistance had to be eliminated to allow the units to advance and casualties to be evacuated, Private First Class Burke, without hesitation, seized his machine gun and launched a series of one man assaults against the fortified emplacement. As he aggressively maneuvered to the edge of the steep river bank, he delivered accurate suppressive fire upon several enemy bunkers, which enabled his comrades to advance and move the wounded Marines to positions of relative safety. As he continued his combative actions, he located an opposing automatic weapons emplacement and poured intense fire into the position, killing three North Vietnamese soldiers as they attempted to flee. Private First Class Burke then fearlessly moved from one position to another, quelling the hostile fire until his weapon malfunctioned. Obtaining a casualty's rifle and hand grenades, he advanced further into the midst of the enemy. Observing that a fellow Marine had cleared his malfunctioning machine gun he grasped his weapon and moved into a dangerously exposed area and saturated the hostile treeline until he fell mortally wounded. Private First Class Burke's gallant actions upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|R
40|$|Opening in 1972, the Kansas City International Airport (MCI) has had {{numerous}} issues concerning white-tailed deer. The first documented deer strikes at MCI were in 1979 and 1980. Between 1996 and 2000, airport operations entered 39 reports of deer inside the fence on the AOA, or 0. 72 deer incursions per month, and 28 instances where deer {{were struck by}} vehicles on airport property. In one situation, a deer entered the airport terminal by breaking through a large glass window and injured three people. After a Wildlife Hazard Assessment was completed in 1997, Wildlife Services and MCI worked together closely to make several habitat modifications to the airport. Deer surveys during spring 2000 estimated 60 deer per square mile along {{the perimeter of the}} AOA. During the summer of 2000, over 800 acres of expired CRP land, mostly fescue, and 400 acres of brome grass, converted from grain production, was placed into a managed cattle grazing program. Over 9 miles of new fence was installed around these pastures that directly border the AOA. Other habitat modifications included removing over 50 acres of <b>wooded</b> tracts that <b>border</b> the AOA. After these modifications were incorporated, deer control was implemented beginning in January 2001. From 2001 to present, air operations entered only 12 reports of deer inside the fence, an 81 % reduction compared to 1996 - 2000, and perimeter deer surveys conducted in fall 2005 estimated 25. 5 deer per square mile, a 58 % reduction. Although FAA AC 5200 - 33 A section 2 - 6 a discourages livestock grazing on airport property, this specific livestock program has proved beneficial in reducing the attractiveness of the site to deer and other hazardous species. The program has provided income for MCI, prevented 1, 200 acres of land from being used for grain production, and allowed cattle to naturally reduce wildlife habitat. No cattle have entered into the AOA...|$|R
