25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{the problem}} became {{increasingly}} popular in scientific circles in Europe and the USA after the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica offered prizes for steps {{in solving the}} problem. Notable contributions were made by George Dantzig, Delbert Ray Fulkerson and Selmer M. Johnson from the RAND Corporation, who expressed the problem as an integer linear program and developed the cutting plane method for its solution. They wrote what is considered the seminal paper on the subject in which with these new methods they solved an instance with 49 cities to optimality by constructing a tour and proving that no other tour could be shorter. Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson, however, speculated that given a near optimal solution <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> find optimality or prove optimality by adding {{a small amount of}} extra inequalities (cuts). They used this idea to solve their initial 49 city problem using a string model. They found they only needed 26 cuts to come to a solution for their 49 city problem. While this paper did not give an algorithmic approach to TSP problems, the ideas that lay within it were indispensable to later creating exact solution methods for the TSP, though it would take 15 years to find an algorithmic approach in creating these cuts. As well as cutting plane methods, Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson used branch and bound algorithms perhaps for the first time.|$|E

[...] However, it was roundly rejected by Gordon Brown, then the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said that it was [...] "An idea that they say is sweeping the world, well sweeping Estonia, well a wing of the neo-conservatives in Estonia", and criticised it thus: [...] "The millionaire to pay exactly the same tax rate as the young nurse, the home help, the worker on the minimum wage".|$|E

2500|$|Set in the {{critical}} year of 1945, this novel focuses on farmer Mat Feltner's struggle over the news that his son Virgil has been listed as missing in action while also telling multiple tales {{of the lives of}} other Port William residents, such as Burley Coulter, Jack Beechum, Ernest Finley, Ida and Gideon Crop. Reprinting by North Point Press in 1983 allowed Berry to radically revise the novel, removing almost a third of its original length. Jeffrey Bilbro believes that these substantial changes marked growth in Berry's approach. [...] "In Berry's revised edition, his technique caught up with his subject. He allows us, as readers, to participate in the ignorance of his characters, and in doing so, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> understand more fully the painful difficulty of choosing fidelity to the natural order while living in the midst of mystery." ...|$|E

[...] Despite an awareness of the potentially lethal effects of asbestos, the factory site remained heavily contaminated: measurements taken in 1950 and again in 1957 showed levels of asbestos dust in the air outside the factory roof were between 18 and 60 particles per cubic centimetre - far above the company's own safe working level of 2 to 3 particles, while a measurement taken near houses outside the factory premises was 47 particles. In August 1957, Turner's revealed that they were dumping 15,000lb (6.8 tonnes) of asbestos dust recovered from ventilation filters alone each week. The same document reported that the levels of asbestos dust on the factory's roof exceeded those in the actual production areas inside the factory. In the 1950s people living near the factory joked that the area had frost all year round and the local woods were nicknamed [...] "the snow trees" [...] due to the permanent dusting with asbestos particles.|$|E

2500|$|McKenzie {{proposed}} {{outreach programs}} for the Nashville Black community. In early 1919, McKenzie wrote L. Hollingsworth Wood regarding his desire for Fisk to more aggressively engage with the Black community. McKenzie proposed a small fund to establishing a night school for local Blacks, provide extension work in Nashville, offer free weekly musical concerts, and offer continuing education programs for Black teachers and clergy in the South. McKenzie viewed summer school for Black church leaders, and student engagement in Black churches during Sunday services, as important tools for community engagement. [...] "If we had the funds we might gather a group of preachers for two weeks, or four weeks, or longer, and do them some good. As we develop our courses along religious and recreational lines we probably shall {{be able to develop}} the equivalent of a Y.M.C.A. training course, and <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> utilize our more advanced students to real advantage in the churches and Sunday schools of the city." [...] However, lack of funding precluded most of McKenzie's ideas from being implemented. Funding issues also hampered those efforts he did implement, including Bethlehem House, a settlement house where social service students trained. These efforts continued with McKenzie's successor, Thomas Elsa Jones, who in 1946 Fisk partnered with Tennessee State University to establish an extension program for [...] "functionally [...] illiterate" [...] Blacks in Nashville, an idea first envisioned by McKenzie in 1915.|$|E
