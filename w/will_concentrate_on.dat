5|$|During the {{ceremony}} of initiation, the candidate {{is expected to}} swear (usually on a volume of sacred text appropriate to his personal religious faith) to fulfil certain obligations as a Mason. In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit). There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, but on the whole, Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will further explore the ritual and symbolism of the craft, others will focus their involvement on the social side of the Lodge, while still others <b>will</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> the charitable functions of the lodge.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 2015, Albrecht {{announced}} he would sit {{out the rest of}} the season for the 2015–16 Wolverines team due to injuries. He <b>will</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> his continued recovery and the rehabilitation process following bilateral hip surgery this past summer. During his career at Michigan, Albrecht played in 115 career games, and was named Michigan's co-MVP during the 2014–15 season, after starting 18 of 31 games and posting a career-best 7.5 points per game, while battling hip problems. On March 29, Albrecht announced that he would use the graduate transfer option to play a fifth year at another school. On April 1, head coach John Beilein decided not to restrict Albrecht or teammate Ricky Doyle from transferring to schools within the Big Ten if they desired to do so. By April 18, Albrecht was considering interest from home state Big Ten programs Purdue and Indiana as well as Wichita State, Texas A, Syracuse, USC, and Milwaukee (where Michigan assistant coach LaVall Jordan had just taken over as head coach).|$|E

25|$|A vector bundle (E, p, M) is smooth, if E and M are smooth manifolds, p : E → M is {{a smooth}} map, {{and the local}} trivializations are diffeomorphisms. Depending on the {{required}} degree of smoothness, there are different corresponding notions of Cp bundles, infinitely differentiable C∞-bundles and real analytic Cω-bundles. In this section we <b>will</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> C∞-bundles. The most important example of a C∞-vector bundle is the tangent bundle (TM,πTM,M) of a C∞-manifold M.|$|E

25|$|Further {{practical}} aspects {{concern the}} amount of time the system can switch from channel to channel, time to lock when first switched on, and how much noise there is in the output. All of these are a function of the loop filter of the system, which is a low-pass filter placed between the output of the frequency comparator and the input of the VCO. Usually the output of a frequency comparator {{is in the form of}} short error pulses, but the input of the VCO must be a smooth noise-free DC voltage. (Any noise on this signal naturally causes frequency modulation of the VCO.) Heavy filtering will make the VCO slow to respond to changes, causing drift and slow response time, but light filtering will produce noise and other problems with harmonics. Thus the design of the filter is critical to the performance of the system and in fact the main area that a designer <b>will</b> <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> when building a synthesizer system.|$|E

He stated that the sequels would widen the universe while exploring other moons of Polyphemus. The first sequel would focus on the ocean of Pandora and also feature more of the rainforest. He intended to capture footage for this sequel {{at the bottom of the}} Mariana Trench using a deepwater submersible. In 2011, Cameron stated that he was just starting to design the ocean ecosystem of Pandora and the other worlds to be included in the story.

In addition, the program will attempt to improve the diagnosis of STEMI patients by EMS personnel. According to Alice Jacobs, MD, who led the work group that addressed STEMI systems, when patients arrive at non-PCI hospitals they will stay on the EMS stretcher with paramedics in attendance while a determination is made {{as to whether or not}} the patient will be transferred. For walk-in STEMI patients at non-PCI hospitals, EMS calls to transfer the patient to a PCI hospital should be handled with the same urgency as a 9-1-1 call.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to SpaceX's privately funded {{plans for an}} eventual Mars mission, NASA Ames Research Center had developed a concept called Red Dragon: a low-cost Mars mission that would use Falcon Heavy as the launch vehicle and trans-Martian injection vehicle, and the Dragon capsule to enter the Martian atmosphere.
