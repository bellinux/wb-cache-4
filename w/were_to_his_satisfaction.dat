500|$|During shooting, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme {{close-up}} on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face {{made her want to}} blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough. Leigh had trouble saying [...] "Not inordinately" [...] for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes. Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane) [...] hitting the light bulb, and a lens flare, which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh {{to write}} {{a draft of the}} screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer Joseph Stefano to adapt the novel.

60|$|He begged {{of me to}} talk no more at that rate, for {{it would}} make him distracted; {{he said he was}} bred a gentleman, though he <b>was</b> reduced <b>to</b> a low fortune, and that there was but one way left which he could think of, and that would not do, unless I could answer him one question, which, however, he said he would not press me to. I told him I would answer it honestly; whether it would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction</b> or not, that I could not tell.|$|R
50|$|After {{suffering}} breakdowns in 1967, Hailwood {{had intended}} to re-sign for Honda provided the 1968 machinery <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> and had relocated to South Africa where he started a building business with former motorcycle Grand Prix rider Frank Perris, completing their first house in October 1967, also selling one to ex-racer Jim Redman. Hailwood stated to Motorcycle Mechanics that even without suitable machinery from Honda he would not go elsewhere, preferring to retire prematurely and he would in any case finish {{at the end of}} the 1968 season.|$|R
60|$|The {{whole time}} {{occupied}} by these transactions in Cyprus {{was only about}} a month, and now, since every thing had <b>been</b> finished <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> Richard began <b>to</b> think once more of prosecuting his voyage.|$|R
60|$|Having thus {{secured the}} {{premises}} in front, {{he proceeded to}} fortify the rear, and, when this <b>was</b> accomplished <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> he returned <b>to</b> the kitchen, sat down opposite the widow, and wiped his shining pate.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the end of}} his life, Dijkstra {{maintained}} that the central challenges of computing hadn’t <b>been</b> met <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> due <b>to</b> an insufficient emphasis on program correctness (though not obviating other requirements, such as maintainability and efficiency).|$|R
60|$|When {{this had}} <b>been</b> done <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> {{and it seemed}} to give him {{greatest}} pleasure to keep me in suspense as <b>to</b> <b>his</b> purpose, he tied to the smaller end of the stick the fringe from his shirt.|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} {{that if he}} chose still to embarrass himself with business, I supposed it would <b>be</b> more <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in <b>his</b> own country, and where his family was so well known, and where his children also were.|$|R
60|$|Squeezing {{a drop of}} ink {{onto the}} glass, he spread {{it back and forth}} with the rubber roller until the entire surface of the glass <b>was</b> covered <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with a very thin and uniform layer of ink.|$|R
60|$|But now {{the writer}} was {{leaning back in}} his chair. He put down his pen and sighed the half resentful sigh--"ah! you, work, you! how you gratify and tire me!"--of a man who has <b>been</b> writing <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rowan {{returns to}} Devon, and {{the dispute over}} the brewery <b>is</b> settled <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> This accomplished, he calls upon the Rays and assures Rachel that his love for her is still strong.

60|$|Then {{while the}} Sin Verguenza laughed he backed his captive {{against the wall}} and gravely {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> pull <b>his</b> tunic straight and dust him.

50|$|Bekker {{was born}} in Metslawier (Dongeradeel) {{as the son of}} a German pastor from Bielefeld. He was educated at Groningen, under Jacob Alting, and at Franeker.

50|$|With {{the rise}} of Pop Art and optical painting, not to mention Neo-Dada and Conceptualism, Resnick withdrew {{somewhat}} from the art world. Increasingly tending his own garden, he turned inward and began to produce—in complete disregard and perhaps defiance—the dense and rigorous all-over abstractions that would make his reputation. An indefatigable worker, these paintings often took months to accomplish before they <b>were</b> realized <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction.</b>|$|R
60|$|Captain Fazackerly {{having no}} objection, they had tea first, and then, {{accompanied}} by the first mate, went out to christen the disbursement sheet.

50|$|As a Christian, Theodosius was {{distressed by}} the {{apparent}} pagan revival that was occurring under Eugenius's reign. In addition {{there was the}} issue of Valentinian's death, which had never <b>been</b> resolved <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> Furthermore, Eugenius had removed all the high civil officers left by Theodosius when he had given the Western half of the empire to Valentinian, so that Theodosius had {{lost control of the}} Western Roman Empire.|$|R
60|$|She left Merton pensive, and not {{disposed}} to overrate human nature. 'But there can't be many fellows like Jephson,' he said. 'I {{wonder how much}} the six figures run to?' But that question <b>was</b> never answered <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{remember}} now, {{that was}} one of the points on which Mr. Wanklyn consulted me. It struck him at first sight as being rather a remarkable transaction, and he went into it carefully, but it <b>was</b> all proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> correct <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> It <b>is</b> unfortunate that the system of registering mortgages is not enforced everywhere as it is in London--it would save a great deal of trouble in such cases as the present." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Pope, in {{his last}} illness, amused himself, amidst the care of his higher concerns, in {{preparing}} a corrected and complete edition of his writings;[1] and, with his usual delicacy, <b>was</b> even solicitous <b>to</b> prevent any share of the offence they might occasion, from falling on the friend whom he had engaged to give them to the public.[2] In discharge of this trust, the public has here a complete edition of his works, executed in such a manner, as, I am persuaded, would have <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> The editor hath not, {{for the sake of}} profit, suffered the author's name <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made cheap by a subscription;[3] nor <b>his</b> works <b>to</b> <b>be</b> defrauded of their due honours by a vulgar or inelegant impression; nor <b>his</b> memory <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disgraced by any pieces unworthy of his talents or virtue.

60|$|At last, when within hearing, Anders shouted a {{peaceful}} message, {{and there was}} much hallooing and gesticulation among the natives, but nothing comprehensible came of it.

50|$|If the {{surveyor}} {{is fully}} satisfied as {{to all the}} requirements having been complied with, and defects on the vessel, if any, <b>is</b> rectified <b>to</b> <b>his</b> full <b>satisfaction,</b> then he issues a declaration of survey to the applicant and also issues temporary certificate of survey.|$|R
50|$|While this {{standoff}} takes place, he demands music be played, and {{he paints}} his naked body black as he listens, and ties {{the teacher to}} a post. He forces an apple into his mouth, paints a matching mustache onto his face, and removes his own hat and glasses {{to put on the}} teacher's head. After this human still life has <b>been</b> arranged <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> he accepts <b>his</b> fate, calling for the prison guards to burst in for yet another violent brawl which will send him back to solitary.|$|R
50|$|A {{conflict}} of another kind caused Dale {{to request a}} second furlough after hostilities with France were redressed. Dale {{and some of the}} other five naval leaders became engaged in a dispute over their proper ranks. While government officials considered their concerns, Dale resumed the Far East trade. Upon <b>his</b> return <b>to</b> Philadelphia, the issue had <b>been</b> settled <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> and Dale accepted <b>his</b> orders. He <b>was</b> <b>to</b> command a small fleet assigned to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean Sea. American ships were no longer safe against the privateers of the North African nation-states.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fight}} both Griffin and his coach Randy Couture {{expressed}} {{that they thought}} the fight was close, and Jackson's coach, Juanito Ibarra, had planned to protest the unanimous decision with the Nevada State Athletic Commission. However, after speaking with the commission about his complaint, {{he decided not to}} file because he was informed that even if the judges scores <b>were</b> changed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> the fight would still result in a victory for Griffin by a majority decision. Soon after the fight, Jackson fired his longtime trainer/manager Ibarra. There were talks of an immediate rematch after the fight.|$|R
50|$|By July 1893 {{the tram}} {{had been running}} for over 30 years and the {{maintenance}} costs were rising at an unacceptable rate, with much of this attributable to the run-down state of the assets, particularly the rails. Harle resolved to sell the operation and put everything up for sale by tender. When no tenders <b>were</b> received <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> he approached the council {{to see if it}} was interested in purchasing it. As it were in some financial difficulties and realising that a significant expense would be involved in upgrading the railway, it declined Harle’s offer.|$|R
50|$|The {{governors}} pay for {{the works}} on execution on receipt of a certificate from the surveyor; and the surveyor, when the works have <b>been</b> completed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> gives a certificate to that effect, the effect of which, so far as regards the incumbent, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> protect him from liability for dilapidations {{for the next five}} years. Unnecessary buildings belonging to a residence house may, by the authority of the bishop and with the consent of the patron, be removed. An amending statute of 1872 (Ecclesiastical Dilapidations Act (1871) Amendment) relates chiefly to advances by the governors of Queen Anne's Bounty {{for the purposes of the}} act.|$|R
50|$|By April 1939, the Seversky Aircraft Corporation {{had lost}} $550,000, and Seversky {{was forced out}} of the company he had founded. The board, led by {{financier}} Paul Moore, voted W.

Seversky continued <b>to</b> fight for <b>his</b> company, and the matter <b>was</b> not resolved <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>satisfaction</b> until September 1942.|$|R
