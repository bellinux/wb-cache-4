5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E
500|$|The release {{also drew}} criticism. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who {{independently}} released his sixth album Ghosts I-IV under a Creative Commons licence the following year, thought {{it did not}} go far enough, calling it [...] "very much a bait and switch, {{to get you to}} pay for a MySpace-quality stream as a way to promote a very traditional record sale." [...] Singer Lily Allen called it [...] "arrogant", saying: [...] " [...] millions of pounds. It sends a weird message to younger bands who haven't done as well. You don't choose how to pay for eggs. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> different for music?" [...] In the Guardian, journalist Will Hodgkinson wrote: [...] "Spare a thought for the thousands upon thousands of bands and singers who, nowhere near Radiohead's levels of fame and fortune, now have pretty much no chance of ever making a living from their music." [...] Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth told the Guardian the release [...] "seemed really community-oriented, but it wasn't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters, who don’t sell as many records as them. It makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics such as Malcolm Cowley and Delmore Schwartz {{describe}} {{mixed emotions}} about the religiosity of the poem. Cowley emphasised the mystical {{nature of the}} poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism than Anglicanism while mentioning his appreciation {{of many of the}} passages. Schwartz also mentioned the Buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in Little Gidding. F. B. Pinion believed that the fourth section of the poem caused [...] "Eliot more trouble and vexation than any passage of the same length he ever wrote, and is his greatest achievement in the Four Quartets." [...] E. M. Forster did not like Eliot's emphasis on pain and responded to the poem: [...] "Of course there's pain on and off through each individual's life... You can't shirk it and so on. But <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> endorsed by the schoolmaster and sanctified by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and bullies? It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer." [...] Writing in 2003, Roger Scruton wrote that in [...] "Little Gidding" [...] Eliot achieved [...] "that for which he envies Dante—namely, a poetry of belief, in which belief and words are one, and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language".|$|E
60|$|Inez only laughed bitterly, {{but did not}} {{resent the}} words. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> she? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> not worth while.|$|R
6000|$|If {{the thing}} {{must be done}} at all, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> not <b>be</b> done in this way? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> not the {{sergeant}} address the new recruits politely: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Suppose the devil!--I {{beg your}} pardon. But people don't forge {{documents}} {{in the interests of}} humanity and justice. And <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> given to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why should I {{sacrifice}} myself?" [...] he cried. [...] "My life is {{as valuable}} as theirs. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> always I from whom sacrifice is demanded?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> changed? If I {{could change}} it by lifting up my little finger I {{could not do}} <b>it.</b> <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> not <b>be</b> you as well as me? They have tried me, and,--as Aunt Emmeline says,--I have not suited." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{to defend}} myself, and I will do so with truth. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> not very long,--as months go; but <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> have <b>been</b> less long, whether for months or days? I had to cure myself of a wound." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{not deny}} that without the pity there {{might not have been}} the courage. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> I--since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a pity that gives you no offense, a pity that is rooted firmly in--in love for you, my Justin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is fixed, dear friend; fixed as fate. It {{does not}} trouble me. It shall not trouble me. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> a trouble? Suppose I {{had never seen}} him!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Something {{very like}} it. But, however, I {{have no doubt}} you were true enough. But, Bell, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> so? If you {{were in love with}} any one else I could {{understand}} it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Driver {{was deeply}} {{attached}} to the flag, writing: [...] "It has ever been my staunch companion and protection.

6000|$|... "Only the ring, of course," [...] he admitted. [...] "I {{did not see}} {{the hand}} close enough. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> foolish of me, perhaps, to say {{anything}} about it, and yet--and yet the man last night--he was looking for Rosario. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> not <b>be</b> the same?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might like}} it," [...] she answered, frankly, [...] "if--if my temper {{had not made}} a fool of me. I never meet anyone I care to talk to. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> not <b>be</b> {{pleasant}} to run across some one new--some one strange in this heah wild country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, {{this is most}} extraordinary!" [...] cried Mrs. Travers, {{suddenly}} aroused. [...] "Why did {{you come}} to me? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> my task? Why should you want me specially to take it to him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Impossible!--why impossible? What {{could be}} more fitting? Your rank is equal to his;--higher even in this, that your father was himself the Earl.

6000|$|Then will {{somebody}} square this shade {{with the}} [...] being I know I was last night, when my soul rang {{clear as a}} bell And happy as rain in summer? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> [...] so? What is there gone against me, why am I in hell? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it?</b> Better she <b>were</b> dead--she'll be {{much more}} real. She'll be {{positive}} in death. In life she was a fretting, negated thing.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it?</b> Because there <b>was</b> {{more rain}} then than now? That he must {{put out of}} court; there is no {{evidence}} of it whatsoever.|$|R
6000|$|Both men felt rebuked and {{the group}} again settled into silence. Suddenly, Kate began to laugh, [...] "Isn't it childish? Really, Morton, if our friends could see us sitting around here in the dark, as we are now, they would roar. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> all <b>be</b> so silly, Mr. Clarke?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No lass, I darena; but <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> {{an insult}}? that's what I canna make out; why wouldn't it be {{an insult to}} offer you a gold brooch worth three or four pounds, and yet be an insult to offer you the other things? what's the difference?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{his native}} {{determination}} began to assert itself. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> for nothing? There was the house, {{and in it}} was Isobel, and oh! {{he wanted to see}} her. He crossed to the square-garden side and walked down {{in the shadow of the}} trees which grew there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] she murmured, {{dropping}} her eyes. [...] "I {{am tired of}} my life. What you owed me then you owe me now. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> too late? I am not an old woman yet, nor are you an old man, and I am weary of being alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have heard," [...] {{interrupted}} Meneptah impatiently, [...] "and {{as in our}} House <b>it</b> {{has always}} <b>been</b> the custom for kin to marry kin, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> not <b>be</b> her will? Also, who else should she marry? Amenmeses is already wed. There remains only Saptah his brother who is younger than herself----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{very kind}} of her {{thinking}} of it," [...] Isobel said, [...] "and I don't think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> nice of you, Doctor, to say that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an evident relief {{to her when she}} found I had someone else to take care of me. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> have <b>been</b> a relief?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{she thought}} that she would tell the lie. If <b>it</b> <b>was</b> well that she should make the {{sacrifice}} for his sake, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> not <b>be</b> completed?

60|$|Only <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> {{with pain}} at all Why must I 'twix {{the leaves of}} corona! Put any kiss of pardon on thy brow?

6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{said the}} cardinal; [...] "not the Church of Christ; {{it is never}} perplexed, never ambiguous, never contradictory. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be?</b> How could it be?

6000|$|There was a {{struggle}} in the boy's face, {{and she did not}} know whether she had touched or angered him. 'I can't help it,' he said, as if he would have recalled his former hardness; but then softening, 'No, Miss May, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> <b>be?</b> A man can do his duty in any state of life.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't {{they make}} more games out of wind?" [...] {{he asked in}} some excitement.

50|$|Brig and Jon were bottom two, {{and each}} {{dictated}} the reasons <b>why</b> each <b>should</b> stay. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> then revealed {{that no one}} would be eliminated.|$|R
