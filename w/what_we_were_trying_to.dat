According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list.

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{recording}} Spiritual Machines, percussionist Jeremy Taggart suffered a serious ankle injury during a mugging while walking his dog. While he recovered, Taggart's friend Matt Cameron, former drummer for Soundgarden and current drummer for Pearl Jam, filled in for Taggart on the tracks [...] "Right Behind You (Mafia)" [...] and [...] "Are You Sad?", which Taggart had already written the drum parts for. When the final tracks were ready for mixing, the band shopped around before finding a producer they wanted. The album was mixed in Atlanta, Georgia by Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam's long time producer. [...] "It was an amazing experience working with Brendan, someone who immediately understood <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do {{and was able to}} capture exactly how we heard this album," [...] noted Maida.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Black's near-psychic visions; a phenomenon which had been used with much less frequency in the second season. Executive producer Glen Morgan begrudgingly allowed Maher and Reindl to show the ability in this episode, saying [...] "I felt last year those visions were a cheat. The camera {{would go to a}} coffee cup and Frank would say, 'The murderer used a coffee cup.' It drove me nuts. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do this year was elevate Frank's visions to a dream-like state, so he would have to interpret what he's seeing. There would be more mystical, symbolic imagery that might give him more of a sense of what's going on. I had wanted to strip away the gift {{for a long time and}} see if the show really played without it. But we got back into that".|$|E
500|$|Yorke {{said that}} the {{starting}} point for the record was the [...] "incredibly dense and terrifying sound" [...] of Bitches Brew, the 1970 avant-garde jazz fusion album by Miles Davis. He described the sound of Bitches Brew to Q: [...] "It was building something up and watching it fall apart, that's the beauty of it. It was at the core of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do with OK Computer." [...] Yorke identified [...] "I'll Wear It Proudly" [...] by Elvis Costello, [...] "Fall on Me" [...] by R.E.M., [...] "Dress" [...] by PJ Harvey and [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] by the Beatles as particularly influential on the album's songwriting. Radiohead drew further inspiration from the recording style of film soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone and the krautrock band Can, musicians Yorke described as [...] "abusing the recording process".|$|E

[...] In 2011, in {{response}} to LaBeouf's comments, Harrison Ford said: [...] "I think I told [...] he was a fucking idiot ...

Shia is ambitious, attentive and talented — and he's learning how to deal with a situation which is very unique and difficult." [...] LaBeouf later regretted his comments and their effect on his relationship with Spielberg: [...] "He told me there's a time to be a human being and have an opinion, and there's a time to sell cars.

500|$|Lead singer Raine Maida {{first brought}} {{up the idea of}} a concept album after {{excerpts}} from the book began influencing his songwriting. Passing time on the road, he had amassed a backlog of songs and had begun to record demos. He jokingly suggested an album title of Kurzweil. [...] "That was not the most graceful sounding name in the world, so we went with Spiritual Machines instead," [...] Turner said. While the other band-members were less enthusiastic about the idea due to its weighty subject matter, Maida and Turner decided to pursue it and Turner contacted Ray Kurzweil via email to ask for permission to use the title of his book for their project. Kurzweil's excitement at the prospect prompted them to invite him to record spoken excerpts from his book for the album and a correspondence developed. “I think it’s amazing that Ray Kurzweil sent us a bunch of pieces, and for whatever reason, they really tie in with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> say on this record,” said Maida.|$|E
500|$|By September 2015, John Paesano {{had begun}} {{composing}} {{music for the}} season. He felt that the season's new showrunners [...] "were true to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do in season one. There were just elements in season two {{that we had to}} acknowledge" [...] such as the Punisher and Elektra. He jokingly said that [...] "it’s not like we all of the sudden went into John Williams territory, you know? It’s definitely still dark, still gritty ... but it definitely jumps up a couple levels." [...] When approaching the characters of Punisher and Elektra, with whom Paesano was familiar from the comics and previous adaptations, he [...] "took all those preconceived notions I had with a grain of salt" [...] and waited to see what the season's interpretation of the characters would be. Paesano worked closely with the series' sound design team, spotting episodes with them to coordinate where [...] "we were going to hit what" [...] and [...] "maintain that definable aspect of New York" [...] and its sound. A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by Hollywood Records on July 15, 2016.|$|E

500|$|U2 {{returned}} to Dublin for Christmas, where they discussed their future together and all recommitted to the group. Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded {{better than they}} originally thought. They briefly {{returned to}} Berlin in January 1991 to finish their work at Hansa. Reflecting on their time in Berlin, Clayton called the sessions a [...] "baptism of fire" [...] and said, [...] "It was something {{we had to go}} through to realize <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get to was not something you could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city—that there was not magic to it and that we actually had to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down." [...] Although just two songs were delivered during their two months in Berlin, the Edge said that in retrospect, working there had been more productive and inspirational than the output had suggested. The band had been removed from a familiar environment, providing what they described as a certain [...] "texture and cinematic location", and many of their incomplete ideas would be revisited in the subsequent Dublin sessions with success.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. Mike Reiss, show runner of The Simpsons with Al Jean at the time, said Meyer wrote most of the episode by himself without help from the show's other writers. Few changes {{were made to the}} first draft that he pitched to the producers; it was near identical to the final script. The episode was inspired by the vocational tests taken by several members of the show's staff when they went to school; Reiss, for example, said he was told he would become a librarian. Jean said [...] "one of the first things that sold us on doing the episode" [...] was the idea of Bart becoming a policeman. He said it was [...] "a funny, realistic depiction of what a kid like Bart might wind up to become, and it wasn't something you would immediately think of." [...] Jean said the episode deals with the emotion that many adults feel when they grow older and realize that {{they are not going to}} achieve the dreams they once had. [...] " [...] how people in life cope with that problem. Maybe Lisa, at eight years old, is a little bit young to worry about that, but that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> explore here." ...|$|E

Neurath later said that [...] "neither [...] had much involvement" [...] in the game, and that, following the second's departure, the team spent time without any producer at all. Rumors circulated that Origin planned to cancel the project. Following a proposal by the team around this time, Spector, who had previously worked with Neurath on Space Rogue, assumed the role of producer. Church later described this event as [...] "a big win for everyone". Spector began to interact regularly with the team by phone and to visit the studio in person. Neurath later said, [...] "Warren understood immediately <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> accomplish with the game, and became our biggest champion within Origin. Had not Warren stepped in this role at that stage, I'm not sure Ultima Underworld would have ever seen the light of day." [...] Church said that Spector helped the team polish the game and [...] "make it real", and that Spector's past experience in the industry enabled him to keep the team focused on completing the game. He explained that Spector [...] "had that ability to help me {{and the rest of the}} guys reset, from the big-picture view of someone who has done it before." ...|$|E

500|$|The title OK Computer {{is taken}} from the 1978 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio series, in which the {{character}} Zaphod Beeblebrox speaks the phrase [...] "Okay, computer, I want full manual control now." [...] The members of Radiohead listened to the series on the bus during their 1996 tour and Yorke made a note of the phrase. [...] "OK Computer" [...] was a working title for the song [...] "Palo Alto", which had been considered for inclusion on the album. The title stuck with the band; according to Jonny Greenwood, [...] " [...] started attaching itself and creating all these weird resonances with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Yorke said it [...] "refers to embracing the future, it refers to being terrified of the future, of our future, of everyone else's. It's to do with standing in a room where all these appliances are going off and all these machines and computers and so on... and the sound it makes." [...] Yorke described the title as [...] "a really resigned, terrified phrase", to him similar to the Coca-Cola advertisement [...] "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing". Wired writer Leander Kahney {{suggests that it is}} an homage to Macintosh computers, as the Mac's speech recognition software responds to the command [...] "OK computer" [...] as an alternative to clicking the [...] "OK" [...] button. Other titles considered were Ones and Zeroes—a reference to the binary numeral system—and Your Home May Be at Risk If You Do Not Keep Up Payments.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Lundgren {{starred in}} The Last Warrior as Captain Nick Preston under {{director}} Sheldon Lettich. This post apocalyptic movie {{is set in}} 2006 {{in the context of}} a 9.5-magnitude earthquake which kills millions of people, with Preston leading a motley military patrol on the island to help survivors in the pole shift-affected world. The film was partly shot in Eilat, Israel. Later in 2000, Dolph appeared in Damian Lee's Agent Red (also known as Captured), alongside Alexander Kuznetsov, Natalie Radford and Randolph Mantooth. The film is set during the Cold War, and is about two soldiers trapped on a submarine with a group of terrorists who plan to use a chemical weapon against the United States. Lundgren's character, Matt Hendricks, must work with his wife, a virologist, to prevent the scenario occurring. After the film was completed, producer Andrew Stevens thought it was too poor to be released and multiple people had to be hired to at least make the film half-competent. The film was very poorly received, given its [...] "shoestring budget"; the DVD and Film Guide of 2005 wrote, [...] "low-budget mess stars Dolph Lundgren as a navy special operations commander trying to keep a deadly virus out of the hands of terrorists. This subpar effort sinks to the bottom of the ocean in a tidal wave of cliche." [...] During an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in May 2008, Gladiator director Ridley Scott said Lundgren had been considered for the part of undefeated fighter Tigris of Gaul in 2000, but was eventually rejected because [...] "as an actor, he just didn't fit in with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> achieve".|$|E

Bono explained that the idea to crossdress [...] "had been {{based on the idea}} that if U2 can't do this, we've got to do it!", and it was fostered by the group's experiences dressing in drag for the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. However, the band pulled the video, fearing the single's status as an AIDS benefit would result in critics finding AIDS-related interpretations of the video. The Edge explained, [...] "We didn't want to be involved in putting back the AIDS issue into the realm of sexuality...
