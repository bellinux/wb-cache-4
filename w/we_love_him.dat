25|$|The Pan-American Exposition of 1901 is most remembered because President William McKinley {{was assassinated}} by an anarchist, Leon Czolgosz, at the Temple of Music on September 6, 1901. McKinley died eight days later. On Sunday morning, September 15, 1901, President McKinley’s casket {{was closed and}} the honor guard placed the casket into a hearse. Close behind the {{followed}} President Theodore Roosevelt with Secretary Elihu Root {{and other members of}} the Cabinet following. The procession moved through a vast throng to the Buffalo City Hall where the body, lying in state, was viewed by one hundred and fifty thousand people. Toward the end of the afternoon, Indians from the exposition, in their blankets and feathers, followed by their squaws filed by. The Indians liked President McKinley and they had come to see the Great Father. A few hours before they had sent a wreath of purple astors accompanied by the inscription: “Farewell of Geronimo, Blue Horse, Flat Iron and Red Shirt and the seven hundred braves of the Cummins Indian Congress and Wild West Show. Like President Lincoln and Garfield, President McKinley never abused authority except on the side of mercy. The martyred Great White Chief will stand in memory next to the Savior of mankind. We loved him living, <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>him</b> still.” As the Indians passed, each of them dropped a white carnation upon the President’s coffin.|$|E

Dr. Rowan Williams, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, is a confessed Simpsons fan, and likes Flanders. Ned's [...] "unbearable piousness" [...] has been described as [...] "The Simpsons sharpest critique of organized religion. The show's implicit argument seems to be that humorless obsessives like Ned have hijacked religious institutions, removing them from the center of society to a place where only those who know their brides of Beth Chedruharazzeb from their wells of Zohassadar can seek solace." [...] Steve Goddard of the website Ship of Fools said, [...] "Ned is an innocent abroad in a world of cynicism and compromise. <b>We</b> <b>love</b> <b>him</b> because we know what it's like to be classed as a nerd— and to come out smiling at the end of it." ...|$|E

500|$|An initial fee of £300,000 was agreed, plus an {{additional}} £50,000 depending on appearances, and in October 1998 Horsfield joined Fulham. A clause was {{also included in}} the contract which would allow Halifax a share of the profits from any future sale. The remainder of his 1998–99 season produced 15 goals from 28 games as Fulham won the Second Division title by 14 clear points. He was also named in the PFA's Second Division Team of the Year. According to Keegan, [...] "Geoff's your old-fashioned centre forward and <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>him.</b> He will score goals in this division, he will score goals in the next divisions. He chases a lot of lost causes and is very important for us." [...] Though less prolific in the First Division, seven league goals and another seven in the cups still made him the club's top scorer for the 1999–2000 season. After new manager Jean Tigana made it clear that Horsfield's aggressive style and perceived lack of pace and mobility would not fit the way he wanted his new team to play, and brought in Louis Saha as his main striker, the player agreed to join Fulham's First Division rivals Birmingham City.|$|E

[...] The perpetual play of humor gave to his work, even to the last, the freshness of youth. <b>We</b> <b>love</b> <b>him</b> for his boyish love of pure fun.

He {{is by no means}} the most brilliant of wits nor the deepest of thinkers: but he is our friend: <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>him,</b> as children love their love with an A, because he is amiable. Who likes a man best because he is the cleverest or the wisest of mankind; or a woman because she is the most virtuous, or talks French; or plays the piano better than the rest of her sex?

To get Jordan a living by planting him in some office which he could not do; to warm Jordan by burning our royal bed for him: that had not entered into the mind of Jordan's royal friend.
