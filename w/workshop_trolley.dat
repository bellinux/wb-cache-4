In this paper we present a conceptual approach towards using cognitive architectures to provide information assistance and allow complex decision making based on expert knowledge. We transfer our approach into a technical concept which was finally implemented as part of the Plant@Hand assembly assistance system within a mobile <b>workshop</b> <b>trolley.</b> The paper gives insights into our work on formalizing knowledge and providing ad-hoc mechanisms for planning, assisting and controlling assembly tasks on the manufacturing shop floor...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to focus}} on the systems design of a multi purpose engine tester, a device for diagnostic techniques of self propelled motor vehicles to be used in a car mechanics work shop. The principle aim is to combine a permanently installed PC, a portable laptop and a <b>workshop</b> <b>trolley</b> containing all the necessary assembly tools and accessories. These three pieces used together will serve as a self contained unit within the workshop. I will compare the quality of the devices with others on the market. I will talk about the layout of the individual parts such as the design, structure and shape of the unit, as well as the ergonomics of the designed pieces. An important factor will be reducing the size of the device without compromising the quality and keeping it a similar price to other similar products on the market...|$|E
