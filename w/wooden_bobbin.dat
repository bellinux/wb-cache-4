50|$|In 1831 {{began the}} epoch-making {{researches}} of Michael Faraday, the famous pupil and successor of Humphry Davy {{at the head}} of the Royal Institution, London, relating to electric and electromagnetic induction. The remarkable researches of Faraday, the prince of experimentalists, on electrostatics and electrodynamics and the induction of currents. These were rather long in being brought from the crude experimental state to a compact system, expressing the real essence. Faraday was not a competent mathematician, but had he been one, he would have been greatly assisted in his researches, have saved himself much useless speculation, and would have anticipated much later work. He would, for instance, knowing Ampere's theory, by his own results have readily been led to Neumann's theory, and the connected work of Helmholtz and Thomson. Faraday's studies and researches extended from 1831 to 1855 and a detailed description of his experiments, deductions and speculations are to be found in his compiled papers, entitled Experimental Researches in Electricity.' Faraday was by profession a chemist. He was not in the remotest degree a mathematician in the ordinary sense — indeed it is a question if in all his writings there is a single mathematical formula.The experiment which led Faraday to the discovery of electromagnetic induction was made as follows: He constructed what is now and was then termed an induction coil, the primary and secondary wires of which were wound on a <b>wooden</b> <b>bobbin,</b> side by side, and insulated from one another. In the circuit of the primary wire he placed a battery of approximately 100 cells. In the secondary wire he inserted a galvanometer. On making his first test he observed no results, the galvanometer remaining quiescent, but on increasing the length of the wires he noticed a deflection of the galvanometer in the secondary wire when the circuit of the primary wire was made and broken. This was the first observed instance of the development of electromotive force by electromagnetic induction.|$|E

50|$|Stott Park Bobbin Mill is a 19th-century bobbin {{mill and}} now a working museum located near Newby Bridge, Cumbria, England. Built in 1835 the mill was one of over 65 such {{buildings}} in the Lake District, which provided <b>wooden</b> <b>bobbins</b> to the weaving and spinning industry primarily in Lancashire and Yorkshire. The building is today owned and run by English Heritage.|$|R
50|$|These moorland mills {{held their}} own {{for more than}} half a century against their big-town rivals, many finding a niche for themselves, as {{mainline}} competition increased, by developing as cotton-waste spinners. This involved recycling the inner core of yarn cops, which had been stiffened in manufacture by the application of starch paste to avoid the need for separate <b>wooden</b> <b>bobbins.</b> During the cotton famine caused by the American Civil War these waste mills actually experienced a boom.|$|R
50|$|Mundillo is a {{craft of}} {{handmade}} bobbin lace that is cultivated and honored {{on the island}} of Puerto Rico. The term 'mundillo' means 'little world', referring to the cylindrical pillow on which the lace maker ('Mundillista') weaves intricate designs. The decorative lace is created using <b>wooden</b> <b>bobbins</b> about the diameter of a pencil, which are wound with thread that is twisted and crossed to form a pattern. Depending on the pattern, as few as two dozen or as many as several hundred bobbins may be used.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th century {{numerous}} industries {{including a}} cotton mill and iron foundry flourished along the river, {{making use of}} the fast flowing water to drive machinery. A bobbin mill at Spark Bridge, which manufactured <b>wooden</b> <b>bobbins</b> for the Lancashire cotton industry, used water-powered lathes to turn the wood. The factory survived into the 1970s using Gilkes water turbines to generate electricity and turn the lathes. The factory was eventually forced to close by the punitive water usage charges levied by the North West Water Authority. Today there are no obvious signs {{of any of the}} riverside industries.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the mill}} was built in 1835 by John Harrison, a local landowner who had earlier inherited Low Stott Park Farm including the land on which the mill was built. It {{is believed to be}} one of the few mills to have been specifically built for bobbin production as many other mills were converted from earlier structures. At that time there was a great demand for <b>wooden</b> <b>bobbins</b> from the ever-growing cotton and textile industry and the Lake District provided a perfect place for bobbin-making owing to its abundant natural resources: water for power and coppiced woodlands for the bobbins. Having built the mill as a speculative venture, Harrison and his successors let it out to a string of trustees.|$|R
