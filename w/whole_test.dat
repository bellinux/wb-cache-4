This was a wet summer and most of the bowling in the series was done by spinners, but Trueman still managed 5–31 in the first Test at Edgbaston. He pulled off a {{remarkable}} anticipatory catch in the Lord's Test when he stepped forward from his short leg position to catch the ball off a defensive stroke with his hand on the batsman's boot. In the Final Test at the Oval, he made the highest score of his <b>whole</b> <b>Test</b> career with 39 not out in twenty minutes, including three sixes off Alex Moir.|$|E
2500|$|During phase four, the MCAT {{underwent}} several changes. The [...] "general information" [...] {{section was}} eliminated and {{a broader range}} of knowledge was tested. At this point, topics tested included scientific knowledge, science problems, reading skills analysis, and quantitative skills analysis. Individual scores were reported for biology, chemistry, and physics rather than a composite science score, thus six different scores for the <b>whole</b> <b>test</b> were reported. The score scale changed to 1–15 as opposed to 200–800 from previous versions of the test. Cultural and social bias was minimized. Though the AAMC claimed the new version intended to evaluate [...] "information gathering and analysis, discerning and formulating relationships, and other problem-solving skills," [...] no research supported this claim.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Adelaide Test, New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum said that day-night Test cricket is [...] "here to stay" [...] and that [...] "it's a great concept". The Australian captain Steve Smith also had praise for the day-night Test saying that [...] "the <b>whole</b> <b>Test</b> match was a great innovation, it was a great spectacle". Media reaction to the first day-night Test was also positive, with many news outlets praising the innovation. However, following the match the majority of players {{who took part in the}} game said that there needs considerable work on floodlit Test cricket. Twenty of the twenty-two players who responded supported the concept of day-night Test cricket but work on the pink ball needed further refinement.|$|E

Having undergone another operation on the troublesome ankle, he missed the <b>whole</b> <b>Test</b> and one-day series against the West Indies, and was also ruled out for the subsequent Test series with India. [...] Following several games for Lancashire, Flintoff {{returned for}} England in the first of seven ODIs against India on 21 August 2007. He bowled seven overs and ended with figures of one for twelve in England's 104-run victory. He hit an eventful nine runs during the second ODI; however, while fielding, he injured his knee and sat out England's 42-run victory in the third ODI. [...] He returned for the fourth ODI on 30 August.

Mark Waugh theorised that [...] "if you attack him, he can go on the defensive, and it puts him off his game", [...] although Waugh was Tufnell's most frequent test victim, being dismissed a total of seven times by him, three of them bowled. According to Michael Parkinson, a British talk show host, [...] "at the age of nine he was opening the bowling and the batting for his club's junior team". Parkinson also believes that his [...] "ordinary fielding made him a luxury {{in the view of}} the ... (English cricket) management (circa August 1996)". However, Tufnell's fielding did improve during his career. He was nicknamed [...] "The Cat" [...] due to his propensity to be found sleeping in the dressing room. He also acquired the nickname [...] "Two Sugars" [...] due to his well-known love of tea. According to England teammate Mike Atherton, Tufnell smoked more than occasionally.|$|E

40|$|Background: Near patient {{tests for}} Helicobacter pylori were {{developed}} {{to assist in the}} management of dyspepsia patients in general practice. Most studies were performed in western populations. Aim: To evaluate the rapid <b>whole</b> blood <b>test</b> (Flexpack HP) for H. pylori in the Chinese population. Methods: Consecutive dyspeptic patients referred for upper endoscopy were recruited. During upper endoscopy, biopsies were taken from the antrum and corpus for rapid urease test (CLO test) and histological examination. After endoscopy, the <b>whole</b> blood <b>test</b> (FlexPack HP) was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Patients then received a 13 C-urea breath test. Results of the <b>whole</b> blood <b>test</b> were compared with the gold standard (CLO test, histology and 13 C-urea breath test). Results: A total of 294 consecutive patients gave a valid Flexpack HP result for interpretation. The mean age of patients was 47. 7 (range 15 - 85) years. Analysis showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 58 %, 92 %, 91 %, 63 % and 73 % respectively. Conclusion: The FlexPack HP <b>whole</b> blood <b>test</b> showed good specificity but lacked sensitivity. It is not sensitive enough to be used in a general practice setting for the test-and-treat approach in the Chinese population. postprin...|$|R
