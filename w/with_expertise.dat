40|$|Firms {{depend on}} {{information}} technology to provide high quality internal information, but prior {{research suggests that}} IT is underutilized (Venkatesh and Bala 2008). Therefore, using a sample of firms with equivalent levels of technology in their information systems, I investigate whether firms that employ CEOs <b>with</b> IT <b>expertise</b> make forecasts that are more accurate. I argue that CEOs <b>with</b> IT <b>expertise</b> {{are more likely to}} encourage the utilization of IT in making earnings forecasts, thus increasing the accuracy of the forecasts. This argument is supported by prior research that suggests that {{people are more likely to}} utilize technology if they have more experience with IT (Venkatesh et al. 2012). This research suggests that executives with IT experience are more likely to utilize IT because they perceive it as easy to use. Overall, I find that CEOs <b>with</b> IT <b>expertise</b> make forecasts that are more accurate. In additional tests, I also find that CEOs <b>with</b> IT <b>expertise</b> do not manage earnings to maintain accuracy. Finally, I find that analysts are more likely to rely on information provided by CEOs <b>with</b> IT <b>expertise.</b> Additionally, analysts benefit from the high quality information provided by CEOs <b>with</b> IT <b>expertise</b> because analysts that revise their forecasts following a forecast issued by a CEO <b>with</b> IT <b>expertise</b> make forecasts that are more accurate...|$|R

5|$|A police {{investigation}} was initiated in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company. Tjøntveit announced in December 1971 that he had established a new airline—Norwegian Overseas Airways (NOA)—which intended to operate freight routes using the Lockheed L-100 Hercules. The {{police investigation}} quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's bookkeeping {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was responsible in the company. As Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, it was obvious that he had been calling the shots. Because NOA could not obtain Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the police from interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The police also stated that the investigation took too long because they had too few investigators <b>with</b> <b>expertise</b> in financial crime.|$|E

5|$|Channel 4's {{coverage}} of the Games was billed as the most extensive Paralympic coverage ever broadcast in the United Kingdom; it promised over 150 hours of live coverage throughout the Games on Channel 4 and sister channel More4, and additional coverage online and through special channels carried by Freesat, Sky and Virgin TV (in both standard and high definition). The broadcaster also invested around £600,000 towards training new on-air personalities <b>with</b> <b>expertise</b> in disability sports for the Games, {{many of whom were}} disabled themselves—they would also be joined by Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow, and BBC Sport personality Clare Balding. Channel 4 also broadcast supplemental programming to lead towards the Games, such as Paralympic-focused documentaries, other IPC championships, and That Paralympic Show, a weekly program focusing on disability sports. During the Games, comedian Adam Hills (who himself was born without a right leg, and hosted the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's {{coverage of}} the Beijing Paralympics) would host The Last Leg, a Paralympic-themed late night talk show that followed the conclusion of each night's coverage. Channel 4's {{coverage of the}} Games drew relatively high viewership; its coverage of the opening ceremony was seen by an average of 7.6 million viewers, a 40% share, and peaked at 11.2 million viewers—making it one of Channel 4's most-watched programmes in network history. Primetime coverage saw an average of 3.3 million viewers nightly, while viewership peaked at 4.5 million viewers during the men's T44 200m final where Alan Oliveira beat Oscar Pistorius for the gold medal.
