60|$|What {{seized on}} his fancy and strangely {{affected}} {{his mind was}} this incessant changing roar of falling water. It must be the Widder, he said to himself, flowing close to the walls. But not until he had had the boldness to lean head and shoulders out of the nearest window did he fully realize how close indeed the Widder was. It came sweeping dark and deep and begreened and full with the early autumnal rains, actually against the lower walls of the house itself, {{and in the middle}} suddenly swerved in a black, smooth arch, and tumbled headlong into a great pool, nodding with tall slender water-weeds, and charged in its bubbled blackness here and there with the last crimson of the setting sun. To the left of the house, where the waters floated free again, stood vast, still trees above the clustering rushes; and in glimpses between their spreading boughs lay the far-stretching countryside, now dimmed with the first mists of approaching evening. So absorbed he became as he stood leaning over the <b>wooden</b> <b>sill</b> above the falling water, that eye and ear became enslaved by the roar and stillness. And in the faint atmosphere of age that seemed like a veil to hang about the odd old house and these prodigious branches, he fell into a kind of waking dream.|$|E

The church campus includes three buildings: the 1799 church, a modern 20th-century sanctuary, and a parish house. The 1799 church is a log structure, measuring about 32 x 74 ft. It is built out of heavy walnut timbers that were hewn into rectangular shape and mortised into a <b>wooden</b> <b>sill</b> resting on stone slabs. The timbers are each about 14 ft long, one foot wide and six inches thick, and are set about one foot apart. The spaces between them are filled with what was termed pierrotage, a mixture of rubblestone and clay. Each of the walls slopes slightly inward as it rises, and is braced by diagonal timbers. The roof trusses are of walnut and oak, and give the roof a bell-cast appearance.|$|E

This paper presents a study on a combination lift and lower manual handling task and was designed to simulate the loading of grocery bags into a car trunk. Twelve male subjects performed an externally paced task of lifting grocery bags loaded with weights from 15 cm above the floor and over a <b>wooden</b> <b>sill.</b> There were two different sill heights of 70 cm and 90 cm, and for each of these heights there were two frequencies of 3 and 6 lifts per cycle. The dependent variables were maximum acceptable weight of lift (MAWOL). A unique lifting sequence and {{a modified version of the}} psychophysical methodology were used to determine MAWOL. There was a significant difference in the MAWOL across the two sill heights as well as the MAWOL at the two different frequencies. Plastic bags were determined to increase the average load lifted by 27 % as compared to paper bags. At normal grocery bag weights, the increased load carrying capacity represents an increase in the safety factor. Not only can the risk of lower back injuries be decreased by using plastic bags with handles but the risk of developing a cumulative trauma disorder could also be decreased. peer reviewe...|$|E

50|$|Around {{the main}} square, {{much of the}} {{construction}} remains traditional with cobblestone streets and buildings that relatively simple and rustic. This is because this town was dominated by the indigenous {{for the first three}} hundred years of its existence. Many of the buildings are two stories tall painted in bright colors such as yellow and green and with balconies. They also have wrought iron fixtures with <b>wooden</b> <b>sills</b> and frames on their doors and windows. Flowerpots are a common sight as well. The narrowness of the roads means that vehicular traffic is commonly jammed, especially on weekends. Efforts at modernization have destroyed many of the town’s old trees; however, most of the original junipers along the river remain. Away from the historic center, many of the newer sections of town consist of subdivisions of weekends homes more recently built. However, these mostly follow the architectural styles of the older structures.|$|R

40|$|Joints with {{pressure}} {{perpendicular to the}} grain are a common occurrence in wooden structures. While the making of such a joint is very simple, dimensioning it is difficult: The load configuration causes a mix of ductile compressive failure and brittle tensile failure. In addition, the global response shows hardening after the first failure. Recent changes to the design code has made the design bearing strength for this type of load so low that Norwegian houses no longer fulfill the requirements. As the houses remain standing even after the new rules were introduced, it is clear that a revision of the rules may be in order. The revision is made even more important by the growing interest for building large wooden structures. This thesis focuses on using numerical models to estimate the bearing strength of <b>wooden</b> <b>sills</b> {{with pressure}} {{perpendicular to the grain}} and compares the numerical model with results from laboratory tests. The goal is to see how accurate response a numerical model can give for the problem in question, to and beyond first failure. Many new and interesting tools for modeling of complex material behavior have been implemented in commercial FEA analysis software in later years. These tools are implemented in an attempt to mimic the complexity of the material behavior, but limitations in the software and hardware proved hard to overcome. While the model is able to give good estimates for bearing strength for certain cases, it proves unable to model the development after first failure. Using results from laboratory tests in conjunction with the numerical model, the impact of tested parameters such as pith location, cross-section geometry and load placement is still evaluated. Results imply that all of these parameters severely impact the global response of the problem, particularly after first fracture. The numerical model has potential, particularly as new modeling tools become available, and should be worked on. </p...|$|R
50|$|Since the Grafton Guards had {{departed}} for Wheeling to be mustered into the Union Army, Porterfield occupied Grafton on May 25, {{but did not}} keep his force there long. Porterfield then decided {{that he could not}} capture or even raid Wheeling, Virginia for supplies as desired by Governor Letcher and that his position at Grafton was threatened. In order to prevent the advance of Union forces, Porterfield decided to burn two bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad between Farmington and Mannington, West Virginia. He ordered Colonel William J. Willey to carry out this mission on May 25. Since Porterfield continued to have only a few poorly-equipped companies numbering about 550 men under his command, had not yet received requested arms and ammunition, and was given information on May 27, 1861 that Union regiments under the overall departmental command of Major General George B. McClellan were headed toward Grafton, he decided that his position at Grafton was untenable. Porterfield learned that Union forces from both Wheeling under the immediate command of Colonel Benjamin Franklin Kelley and from Parkersburg under the immediate command of Colonel James B. Steedman were headed toward Grafton to protect the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad for the Union. On May 28, Porterfield withdrew his force to Philippi, strongly secessionist in sentiment, in Barbour County about 30 mi to the south of Grafton. Also on May 28, McClellan placed the entire Union force in western Virginia, about 3,000 men, under the command of Brigadier General Thomas A. Morris. On May 30, Colonel Kelley occupied Grafton. He had spent two days working with his force to restore the two bridges that had been burned. Since the bridges were mainly iron structures, only <b>wooden</b> <b>sills</b> and ties needed to be replaced. Porterfield picked up two companies of additional men in his move to Philippi but had to send two more companies home for lack of arms and ammunition. A Confederate court of inquiry concluded on July 4, 1861 that Porterfield had 600 effective infantry and 175 cavalry available at Philippi.|$|R
