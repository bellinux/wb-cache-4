5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the <b>white</b> <b>land</b> owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
500|$|This {{involvement}} led her {{to become}} interested in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986. After a request by activist Adi Roche, she went to blighted, high-radiation exclusion zones in Belarus for three weeks to narrate part of Black Wind, <b>White</b> <b>Land.</b> The 1993 Irish documentary, shown on RTÉ, highlighted the plight of fallout victims of the Chernobyl event. [...] Hot Press magazine wrote that Hewson had [...] "obvious gifts as a presenter, which include a sense of quiet compassion that draws forth the best from the people she talks with."

500|$|Hewson became {{involved}} in anti-nuclear activism in the 1990s. [...] She narrated Black Wind, <b>White</b> <b>Land,</b> a 1993 Irish documentary about the lasting effects of the Chernobyl disaster, and has worked closely with activist Adi Roche. [...] She has been a patron of Chernobyl Children's Project International since 1994 and has participated {{in a number of}} aid missions to the high-radiation exclusion zones of Belarus. [...] She has also campaigned against Sellafield, the northern English nuclear facility. [...] In 2002 she helped lead an effort which sent more than a million postcards, urging the site be closed, to Prime Minister Tony Blair and others. Hewson has repeatedly been discussed by tabloid newspapers as a possible candidate for political offices, including President of Ireland. None of these suggestions have come to fruition.|$|E

500|$|In this storyline, Munro {{comes into}} {{possession}} of his father’s diary and learns of Danner's troubled {{life as the}} 20th century’s first metahuman. After having read the diary, Munro turns to the government's secret Project M, demanding to know {{the location of the}} [...] "Dinosaur Island" [...] mentioned by Danner. There he meets a person who leads him instead to Maple <b>White</b> <b>Land</b> in South America. Munro is surprised when he finds his father is alive. Danner apparently faked his death in the Yucatan and briefly returned home to have a one-night stand with his former high school sweetheart Anna Blake. The resulting union bore Munro, who took his surname from his mother's new husband (who believed the child to be his own). Danner has, by this time, succeeded in rearing the first generation of the Sons of Dawn. He later reveals to the Young-All Stars that the villain Übermensch has stolen the formula in order to create his own race of supermen.|$|E
500|$|In February 2000, {{the land}} invasions began as armed gangs {{attacked}} and occupied white-owned farms. The government {{referred to the}} attackers as [...] "war veterans" [...] although the majority were unemployed youth {{too young to have}} fought in the Rhodesian War. Mugabe claimed that the attacks were a spontaneous uprising against <b>white</b> <b>land</b> owners, although the government had paid Z$20 million to Chenjerai Hunzvi's War Veterans Association to lead the land invasion campaign and ZANU-PF officials, police, and military figures were all involved in facilitating it. Some of Mugabe's colleagues described the invasions as retribution for the white community's alleged involvement in securing the success of the 'no' vote in the recent referendum. Mugabe justified the seizures by the fact that this land had been seized by white settlers from the indigenous African population in the 1890s. He portrayed the invasions as a struggle against colonialism and alleged that the UK was trying to overthrow his government. In May 2000, he issued a decree under the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Act which empowered the government to seize farms without providing compensation, insisting that it was the British government that should make these payments.|$|E
500|$|On 5 June 1881 {{the mail}} ship Acadia ran aground {{on the island}} while {{returning}} from San Francisco, Peru after unloading its cargo. On the way to Queenstown or Falmouth for new orders, Master Stephen George calculated a route passing [...] {{to the east of}} Ducie. George left the first mate in command at 6am. Half an hour later, the first mate saw a white line, which he disregarded on the assumption that it was phosphorescence in the water. Later, realising that it was land, he manoeuvred to avoid running aground, but failed. The look-out excused himself by saying that he thought that the <b>white</b> <b>land</b> was a cloud. The crew made several unsuccessful attempts to re-float the ship, after which the master sailed one of the ship's boats to Pitcairn Island. He was assisted there by the local inhabitants and returned aboard the Edward O'Brien, an American boat, to rescue the rest of the crew. The incident was later investigated in a court in Liverpool, where the ultimate cause of the wreck was left undetermined, though possible causes included a calculation error by the master or an unknown current that carried the ship to the island. The court declared the master not guilty of any wrongdoing. A stone marker with a memorial inscription is located at the landing point on Acadia Islet. It was unveiled to commemorate the recovery of the anchor in 1990. The wreck lies offshore from the memorial stone in about 10 metres of water.|$|E

2500|$|In 1910, Black Americans owned 15,000,000 {{acres of}} land, {{most of it}} in Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. This figure has since {{declined}} to 5,500,000 acres in 1980 and to 2,000,000 acres in 1997. Most of this land is not the area held by Black families in 1910; beyond the [...] "Black Belt", it is located in Texas, Oklahoma, and California. The total number of Black farmers has decreased from 925,708 in 1920 to 18,000 in 1997; the number of White farmers has also decreased, but much more slowly. Black American land ownership has diminished more than that of any other ethnic group, while <b>White</b> <b>land</b> ownership has increased. Black families who inherit land across generations without obtaining an explicit title (often resulting in tenancy in common by multiple descendents) may have difficulty gaining government benefits and risk losing their land completely. Outright fraud and lynchings have also been used to strip Black people of their land.|$|E
2500|$|On April 18, 1877, a {{group of}} seven Kansans, six of whom were black, {{established}} the Nicodemus Town Company. [...] African American W.H. Smith and W.R. Hill, an experienced <b>white</b> <b>land</b> speculator, served as the town’s president and treasurer, respectively. [...] Most of the group consisted of former slaves from Kentucky {{in search of a}} new livelihood. [...] The goal was to establish [...] the first all-black settlement on the Great Plains. [...] Two theories explain the choice of the name Nicodemus. [...] One claiming the town was named after the biblical figure Nicodemus. [...] The other holds the town was inspired by the legendary account of an African prince taken into slavery who later purchased his freedom. [...] The location of the town, chosen by Hill, was along the northern bank of the Solomon River, an area suitable for developing farming. [...] The town itself was located on a 160-acre plot, of the 19,200 acres of the township, at large.|$|E
2500|$|Known as the [...] "Christian general" [...] {{because he}} tried to base his policy {{decisions}} on his deep religious piety, he was given charge of the Freedmen's Bureau in mid-1865, with the mission of integrating the freed slaves into Southern society and politics during {{the second phase of}} the Reconstruction Era. Howard took charge of labor policy, setting up a system that required free slaves to work on former plantation land under pay scales fixed by the Bureau, on terms negotiated by the Bureau with <b>white</b> <b>land</b> owners. [...] Howard's Bureau was primarily responsible for the legal affairs of the freedmen. [...] He attempted to protect freed blacks from hostile conditions, but lacked adequate power, and was repeatedly frustrated by President Andrew Johnson. Howard's allies, the Radical Republicans, won control of Congress in the 1866 elections and imposed Radical Reconstruction, with the result that freedmen were given the vote. With the help and advice of the Bureau, freedmen joined Republican coalitions and won at the ballot boxes of most of the southern states. [...] Howard was also a leader in promoting higher education for freedmen, most notably in founding of Howard University in Washington and serving as its president 1867–73.|$|E
