5|$|A trial {{assembly}} of the Gadget without the active components or explosive lenses {{was carried out by}} the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set of explosive lenses arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the best ones were selected for use. The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. This test brought bad news: magnetic measurements of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Bethe <b>worked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night to assess the results, and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} <b>worked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{procedures}} and checklists for entry on Friday, the managers {{on the ground}} closely examined the weather patterns around Florida, which were less than favorable. The crew was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms, both conditions that violated landing criteria, so managers waived the first opportunity. A second opportunity was also not taken, as the weather had not improved. Entry Flight Director Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base shortly after the decision to delay to Saturday was made, which would give the crew {{a total of six}} Saturday landing opportunities, three at each location.|$|E

Using the robotic arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson <b>worked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> procedures to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, reinforced carbon-carbon nose cap, and heat shield tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the schedule for landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early {{to try to avoid}} the possibility of showers that would prevent a landing on Friday. The new landing opportunity would bring the crew home at 10:01am EDT.|$|E
5|$|Gens had {{a dispute}} with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a {{tailoring}} workshop in the ghetto. Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating directly with the German Army and not going through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts {{to go through the}} Labor Department, Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, Hans Hingst, preferred that control of such contracts go through his own office which <b>worked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.|$|E

Thomas Talbot, an influential scion who joined the British army {{at the age of}} 11, would challenge the government, the terrain, and the forces of nature {{to see to it that}} his road be built. Due to his family legacy, Talbot <b>worked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ranks quickly and found himself a personal aide to John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. He returned to England after Simcoe fell ill, but vowed to return to the hinterland he had come to love.|$|E

5|$|GJ 3634 {{is named}} for its {{location}} in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars; a later expansion of the original catalogue was compiled jointly by Gliese and Hartmut Jahreiß. The Third Catalogue, the most recent catalogue, was formed to tag all then-known stars within 25 parsecs of Earth (81.54 light years). GJ 3634 was first catalogued in 1987. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b <b>worked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at the European Southern Observatory's La Silla Observatory in Chile for over six years in search of planets that orbited low-mass red dwarfs. After the discoveries of eleven prior planets, the researchers changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits. They would first discover the system using the radial velocity method, in which an observed Doppler shift in the star's light would be measured and interpreted; and would then follow up with a search for transits, in which the planet crosses in front of and dims its star as seen from Earth. Radial velocity measurements would help determine the most efficient and time-effective means of observing potential planetary transits.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but {{the challenge was}} met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. In October 1944, Creutz moved to Los Alamos, where he became a group leader responsible for explosive lens design verification and preliminary testing. Difficulties encountered in testing the lenses led {{to the construction of}} a special test area in Pajarito Canyon, and Creutz became responsible for testing there. As part of the preparation for the Trinity nuclear test, Creutz conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon without nuclear material. This test brought bad news; it seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Hans Bethe <b>worked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night to assess the results, and was able to report that the results were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E
5|$|White middle-class Indiana women learned {{organizational}} skills through the suffrage and temperance movements. By the 1890s they were applying their new {{skills to the}} needs of their home communities, by organizing women's clubs, the combined literary activity with social activism focused on such needs as public health, sanitation, and good schools. Hoosier women worked at both {{the state and local level}} to materialize Progressive Era reforms. In Lafayette, for example, the suffragists concentrated in the Lafayette Franchise League, while those oriented toward social concerns <b>worked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Lafayette Charity Organization Society (LCOS), the Free Kindergarten and Industrial School Association (FKISA), and the Martha Home. Albion Fellows Bacon led statewide and national efforts at housing reform. A native of Evansville, Bacon worked to pass tenement and housing legislation in Indiana in 1909, 1913, and 1917. She also held leadership roles in Indiana Child Welfare Association; the Child Welfare Committee, a part of the Women's Section of the Indiana State Council of Defense; the Indiana Conference of Charities and Corrections, and the Juvenile Advisory Commission of Indiana's Probation Department. Women in Indiana would officially gain the right to vote in 1920 when the 19th Amendment is ratified for the United States constitution.|$|E

25|$|The late 1880s was {{a period}} of great demand for John Kemp Starley's new safety bicycles. Pneumatic Tyre began cycle tyre {{production}} in Belfast in late 1890, and quickly expanded to fill consumer demand. However, in 1890, J B Dunlop's patent was withdrawn. It had been discovered that Robert William Thomson had first patented the pneumatic tyre in 1845. J B Dunlop and Harvey du Cros together <b>worked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ensuing considerable difficulties. They employed inventor Charles Kingston Welch and also acquired other rights and patents which allowed them to protect their business's position to some extent.|$|E
25|$|In {{most major}} economies using coinage, copper, {{silver and gold}} formed three tiers of coins. Gold coins were used for large purchases, payment of the {{military}} and backing of state activities. Silver coins were used for midsized transactions, and as a unit of account for taxes, dues, contracts and fealty, while copper coins represented the coinage of common transaction. This system had been used in ancient India since the time of the Mahajanapadas. In Europe, this system <b>worked</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> medieval period because there was virtually no new gold, silver or copper introduced through mining or conquest. Thus the overall ratios of the three coinages remained roughly equivalent.|$|E

It helped {{to lay the groundwork for}} new federal legislation, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, passed in 1990. Because the artifacts had already been separated from the original burials, the tribe decided to build a museum to house them. Members of the tribe were trained as conservators to repair damage by the centuries underground, and storage and handling during the ten-year court battle.|$|E
