The generic Māori language term for plants in the Cordyline genus is tī, and names recorded as specific to C.australis include tī kōuka, tī kāuka, tī rākau, tī awe, tī pua, and tī whanake. Each tribe had names for the tree depending on its local uses and characteristics. Simpson reports that the names highlight {{the characteristics of the}} tree that were important to Māori. These include what the plant looked like—whether it was a large tree (tī rākau, tī pua), the <b>whiteness</b> <b>of</b> its flowers (tī puatea), whether its leaves were broad (tī wharanui), twisted along the edges (tī tahanui), or spiky (tī tarariki). Other names refer to its uses—whether its fruit attracted birds (tī manu), or the leaves were particularly suitable for making ropes (tī whanake) and nets (tī kupenga). The most widely used name, tī kōuka, refers {{to the use of the}} leaf hearts as food.|$|E

Ivory, already a luxury {{commodity}} in Africa, became increasingly coveted {{with the growth}} of the European ivory trade. When an elephant was killed in Benin, the Oba received one tusk as a gift and was offered the other in sale. Thus, the Oba had many tusks and controlled the ivory trade. Ivory is associated with the Edo orisha of the sea, Olokun. As this orisha gives wealth and fertility, it the spirit world's equivalent of the Benin Oba. Ivory gave wealth similar to Olokun, as it enticed the Portuguese merchants who, in turn, returned wealth to Benin. The Portuguese belonged to Olokun, having arrived from the sea. The <b>whiteness</b> <b>of</b> ivory also reflects the symbolism of white chalk, whose ritual purity is associated with Olokun.|$|E

Alternatively, Pym may die in the retelling of the story at precisely the same point he should have died during the actual adventure. Like other characters in works by Poe, Pym seems to submit willingly to this fate, whatever it is. Kenneth Silverman notes that the figure radiates ambivalence and it is not clear if it is a symbol of destruction or of protection.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Edward R. Murrow School of Communication, Washington State UniversityIn this ethnographic dissertation, I {{develop a}} spatial framework, {{emphasizing}} the intersections {{of the symbolic}} and material, to contextualize and fragment our understanding <b>of</b> <b>whiteness.</b> Marrying race with space complicates essentialized depictions <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> and de-racialized descriptions of space. Extending the contributions of Henri Lefebvre, I argue that discourses <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> intersect with spatial control, exacerbating continued racial division in concrete, material locations. As space does not exist independently of discourse, it is constituted by ideological interests. Space also {{plays an important role}} in identification, and thus a more nuanced understanding <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> involves examining how spaces are represented, and the implications for white identity. In this study, I utilized observation, interviews, and mapping. My fieldwork, conducted in the spring of 2011, took place in a farm town in central Washington that relies upon migrant workers from Mexico and other parts of Latin America. The two major contributions of this research are a) the demonstration of the intersections between whiteness, space, and communication and b) the proposal of a framework for incorporating space into research on the symbolic constructions of race. White participants' spatial narratives elucidate pioneer and multiculturalist expressions <b>of</b> <b>whiteness.</b> The citation <b>of</b> an agricultural ethos also pervades discourses <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> in this community. Demographic changes evoke new discursive strategies in which space is rhetorically constructed to affirm and contract whiteness, while simultaneously justifying racial distance and naturalizing spatial avoidance. These specific articulations of space signal the resiliency <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> to morph in response to perceived threats to its position and assuage anxiety over demographic changes. A spatial approach highlights how social productions of space can both reinforce colorblindness ideology and render whiteness visible for the satiation of specific identity needs. How spaces, like those identified by members of an agricultural farm community, are represented and how those articulations both unite and separate are necessary for moving the whiteness project forwardCommunication, Washington State Universit...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{article is}} a {{theoretical}} discussion that links Marcuse’s concept of one-dimensional society and the Great Refusal with critical race theory {{in order to achieve}} a more robust interrogation <b>of</b> <b>whiteness.</b> The author argues that {{in the context of the}} United States, the one-dimensionality that Marcuse condemns in One-Dimensional Man is best illuminated by the concept <b>of</b> <b>whiteness,</b> which posits that whiteness in the context of white supremacy is an ideological manifestation of capitalism in the United States. The author furthers that the values Marcuse wants to break with or refuse in An Essay on Liberation can be more concretely captured if it is made clear that the ideology <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> represents a key part of the normative order of advanced industrial society that must be ‘Refused’. The reproduction <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> in educational structures serves to oppress raced, gendered, and classed individuals and communities who deviate from the norms established by the ideology <b>of</b> <b>whiteness.</b> Thus, in the context of education, the author proposes that the crucial theoretical tools we have to challenge one-dimensional education and refuse whiteness are critical race theory and critical multicultural education...|$|R

2500|$|Some critics {{categorize}} {{this work}} as sentimental because {{descriptions of the}} body are written in sentimental language.

This is a typical element of sentimental works, so scholars use this to prove {{that it is not a}} resistant text encouraging social reform. David Luis-Brown argues that since Ruiz constantly links feelings to whiteness and likens the Alamars to the Anglo-Americans, Squatter and the Don is complicit with, rather than resistant to, Anglo American imperial racism. However, this reading is only true if the novel is completely sentimental, which it is not due to an underlying playful tone.

40|$|The study <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> as {{a racial}} {{category}} emerged roughly {{at the same}} time as historians became interested in postcolonial theory and Subaltern Studies, and forged what became known as 'the new imperial history'. Yet the two areas had different scholarly roots. Whiteness studies grew from labour history, sociology, cultural studies, and feminist theory, among other fields. In this essay I consider some connections between whiteness studies and 'the new imperial history' as they have evolved, and a few of their implications for each other. Recent work has emphasized the global circulation of racial thinking, and historians of empire have located whiteness as a racial category in diverse colonial sites. Arguably, since the 18 th century if not before, the white settler colonies have been key sites. Relevant questions, I think, include: Has white settler colonialism been the breeding ground of specific forms <b>of</b> <b>whiteness?</b> How has the whiteness created by white settler colonialism been connected to the whiteness constructed by slavery and postslavery societies - or that of societies shaped by both slavery and settler colonialism? How has Australian history, in particular, contributed to broader understanding of changing historical constructions <b>of</b> <b>whiteness?</b> And how might analyses <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> contribute to future work in Australian history? I begin with a few notes on the emergence <b>of</b> <b>whiteness</b> studies, then move to 'the imperial turn', before considering the category of 'settler colonialism'. I then offer a few thoughts on how Australian history has contributed to broader understanding of historical constructions <b>of</b> <b>whiteness,</b> and conclude by speculating about how analyses <b>of</b> <b>whiteness,</b> including work on other settler colonies, might help to shape our understanding of the 19 th century in Australia. 9 page(s...|$|R
