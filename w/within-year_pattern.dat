40|$|Hendra virus (HeV), {{a highly}} {{pathogenic}} zoonotic paramyxovirus recently emerged from bats, {{is a major}} concern to the horse industry in Australia. Previous research has shown that higher temperatures led to lower virus survival rates in the laboratory. We develop a model of survival of HeV in the environment as influenced by temperature. We used 20 years of daily temperature at six locations spanning the geographic range of reported HeV incidents to simulate the temporal and spatial impacts of temperature on HeV survival. At any location, simulated virus survival was greater in winter than in summer, and in any month of the year, survival was higher in higher latitudes. At any location, year-to-year variation in virus survival 24 h post-excretion was substantial and was as large as the difference between locations. Survival was higher in microhabitats with lower than ambient temperature, and when environmental exposure was shorter. The <b>within-year</b> <b>pattern</b> of virus survival mirrored the cumulative within-year occurrence of reported HeV cases, although there were no overall differences in survival in HeV case years and non-case years. The model examines the effect of temperature in isolation; actual virus survivability will reflect the effect of additional environmental factor...|$|E
40|$|A {{functional}} {{data analysis}} (FDA) approach to analyse historical archives such as annually laminated (varved) lake sediments is suggested, {{with the aim}} of reconstructing past environment and climate changes. Varved lake sediment has inherent (<b>within-year)</b> seasonal <b>patterns</b> that are expected to contain valuable information about past (seasonal) climate, with similar profiles corresponding to similar climatic conditions. Image analysis is used to generate the observed data of yearly seasonal profiles in terms of a sequence of grey-scale pixel variation. FDA methods are used to cluster the seasonal patterns of the varves (years) into a set of k homogeneous groups. We propose and compare a non-parametric and a model-based FDA method, illustrated on a varved lake sediment core from the lake KassjÃ¶n (N. Sweden) covering the past > 6400 years. The possibilities to improve the clustering of the varves by incorporating covariates, time warping and time dependence between years will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Organisms usually {{benefit from}} {{heterogeneous}} conditions, but, by doing so, {{may reduce the}} degree of heterogeneity. The question therefore arises how heterogeneity is maintained. We investigated <b>within-year</b> spatiotemporal <b>patterns</b> in a monospecific stand of a submerged plant (fennel pondweed, Potamogeton pectinatus), with the novelty that we distinguished between different forms of heterogeneity: spatial variance (the frequency distribution of densities) and spatial pattern (the spatial distribution of densities). We repeatedly measured plant biomass that was affected by swan predation, winter mortality, and summer regrowth. Spatial variance was enhanced mostly by swan foraging, {{despite the fact that}} swans appear to exploit patches to the same threshold level. Spatial pattern, which had vanished after swan foraging, reestablished due to spatial pattern in winter mortality and was further enhanced by plant regrowth. We found that variance and pattern each have their own temporal dynamics and are maintained by different biological processes. We therefore advocate that it is pivotal to distinguish between variance and pattern in the study of spatial heterogeneity. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —Subadult {{red drum}} Sciaenops ocellatus were sampled in Charleston, South Carolina, from 1991 to 1999. Tagged {{individuals}} {{were subjected to}} either live recapture and release by research biologists or harvest and subsequent tag recovery by recreational anglers. Tag recovery data aggregated into 4 -month periods were analyzed using Brownie models that were parameterized in terms of fishing effort and instantaneous rates of fishing (F) and natural (M) mortality. Within-year estimates of fishing effort were calculated from the U. S. National Marine Fisheries Service’s Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey and adjusted to reflect a 4 -month harvesting period. The level of annual effort appeared stable over all years and was held constant for all analyses; however, the <b>within-year</b> seasonal <b>pattern</b> of fishing effort varied substantially. Estimates of F and M depended heavily on the values used for the tag-reporting rate (l) and the tag-retention and immediate survival rate (f). For age- 1 fish, values of f·l ranging from 0. 8 to 0. 3 produced F values between 0. 27 and 0. 71 and M values between 0. 88 and 0. 44, respectively. For age- 2 fish, similar values for f·l yielded F values of 0. 35 – 0. 92 and M values of 1. 37 – 0. 83, respectively. The natural mortality estimates for age- 2 fish also reflect emigration from the bay and estuarine systems to the coastal ocean...|$|R
40|$|Water is {{essential}} for all life on earth. Global population increase and climate change are projected to increase the water stress, which already today is very high {{in many areas of}} the world. The differences between the largest and smallest global runoff estimates exceed the highest continental runoff estimates. These differences, which are caused by different modelling and measurement techniques together with large natural variabilities need to be further addressed. This thesis focuses on global water balance models that calculate global runoff, evaporation and water storage from precipitation and other climate data. A new global water balance model, WASMOD-M was developed. Already when tuned against the volume error it reasonable produced <b>within-year</b> runoff <b>patterns,</b> but the volume error was not enough to confine the model parameter space. The parameter space and the simulated hydrograph could be better confined with, e. g., the Nash criterion. Calibration against snow-cover data confined the snow parameters better, although some equifinality still persisted. Thus, even the simple WASMOD-M showed signs of being overparameterised. A simple regionalisation procedure that only utilised proximity contributed to calculate a global runoff estimate in line with earlier estimations. The need for better specifications of global runoff estimates was highlighted. Global modellers depend on global data-sets that can have low quality in many areas. Major sources of uncertainty are precipitation and river regulation. A new routing method that utilises high-resolution flow network information in low-resolution calculations was developed and shown to perform well over all spatial scales, while the standard linear reservoir routing decreased in performance with decreasing resolution. This algorithm, called aggregated time-delay-histogram routing, is intended for inclusion in WASMOD-M...|$|R
