25|$|The Fairfax {{estate was}} also {{the site of the}} last {{political}} duel fought in California, on the afternoon of May 25, 1861, between State Assemblymen Daniel Showalter and Charles W. Piercy. Though Fairfax served them lunch and tried to dissuade them, the two men <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> grassy meadow and fired rifles at 40 paces. Piercy was killed by the second volley.|$|E
25|$|The civil celebrant {{program is}} almost entirely the result of one man's vision. Murphy himself told me {{the story of how}} he was opposed by his own staff, the public service, his fellow members of {{parliament}} and officials of the Labour Party. He defied all, and, on July 19, 1973, in the dead of night, typed the first appointment himself, found the envelope and stamp, <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> post box and posted it himself.|$|E

25|$|Kerik {{was serving}} as police {{commissioner}} during the September 11 attacks. He {{was in his}} office when American Airlines Flight 11 hit the North Tower. He arrived {{at the base of}} the North Tower three minutes before United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower, showering him and his staff with debris from the burning tower and plane. Giuliani arrived within minutes afterward and the two men <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> temporary command post on West Street to meet with senior police and fire personnel.|$|E
25|$|Around {{midnight on}} August 16, 1996, {{following}} a day spent together drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, 18-year-old Daryl Atkins and his accomplice, William Jones, <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nearby convenience store where they abducted Eric Nesbitt, an airman from nearby Langley Air Force Base. Unsatisfied with the $60 {{they found in}} his wallet, Atkins drove Nesbitt in his own vehicle to a nearby ATM and forced him to withdraw a further $200. In spite of Nesbitt's pleas, the two abductors then drove him to an isolated location, where he was shot eight times, killing him.|$|E
25|$|On 23 February 1808 Hirondelle {{was under}} the command of Lieutenant Joseph Kidd and {{transporting}} despatches from Malta to Tunis. Suddenly breakeers were sighted ahead and though the crew threw over anchors, it was too late and she grounded. Waves swamped a boat carrying some of the crew that were leaving the ship. The brig then capsized. In all, next morning there were only four survivors, with Kidd not being among them. The survivors <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nearby village. The court martial found that Hirondelle had probably steered a wrong course that led her into Cape Bon.|$|E

25|$|On July 13, 1991, Bruce Hamill {{went to a}} {{hardware}} store, bought a plumber's wrench, hatchet, knives and a sleeping bag, {{then went to the}} Brockville hospital and signed out Krueger on his first publicly escorted day pass. During the first hour of his first weekend pass (unsupervised release) in 34 years, Krueger arranged to meet Dennis Kerr in the woods near Brockville where Krueger would loan Kerr five hundred dollars. When Dennis Kerr arrived as instructed, Krueger struck him in the head with the pipe wrench and continued to beat him into unconsciousness. Krueger and Hamill then seized the hatchet and knife they had hidden in the bushes while waiting for Kerr's arrival and hacked and stabbed Kerr, mutilating his body, cutting it open, and nearly severing his head. Drenched in Kerr's blood, they then stripped themselves naked and sodomized the corpse. Krueger then left the scene, <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> police station about two miles away, and turned himself in.|$|E
25|$|Apparently {{dizzy and}} disoriented, Tunney grabbed {{on to the}} ring's top rope with his left hand. Dempsey, who used to stand over opponents and rush right back at them after they got up, looked down on Tunney. Referee Dave Barry ordered Dempsey into a neutral corner to no avail; Dempsey just stood there, observing his opponent. This gave Tunney {{precious}} seconds to recuperate. By the time Dempsey finally <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> neutral corner, Tunney had been down for around 3 to 8 seconds. Barry could not start to count on Tunney until Dempsey reached the neutral corner, {{but he was still}} able to count to nine before Tunney got up. Some believe that if Dempsey had responded to the referee's orders in time, he would have likely regained the world Heavyweight crown with a seventh round knockout of Tunney. The validity of this argument has been debated even to this day. In the fight film, a clock was superimposed that recorded Tunney's time on the floor as 13 seconds, from the moment he fell until he got up. Because of this delay, it became known as The Long Count Fight.|$|E
500|$|As Lennon and Ono <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> limousine, {{shared with}} the RKO Radio crew, they were {{approached}} by several people seeking autographs. Among them was Mark David Chapman. It was common for fans to wait outside the Dakota to meet Lennon and ask for his autograph. Chapman, a 25-year-old security guard from Honolulu, Hawaii, had previously travelled to New York to murder Lennon in October (before the release of Double Fantasy), but had {{changed his mind and}} returned home. Chapman silently handed Lennon a copy of Double Fantasy, and Lennon obliged with an autograph. After signing the album, Lennon asked, [...] "Is this all you want?" [...] Chapman smiled and nodded in agreement. Photographer and Lennon fan Paul Goresh took a photo of the encounter.|$|E

2500|$|With {{a gun to}} her back, Haq {{reportedly}} told the girl, [...] "Open the door," [...] and [...] "careful", as she was buzzed into the building.

Haq stopped to ask receptionist Layla Bush about speaking with a manager, at which point the girl <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bathroom and locked herself inside. At this point, Cheryl Stumbo asked fellow employee Carol Goldman to call 911. But, before Goldman could complete a call, Haq shot Goldman in the knee. Stumbo's niece, in the bathroom, heard her and dialed 911.|$|E

2500|$|The MIC {{gas leak}} emanating from tank E610 petered out at {{approximately}} 2:00a.m. Fifteen minutes later, the plant's public siren was sounded {{for an extended}} period of time, after first having been quickly silenced an hour and a half earlier. Some minutes after the public siren sounded, a UCIL employee <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> police control room to both inform them of the leak (their first acknowledgement that one had occurred at all), and that [...] "the leak had been plugged." [...] Most city residents who were exposed to the MIC gas were first made aware of the leak by exposure to the gas itself, or by opening their doors to investigate commotion, rather than having been instructed to shelter in place, or to evacuate before the arrival of the gas in the first place.|$|E
2500|$|While not {{active in}} any Watergate {{activities}} per se, Gray was aware through {{his dealings with}} John Dean that the White House was concerned about what might be discovered from a full-field FBI investigation and explored {{what he could do}} to limit the investigation or shift it away from the Bureau’s jurisdiction. As Dean wrote in his Watergate memoir “Blind Ambition,” he used Gray as a shill knowing that “we could count on Pat Gray to keep the Hunt material from becoming public, and he did not disappoint us.” [...] In fact, even though he thought of this as a political not criminal situation and that he was ultimately serving the President as the “nation’s chief law enforcement officer,” Gray would come dangerously close to collusion because he chose to be useful to the White House without asking the hard questions. Dean goes on to say, “I met Pat Gray secretly at his home in southwest Washington. We were both apprehensive about the meeting as we <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> park and sat down on a bench overlooking the Potomac, discussing my request to obtain FBI 302s and AirTels on the Watergate investigation." ...|$|E
