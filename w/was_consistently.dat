Spectroscopic techniques were rarely taught in chemistry classes and were unfamiliar to most practicing chemists.

5|$|Fatigue {{from the}} South African tour {{affected}} Hobbs in 1910. He scored 1,982 runs {{at an average}} of 33.03, the lowest average of his career apart from his first season. More effective during 1911, after a long rest during the winter, Hobbs <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> successful in a hot, dry summer which produced good batting pitches. He played few large innings, but was very effective in high-pressure games, and scored 2,376 runs at 41.68. Bowling more frequently than in other seasons, Hobbs took 28 first-class wickets. Against Oxford University, Hobbs bowled throughout the second innings to take seven wickets for 56 runs, the best figures of his career.|$|E
5|$|Jenner would {{normally}} {{wake up to}} pray at 5am each day. In the 1940s, Jenner left the Glanton Brethren and joined the Open Brethren. For {{the rest of his}} life, Jenner attended Open Brethren churches: one on Goulburn Street in Sydney and the other in Bexley, New South Wales. At these churches, people did not understand what narcolepsy was and thought that Jenner <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> falling asleep during services because he lacked respect for God. The church on Goulburn Street also disapproved of his partnership with other Christian organisations and churches; Jenner actively partnered with The Navigators, Campaigners for Christ, Baptists, Anglicans, and Methodists.|$|E

In contrast, those who <b>were</b> <b>consistently</b> positive <b>were</b> more likely to be male, European, hold a university degree, have a household income over $100,000 per year, and live in the Wellington metro area.|$|R
5|$|Lassie themes {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} boys and their dogs with the show helping to shape the viewer's understanding of mid-twentieth century American boyhood. Lassie {{was associated with the}} wholesome family values of its period but some parents' groups monitoring television content found cliffhanger plots showing children in danger too intense for very young viewers and objected to some of Timmy's actions which were believed to encourage children to disobey parents. However, Lassie <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> depicted as caring, nurturing, and responsible with a commitment to family and community, often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs. She was the perfect 'mother' within the American ideology of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 2002, Blizzard Entertainment {{announced}} {{the development of}} StarCraft: Ghost in conjunction with fellow video game company Nihilistic Software. Nihilistic aimed to release the game for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube video game consoles in late 2003, which elicited positive reactions from the press. The game <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> delayed, and during {{the third quarter of}} 2004, Nihilistic discontinued their work on the project. Blizzard stated that Nihilistic had completed the tasks it had been contracted for, and the game would be delivered on time.|$|E
5|$|T.F. Tout, in 1914 one of {{the first}} historians to make a {{thorough}} academic study of the period, considered Pembroke the one favourable exception in an age of small-minded and incompetent leaders. Tout wrote of a 'middle party', led by Pembroke, representing a moderate position between the extremes of Edward and Lancaster. This 'middle party' supposedly took control of royal government through the Treaty of Leake in 1318. In his authoritative study of 1972, J.R.S. Phillips rejects this view. In spite of misgivings with the King’s favourites, Pembroke <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> loyal to Edward. What was accomplished in 1318 was not the takeover by a 'middle party', but simply a restoration of royal power.|$|E

5|$|The 1896 {{establishment}} of the Gympie Truth, a newspaper {{that he was to}} partly own, was part of his response. Intended as a medium to broadcast Labour's message, the newspaper played a vital role in Fisher's return to parliament in 1899. This time, he was the beneficiary of a scare campaign, in which conservative candidate Francis Power <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> painted by the Gympie Truth as being a supporter of black labour and the alleged economic and social ills that accompanied it. In that year he was Secretary for Railways and Public Works in the seven-day government of Anderson Dawson, the first parliamentary Labour government in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} Giffnock railway station in 1866 allowed {{business}} people to build sandstone villas and commute daily to the city. At the time, {{it was much}} more desirable to live in Giffnock than to live in the smog-polluted city. By the early 1890s, residential Giffnock began to grow around the railway station and Eastwood Toll, and by 1892 gas was introduced to the area. Gas street lamps were erected by Busby and District Gas Company in 1893; however, these were supported by a voluntary subscription that many households refused to pay, leaving many areas unlit. It was not until October 1896, when Eastwood Parish Council took over street lighting, that the area <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> lit at night.|$|E
5|$|The show {{averaged}} a 2.0 Nielsen rating over August and September 1996, considered a strong start for an animated series. Though Cartoon Network suffered declining viewership in 1996, Quest <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> {{one of the}} highest-rated programs; later season-one episodes drew around 650,000viewers. Real Adventuress merchandise performed poorly, and it failed to build consistent ratings in its targeted demographics (though it did attract adult audiences). Turner tried to revive interest in February 1997 with a contest for an adventurous trip to Jamaica called Quest World Adventure.|$|E

5|$|However, the BC NDP {{were deeply}} unpopular within the province, {{reaching}} a low at 15% support in opinion polls {{at the time}} of Glen Clark's resignation as Premier in August 1999. With Dosanjh as leader, support had risen to 21% by August 2000. Dosanjh <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> ranked higher personal popularity over opposition leader Gordon Campbell until the run-up to the May 16, 2001, provincial election. Dosanjh and the BC NDP knew they would not be reelected, so they concentrated their campaign to a few ridings in the Lower Mainland which were still considered competitive. Their campaign focused on the expanding economy, issues of health care and education, and Dosanjh's personal popularity over Campbell. Dosanjh conceded defeat a week before the election, but requested voters consider making the NDP a strong opposition party. After the vote, on May 16, Dosanjh lost his seat in Vancouver-Kensington along with all but two members of his Cabinet in the second-worst defeat of a sitting provincial government in Canada. The BC Liberals won all 77 other seats.|$|E
5|$|Its writing <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> {{praised by}} reviewers. The {{narrative}} was considered deep, successfully using White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade content. Eurogamer {{said that it}} had the best script the website had ever seen in a video game, and others {{described it as a}} superbly crafted tale of conspiracies, underworld subterfuge, fun and intrigue. Reviewers appreciated the use of adult themes, such as sex and death, in the storyline of a contemporary video game, which no other games had tackled with similar effectiveness. The mature themes succeeded without being gratuitous or exploitative, and were explored honestly and intelligently by a knowledgeable writer. The game's characters were praised for their memorable, developed personalities, with most major characters possessing their own backstory and presented as living people instead of ciphers. Its ending had a mixed response, with some reviewers appreciating their ability to choose one of the game's four endings (adding an incentive to replay the game) and others considering the ending anti-climatic.|$|E
5|$|Kubo {{said that}} Ichigo {{was created to}} replace Rukia as the protagonist of the series because he felt she wasn't suited for the role. His {{character}} has been well received among both readers and reviewers. Ichigo is often featured in Weekly Shōnen Jump character popularity polls. He <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> ranked as the most popular character in Bleach. The 2007 Japanese Newtype magazine polls ranked Ichigo {{as one of the}} top 100 most-loved anime characters. Reviewers of the series have praised his personality, though some consider him to be a stereotypical anti-hero. Merchandise based on Ichigo's likeness has been released, including toys, clothing and action figures. In the animated adaptations of Bleach, Ichigo is voiced by Masakazu Morita in Japanese. In the English adaptations, he is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch. In the live-action film, he will be played by Sota Fukushi.|$|E

5|$|Menchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose {{to second}} before stage 12, the {{very long and}} hilly {{individual}} time trial in Cinque Terre. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, and fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages {{to make up the}} time difference, which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses at the finish line in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the finish line.|$|E
5|$|The {{average age}} of the Politburo's members was 58 years in 1961, and 71 in 1981. A similar greying also took place in the Central Committee, the median age rising from 53 in 1961 to 62 in 1981, with the {{proportion}} of members older than 65 increasing from 3 percent in 1961 to 39 percent in 1981. The difference in the median age between Politburo and Central Committee members {{can be explained by the}} fact that the Central Committee <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> enlarged during Brezhnev's leadership; this made it possible to appoint new and younger members to the Central Committee without retiring some of its oldest members. Of the 319-member Central Committee in 1981, 130 were younger than 30 when Stalin died in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Though she {{had missed}} out on Commonwealth Games selection, Kydd had {{established}} {{a reputation as a}} particularly difficult opponent {{by the beginning of the}} 2002 Commonwealth Bank Trophy season. She <b>was</b> <b>consistently</b> among the league's top goalers, particularly after she was again paired with Burton, due to the axing of struggling new recruit Kristy Doyle. She scored her 500th goal with the Kestrels in the middle of the season, and excelled against some particularly difficult opponents, including then-Australian captain Kathryn Harby-Williams. She was integral in helping the Kestrels make the semifinals for the first time since 1999, and was the third-highest scorer in the league. Kydd was again named in the extended national squad at the end of the season, and finally survived the cut, being named in the squad to tour Jamaica in early 2003, beating rival shooters Jane Altschwager and Megan Dehn (née Anderson) for the vacancy caused by the retirement of veteran player Jacqui Delaney.|$|E
