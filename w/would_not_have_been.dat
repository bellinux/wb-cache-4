5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates because they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and}} neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> elevated.|$|E

5|$|The {{need to keep}} {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> informed about any of the incidents prior to the attack, they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated {{in the early hours of}} the attack.|$|E
5|$|Although {{born into}} an Anglican family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, {{had it been}} made public, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{considered}} orthodox by mainstream Christianity; in recent times he {{has been described as}} a heretic.|$|E

5|$|On {{their way}} to Vaes Dothrak with Drogo's khalasar, Jorah Mormont reveals to Viserys that he was exiled for selling poachers to slavers.

5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical form that <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to address a person of high rank. The instructions were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaurs {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and {{the total number of}} genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. An earlier study predicted that about 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many that <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> preserved in the fossil record. By September 17, 2008, 1047 different species of dinosaurs had been named.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{gave birth}} to her first child, Prince Charles, on 14 November 1948.

A second child, Princess Anne, was born in 1950.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that documents had surfaced indicating that Speer had approved {{the allocation of}} materials {{for the expansion of}} Auschwitz after two of his assistants toured the facility on a day when almost a thousand Jews were killed.

5|$|On 5 September 2012, Alessandro Del Piero {{signed a}} two-year deal with Sydney FC. He was paid {{approximately}} AU$3.5million {{for each of}} his first two seasons, and therefore became the highest-paid footballer to ever play in Australia. Del Piero had been linked to Liverpool prior to signing for Sydney, but later revealed due to his memories of Heysel he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able {{to move to the}} club.|$|E
5|$|Sanders {{says that}} Jesus' mission {{was not about}} repentance, {{although}} he acknowledges that this opinion is unpopular. He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was John the Baptist's message, and that Jesus' ministry <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant. According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 343 and 340BC, Neaira {{was brought}} to trial by Theomnestus {{on behalf of his}} {{father-in-law}} Apollodorus, accused of xenias (representing herself as a citizen when in fact she was not). If she was convicted, the maximum penalty Neaira faced was being sold into slavery and having her property sold. Neaira herself <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> permitted to speak at her trial, though she was probably present.|$|E

5000|$|The Clare {{part of the}} {{constituency}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> included since 1923 in the Clare constituency.

5|$|The Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone, {{from where}} Euchambersia is known, {{represents}} a floodplain that {{was covered in}} many small, relatively straight streams. The water level in these streams was probably seasonally dependent. Judging from pollen preserved in the Cistecephalus AZ, the pollen taxon Pityosporites (which probably originated from a plant similar to Glossopteris) was very common, forming some 80% to 90% of the pollen discovered (although the prevalent sediments <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ideal for pollen preservation).|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of the Space Exploration Center's Inquiry Room was influenced by Sylvia Anderson, who {{in her role as}} producer supervised design aspects and wanted the light-blue uniforms of the SEC officials to be vividly contrasted with a tangerine and black duotone backdrop. Director David Lane recalls that the Inquiry Room scene depicted a panel made up of 20 puppets, an achievement which <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> possible in one of the Thunderbirds television episodes due to the smaller budget.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} {{appears to}} have been compiled from two different versions: according to some verses there were 300 men of the Gododdin, and only one, Cynon ap Clydno, survived; in others there were 363 warriors and three survivors, in addition to the poet, who as a bard, almost certainly <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> counted as one of the warriors. The names of about eighty warriors are given in the poem.|$|E
