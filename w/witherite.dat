5|$|The {{abundance}} of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source of barium is barite (also called barytes or heavy spar), a barium sulfate mineral. with deposits {{in many parts}} of the world. Another commercial source, far less important than barite, is <b>witherite,</b> a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.|$|E
25|$|The barium {{source was}} either <b>witherite</b> (BaCO3) or baryte (BaSO4). The rarity of <b>witherite</b> may favor baryte {{as the most}} likely source. Baryte has a slower {{decomposition}} rate and so favors Han blue production. <b>Witherite</b> conversely favors Han purple. In the use of baryte, lead salts (lead carbonate or lead oxide) would have been needed to increase yield. Lead has been detected in association with Han purple and Han blue.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{naturally}} occurring minerals of barium are barite (barium sulfate, BaSO4) and <b>witherite</b> (barium carbonate, BaCO3), both insoluble in water. The barium name originates from the alchemical derivative [...] "baryta", from Greek βαρύς (barys), meaning [...] "heavy." [...] Baric is the adjectival form of barium. Barium {{was identified as}} a new element in 1774, but not reduced to a metal until 1808 with the advent of electrolysis.|$|E
500|$|Carl Scheele {{determined}} that barite contained a new element in 1774, {{but could not}} isolate barium, only barium oxide. Johan Gottlieb Gahn also isolated barium oxide two years later in similar studies. Oxidized barium was at first called [...] "barote" [...] by Guyton de Morveau, a name that was changed by Antoine Lavoisier to baryta. Also in the 18th century, English mineralogist William Withering noted a heavy mineral in the lead mines of Cumberland, now known to be <b>witherite.</b> Barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy in England. Davy, by analogy with calcium, named [...] "barium" [...] after baryta, with the [...] "-ium" [...] ending signifying a metallic element. Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen obtained pure barium by electrolysis of a molten mixture of barium chloride and ammonium chloride.|$|E
500|$|Strontium {{is named}} after the Scottish village of Strontian (Gaelic Sròn an t-Sìthein), where it was {{discovered}} in the ores of the lead mines. In 1790, Adair Crawford, a physician engaged {{in the preparation of}} barium, and his colleague William Cruickshank, recognised that the Strontian ores exhibited properties that differed from those in other [...] "heavy spars" [...] sources. This allowed Adair to conclude on page 355 [...] "...it is probable indeed, that the scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined." [...] The physician and mineral collector Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer analysed together with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach the mineral from Strontian and named it strontianite. He also {{came to the conclusion that}} it was distinct from the <b>witherite</b> and contained a new earth (neue Grunderde). In 1793 Thomas Charles Hope, a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow proposed the name [...] strontites. [...] He confirmed the earlier work of Crawford and recounted: [...] "...Considering it a peculiar earth I thought it necessary to give it an name. I have called it Strontites, from the place it was found; a mode of derivation in my opinion, fully as proper as any quality it may possess, which is the present fashion." [...] The element was eventually isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 by the electrolysis of a mixture containing strontium chloride and mercuric oxide, and announced by him in a lecture to the Royal Society on 30 June 1808. In keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths, he changed the name to strontium.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Witherite</b> BaCO3: <b>Witherite</b> is an {{abundant}} barium mineral at Rampgill. Mostly massive and colourless to brown. Barrel-shaped masses up to 15 cm across of radiating <b>witherite,</b> {{often with a}} rudimentary hexagonal cross-section,have been found in cavities in the rock. [...] <b>Witherite</b> from Rampgill fluoresces white and calcite fluoresces red under SW ultraviolet light. Both phosphoresce.|$|E
50|$|Baryte, BaS04, is an {{extremely}} stable mineral. Under surface and near surface conditions it is far less soluble in aqueous solutions than are the barium carbonate minerals <b>witherite</b> BaC03, barytocalcite BaCa(C03)2 and alstonite BaCa(C03)2, so baryte replaces the more soluble minerals. This is demonstrated by the numerous pseudomorphs and partial pseudomorphs of baryte after these carbonates. The sharp pointed crystals of baryte that occur, particularly where <b>witherite</b> is also present, are secondary in nature, forming from <b>witherite.</b> The change from <b>witherite</b> to baryte, however, can also go the other way, with barium carbonates, particularly <b>witherite,</b> replacing baryte. Replacement of baryte by both barytocalcite and <b>witherite</b> has occurred on a significant scale at Rampgill mine.|$|E

50|$|The mineral <b>witherite</b> (barium carbonate) was {{discovered}} in spoil from the mines in the 18th century.

50|$|Initially {{cavities}} {{formed in}} the rocks, {{and some of these}} were then lined with quartz and sphalerite crystals followed by fluorite.
