25|$|Water {{quality in}} Nicaragua was {{monitored}} from 1971 to 1986. Due to economics, the monitoring ceased in 1986. Since then, the only information available on water quality is obtained from site-specific studies. It has been recommended that an environmental <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> system be {{established for the}} purpose of monitoring water quality.|$|E
25|$|CONAGUA is {{formally}} {{under the}} authority of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaria del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales – SEMARNAT) but it enjoys considerable de facto autonomy. It employs 17,000 professionals, has 13 regional offices and 32 state offices and had an annual budget of US$1.2 billion in 2005. It also directly manages certain key hydraulic facilities such as the Cutzamala Pipeline that supplies a large share of the water used in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City. CONAGUA also owns and operates most dams in Mexico and operates the country’s <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> network.|$|E

25|$|Sewage is a {{major cause}} of water {{pollution}} in Brazil, a major problem that undermines quality of life, health, and economic development in large metropolitan areas and has a disproportionate impact on the poor in the slums surrounding Brazil’s largest cities. According to the 2000 National Survey of Sanitary Conditions (PNSB), less than 10% of the wastewater produced in urban areas is treated. The 2000 PNSB was the latest survey of water supply for human consumption and wastewater collection and treatment conducted nationwide. Water quality management is also undertaken by the states, although the quality of their <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems and surveys varies widely. In 2006, only nine Brazilian states had water quality monitoring systems that were rated as excellent or very good; five had good or fair systems; and thirteen had weak systems.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, the DFG {{completed}} its first natural resource {{inventory of the}} Smith River, a necessary step toward the department's first formal management plan for the river. The report was not comprehensive, focusing primarily on big game, sport fish, game birds, and ducks. The report {{made a number of}} recommendations, including: 1) New state legislation to protect the river; 2) Adoption of a statewide water quality and <b>water</b> <b>monitoring</b> plan; 3) A rural zoning act, to minimize development along rivers and streams; 4) Appropriation of extensive funds to allow DFG to purchase land along the Smith River; and 5) Adoption of a sport fish management plan. This last recommendation included limiting the fishing season, adopting limits on the number of fish taken ("creel limits"), encouragement of commercial fishing of undesirable fish, and the stocking of hatchery-raised sport fish.|$|E
2500|$|The 1989 EPA Total Coliform Rule (TCR) imposed major {{monitoring}} {{changes for}} public water systems.

2500|$|As global populations grow, and {{as demand}} for food {{increases}} {{in a world}} with a fixed water supply, there are efforts under way {{to learn how to}} produce more food with less water, through improvements in irrigation [...] methods [...] and technologies, agricultural water management, crop types, and <b>water</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Aquaculture is a small but growing agricultural use of water. [...] Freshwater commercial fisheries may also be considered as agricultural uses of water, but have generally been assigned a lower priority than irrigation (see Aral Sea and Pyramid Lake).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fire <b>water</b> <b>monitor</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used equipments in fire fighting. A liquamatic fire <b>water</b> <b>monitor</b> with self-swinging device was designed. The mechanism of an impeller driving four bar linkage was applied as the self-swinging device. The working principle of the liquamatic fire <b>water</b> <b>monitor</b> was introduced. The internal flow performance was simulated using Fluent software; and the influence rules on jet characteristics were analyzed by changing the cross-sectional shape and diameters of the monitor body, inlet pressure and drive set of the self-swinging device. These analyses led to the optimal structural parameters of flow channel. These simulation results will provide useful theoretical guidance for design of other types of fire <b>water</b> <b>monitor...</b>|$|R
