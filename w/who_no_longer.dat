5|$|A weary emperor <b>who</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> {{cared for}} the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E

5|$|Spiritualism {{appealed to}} many educated Victorians <b>who</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> found {{traditional}} religious doctrine, {{such as that}} of the Church of England, acceptable yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical view of the world that was increasingly emerging from 19th-century science. However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised that, for him, spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief. Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer Robert Owen, who was one of Wallace's early idols, the physicists William Crookes and Lord Rayleigh, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan, and the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Film Library {{was turned}} into a {{combined}} Film & Videotape Library for the preservation of both media. The Film Library at the time held only 47 episodes of 1960s Doctor Who; they had once held 53, but six episodes had either been junked or gone missing. Junkings at BBC Enterprises, however, continued until the intervention of Ian Levine, a record producer and fan of the programme. Following the transfer of episodes still held by Enterprises, there were 152 episodes of Doctor <b>Who</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> held by the BBC, although subsequent efforts have reduced that number to 97.|$|E

Anne of The Famous Five stating that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girl's dolls was removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{basis of}} the musical is the 1951 novel From Here to Eternity by James Jones. In 1941, Jones was serving with the US Army in Hawaii, {{at the time of}} Pearl Harbor, and the novel was loosely based on his {{experiences}} in the 27th Infantry Regiment. It focuses on the lives of a group of soldiers {{in the months leading up}} to the attack, in particular Private Prewiit, a boxer <b>who</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> wants to fight having blinded an opponent, and Sergeant Milt Warden, who has an affair with the wife of his commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|A weary Emperor <b>who</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> {{cared for}} the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and the politicians proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{requirements}} of the Foundling Hospital was that babies were to be less than six months old at the time of admittance, but the hospital did not keep more accurate records of age. Another requirement was that foundlings were given a new name and a reference number, so Sabrina became Girl Ann Kingston no. 4759. She was taken in by a wet nurse, Mary Penfold, who brought her to Wotton, Surrey, where she remained until 1759, when she was two years old. Although it was usual for foundlings to remain with their wet nurse until the age of five or six, the Foundling Hospital had received an influx of new babies and moved many children <b>who</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> required nursing, including Sabrina, to the Shrewsbury branch of the Foundling Hospital. The Shrewsbury building was not completed until 1765, so in the meantime Sabrina and another foundling were cared for by a nurse, Ann Casewell, at her home.|$|E
5|$|Paleo-Indians {{visited the}} area about 12,000 {{years ago but}} did not leave much archaeological {{evidence}}. Northern Shoshone created trails through the Craters of the Moon Lava Field during their summer migrations from the Snake River to the camas prairie, west of the lava field. Stone windbreaks at Indian Tunnel were used to protect campsites from the dry summer wind. No evidence exists for permanent habitation by any Native American group. A hunting and gathering culture, the Northern Shoshone pursued elk, bears, American bison, cougars, and bighorn sheepâ€” all large game <b>who</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> range the area. The most recent volcanic eruptions ended about 2,100 years ago and were likely witnessed by the Shoshone people. Shoshone legend speaks of a serpent on a mountain who, angered by lightning, coiled around and squeezed the mountain until liquid rock flowed, fire shot from cracks, and the mountain exploded.|$|E
5|$|The first New Jersey State Constitution, {{ratified}} in 1776, {{provided that}} a governor be elected annually {{by the state}} legislature, the members of which were selected by the several counties. Under this constitution, the governor {{was president of the}} upper house of the legislature, then called the Legislative Council. The 1844 constitution provided for a popular vote to elect the governor, <b>who</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> presided over the upper house of the legislature, now called the Senate. The 1844 constitution also lengthened the governor's term to three years, set to start on the third Tuesday in January following an election, and barred governors from succeeding themselves. The 1947 constitution extended terms to four years, and limits governors from being elected to more than two consecutive terms, though they can run again after a third term has passed.|$|E
