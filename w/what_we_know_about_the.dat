25|$|Ptolemy's {{comprehensive}} treatise {{of mathematical}} astronomy superseded most older texts of Greek astronomy. Some were more specialized and thus of less interest; others simply became outdated by the newer models. As a result, the older texts {{ceased to be}} copied and were gradually lost. Much of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> work of astronomers like Hipparchus comes from references in the Syntaxis.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} rich archaeological and {{linguistic}} evidence of earlier Germanic religious ideas, these sources are all mute, and cannot {{be interpreted with}} much confidence. Seen in light of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> medieval survival of the Germanic religions as practiced by the Nordic nations, some educated guesses may be made. However, the presence of marked regional differences make generalization of any such reconstructed belief or practice a risky venture.|$|E

25|$|Much of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> site {{is due to}} {{the large}} number of altars, {{dedication}} slabs and a milestone dedicated to emperor Gordian III found half a mile away from the fort on the path of Dere Street. Gods worshipped include traditional Roman deities such as Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and Silvanus and Celtic and Germanic ones such as Garmangabis. From such stones and building inscriptions we know who built the fort and eventually garrisoned it.|$|E
25|$|Much of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{elemental}} composition of Mars comes from orbiting spacecraft and landers. (See Exploration of Mars for list.) Most of these spacecraft carry spectrometers and other instruments {{to measure the}} surface composition of Mars by either remote sensing from orbit or in situ analyses on the surface. We also have many actual samples of Mars {{in the form of}} meteorites that have made their way to Earth. Martian meteorites (often called SNC's, for Shergottites, Nakhlites, and Chassignites—the groups of meteorites first shown to have a martian origin) provide data on the chemical composition of Mars' crust and interior that would not otherwise be available except through a sample return mission.|$|E
2500|$|Structures at La Venta {{show that}} “various architectural-sculptural canons were firmly established—canons that were, in essence, used in civic-ceremonial constructions {{throughout}} the cultural history of ancient Middle America.” [...] In other words, most of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Olmec, from La Venta, {{comes from the}} architecture and artifacts left behind and from these clues it can be discerned that Maya and Aztec culture and ideology was heavily influenced by the Olmec “mother culture.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Jetté {{pointed out}} that William of Malmesbury in De Gestis Regis Anglorum and several later chronicles {{unambiguously}} state that Agatha's sister was a Queen of Hungary. From <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> biography of Edward the Exile, he loyally supported Andrew I of Hungary, following him from Kiev to Hungary in 1046 and staying at his court for many years. Andrew's wife and queen was Anastasia, a daughter of Yaroslav the Wise of Kiev by Ingigerd of Sweden. Following Jetté's logic, Edward's wife was another daughter of Yaroslav.|$|E
