In order {{to investigate the}} properties ofthe fabric, four different samples were knitted by selecting four different run-in ratios of elastane and Nylon. Elastane yarn was kept at a constant elongation of 65 % for all four samples. Two samples were produced keeping constant run-in of nylon yarn and changing the run-in length of elastane yarn. Then elastane yarn run-in was kept constant and produced two other samples. The sample with minimum run-in length of elastane yarn and the highest run-in ratio has the highest value of load at 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % extensions in length direction and the lowest values of load at 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % extensions in <b>width</b> <b>direction.</b> This {{is due to the}} fact that low run in of elastane yarn increases the strain on the yarn and it increases the tightness factor value of the sample and contributes higher load at extension along the length direction of the greige sample.

The smectite group refers to a family of non-metallic clays primarily composed of hydrated sodium calcium aluminium silicate, a group of monoclinic clay-like minerals with general formula (Ca, Na, H)(Al, Mg, Fe, Zn) 2 (Si, Al) 4 O 10 (OH) 2 ·nH 2 O (Grim 1962). Chemically, it is hydrated sodium calcium aluminium magnesium silicate hydroxide (Na,Ca) x (Al,Mg) 2 (Si 4 O 10)(OH) 2 ·nH 2 O. Potassium, iron and other cations are common substitutes and the exact ratio of cations varies with source (Jaafar 2006). The basic structural unit is a layer consisting of two inward-pointing tetrahedral sheets with a central alumina octahedral sheet. The layers are continuous in the length and <b>width</b> <b>directions,</b> but the bonds between these layers are weak and have excellent cleavage, allowing water and other molecules to enter between the layers causing expansion in the highness direction.
