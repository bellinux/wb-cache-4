5|$|Architectural {{historian}} Anthony Emery {{argues that}} the castle was built in three phases, starting with the central keep, which he believes <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> a largely unfortified summer residence for the Abbot. With the increased threat from Scotland and the granting of the licence to crenellate, Emery suggests that the inner bailey wall was then constructed to better defend the keep, followed by the outer bailey wall in a final phase of work.|$|E
5|$|Fans of Ultra {{were open}} about liking it {{and sent a}} {{significant}} amount of correspondence to Image and the Luna Brothers. The series <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> a finite story, but its success prompted Image to ask the creators to continue the story. Instead, they chose to move on to a different project, Girls, which began in May 2005.|$|E

5|$|The H-9 <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> {{a trainer}} with dual control columns. The {{airframe}} was a H-1 variant rebuild. The powerplants {{consisted of two}} JumoA-1s or D-1s. The H-10 was also designated to trainer duties. Rebuilt from an H-2 or H-3 airframe, it was installed with full defensive armament including 13mm (.51in) MG 131 and 7.92mm (.312in) MG 81Z machine guns. It was to be powered by two Jumo 211A-1s, D-1s or F-2s.|$|E
5|$|The Z-8 Geier was not produced. It <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> {{a ground}} attack {{aircraft}} {{and reached the}} first planning phase but was given up {{due to lack of}} performance and protective armour allocation against anti-aircraft artillery. An increase in armour would have meant a decrease in speed which would have exposed the aircraft further to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} rhetorician Libanius delivered Julian's funeral oration in 363, whose text survives. This {{contains some}} {{details about the}} battle which are missing in Ammianus, which he presumably learnt from members of Julian's entourage. But because his oration <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> a eulogy, not a historical narrative, his account of Julian's campaign is unreliable, and Ammianus' version is to be preferred {{where there is a}} contradiction.|$|E

5|$|The first live-action film {{based on}} Spider-Man was the {{unauthorized}} short Spider-Man by Donald F. Glut in 1969. This {{was followed by}} Spider-Man, an American made-for-television film that premiered on the CBS network in 1977. It starred Nicholas Hammond and <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> a backdoor pilot for what became a weekly episodic TV series.|$|E
5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> {{a replacement for}} the SU-122. Although the project {{received a lot of}} support from the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much strain on the suspension and ammunition stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Captain Kirk, {{the episode}} {{introduced}} two other regular characters to the show: James Doohan, {{a friend of}} director James Goldstone, was cast as the Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (the name chosen after Doohan had tried various accents, and had decided that an engineer ought to be Scottish) and George Takei was cast as Ship's Physicist Sulu, who would become the helmsman in the regular series. Lieutenant Uhura and Dr. Leonard McCoy do not feature; the ship's doctor is instead Mark Piper (Paul Fix). Piper <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> a regular; DeForest Kelley, who played McCoy in the series proper, had been considered for the role.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{destruction}} from the war, the new ports of Fulton and Rockport were developed in the later 1860s. At first, Rockport <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> a deep-water port, but after a series of mishaps, Aransas Pass was selected when deepening was approved in 1879. By 1912, a 100 feet wide and 8½ feet deep channel was operational. After hurricanes ransacked the port in 1916 and 1919, the United States Army Corps of Engineers chose Corpus Christi as the preferred deepwater port for the lower Gulf coast.|$|E
5|$|Ashworth left Liverpool {{midway through}} the {{following}} season, to manage Oldham Athletic – he wished {{to be closer to}} his wife and daughter, who lived in nearby Stockport. His replacement was the former Liverpool player Matt McQueen, a club director. McQueen <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> a temporary appointment, but he kept the job as Liverpool retained the League championship. This success owed much to the form of their goalkeeper Elisha Scott, who conceded only 31 goals during the season, a league record at the time. Liverpool's total of 60 points in the season equalled the record set by West Bromwich Albion three seasons earlier. Harry Chambers top scored in the first four post World War 1 seasons including the two title wins.|$|E
5|$|Before the Suez Canal {{was opened}} in 1869, the Indonesian {{archipelago}} was reached via the Sunda Strait from Africa. From the Suez Canal, {{the route to}} Indonesia is shorter via the Malacca Strait. Due to its natural harbour with relatively deep and well sheltered water, the Dutch East Indies government decided to open Sabang as a quay. In 1883, Sabang quay was opened for ships to dock by the Atjeh Associate. At first, the harbour <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> a coal station for the Dutch navy, but later also served merchant vessels and for the transfer of export goods from northern Sumatra.|$|E

5|$|Documents {{regarding}} the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece, the artist, patron, place of installation and {{date of completion}} are all known. It <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> the centrepiece for the chapel, and Rolin approached van der Weyden around 1443, when the hospital was founded. The altarpiece was ready by 1451, the year the chapel was consecrated. Painted in van der Weyden's Brussels workshop– most likely {{with the aid of}} apprentices – the completed panels were then transported to the hospice. The altarpiece is first mentioned in a 1501 inventory, when it was positioned on the high altar.|$|E
5|$|Flower <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> {{a spiritual}} {{successor}} to Flow. Using the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller, the player controls wind that blows a flower petal through the air. Flying close to flowers {{results in the}} player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 {{a replica}} Rocket was {{commissioned}} from Robert Stephenson and Company by Henry Ford, using Stephenson's original construction techniques. It <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> a centrepiece of the Henry Ford Museum, where it remains. Another fully functioning replica {{was built in}} the 1970s for the National Railway Museum. In 1999, to mark the 170th anniversary of the Rainhill Trials, the Trials were re-enacted on the Llangollen Railway using this replica and replicas of Novelty and Sans Pareil, the other serious contenders in 1829. Rocket again won.|$|E

The office, located in the Equitable Building, was able to begin operations {{a few weeks after the}} outbreak of the war and <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> a safe place to store assets in the case of an invasion. During the war, the banks' traditional business fell off and the Swiss government became their largest client.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{its large}} {{physical}} size and extensive armament, Fort Runyon {{was intended to}} be the primary fort defending the Long Bridge. Fort Jackson, located {{at the southern end of}} the bridge, received four cannon and <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> a guard post for soldiers inspecting civilian traffic crossing the bridge and to detour any Confederate saboteurs that might attempt to destroy the bridge. To man the fort's four guns, 60 artillerymen were assigned, bringing the total garrison to 200 men.|$|E
5|$|The Attack on Pearl Harbor (called Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters) was a {{surprise}} military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, {{on the morning of}} December 7, 1941 (December 8 in Japan and the Philippines). The attack <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>as</b> a preventive action {{in order to keep the}} U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against the overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States.|$|E
