5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> blister rust which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) {{and the other a}} <b>white</b> <b>pine.</b> This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E
5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern <b>White</b> <b>Pine),</b> spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>Pines</b> is an unincorporated {{community}} in Calaveras County, California. It lies at {{an elevation of}} 3907 feet (1191 m). In the 1940s, <b>White</b> <b>Pines</b> was a lumber camp. A post office operated here from 1940 to 1975.|$|R
5000|$|The {{architecture}} of the lodge and cabins at <b>White</b> <b>Pines</b> was probably most influenced by the limitations on size instilled by the conservation effort underway at the southernmost stand of native <b>white</b> <b>pines</b> in the United States. When the site was under consideration for the lodge and cabins it had already seen extensive recreational use by the surrounding population. That use threatened to unhinge the delicate balance that existed within <b>White</b> <b>Pines</b> fragile ecosystem. As such, the Illinois State Park Plan, implemented {{at the time of}} the lodge's construction, already called for additional state recreational areas in the northern Illinois area to alleviate the burden on <b>White</b> <b>Pines.</b> Because of the concern for conservation at the site, the <b>White</b> <b>Pines</b> State Park Lodge and Cabins is the smallest of the five sites on the Multiple Property Submission. Despite its relative small size, especially compared to the Starved Rock Lodge or the Pere Marquette Lodge, the complex remains faithful to Booton's vision of [...] "fanciful forest retreats." ...|$|R
5|$|Half of {{the trees}} in the Kettle Creek {{watershed}} are northern hardwood trees. The remainder includes oak trees, which make up 29 percent of the watershed's trees, red maple (4 percent), aspen and gray birch (3 percent), Virginia pine, <b>white</b> <b>pine,</b> and hemlock (1 percent each).|$|E
5|$|Near {{the trailhead}} at lower elevations, alder {{thickets}} are present, {{as well as}} incense cedar, red firs, and western <b>white</b> <b>pine.</b> At higher elevations, groups of mountain hemlock and lupines prevail. Eagles and hawks can be frequently noted on high crags, and squirrels and pika live about the mountain.|$|E
5|$|<b>White</b> <b>pine</b> blister rust, a {{fungal disease}} that infects conifer trees, was accidentally {{introduced}} in British Columbia in 1910 and had reached California by the 1920s. It has since infected many sugar pine {{trees in the}} Yosemite area. The rust is managed by removing plants belonging to the ribes genus, which act as carriers of the fungus.|$|E

5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of red fir, western <b>white</b> <b>pine,</b> Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E
5|$|In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around {{the roots of}} the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with <b>white</b> <b>pine,</b> a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S.spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine, Pitch Pine, and Loblolly Pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine, Chinese <b>White</b> <b>Pine,</b> Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese <b>White</b> <b>Pine.</b> In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in Julyâ€“September), although they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H.completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold {{on the surface of the}} cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the area}} resembles Pennsylvania in climate, {{vegetation}} and wildlife. The park is near the southern limit for eastern hemlock and eastern <b>white</b> <b>pine.</b> Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography, with second-growth oak and hickory more common in lower-lying areas. The surrounding forests contain rich, high-altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns, such as Persistent Trillium, which grows near Rhododendron. Nearby boulderfields by Blood Mountain include Dutchman's breeches, squirrel corn, waterleaf and other herbaceous plants.|$|E

5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, so that there are now more hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E
5|$|Flora {{along the}} {{northern}} end of the trail includes sumac (Rhus) and honeysuckle (Lonicera) shrubs, American elm (Ulmus americana), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south, there are occurrences of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black birch (Betula lenta). Other trees common on the trail include red maple (Acer rubrum), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), white ash (Fraxinus americana) and eastern <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus strobus).|$|E

5|$|In 1879 Henry Colton, {{who worked}} for the Williamsport Lumber Company, {{supervised}} the cutting of <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> on the land owned by Silas Billings; this land would later become the park. Colton gave his name to the Colton Point overlook on the west rim of the Pine Creek Gorge. Deadman Hollow Road in the park is named for a trapper whose decomposed body was found in his own bear trap there in the early 20th century. Fourmile Run flows through the park: its O'Connor Branch is named for the dead trapper's brothers, who were loggers in the area.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Suillus americanus has {{a similar}} appearance, but a more easterly distribution. It is {{associated}} with eastern <b>white</b> <b>pine.</b> Although some authors have tried {{to distinguish between the}} two with by using width of the stem, or by differences in fruit body colouration, it is acknowledged that these characteristics are variable, and depend on environmental factors. The phylogenetic analysis of Wu and colleagues (2000) suggests that the two taxa may be the same, although more samples from different geographical areas will be needed to verify this.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, a mutualistic relationship {{where the}} fungus forms a sheath {{on the surface}} of the root from which hyphae extend outward into the soil, and inwards between the cortical cells with which they interface to form a Hartig net. The main benefit for the fungus is constant access to a supply of carbohydrates produced by the plant's photosynthesis, while the plant benefits from an enhanced supply of mineral nutrients from the soil, taken up by the hyphae of the fungus. It grows in association with pines, particularly eastern <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus strobus).|$|E

5|$|Suillus luteus is {{a pioneer}} species that {{typically}} establishes {{itself in the}} early stages of forest succession. The fungus forms mycorrhizal associations with various species of pine, including Scots pine (P.sylvestris), black pine (P.nigra), and Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in Europe, and red pine (P.resinosa) and <b>white</b> <b>pine</b> (P.strobus) in North America. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that the species could form an ectomycorrhizal association with Aleppo pine (P.halepensis), a key species used in reforestation in the Mediterranean. A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a lodgepole pine (P.contorta) invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by S.luteus as the sole mycorrhizal partner.|$|E
5|$|Suillus spraguei {{grows in}} a {{mycorrhizal}} association with several pine species, particularly eastern <b>white</b> <b>pine,</b> and the fruit bodies grow on the ground, appearing from early summer to autumn.
