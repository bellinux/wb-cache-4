5|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s, {{the central part}} of NYU has been its <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> campus in the heart of Greenwich Village. The <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> Arch is an {{unofficial}} symbol of NYU. Until 2007, NYU had held its commencement ceremonies in <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> Park, but moved the ceremonies to Yankee Stadium in 2008 because of renovations to <b>Washington</b> <b>Square.</b>|$|E
5|$|The St. James is {{a luxury}} {{residential}} skyscraper in <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> West, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The , 45-story high-rise stands along Walnut Street and <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> and is the 12th tallest building in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s, sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Daniel Chester French {{lived and}} worked near the Square. By the 1920s, <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> Park was nationally {{recognized}} as {{a focal point for}} artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU. Famed residents of this time include Eugene O'Neill, John Sloan, and Maurice Prendergast. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, and the realists Edward Hopper and Thomas Hart Benton had studios around <b>Washington</b> <b>Square.</b> In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when Allen Ginsberg and Bob Dylan settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time {{was in the midst of}} an aggressive facilities expansion phase. In 1975, the university opened The Grey Art Gallery at 100 <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.|$|E

5|$|Manhattan {{has been}} the scene of many {{important}} American cultural movements. In 1912, about 20,000 workers, a quarter of them women, marched upon <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> Park to commemorate the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which killed 146 workers on March 25, 1911. Many of the women wore fitted tucked-front blouses like those manufactured by the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, a clothing style that became the working woman's uniform and a symbol of women's liberation, reflecting the alliance of labor and suffrage movements.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} it {{includes}} the older buildings of Russell Sage College, <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> Park and the houses on Adams Street, the district's southern boundary. The mostly regular southeastern boundary follows Clinton Street until it reaches Ferry. Then it becomes ragged and irregular, reaching the district's northernmost extent at the former Grand Street Historic District. This extension allows it to include as well the Gurley Building and its surrounding neighborhood, formerly the Fifth Street-Fulton Street Historic District.|$|E
5|$|Undergraduate {{students}} are guaranteed housing during their enrollment at NYU. Most freshman residence halls are {{located near the}} <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> area. While {{nearly all of the}} residence halls that primarily house sophomores are located near the Union Square area, two former residence halls were located in the Financial District and one is still in use in Chinatown. All of NYU's residence halls are governed by the Inter-Residence Hall Council (IRHC), an umbrella student council organization.|$|E

5|$|In September 1989, Peterson outbid two challengers {{to acquire}} Stereo Super Stores, whose parent company had filed for {{bankruptcy}} the month before, paying $940,000 plus another $1,000,000 for inventory. The acquisition included a car stereo specialty shop at Mall 205, Car Stereo East. Peterson continued to operate the franchise's locations at Jantzen Beach and <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> Too without a branding change until March 1991, when he renamed them Tom Peterson Super Stores, as he did his original home electronics store at 82nd and Foster. Peterson explained that the original stores were performing better than the newly acquired outlets, {{so he decided to}} combine them. His other two stores and car specialty store were unaffected.|$|E
5|$|NYU {{operates}} {{theaters and}} performance facilities {{that are often}} used by the university's music conservatory and Tisch School of the Arts. External productions are also occasionally held in NYU's facilities. The largest performance accommodations at NYU are the Skirball Center for Performing Arts (850 seats) at 566 LaGuardia Place, just south of <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> South, and the Eisner-Lubin Auditorium (560 seats) in the Kimmel Center.

5|$|Principal {{photography}} of {{the film}} began in New York City on July 2, 2012, and lasted for 23 days. Carney chose to film in Manhattan's lesser known neighborhoods {{that would be more}} recognizable to locals than tourists. Specific locations included Greenwich Village, the East Village, Times Square, and <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> Park. Rather than performing live during filming, the actors sang to pre-recorded tracks. In order to save money on hiring a full crew and extras, some scenes—including one in Times Square—were shot late at night with a handheld camera. The rooftop location near the Empire State Building is located at 28 W 36th St.|$|E

The Kimmel Center for University Life {{was built in}} 2003 as the primary location for the university's student services offices. It also houses the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, the Rosenthal Pavilion, the Eisner & Lubin Auditorium, and the Loeb Student Center.

5|$|In 1959 Rohm and Haas, {{the first}} private {{investor}} {{to build on}} the Independence Mall, first commissioned Philadelphia-based George M. Ewing Co. to design their new headquarters. Ewing's design was met with a poor response from the City Art Commission, and Rohm and Haas decided on using a leading architect and approached Pietro Belluschi. At the time the dean of architecture and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Belluschi worked with George M. Ewing Co. to redesign Ewing's original plan. The new design was completed in a few months and was approved by Rohm and Haas, the City Planning Commission, the Redevelopment Authority, and the City Art Commission. Construction began in 1963 and was completed in 1964, costing close to US$10 million. Rohm and Haas moved from their old <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> headquarters into the new building in 1965.|$|E

5000|$|Afrika Bambaataa {{recorded}} the song with the Soulsonic Force and producer Arthur Baker in a Manhattan studio, the NYC upper eastside Intergalactic Studios, a popular site for NYC clubscene productions. The song blends synthesizer and vocoder sounds with breakbeats on a Roland TR-808 drum machine. Toward {{the end of}} the scheduled recording session, NYC music clubscene fixtures DJ David Azarc, soundman Jim Toth, and promoter Tom Goodkind - all from the Peppermint Lounge - asked Arthur to please hurry. The three had scheduled the next recording session for a band that would become the <b>Washington</b> <b>Squares.</b> Ever accommodating, Arthur told them that things would move faster if they assisted him with the backup vocals. The voices singing [...] "rock it don't stop it" [...] on [...] "Planet Rock" [...] are in fact those of the <b>Washington</b> <b>Squares.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, {{financial}} crisis gripped the New York City {{government and the}} troubles spread to the city's institutions, including NYU. Feeling the pressures of imminent bankruptcy, NYU President James McNaughton Hester negotiated {{the sale of the}} University Heights campus to the City University of New York, which occurred in 1973. In 1973, the New York University School of Engineering and Science merged into Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, which eventually merged into NYU in 2014 forming the present Tandon School of Engineering. After the sale of the Bronx campus, University College merged with <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> College. In the 1980s, under the leadership of President John Brademas, NYU launched a billion-dollar campaign that was spent almost entirely on updating facilities. The campaign was set to complete in 15 years, but ended up being completed in 10. In 2003 President John Sexton launched a $2.5 billion campaign for funds to be spent especially on faculty and financial aid resources.|$|E
5|$|The site of The St. James was {{formerly}} {{occupied by a}} group of historic 19th-century buildings that lined Walnut Street in the <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> West neighborhood in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The most notable of these was the former headquarters of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS). Designed in 1868 by Addison Hutton, the granite-faced Italianate-style building was the second headquarters building that PSFS had built. Construction began on the building on June 13, 1868 and it was opened for business on October 11, 1869. An addition designed by Hutton was added in 1885, and another designed by Frank Furness in 1895. The building served as the PSFS headquarters until 1932 when the company moved to the PSFS Building on Market Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} logo, the upheld torch, {{is derived}} from the Statue of Liberty, signifying NYU's service to New York City. The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer Tom Geismar of the branding and design firm Chermayeff & Geismar. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, violet. Some believe that it may have been chosen because violets are said to have grown abundantly in <b>Washington</b> <b>Square</b> and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with Athens, the center of learning in ancient Greece.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s, the <b>Washington</b> <b>Squares</b> played [...] "throwback" [...] folk music. Suzanne Vega {{performed}} folk an folk-oriented pop music.
