6000|$|... "Not {{with you}} to back up so {{formidable}} a quintette of stalwarts," [...] assented the tall visitor gaily. [...] "But we won't trouble about that just now. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hours before us in which {{to do all that}} we want. So au revoir, friend Rondeau ... two more louis for your complaisance, remember, when we have accomplished our purpose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Plenty. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hours' {{drill in}} the morning, and after that, except {{when you are}} officer of the day, you can spend your time as you like. The colonel {{and two of his}} {{officers}} attend at the king's levees, when he is in Paris, but, as he spends the greater portion of his time at Versailles, we are seldom called upon for that duty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'At {{the first}} start, my dear fellow,' said Montague, 'to {{show you how}} correct your {{judgment}} is, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of unlucky deaths that brought us down to a grand piano.' ...|$|R

[...] "You should ha' seen 'im the other night on the 'bus. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> o' lady friends o' mine with us, and even the conductor was surprised at his goings on." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> {{of grand}} tournaments, to {{determine}} who should be [...] "Champion of the Pacific"; they included among the participants nearly all the passengers, of both sexes, and the officers of the ship, and they afforded many days of stupendous interest and excitement, and murderous exercise--for horse-billiards is a physically violent game.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah! <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of ninety-six pounders, quite {{sufficient}} {{to blow the}} gates open; and then, hey for a charge!" [...] said Loll Mahommed, a general of cavalry, who was a rival of Bobbachy's, and contradicted, therefore, every word I said. [...] "In the name of Juggernaut, why wait for the heavy artillery? Have we not swords? Have we not hearts? Mashallah! Let cravens stay with Bobbachy, all true men will follow Loll Mahommed! Allahhumdillah, Bismillah, Barikallah?" [...] {7} and drawing his scimitar, he waved it over his head, and shouted out his cry of battle. It was repeated {{by many of the}} other omrahs; the sound of their cheers was carried into the camp, and caught up by the men; the camels began to cry, the horses to prance and neigh, the eight hundred elephants set up a scream, the trumpeters and drummers clanged away at their instruments. I never heard such a din before or after. How I trembled for my little garrison when I heard the enthusiastic cries of this innumerable host! ...|$|E
60|$|Here {{is another}} very pretty thing--the boys' sucker, only refined by the philosopher. We young ones {{have a perfect}} right to take toys, and make them into {{philosophy}}, inasmuch as now-a-days we are turning philosophy into toys. Here is a sucker, only it is made of india-rubber: if I clap it upon the table, you see at once it holds. Why does it hold? I can slip it about, and yet if I try to pull it up, {{it seems as if}} it would pull the table with it I can easily make it slip about from place to place; but only when I bring it {{to the edge of the}} table can I get it off. It is only kept down by the pressure of the atmosphere above. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of them; and if you take these two and press them together, you will see how firmly they stick. And, indeed, we may use them as they are proposed to be used, to stick against windows, or against walls, where they will adhere for an evening, and serve to hang anything on that you want. I think, however, that you boys ought to be shewn experiments that you can make at home; and so here is a very pretty experiment in illustration of the pressure of the atmosphere. Here is a tumbler of water. Suppose I were to ask you to turn that tumbler upside-down, so that the water should not fall out, and yet not be kept in by your hand, but merely by using the pressure of the atmosphere. Could you do that? Take a wine-glass, either quite full or half-full of water, and put a flat card on the top, turn it upside-down, and then see what becomes of the card and of the water. The air cannot get in because the water by its capillary attraction round the edge keeps it out.|$|E

60|$|So I {{called to}} Hans, who was hanging about {{with a rifle}} on his arm, to follow with a cloth and soap, of which {{fortunately}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of pieces left, and we started along what <b>had</b> once been <b>a</b> paved roadway running between stone houses, whereof the time-eaten ruins still remained on either side.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the looks}} are my direct aesthetic, so I put my stamp on it. It {{was just a}} certain {{silhouette}} that she wanted and certain colors, and that’s how we met in the middle. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of looks that were in her silhouette, which is usually high-waisted bodysuits, shorts, skirts and crop tops. It’s very flattering on her so <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of items in that shape.|$|R

5000|$|Some people, {{including}} American {{attorney and}} legal analyst Ann-Margaret Carrozza, {{say that the}} Wevorce methodology may not be suitable for all couples going through divorce: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> who fight like cats and dogs, then I would strongly caution against going the Wevorce route".|$|E
5000|$|We’re {{going to}} keep playing shows - <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of big ones {{happening}} in front of both conventions.

5000|$|The {{new stuff}} is {{sounding}} great. We're real excited at how it's all come together. Paul Northfield flew home and we're gonna {{live with the}} tracks for awhile, and he'll be back next month to make any changes and do the final mixes.We've been {{getting a lot of}} emails about the title of the record. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> ideas for title and artwork, but we're gonna wait till the music is all done and deal with it then.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we explore the Coupled Cluster method in Quantum Chemistry. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> {{implemented}} <b>an</b> effective <b>Coupled</b> Cluster Singles and Doubles code. We also explore {{deviations from the}} true ground state. For this purpose <b>we</b> <b>have</b> implemented <b>a</b> <b>Coupled</b> Cluster Singles, Doubles and Triples code. Our results are in agreement with theory that Coupled Cluster converge to the ground state when including more excitations and improving the basis set.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{think it}} was a really good {{performance}} today. It was a step up in a lot of aspects. Technically it wasn't what we were aiming for. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of little mistakes here and there which certainly you can't get away at this point. We're looking to execute everything perfectly at this point of the season, but I think we've made some improvement in a lot of other areas. Despite the little mistakes we are headed into the right direction and we're feeling good", Davis said.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{prototype}} implementation for autonomous sensor network deployment. The utilized deployment algorithm considers two conflicting goals: (1) maximizing {{the coverage area}} while (2) maintaining good multi-hop connectivity from sensor nodes to a data sink. In an interdisciplinary research project <b>we</b> <b>have</b> built tiny sensor nodes fitting into bionic winged seeds that can be deployed with <b>a</b> flying drone. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of successful test flights with 15 nodes deployed on a soccer field.

5000|$|The {{school was}} founded in 1970 in {{reaction}} to the desegregation of the McComb, Mississippi public schooling system. [...] Originally new students were required to have the sponsorship of two families whose children attended the academy and no black students were invited.

Well, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of students named Black." ...|$|E
5000|$|The series used 50 horses, {{trained by}} Matt Chew at Santa Anita. As he described, [...] "Because it’s a natural {{tendency}} for horses {{to want to}} be a part of a herd, most adapt to it very well. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> individuals that have been taught to be race horses; we’re not going to get that out of their system. We'll just have to adapt to it. But of the 50 horses, I’d say 45 of them have adapted to it real well." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, Cruz claimed that fans could expect more uptempo dance tracks on his then-forthcoming album. He explained: [...] "The new album will be out before Christmas. We'll have {{had a couple of}} singles before then, too. It's definitely going to be more of the uptempo, fun, energetic vibe that you've heard on 'Break Your Heart', 'Higher' and 'Dynamite'. There are also a few guests on the album - David Guetta and Ludacris, just to name two - but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> more on there that will be big surprises." ...|$|E
40|$|Now {{that the}} corn {{has started to}} grow again, {{producers}} and crop scouts are starting to notice disease problems other than poor emergence, seed rot, and seedling diseases. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of reports of leaf diseases and one sample was received at the ISU Plant Disease Clinic with symptoms of holcus spot, caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae.

"Yes. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> {{of years}} with rain a-plenty, and {{that brought a}} boom in settlement; {{everything}} along the river was homesteaded, and so I retreated--the range was overstocked anyhow. This time I climbed high. I reckon I'm all right now while I live. They can't raise co'n in this high country, and not much of anything but grass. They won't bother us no mo'. It's a good cattle country, but a mighty tough range to ride, as you'll find. I thought I knew what rough riding was, {{but when it comes}} to racin' over these granite knobs, I'm jest a little too old. I'm getting heavy, too, you notice." ...|$|R
50|$|The first LGBT {{association}} of the country, Rainbow Sudan, was founded on 9 February 2012. Its founder, known as Mohammed, said,A dear friend of mine gave me the idea of funding Sudan Rainbow. We started working together for it and even now he helps me a lot in this project. Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of groups that work online and offline.

We provide sexual education, psychological and emotional support, protection.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with lead composer Ludvig Forssell, {{it was revealed that}} there were over eight different versions of Sins of the Father made just for the trailer, on top of the various previous renditions. Forssell himself provided the vocals during development. The song supposedly is a metaphor not only for The Phantom Pain, but the entire Metal Gear Saga: [...] "For this game <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of keywords: race and revenge, and… unfortunately I cannot at this point tell you everything, but there’s a lot of metaphors in the lyrics {{that have to do with}} the game, and the whole Metal Gear Saga, pretty much." [...] Forssell said.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2010, at {{a show in}} Brunswick, Georgia, after Dowling {{played a}} set as I Am Me, Kyle Davis made a guest {{appearance}} to finish the set with a cover of MGMT's [...] "Electric Feel". A group consisting of Dowling, Davis, Trevor Aspinwall, Jet Turner, and Miles Teeters (old members of local Brunswick band Dora Maar) then took the stage. Davis stated, [...] "I'm not sure if there's a name for this yet, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> songs that we're going to play for you". They were later confirmed to be named Never Have I Ever, and recorded four demos at Rock Studio in Brunswick.|$|E

I know you were {{accustomed}} to boats, and I did some rowing when I was a young man. I wish <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of Canadian Indians with us, or of half-breeds; they are up {{to this sort of}} work, and with one in the stern of each canoe it would be a much less risky business going down the rapids. However, no doubt we shall get handy with the paddles before long." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Tighten Up" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{rock band}} The Black Keys. It is the third track on their 2010 album Brothers and was {{released}} as the record's first single on April 23, 2010. Dan Auerbach told The Sun how the song originated: [...] "That was the last song we did for the record. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days off and so did Brian (Danger Mouse) and since we are friends and like hanging out with each other {{we thought it would}} be fun to go into the studio and see if we could come up with <b>a</b> tune. <b>We</b> always <b>have</b> <b>a</b> blast when the three of us get together." ...|$|R

5000|$|Morgan {{revealed}} {{that when she}} booked the gig, the producers {{did not have any}} solid plans for the character set in stone. The writers told her, [...] "Yeah, you know <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of directions we want to go in but we’re not really sure." [...] The series planned to wait for the fan response before they chose a direction for the character. Morgan, who grew up watching the soap with her mother was relieved that she got to build her character from scratch. [...] "This is a brand new character which is good for me because I didn't {{have to figure out how}} to play her any differently than someone else had" [...] Morgan stated. She continued that [...] "I modeled her after me when I was in university." ...|$|E
5000|$|Series creators Katzenberg and Grahame-Smith {{were the}} showrunners for both seasons, {{credited}} as executive producers. Grahame-Smith said [...] "generally, David {{is concerned with}} visuals, running the set and designing the coverage, and I’m more concerned with making script changes and giving notes to actors, but those things cross-pollinate. I direct some episodes and David directs some episodes, but we’re both there, every day. Even when we’re not directing an episode, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> directors that we really enjoy working with, on the series, and we’re still involved, still bouncing things off the actors, and we’re definitely making our presence felt, at all times, on set." [...] The series was shot in a single-camera setup; each episode of the first season was shot in {{three and a half}} days, while each episode of the second season was shot in four days with two episodes being shot concurrently.|$|E
5000|$|Sue and Sunny {{themselves}} {{are a little}} unsure of how many records they have actually released.

But nothing really happened for us". In fact they appear to <b>have</b> recorded around <b>a</b> dozen singles, but to confuse things further they also recorded under the names Sue & Sunshine, The Stockingtops, and as part of The Nirvana Orchestra. They also recorded an album for CBS which was, confusingly, also released - with a different cover - on the CBS subsidiary, Reflection.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that I see my {{students}} only 45 minutes a day, any trip to the lake that we partnered with caused students to miss all other classes. I solved the problem this year by stopping by the lake on my way to school to collect water for chemical tests and stream mud for macro invertebrate surveys. I had to perform the dissolved oxygen test on-site immediately for accuracy. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of trips to the lake in addition where we combined water monitoring with projects such as painting the life cycle of a dragonfly on a building wall there. I am still searching for alternative solutions. Any suggestions would be welcomed. ...|$|R

[...] "There {{would not be}} much difficulty in working through them if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of good knives, they are made of sun-dried bricks. However, we will hunt about among this rubbish {{and see if we}} can find some more bits of iron. Anyhow, we can wait a day or two before we make up our minds about it and see what comes of it. I vote we clear up this litter a bit, and chuck it out through the opening. There is a close, musty smell in the place. The opening will be very handy for chucking everything out and keeping the place as clean as we can." ...|$|R
