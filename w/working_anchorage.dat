Police stated that Keyes sexually assaulted Koenig before he murdered her. After Koenig's death, Keyes left on a cruise out of New Orleans, leaving Koenig's body in a shed. When he returned home, he took a photograph of her body with a four-day-old issue of the Anchorage Daily News, maintaining the illusion {{that she was still}} alive in his ransom demand. After demanding $30,000 in ransom, Keyes dismembered Koenig and disposed of her body in Matanuska Lake north of Anchorage.|$|R

30|$|Solid {{substrate}} supplies {{nutrients to}} the microorganisms besides <b>working</b> as an <b>anchorage</b> for the cells (Pandey et al. 2000). But, {{some of the}} nutrients are present in limited concentrations (Kashyap et al. 2003) hence external supplements are necessary to meet the required energy source for ample growth of the microorganism and its metabolism. Among the different ingredients supplied for the PGL and PG production; pectin, GA, arabinose and PGA induced the enzyme yield {{in the same order}} mentioned (Fig.  2 e) while none of the nitrogen supplements and metal ions could enhance the enzyme production, which might be due to no further improvement in growth of the microorganism. Among the various carbon sources, pectin was detected as the most favored supplement for PGL (1371.25  U/gds) and PG (85.45  U/gds) production, and the similar results were reported by Islam et al. (2013) and Nicemol and Parukuttyamma (2008). The results of nitrogen supplementation concluded that external nitrogen additive is not necessary for PGL and PG production since the wheat bran has 65  % nitrogen (Martins et al. 2002), which itself provided the required nitrogen for the growth of the organism. Overall, among the several agro-residues screened for SSF, wheat bran was found to be an ideal substrate, and the maximum yield of pectate lyase (1371.25  U/gds) and polygalacturonase (85.45  U/gds) was obtained by using 80  % moisture, 0.7  mm particle size, 20  % inoculum and 1  % pectin at 37  °C, pH 6 in 3  days of incubation time.|$|R
