5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} {{in the blue}} wildebeest is 58. Chromosomes <b>were</b> <b>studied</b> in a male and a female wildebeest. In the female, all except a pair of very large submetacentric chromosomes {{were found to be}} acrocentric. Metaphases <b>were</b> <b>studied</b> in the male's chromosomes, and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well, similar to those in the female both in size and morphology. the rest were acrocentric. The X chromosome is a large acrocentric while the Y chromosome a minute one.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{similarities}} in morphology and lifestyle, the slime molds (mycetozoans, plasmodiophorids, acrasids, Fonticula and labyrinthulids, now in Amoebozoa, Rhizaria, Excavata, Opisthokonta and Stramenopiles, respectively), water molds (oomycetes) and hyphochytrids (both Stramenopiles) were formerly {{classified in the}} kingdom Fungi, in groups like Mastigomycotina, Gymnomycota and Phycomycetes. The slime molds <b>were</b> <b>studied</b> also as protozoans, leading to a ambiregnal, duplicated taxonomy.|$|E

5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} {{emerged as a}} critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives <b>were</b> <b>studied</b> with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.|$|E

Behavioral studies of captive individuals have also been performed at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) <b>were</b> <b>studied</b> to {{determine}} the retention time of food from the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy {{of physics}} {{is the study}} of the fundamental, {{philosophical}} questions underlying modern physics, the study of matter and energy and how they interact. The main questions concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, causality, determinism, and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several of these questions <b>were</b> <b>studied</b> as part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, determinism, and space and time).|$|E
