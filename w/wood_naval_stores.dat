The Company recruited these as skilled craftsmen and industry specialists: soap-ash, glass, lumber milling (wainscot, clapboard, and ‘deal’ — planks, especially soft <b>wood</b> planks) and <b>naval</b> <b>stores</b> (pitch, turpentine, and tar). Among these additional settlers were eight [...] "Dutch-men" [...] (probably German or German-speakers), Polish and Slovak craftsmen, who had been hired to help develop and manufacture profitable export products. William Volday (Wilhelm Waldi), a Swiss German mineral prospector, was also among those who arrived in 1608. His mission was seeking a silver reservoir that {{was believed to be}} within the proximity of Jamestown. Some of the settlers were the artisans who built a glass furnace which became the first factory in America. Additional craftsmen were brought to produce soap, pitch, and wooden building supplies.|$|R
2500|$|Also {{included}} on the Second Supply were the first non-English settlers. [...] The company recruited these as skilled craftsmen and industry specialists: soap-ash, glass, lumber milling (wainscot, clapboard, and ‘deal’ — planks, especially soft <b>wood</b> planks) and <b>naval</b> <b>stores</b> (pitch, turpentine, and tar). Among these additional settlers were eight [...] "Dutch-men" [...] (consisting of unnamed craftsmen and three who were probably the wood-mill-men — Adam, Franz and Samuel) [...] "Dutch-men" [...] (probably meaning German or German-speakers), Polish and Slovak craftsmen, who had been hired by the Virginia Company of London's leaders to help develop and manufacture profitable export products. There has been debate about the nationality of the specific craftsmen, and both the Germans and Poles claim the glassmaker for one of their own, but the evidence is insufficient. Ethnicity is further {{complicated by the fact}} that the German minority in Royal Prussia lived under Polish control during this period. [...] These workers staged the first recorded strike in Colonial America for the right to vote in the colony's 1619 election.|$|R

50|$|<b>Naval</b> <b>stores</b> {{played a}} role during the American Revolutionary War. As Britain {{attempted}} to cripple French and Spanish capacities through blockade, they declared <b>naval</b> <b>stores</b> to be contraband. At the time Russia was Europe's chief producer of <b>naval</b> <b>stores,</b> leading to the seizure of 'neutral' Russian vessels. In 1780 Catherine the Great announced that her navy would be used against anyone interfering with neutral trade, and she gathered together European neutrals in the League of Armed Neutrality. These actions were beneficial for the struggling colonists as the British were forced to act with greater caution.|$|R
