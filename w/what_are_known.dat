5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars {{are thought to be}} rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as blue stragglers. These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity of the cluster to which it belongs.|$|E
5|$|After the English Reformation of the 16th century, an {{increasing}} number of people were unhappy with the control that the government and monarch had over the Church of England. This {{led to the formation of}} independent churches and schools by <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as Dissenters. The worship of any faith other than Anglicanism was illegal, and those discovered taking part were arrested and even sentenced to death. Oliver Cromwell imposed a period of religious tolerance, but his death precipitated further persecution of Dissenters, principally through the Act of Uniformity 1549, which required the use of the Book of Common Prayer as the only legal form of worship in England. The South West of England in general, and Taunton specifically, had a significant Dissenter population. There was a Baptist community in the town by 1646, and despite continued persecution they erected their first Meeting House in Taunton, on Mary Street in 1670.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are thought}} to have two {{separate}} points of origin in the Solar System. Short-period comets (those with orbits of up to 200years) are generally accepted to have emerged from either the Kuiper belt or the scattered disc, which are two linked flat discs of icy debris beyond Neptune's orbit at 30AU and jointly extending out beyond 100AU from the Sun. Long-period comets, such as comet Hale–Bopp, whose orbits last for thousands of years, {{are thought to}} originate in the Oort cloud. The orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and so very few comets are thought to originate there. The scattered disc, however, is dynamically active, and is far more likely to be the place of origin for comets. Comets pass from the scattered disc into the realm of the outer planets, becoming <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as centaurs. These centaurs are then sent farther inward to become the short-period comets.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids {{have been}} a {{seasonally}} abundant source of food for people wherever people {{have been a}}ble to reach their colonies. Early records of human exploitation of shearwaters (along with albatrosses and cormorants) come from the remains of hunter-gatherer middens in southern Chile, where sooty shearwaters were taken 5000 years ago. More recently procellariids have been hunted for food by Europeans, particularly the northern fulmar in Europe, and various species by Inuit, and sailors around the world. The hunting pressure on the Bermuda petrel, or cahow, was so intense that the species nearly became extinct and did go missing for 300 years. The name of one species, the providence petrel, is derived from its (seemingly) miraculous arrival on Norfolk Island, where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers; within ten years the providence petrel was extinct on Norfolk. Several species of procellariid have gone extinct in the Pacific since the arrival of man, and their remains have been found in middens dated to that time. More sustainable shearwater harvesting industries developed in Tasmania and New Zealand, where the practice of harvesting <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as muttonbirds continues today.|$|E

25|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward to explain the occurrence of hallucinations. When psychodynamic (Freudian) theories were popular in psychology, hallucinations were seen as a projection of unconscious wishes, thoughts, and wants. As biological {{theories have}} become orthodox, hallucinations are more often thought of (by psychologists at least) as being caused by functional deficits in the brain. With reference to mental illness, the function (or dysfunction) of the neurotransmitters glutamate and dopamine {{are thought to be}} particularly important. The Freudian interpretation may have an aspect of truth, as the biological hypothesis explains the physical interactions in the brain, while the Freudian interpretation addresses the psychological complexes related to the content of the hallucination, such as hallucinating persecutory voices due to guilt. Psychological research has argued that hallucinations may result from biases in <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as metacognitive abilities.|$|E

25|$|Much of <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as Isaac Newton's occult {{studies can}} largely be {{attributed}} to his study of alchemy. Newton was deeply interested in all forms of natural sciences and materials science, an interest which would ultimately lead {{to some of his}} better-known contributions to science. During Newton's lifetime, the study of chemistry was still in its infancy, so many of his experimental studies used esoteric language and vague terminology more typically associated with alchemy and occultism. It was not until several decades after Newton's death that experiments of stoichiometry under the pioneering works of Antoine Lavoisier were conducted, and analytical chemistry, with its associated nomenclature, came to resemble modern chemistry as we know it today. However, Newton's contemporary and fellow Royal Society member, Robert Boyle, had already discovered the basic concepts of modern chemistry and began establishing modern norms of experimental practice and communication in chemistry, information which Newton did not use.|$|E
25|$|Egyptians {{believed}} that the afterlife would be a continuation of this one, allowing for the transportation of items from this life to the next. In order to bring food to the afterlife, Egyptians would surround human mummies by <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as victual mummies. These animals were prepared by dehydrating the meat and wrapping it in linen bandages, {{to indicate that the}} animals were food, not pets. They were not mummified to the same meticulous extent that a pet or human mummy would be, but the animals were nonetheless carefully preserved using natron and other special salts. This food was included in tombs in order to sustain the deceased person’s soul, called the ka, during the journey to the next world. A variety of food has been found in many tombs, mostly breads, meats, and fowl. King Tutankhamen’s tomb held several coffin shaped wooden boxes containing this type of mummified animal, in his case duck and other types of meat.|$|E
25|$|When Dove {{returned}} to America in 1909 he met Alfred Stieglitz, probably {{by way of}} Maurer's written introduction. Stieglitz was a well known photographer and gallery owner who was very active in promoting modern art in America, including works by European artists {{that had never been}} seen before in the U.S. Dove decided to quit working as an illustrator but was in need of artistic identity along with emotional bolstering and Stieglitz filled both these roles. The photographer was 16 years older than Dove and his urban, Jewish and European cultural roots were in contrast to Dove's rural Anglo-Saxon Protestant heritage. Dove was said to be gentle, quiet, and a good friend while Stieglitz was known as being argumentative and shrewd. They found their common ground in the idea that art forms should embody modern spiritual values, not materialism and tradition. With Stieglitz's support, Dove produced <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as the first purely abstract paintings to come out of America. Dove’s works were based on natural forms and he referred to his type of abstraction as “extraction” where, in essence, he extracted the essential forms of a scene from nature.|$|E

500|$|The {{social circle}} of the female {{elephant}} does not necessarily end with the small family unit. In the case of elephants in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, a female's life involves interaction with other families, clans, and subpopulations. Families may associate and bond with each other, forming <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as bond groups. These are typically made of two family groups, which may be closely related due to previously {{being part of the}} same family group which split after becoming too large for the available resources. During the dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social organisation known as the clan. Groups within these clans do not form strong bonds, but they defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. There are typically nine groups in a clan. The Amboseli elephant population is further divided into the [...] "central" [...] and [...] "peripheral" [...] subpopulations.|$|E
