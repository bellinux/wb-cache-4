50|$|The Güldenstädt's {{redstart}} (Phoenicurus erythrogastrus) {{also sometimes}} called the <b>white-winged</b> <b>redstart,</b> is a species of bird in the genus Phoenicurus, family Muscicapidae. It {{is found in the}} high mountains of southwestern and central Asia in the Caucasus, Karakoram, Pamir, Himalaya, Tian Shan, and Altai, in the countries of Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, China, Georgia, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.|$|E
5000|$|It {{belongs to}} a close-knit Eurasian clade which also {{includes}} the black redstart (P. ochruros), Hodgson's redstart (P. hodgsoni), the <b>white-winged</b> <b>redstart</b> (P. erythrogastrus) [...] - [...] which may be especially closely related to P. auroreus [...] - , and maybe the Ala Shan redstart (P. alaschanicus). These all diverged during {{the latter part of}} the Late Pliocene and the earliest Early Pleistocene, some 3-1.5 million years ago, during onset of the Quaternary glaciation.|$|E
50|$|The black {{redstart}} {{is a member}} of a Eurasian clade which also includes the Daurian redstart, Hodgsons redstart, the <b>white-winged</b> <b>redstart,</b> and maybe Przevalskis redstart. The present species ancestors diverged from about 3 million years ago (mya) (Late Pliocene) onwards and spread throughout much of Eurasia from 1.5 mya onward. It is not very closely related to the common redstart. As these are separated by different behaviour and ecological requirements and have not evolved fertilisation barriers, the two European species can nonetheless produce apparently fertile and viable hybrids.|$|E
