5000|$|Gómez has lectured {{widely and}} has {{published}} numerous articles (including a 2000 article in Law and Society Review), book chapters, and op-ed commentaries, {{as well as}} two books. Her scholarship has focused on the intersection of law, politics and social stratification in both contemporary and historical contexts. In Misconceiving Mothers: Legislators, Prosecutors and the Politics of Prenatal Drug Exposure (1997), she documented the career of the [...] "crack baby"/"crack mother" [...] social problem in the media and public policy, situating it at the nexus of the abortion debate, the drug war, and competing discourses of criminalization and medicalization as they played out in the late 1980s. In her 2007 book, Manifest Destinies: The Making of the Mexican American Race (released in paperback in September 2008), Gómez examines how law and racial ideology intersected to create new racial groups and to re-structure the turn-of-the-twentieth century racial order in the U.S. In a new project with sociologist Nancy López (funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Center for Health Policy at the University of New Mexico), she will explore the contemporary legacy of that racial order for the scientific study of [...] "race"; how has the right's co-optation of the fact that race is socially constructed promoted the reigning color-blind ideology and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> how scholars and policymakers operationalize race? ...|$|E

I am probably not the right one to be doing conservation work because I have so much rage against humans of all sort, but there it is. We kill upwards of 100 million sharks a year so chinks can stick their flavorless fins into a soup that they have to season with plants to give it flavor.

5000|$|Scott {{warns that}} the most tragic [...] "state episodes" [...] in recent history {{originates}} with a genuine desire to improve the human condition. These tragic state episodes begin with an authoritarian state implementing policies reflecting high modernist ideals amidst a weak civil society. While Scott is not categorically opposed to high modernism or legibility, he warns that a false perception of human knowledge and social engineering is a dangerous combination. As a result, the negative implications of legibility should be thoroughly considered when contemplating networked advocacy plans, {{even if they are}} well-intentioned. The anonymity of data is one area of concern that deserves special attention. If states seek to impose their scientific beliefs, and methods for making populations legible, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> ICTs whose very purpose is to lower the cost of collaboration and information? The prior literature discussed here has shown that digital technologies and platforms can be leveraged for collective and social benefits, can hold state’s accountable, or can provide modalities of governance in areas where no state seemingly exists. ICTs have the ability to play a very different role when examined against a backdrop of James Scott and population legibility, one that aims for control and repression rather than liberation and collaboration. This raises the possibility for the state to use ICTs for purposes that are enslaving, quite the opposite of liberating. One of the problems with such state initiated standardization, even when done with the best of intentions, is that it robs a community of its very ability to resist to this state imposition and control, and even total authoritarian repression. Another problem arises from, {{in the case of a}} digital and abundant information environment, who controls the data? If the state also has a total monopoly over the information environment, then control and manipulation in this day and age become as easy as pressing a button, wiretapping a phone call, or locating political dissidents to within mere feet of their physical location represented on a GIS map. As Scott states, the technologies and capabilities now available to “enhance the legibility of a society to its rulers have become vastly more sophisticated, but the political motives driving them have changed little - appropriation, control, and manipulation remain the most prominent (77).” ...|$|E

40|$|If {{globalisation}} can {{be described}} as an evolution of imperialism on a global scale, as postcolonial theorist Bill Ashcroft suggests, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>for</b> contemporary writing about animals? This paper examines how questions of globalisation inflect the representation of animals in postcolonial fiction, taking the examples of Julia Leigh’s The Hunter(Australia), the recent film of the same name, and Laurence Fearnley’s Butler’s Ringlet(New Zealand). Their approaches differ in that both versions of The Hunter emphasise dangers associated with globalisation, whereas different reactions are in tension in Butler’s Ringlet. However, I argue that in each case responses to animals figure as a strategy in the negotiation of globalisation, and encourage reassessments of local species relations in the process. I explore the implications of this approach to animals in terms of comments by Zygmunt Bauman about the potential for pluralism within globalisation...|$|E
