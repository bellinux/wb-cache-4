25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Skrull war, S.H.I.E.L.D. is dissolved and Norman Osborn is placed in power of national security. Osborn creates his own team of villainous Avengers by stealing the costumed identities of previous Avengers. The supervillain assassin Bullseye joins the team and takes on the mantle of Hawkeye. Watching the Avengers news coverage on television {{with the rest of the}} New Avengers, Clint is stunned to see the events taking place. Clint unmasked himself on network television and publicly denounces Norman Osborn and his regime. He is later elected as the leader of the New Avengers and makes toppling Osborn and the Hood from power his number one priority. Clint argues that the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Osborn is to kill him, although the rest of the team disagrees. Clint attempts to storm Avengers Tower single-handedly to achieve his goal. He defeats the Dark Avengers, but is captured and arrested when, after failing to kill Norman Osborn, he is attacked from behind by Ares. Clint was imprisoned and tortured at the hands of Mentallo. He was later freed by his teammates, and apologized for his actions.|$|E

The Manchester United manager Matt Busby mentioned Trautmann's anticipation in his pre-match team talks: [...] "Don't stop to think where you're going to hit it with Trautmann. Hit it first and think afterwards. If you look up and work it out he will read your thoughts and stop it." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by the Manchester City forward Neil Young, who recalled that [...] "the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> him with a shot in training was to mis-hit it". As a former handball player, Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves, particularly after witnessing the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics use such tactics to good effect in Hungary's 6–3 victory over England in 1953.|$|E

500|$|The Soviet Union {{launched}} a large military build-up in 1965 by expanding both nuclear and conventional arsenals. The Soviet leadership believed a strong military {{would be useful}} leverage in negotiating with foreign powers, and increase the Eastern Bloc's security from attacks. In the 1970s, the Soviet leadership concluded that a war with the capitalist countries might not necessarily become nuclear, and therefore they initiated a rapid expansion of the country's conventional forces. Due to the country's weaker infrastructure compared to the United States, the Soviet leadership believed that the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the First World was by a rapid military conquest of Western Europe, relying on sheer numbers alone. The Soviet Union achieved nuclear parity with the United States by the early 1970s, after which the country consolidated itself as a superpower. The apparent success of the military build-up led the Soviet leadership {{to believe that the}} military, and the military alone, according to Willard Frank, [...] "bought the Soviet Union security and influence".|$|E

Earle Morris received 254,745 (53.3 percent) to James Henderson's 216,745 (45.2 percent), and the AIP candidate received the remaining 7,320 votes (1.5 percent). The 1971 legislature would have {{only half of the}} Republican representation from 1967, two senators and eleven [...] state representatives. Among the Republican legislative winners was future U.S. representative and Governor Carroll Campbell of Greenville. Campbell blamed the media for Watson's defeat: [...] "the state's press made his campaign racist when it knew it was the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> him." [...] Senator Thurmond similarly accused reporters of [...] "painting a false impression" [...] that Watson was racist and explained that such a caricature adversely [...] "affected some of the moderate vote."

2500|$|Taft first {{sought the}} Republican presidential {{nomination}} in 1940 but lost to Wendell Willkie. Taft {{was regarded as}} a strong contender, but his outspoken support of a non-interventionist foreign policy, and his opposition to the New Deal in domestic policy led many liberal Republicans to reject his candidacy. At the 1940 Republican Convention, Willkie, once a Democrat, and a corporate executive who had never run for political office, came from behind to beat Taft and several other candidates for the nomination. That year, Taft first clashed with Thomas E. Dewey, then a New York District Attorney, who had become nationally famous for successfully prosecuting several prominent organized-crime figures, especially New York mob boss [...] "Lucky" [...] Luciano. Taft felt that Dewey was not conservative or consistent enough in his principles for the Republican Party: [...] "Tom Dewey has no real courage to stand up against the crowd that wants to smear any Republican who takes a forthright position against the New Deal... there is only one <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the New Deal, and that is head on. You can't outdeal them." [...] In other letters, Taft described Dewey as [...] "very arrogant and bossy" [...] and worried that [...] "advisers will talk Dewey into too much internationalism...he comes from New York and sees the group opinions there as a lot more important than they are." ...|$|E

Sagan broke away from a group of 10 riders with [...] remaining and won solo, performing a series of wheelies after crossing the line. Two days later, Sagan carried his good form to the Three Days of De Panne, where he won a close sprint ahead of Arnaud Démare of [...] Démare complained to the race officials that Sagan had swerved slightly in the final metres, but to no avail as they maintained Sagan's victory. Sagan finished second at the Tour of Flanders after breaking away with Fabian Cancellara and joining Jürgen Roelandts. Cancellara attacked on the last climb, the Paterberg, dropped Sagan and went on to win solo. Sagan caused some controversy on the podium by pinching the bottom of a podium girl, and after a media backlash, he apologized the next day. At the sign-up ceremony before the Brabantse Pijl, Sagan presented his apologies in person to the podium girl (Maja Leye) and gave her a flower bouquet. He then {{went on to win the}} race, where he chased an attack by Greg Van Avermaet in the final kilometers. Only Philippe Gilbert could follow, and Sagan was faster in the final dash for the line. His next win came in May on stage 3 of the Tour of California. In the somewhat hectic massive sprint, Sagan came from a long <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Michael Matthews, finding a passage on the right side of the road at the last moment.

Not the {{pendulum}} of a clock is more persistent of iteration than are all existing things; periodicity {{is the ultimate}} law and largest explanation of the universe--to do it over again the one insatiable ambition of all that is. Everything vibrates; through vibration alone do the senses discern it. We are not provided with means of cognizance of what is absolutely at rest; impressions come in waves. Recurrence, recurrence, and again recurrence--that is the sole phenomenon. With what fealty we submit us to the law which compels the rhythm and regularity to our movement--that makes us divide up passing time into brief equal intervals, marking them off by some method of physical notation, so that our senses may apprehend them! In all we do we unconsciously mark time like a clock, the leader of an orchestra with his bâton only more perfectly than the smith with his hammer, or the woman with her needle, because his hand is better assisted by his ear, less embarrassed with impedimenta. The pedestrian impelling his legs and the idler twiddling his thumbs are endeavoring, each in his unconscious <b>way,</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> time to some inaudible music; and the graceless lout, sitting cross-legged in a horse-car, manages the affair with his toe.|$|E
