5|$|After {{the school}} bus is destroyed, Homer is forced to drive several {{students}} to school. Along the way, he listens to a classic rock radio station and is shocked to discover {{that all of the}} kids hate it. After several more days of the kids hating his music, Homer visits a music store and realizes that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> is no longer considered cool. As a result, Homer decides to take Bart and Lisa to the Hullabalooza music festival. At the festival, Homer tries to act cool by wearing a Rastafarian hat, but all he does is humiliate himself and is confronted by an angry crowd of Generation Xers who mistake him for a narc. After being tossed out by the crowd, Homer angrily kicks a cannon, which shoots one of Peter Frampton's inflatable pigs at his stomach. The festival head is impressed and Homer is hired {{as a part of the}} festival's freak show.|$|E

Inoue was surprised about Kakashi's popularity within the Naruto fans and expected people to continue supporting him. In an interview, Dave Wittenberg, who does the voice acting for Kakashi in the English dub, comments that he feels he {{is similar to the}} character since he tends to have one eye open at a time and he becomes angry if he is interrupted while reading. He also added that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> most about Kakashi is his relation with his students, noting him to be [...] "a very nice person".|$|E

500|$|Muhney {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the plot point of seducing Rafe broadened Adam's horizons. He said, [...] "What it did was move a character who represents a person who lives in Genoa City and moved him outside of a box that you can neatly check off. 'He is straight, he is this, or he is that,' and the fact that some lines are blurred makes him more real. When they did that with this character, I loved the opportunity to play into a different realm which is usually not touched upon on television." [...] Muhney described the character as a [...] "puppeteer" [...] with [...] "survival instinct", but also someone with a conscience. In another interview, when asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> about portraying Adam, Muhney stated: [...] "You want to play a catalytic character. You know a troublemaker is good business. You know someone who doesn't swim with the fishes, who swims upstream in the other direction, is someone who is going to cause friction and turbulence in storyline with other characters. I have been told by many of my cast members that the role to play is Adam. They say, [...] "If I were to have a choice, the character I would want to play is your role, Adam." ...|$|E

He mistreats his wife. [...] "I {{sometimes}} think she has no feeling at all; and then I go on until she cries – and that satisfies me," [...] he tells Helen. But after he reforms himself he becomes a loving husband and father.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{everyone}} agreed about {{the greatness of}} that gift. For the conductor Otto Klemperer he was [...] "without doubt the only man of his generation who is an outstanding conductor and musician." [...] For the critic Hans Keller he was [...] "incapable of phrasing. It's {{as simple as that}} ... That's why he conducts Bach, Beethoven or Webern in exactly the same way." [...] His biographer Joan Peyser considered that [...] "in general Boulez conducts what he loves magnificently, conducts <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> very well and, with rare exceptions, gives stiff performances of the classic and romantic repertoire." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although trusts do not, generally, {{require any}} {{formality}} to be established, formality {{may be required}} in order to transfer property the settlor wishes to entrust. There are six particular situations which have returned to the cases: (1) transfers of company shares require registration, (2) trusts and transfers of land require writing and registration, (3) transfers (or [...] "dispositions") of an equitable interest require writing, (4) wills require writing and witnesses, (5) gifts that are only to be transferred in the future require deeds, and (6) bank cheques usually need to be endorsed with a signature. The modern view of formal requirements is that their purpose is to ensure the transferring party has genuinely intended to carry out the transaction. As the American lawyer, Lon Fuller, put it the purpose is to provide [...] "channels for the legally effective expression of intention", particularly where there's a common danger in large transactions that people could rush into it without thinking. However, older case law saw the courts interpreting the requirements of form very rigidly. In an 1862 case, Milroy v Lord, a man named Thomas Medley signed a deed for Samuel Lord to hold 50 Bank of Louisiana shares on trust for his niece, Eleanor Milroy. But the Court of Appeal in Chancery held that this did not create a trust (and nor was any gift effective) because the shares had not finally been registered. Similarly, in an 1865 case, Jones v Lock, Lord Cottenham LC held that because a £900 cheque was not endorsed, it could not be counted as being held on trust for his son. This was so even though the father had said [...] "I give this to baby... I am going to put it away for him... he may do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> with it" [...] and locked it in a safe. However, the more modern view, starting with Re Rose was that if the transferor had taken sufficient steps to demonstrate their intention for property to be entrusted, then this was enough. Here, Eric Rose had filled out forms to transfer company shares to his wife, and three months later this was entered into the company share register. The Court of Appeal held, however, that in equity the transfer took place when the forms were completed. In Mascall v Mascall (1984) the Court of Appeal held that, when a father filled out a deed and certificate for the transfer of land, although the transfer had not actually been lodged with HM Land Registry, in equity it the transfer was irrevocable. The trend was confirmed by the Privy Council in T Choithram International SA v Pagarani (2000), where a wealthy man publicly declared he would donate a large sum of money to a charitable foundation he had set up, but died before any transfer of the money took place. Although a gift, which is not transferred, was traditionally thought to require a deed to be enforced, the Privy Council advised this was not necessary as the property was already vested in him as a trustee, and his intentions were clear. In the case of [...] "secret trusts", where someone has written a will but also privately told the executor that they wished to donate their some part of their property in other ways, this has long been held to not contravene the Wills Act 1837 requirements for writing, because it simply works as a declaration of trust before the will. The modern trend, then, has been that so long as the purpose of the formality rules will not be undermined, the courts will not hold trusts invalid.|$|E
