40|$|Assessing and {{managing}} <b>water</b> <b>use</b> {{is crucial for}} supporting sustainable river basin management and regional development. The first consistent and comprehensive assessment of sectorial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) is presented by analysing homogenized annual <b>water</b> <b>use</b> data from 2000 to 2010 in relation to socio economic statistics for the same period. An abstraction of <b>water</b> <b>use,</b> using the concept of <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensity, and based on equations inspired by those <b>used</b> in global <b>water</b> resource models, is developed to explore the driving forces underlying <b>water</b> <b>use</b> changes in domestic, industrial and agricultural sectors. We do this at both {{the level of the}} region as a whole, {{as well as for the}} nine cities that constitute the PRD separately. We find that, despite strong population and economic growth, the PRD managed to stabilize its absolute <b>water</b> <b>use</b> by significant improvements in industrial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensities, and early stabilisation of domestic <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensities. Results reveal large internal differentiation of sectorial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> among the cities in this region, with industrial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensity varying from - 80 to + 95 % and domestic <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensity by +/- 30 % compared to the PRD average. In general, per capita <b>water</b> <b>use</b> is highest in the cities that industrialised first. Yet, all cities except Guangzhou are expected to approach a saturation value of per capita <b>water</b> <b>use</b> much below what is suggested in recent global studies. Therefore, existing global assessments probably have overestimated future domestic <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in developing countries. Although scarce and uncertain input data and model limitations lead to a high level of uncertainty, the presented conceptualization of <b>water</b> <b>use</b> is useful in exploring the underlying driving forces of <b>water</b> <b>use</b> trends...|$|R

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>use</b> is {{increasing}} globally {{to meet the}} growing demand for food and industrial products, and the rising living standard. Water scarcity {{has been reported in}} many regions, questioning the long-term sustainability of <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> The objective of this thesis is to better understand sectorial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> development in an urbanizing river delta, and to explore the potential of <b>water</b> <b>use</b> management as an adaptation option to reduce water shortage. The Pearl River Basin in Southern China is taken as study area. The upstream part of the basin is one of the poorer regions of China, whereas the Pearl River Delta (PRD) is the world’s largest urban region in both population and area. This study presents the first consistent analysis of sectorial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in the PRD. Results show that during the period of 2000 - 2010, the PRD managed to stabilize its annual total <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> Nevertheless, severe salt intrusion induced water shortages occur. Assessment of <b>water</b> <b>use</b> at a monthly resolution shows that <b>water</b> <b>use</b> contributes to salt intrusion by further reducing the already low dry season river discharge. To investigate the possible future development of <b>water</b> <b>use,</b> this study proposed a method to derive region specific <b>water</b> <b>use</b> scenarios from a global assessment of <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> Scenarios based on regionalised assumptions project substantially lower <b>water</b> <b>use</b> than those based on national assumptions. Nevertheless, hydrological challenges remain for the PRD. The total <b>water</b> <b>use</b> of the PRD may still increase by up to 54 % in 2030 in the regionalized scenarios. Also, <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in the upstream regions increases with socio-economic development. To address water shortage, four extreme water allocation strategies were analysed against <b>water</b> <b>use</b> and <b>water</b> availability scenarios under climate change. None of these strategies proved to be sufficient to fully avoid water scarcity in the Pearl River Basin. This study obtains {{a better understanding of the}} sectorial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> development and its impact on salt intrusion induced water shortage in a heavily urbanized river delta.

40|$|The {{trends of}} {{increasing}} water demand and drought occurrences in Nebraska’s urban areas pose a new crucial issue to water resource management. Former studies in Nebraska mainly focused on rural water demand caused by intensive agricultural irrigation, while largely ignoring the growing municipal <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> Therefore, this thesis aims to investigate total <b>water</b> <b>use</b> and consumptive <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in three major urban land use categories of residential, CIO (commercial, industrial and others), and open space. Three case cities are City of Lincoln, Grand Island and Sidney. First, {{a reliable and}} feasible methodology of estimating consumptive <b>water</b> <b>use</b> is developed based on the analysis of end <b>water</b> <b>use</b> activities. Then, possible influential factors (e. g. population, total landscape area) are statistically examined to evaluate their effects {{on the amount of}} total and consumptive <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> Afterwards, quantity classification and spatial autocorrelation analyses are used to visually assess and quantify the spatial patterns of total and consumptive <b>water</b> <b>use</b> at the census block level, 2010. In the three case cities, residential consumptive <b>water</b> <b>use</b> varies from 31 % to 57 % of total <b>water</b> <b>use,</b> and positive relationships with precipitation and aridity are identified. CIO consumptive <b>water</b> <b>use</b> percentage ranges from 19 % to 27 %. Open space consumptive <b>water</b> <b>use</b> is nearly equal to the open space total <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> Census block level linear models are identified between influential factors and amount of <b>water</b> <b>use,</b> which has been rarely applied by previous research. First, the best predictors of residential total <b>water</b> <b>use</b> area population and total landscape area in three case cities. A positive correlation between residential consumptive <b>water</b> <b>use</b> and total landscape area is identified in the Sidney while similar relationship is not found in the other two cities. Second, there is no linear regression relationship identified between CIO total <b>water</b> use/consumptive <b>water</b> <b>use</b> and available independent variables in this study. Third, both open space total <b>water</b> <b>use</b> and consumptive <b>water</b> <b>use</b> can be positively related to total landscape area. Spatially, high <b>water</b> <b>use</b> blocks are commonly clustered in suburban areas with larger lots and lower population densities. Low <b>water</b> <b>use</b> blocks are commonly located near downtown living areas with less yard area and higher population densities.

A cult grew up at Ripon after his death and remained active until 948, when King Eadred destroyed the church at Ripon; after the destruction, Wilfrid's relics were taken by Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, and held in Canterbury Cathedral. This account appears in a foreword written by Oda for Frithegod's later poem on Wilfrid's life. However, according to Byrhtferth's Vita Sancti Oswaldi, or Life of Saint Oswald, Oda's nephew, Oswald, Archbishop of York, preserved the relics at Ripon and restored the community there to care for them. The two differing accounts are not easily reconciled, but it is possible that Oswald collected secondary relics that had been overlooked by his uncle and installed those at Ripon.

Cooling <b>water</b> <b>use</b> takes into account the location of more than 60,000 power plants, their cooling type and their electricity production. Temporal development of household <b>water</b> <b>use</b> is modeled as a function of technological and structural change (the latter as a function of gross domestic product), taking into account population change. The temporal development of manufacturing and thermal power <b>water</b> <b>use</b> is modeled also as a function of structural and technological change, with national manufacturing output (for manufacturing <b>water</b> <b>use)</b> and national electricity output (for thermal power plant use) as the drivers of <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> Time series of monthly values of irrigation <b>water</b> <b>use</b> are computed, while all other uses are assumed to be constant throughout the year and to only vary from year to year. Based on sectoral water withdrawals and consumptive use as computed by the five <b>water</b> <b>use</b> models, the model component GWSWUSE calculates the total net abstraction from groundwater and from surface water in each grid cell.|$|R
