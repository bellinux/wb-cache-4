500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> there and was like, ‘When {{are we going to get}} a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. [...] "That’s when I finished , because I knew I couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked so hard for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The cover art for {{the album}} was {{inspired}} by the poster to the 1965 film Mudhoney. Jones was recording the album at Danger Mouse's studio and saw the poster on the wall. She said, [...] "Brian has this great collection of Russ Meyer posters in his studio. And this particular one...was right over the couch <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> every day. I always was looking at it and thinking 'that's so cool I want to look like her!' I remember staring at the poster the whole time we made the record. It's a great visual." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fleury {{started the}} 2007–08 season slowly, then won four {{straight}} games before suffering a high-ankle sprain against the Calgary Flames on December 6. [...] He returned {{as a starter}} on March 2, after a brief conditioning stint in the AHL with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. While sidelined, he decided to change the colour of his goaltending equipment from the bright yellow that had become his signature to plain white, to gain an optical advantage over shooters. He was also influenced and challenged by the very strong play of Ty Conklin, who took the team's starting job after being promoted from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton in Fleury's absence. Upon his return from injury, Fleury helped the Penguins win the Atlantic Division, going 10–2–1 with a 1.45 GAA {{en route to a}} 12–2 playoff run to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings. He recorded perhaps the best performance of his career at the time in Game 5 of the Finals at Detroit, where he stopped 55 of 58 shots in a triple overtime win for the Penguins to stave off elimination. Possibly the most memorable save he made came in the second period against Mikael Samuelsson – where he barely got a toe on the puck to keep Pittsburgh in the game, which Petr Sýkora eventually ended. Despite his strong play, the Penguins lost the series in six games, and Fleury's unfortunate attempt to cover an unseen loose puck by sitting on it in Game 6 resulted in him propelling the puck into the net; the own goal {{turned out to be the}} Stanley Cup-winner, credited to Henrik Zetterberg. [...] "The one <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> on it?" [...] he said. [...] "Oh yeah. (Expletive) yeah. That stunk." [...] However, he would recover by the start of the following season: [...] Fleury completed the playoffs with three shutouts – a new team record for one playoff season – and a 14–6 record. His [...]933 save percentage was also tops in the playoffs. In the off-season, Fleury signed a seven-year, US$35 million contract with the Penguins, on July 3. It included a no-movement clause, and a limited no-trade clause that triggers in the 2010–11 season.|$|E
60|$|As {{this last}} thought crossed my mind, I hastily closed the letter; {{determining}} (alas! how vainly!) never {{to open it}} again. Almost at the same instant, I heard another knock at the house-door. Could Ralph have returned already? impossible! Besides, the knock {{was very different from}} his--it was only just loud enough to be audible <b>where</b> <b>I</b> now <b>sat.</b>|$|R
6000|$|His story done, he {{approached}} the little knoll <b>where</b> <b>I</b> and Ginevra <b>sat</b> apart. In his usual mode of demanding an opinion (he had not reticence to wait till it was voluntarily offered) he asked, [...] "Were you interested?" ...|$|R
6000|$|My companions {{found me}} in a coffee-house, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> down to rest from the fatigue of halting on my wounded foot through the town. They had passed their boxes through the custom-house, {{and were now}} inquiring in all directions, [...] "Where's the Effendi?" [...] After sitting for half an hour, we rose to depart, when an old Arab merchant, whom I had met at Suez, politely insisted ...|$|R
60|$|She entered unattended; and, {{speaking}} no word, the {{old wife}} pointed to <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat,</b> and went.|$|E
60|$|Presently one of {{the fellows}} {{got up from the}} table and came over to the place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat.</b>|$|E
60|$|I beckoned him {{to follow}} me into the saloon <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down {{to write a letter}} of {{recommendation}} for him to a man I knew on shore.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>where</b> <b>sat</b> (<b>i,</b> j) {{refers to}} the number of {{satisfactory}} responses that peer i has received from peer j,and unsat(i, j) {{refers to the}} number of unsatisfactory responses that peer i has received from peer j.|$|R
60|$|Then {{an officer}} bade them be silent, and {{conversation}} ceased. Maputa {{passed through the}} ranks giving orders to the captains. From a distance his withered old body, with a fighting shield held in front of it, looked {{like that of a}} huge black ant carrying something in its mouth. He came to <b>where</b> Scowl and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> upon our horses.|$|R
60|$|In {{a little}} while she came back again, this time without food, and hovered over the nest, trying every way to induce the little one to leave it. She succeeded at last, when with a desperate effort he sprang upward and flapped to the ledge above, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> and watched him with Old Whitehead. Then, after {{surveying}} the world gravely from his new place, he flapped back to the nest, and turned a deaf ear to all his mother's assurances that he could fly just as easily to the tree-tops below, if he only would.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, up at {{the other}} end from <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat,</b> though." [...] And the {{commercial}} drummer grinned. [...] "Oh, I {{had nothing to do with}} it," [...] he added, lightly.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a shame!" [...] he said, {{bending down}} to stroke {{her hand and}} her arm. She drew back smiling, {{flushing}} with joy. I could smell the white lilies <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "'There {{is but one}} moepuu,' {{said the}} priest Eoppo, looking at me <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> on the coffin {{in the bottom of}} the canoe. Already the chiefs were {{paddling}} out through the reef.|$|E
60|$|He slid {{through the}} bushes and disappeared. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was, musing, my work interrupted, a mood of bitter disillusionment heavy upon me. So <b>I</b> <b>sat,</b> {{it may have been}} for hours.|$|R
60|$|As for Castle Brady, {{the gates}} of the park were still there; but the old trees were cut down in the avenue, a black stump jutting out here and there, and casting long shadows as I passed in the {{moonlight}} over the worn grass-grown old road. A few cows were at pasture there. The garden-gate was gone, and the place a tangled wilderness. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down on the old bench, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> on the day when Nora jilted me; and I do believe my feelings were as strong then as they had been when I was a boy, eleven years before; and I caught myself almost crying again, to think that Nora Brady had deserted me. I believe a man forgets nothing. I've seen a flower, or heard some trivial word or two, which have awakened recollections that somehow had lain dormant for scores of years; and when I entered the house in Clarges Street, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was born (it was used as a gambling-house when I first visited London), {{all of a sudden the}} memory of my childhood came back to me--of my actual infancy: I recollected my father in green and gold, holding me up to look at a gilt coach which stood at the door, and my mother in a flowered sack, with patches on her face. Some day, I wonder, will everything we have seen and thought and done come and flash across our minds in this way? I had rather not. I felt so as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> upon the bench at Castle Brady, and thought of the bygone times.|$|R
2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from EastEnders, Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: [...] "I've {{had a great}} time but {{it got to the point}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was <b>sat</b> in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said I wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never." ...|$|R
60|$|He tore {{from its}} place of {{concealment}} in his bosom a little locket, fastened by a ribbon around his neck. He threw {{it to me}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat,</b> and burst into a passion of tears.|$|E
60|$|Just {{in front}} of me was a small looking-glass {{fastened}} against the port side of the cabin in such position that by merely raising my eyes I could see the cabin door from <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{stood looking}} gravely {{down at me}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> by the open case. “I think you good man,” she said. And {{suddenly}} she had fallen before me on the floor. “I belong you all-e-same pig!” she cried.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was cold," [...] she admitted. [...] "But it {{was very}} good for me. It was quiet. The first few days seemed endless; then they began to go by quickly. Quite quickly at last. And I came to think. In the day there was a little stool <b>where</b> one <b>sat.</b> <b>I</b> used to sit on that and brood and try to think things out--all sorts of things I've never had the chance to think about before." ...|$|R
60|$|He rose, {{and walked}} across the room in the {{opposite}} direction from that of the door <b>where</b> <b>I</b> still <b>sat</b> crouching on the ground in my night-shirt, with my broken leg extended sideways in front of me. He went up to the wall and pushed aside a picture that hung from a nail near the ceiling before me. Behind it was a small brass knob. He took a little key from his pocket, which he fitted into the midst of the knob, and suddenly, with a spring a door opened. It was the door of a cupboard or small recess let into the wall, and in it I saw for the twinkling of an eye an apparition of something brilliantly red and yellow. I knew in a second what that thing was. It was the royal robe of sacred feathers that Kalaua had worn as his priest's costume when he solemnly dedicated me to the anger of Pélé.|$|R
60|$|It {{was curious}} and interesting, nevertheless, {{to be sitting}} up there behind four horses: well educated, well dressed, and with plenty of money in my pocket; and {{to look out for}} the places <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had slept on my weary journey. I had {{abundant}} occupation for my thoughts, in every conspicuous landmark on the road. When I looked down at the trampers whom we passed, and saw that well-remembered style of face turned up, I felt as if the tinker's blackened hand were in the bosom of my shirt again. When we clattered through the narrow street of Chatham, and I caught a glimpse, in passing, of the lane where the old monster lived who had bought my jacket, I stretched my neck eagerly to look for the place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had <b>sat,</b> in the sun and in the shade, waiting for my money. When we came, at last, within a stage of London, and passed the veritable Salem House where Mr. Creakle had laid about him with a heavy hand, I would have given all I had, for lawful permission to get down and thrash him, and let all the boys out like so many caged sparrows.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} imagine what might cause this strong lateral flow, for the main channel of the river was plainly visible to me from <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat,</b> and I could see the {{rippling}} junction {{of it and the}} mysterious current which had aroused my curiosity.|$|E
60|$|My aunt seemed {{disposed}} {{to contest the}} point; but to facilitate matters I said I would gladly remain behind, if they pleased; and returned into Mr. Wickfield's office, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down again, in the chair I had first occupied, to await their return.|$|E
60|$|That {{afternoon}} Reuben Camp came lounging {{up toward}} us, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{with her on}} the corner of the piazza, and said that if she would like to let him try his luck with some tickets for the Talk he would see what he could do.|$|E
60|$|Fancy this: {{last night}} at about six, who should walk in but Elwin! He was exactly in his usual state, only more demonstrative than ever, and had been driven in by some {{neighbours}} who were coming to the reading. I had tea up for him, and he went down at seven {{with me to the}} dismal den <b>where</b> <b>I</b> dressed, and <b>sat</b> by the fire while I dressed, and was childishly happy in that great privilege! During the reading he sat on a corner of the platform and roared incessantly. He brought in a lady and gentleman to introduce while I was undressing, and went away in a perfect and absolute rapture.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{down at the}} window, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> {{could just}} discover, here and there between the trees, the glimmer of {{the waters of the}} lake. I thought to myself: [...] "Thus far my mortal journey has brought me. Why not end it here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Until one day I {{received}} a letter addressed {{to the care of}} my publishers. It bore the Swiss postmark, and opening it and turning to the signature <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> wondering for the moment <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had met [...] "Horatio Jones." [...] And then I remembered.|$|R
60|$|From <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> I {{could see}} Jeeves in the dining-room, laying the breakfast-table. I wished I {{could have had}} a minute with him alone. I felt certain that he {{would have been able to}} think of some way of putting a stop to this woman.|$|E
60|$|He emptied his {{basin of}} bread and milk as usual, only that he took it on his knees with his chair {{turned away from the}} table <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat.</b> When he had done, he {{carefully}} snuffed out the candle; and the cold, slate-coloured, miserable day looked in upon us.|$|E
60|$|They both rose. The old gentleman drew in {{his legs}} to let them pass. Though I watched with fixed eyes I was {{absolutely}} unable to follow their movements, but when they had passed the old gentleman I could see from <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> that his pocketbook was gone.|$|E
5000|$|Narasimha {{notes that}} Venkataraman used to sleep very deeply, not waking up from loud sounds, nor {{even when his}} body was beaten by others. When he was about twelve years old, he may have {{experienced}} spontaneous deep meditative states. Sri Ramana Vijayam, the Tamil biography that {{first appeared in the}} 1920s, describes a period a few years before the death-experience in Madurai: Some incomplete practice from a past birth was clinging to me. I would be putting attention solely within, forgetting the body. Sometimes I would be sitting in one place, but when I regained normal consciousness and got up, I would notice that I was lying down in a different narrow space the one <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had first <b>sat</b> down.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he turned}} and left me and I entered the house <b>where</b> <b>I</b> found my mother sitting, still in her festal robes, like one who waits. She looked at my face, then asked what troubled me. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down on a stool at her feet and told her everything.|$|R
6000|$|... "Schiller, or {{what you}} like," [...] said Mr. Fairscribe; [...] "I found the book <b>where</b> <b>I</b> wish I had found a better one, and that is, in Kate's work-basket. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down, and, like an old fool, began to read; but there, I grant, you have the better of Schiller, Mr. Croftangry." ...|$|R
