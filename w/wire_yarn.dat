Two types of thin NiTi-SMA wires (SMA MEMRY wire and FLEXINOL Actuator wire) were used as {{the core of the}} yarn. Both 100 % cotton and polypropylene (PP) fibers were used as the sheath and core fibers respectively. The selected machine parameters were arranged and categorised into several machine parameter plans. The first plan was focused on the determination of the appropriate yarn size to be spun the core-sheath yarn on the DREF 3000 friction spinning machine. The second plan was arranged to investigate the NiTi- SMA CSFY yarn mechanical properties. The third plan was arranged to validate the NiTi-SMA CSFY yarn actuation performance upon the parameters changes, in specific, the spinning drum speed, delivery speed and air-suction pressure. The appropriate Tex value was found to be 320 Tex as it was successfully spun the NiTi-SMA CSFY yarn without caused of machine stoppages. The results showed that the strength of both NiTi- SMA CSFY yarns (from SMA MEMRY wire and FLEXINOL Actuator wire) declined as the core-sheath ratio and delivery speed increased from 40 to 60 % and 100 to 160 m/min respectively. The strip resistance of the NiTi-SMA CSFY yarn (SMA MEMRY wire) increased with the increase in the spinning drum speed, delivery speed and core-sheath ratio. Under the thermal heating test, the actuation time of the NiTi- SMA CSFY (SMA MEMRY <b>wire)</b> <b>yarn</b> reduced approximately 5 to 93 %, 39 to 91 % and 15 to 87 % as the spinning drum speed increased from 3000 to 4400 rpm and coresheath ratio from 40 to 60 %, respectively. The NiTi-SMA CSFY yarn (FLEXINOL Actuator wire) showed faster shape recovery at approximately 0. 01 s in comparison with the NiTi-SMA CSFY yarn (SMA MEMRY wire) when it was heated through the resistive heating test. The pre-set shape of the SMA MEMRY wire (spiral annealed) and FLEXINOL Actuator wire (straight annealed) gave different NiTi-SMA CSFY yarn physical appearances, mechanical properties, actuation performance and affected the SMA wire actuation performances in both the woven and knitted fabric structures...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMaterials {{nowadays}} become {{smarter and}} “more intelligent”, containing novel functionalities or sensory components. In {{all areas of}} materials science, integrating new abilities into common materials belongs to the most important topics in research and development. In the textile area, several functions {{can be achieved by}} finishing techniques, i. e. physical and/or chemical modifications of textile surfaces. The integration of electronic components, however, still suffers from incompatibilities between soft, flexible, bendable textile fabrics and rigid electronic parts. Connecting conductive yarns with electronic components, such as SMD-LEDs etc., cannot be performed by soldering nor by sewing. The typical connection technologies of both areas fail in these cases. A new possibility to achieve such electrical {{and at the same time}} mechanical connections is given by 3 D printing. In a recent project, we have studied chances and limitations of electric circuits combining textile fabrics with 3 D printing. Textile fabrics were woven and knitted from common yarns as well as wires, strands and different conductive yarns. 3 D printing was used to connect SMD elements and other small electronic parts with these base circuits and compared with soldered and sewn contacts. The influence of conductive <b>wires,</b> <b>yarns</b> or filaments integrated in the printed elements was tested. The article will give an overview of possibilities and problems in electrical contacting of small electronic components on partly conductive textile fabrics by conductive 3 D printed connections.

40|$|The latest {{developments}} in carbon nanotube (CNT) <b>wires</b> and <b>yarns</b> attract great interest for potential application to electromagnetic devices, such as electrical machines and transformers. The CNT material properties are largely different from copper and aluminum in terms of electrical conductivity, mass density, and thermal transfer, creating a new design paradigm for which the traditional rules and device topologies no longer apply. This paper proposes a brushless permanent magnet multidisc axial flux construction with coreless stator and special windings and minimal rotor back iron, as a suitable topology for CNT winding application. Specific analytical closed-form sizing equations, {{as a function of}} winding electric conductivity, machine dimensions, and operating speed/frequency, are derived and employed in a systematic comparative study over a range of kW power ratings and speeds between 1, 000 and 10, 000 rpm. The numerical study is complemented by 3 D and 2 D electromagnetic FEA. The results show that the designs with CNT windings may have substantially higher specific power per mass, particularly at high rotational speeds and/or supply frequency, where the combined effect of DC and AC conduction losses in the windings is significant...|$|R
50|$|A braid (also {{referred}} to as a plait) is a complex structure or pattern formed by interlacing three or more strands of flexible material such as textile <b>yarns,</b> <b>wire,</b> or hair. Compared with the process of weaving, which usually involves two separate, perpendicular groups of strands (warp and weft), a braid is usually long and narrow, with each component strand functionally equivalent in zigzagging forward through the overlapping mass of the others. The most common braid is a flat, solid, three-stranded structure. More complex braids can be constructed from an arbitrary number of strands to create a wider range of structures.Braids have been made for thousands of years in many different cultures, and for a variety of uses. Traditionally, the materials used in braids have depended on the indigenous plants and animals available in the local area.|$|R

The moulding was performed at a temperature of 140 'C and was post-cured for 2 h. The coefficient of friction of the PFC showed {{a decrease in the}} 3 rd to 4 th cycle when testing was performed at an interface temperature of 250 °C. Gravimetric analysis showed some loss in weight when the unpost-cured PFC was exposed to 300 °C. This was attributed to the presence of moisture and the volatile materials formed from the decomposed ingredients. Similar phenomenon was expected to occur when the coefficient of friction testing performed at higher temperatures. It was shown that the moisture increases the coefficient of friction, whereas, the volatiles decrease it and even prevents the effect of moisture. Extending the post-curing time to 4 h helps in elimination of this slippage behaviour and marginally improves many desirable properties.

40|$|Solar gain through {{fenestration}} has {{a significant}} impact on building peak load and annual energy consumption. Shading devices, attached to fenestration, offer a cost effective strategy in controlling solar gain. The performance of a particular shading device is dependent on solar optical and longwave radiative properties of the device. The current study considers longwave properties of three flat shading materials; drapery fabrics, insect screens and roller blinds. Each of these materials consists of a structure (i. e., <b>yarn,</b> <b>wire,</b> sheet) that is opaque with respect to longwave (infrared) radiation and each material is likely to have some openness. Material emittance and longwave transmittance measurements were taken with an infrared reflectometer using two backing surfaces. The results show emittance and longwave transmittance to be simple functions of openness, emittance and longwave transmittance of the structure. This is especially useful because openness can be determined from solar transmittance measurements while emittance and longwave transmittance of the structure was found to be constant for each category of shading material.

However, incorporating these metallic filaments as core {{or as an}} integral part of core deteriorate the {{mechanical properties}} of textile yarns and ultimately the fabrics’. Moreover, the transparency of fabrics to high frequency/smaller wavelength waves further increases with the attempt to increase the metallic filament diameter. This study, therefore analyses the effects of metallic filament alignment in order to improve the mechanical properties of the resultant hybrid yarns, and devises an alternative method to increase the amount of conductive filament without increasing the diameter of the conducting <b>wire</b> in hybrid <b>yarn</b> structures. The results suggest that the tensile properties of the proposed hybrid cover yarns with conductive filament as covering component is superior as compared to the yarns having a conductive filament in the core, however, the electrical resistance increases with an increase in conductive filament length. The tenacity, elongation and initial modulus values were enhanced several times by incorporating the conductive filament as spiral covering. Moreover, with the proposed alignment method, the amount of copper in hybrid yarn can be increased up to some extent by changing the number of turns of covering component.|$|R
40|$|Sensory Responsive Objects' were {{a series}} of works {{designed}} by Philippa Brock, Samuel Plant Dempsey and Priti Veja This collaboration brought together three researchers who had not previously worked together on textiles, but who all share an interest in smart materials. The collaboration has been as much {{about the process of}} the collaboration as it was the outcomes. Many ideas were discussed during the initial phases of the project, and the designers were particularly interested in exploring sensory experiences on the London underground – haptic, visual and sound for woven jacquard design. The designers discussed how these specific senses (haptic, visual and sound) respond and interact to sensory signal data on the London underground. Using the idea of contrasts for visual aids, tactility of moquette seat fabrics and platform blisters, and sounds of announcements, these ideas were further progressed into the design ideation phase using ludic methodology for design thinking. The designers collected a range of small analogue and digital toys/ objects, reactive materials and electronic components, that would help inform design thinking via hacking, making and linking key sensory themes of haptic, visual and sound. Some of the key objects that worked towards the final outcomes included: −	Digibirds – digital toy birds that respond by singing and moving when sensing sound −	Analog music machine – sound response to a punch card data when wound through analog music machine (reading a punch card relating back to jacquard data) −	Stereo earphones – digital music earphones −	Bike light – reflective and flashing mode bicycle safety light −	Tactile materials and yarns – materials including rubber, paper, mohair, plastics, monofilaments, vibration motors, reflective <b>yarn,</b> phosphorescent <b>yarn,</b> <b>wire,</b> chenille, polyester, UV-reactive −	E-textile materials – conductive yarn and sensory output components (LEDs, buzzers, pressure sensors, actuated soft circuits) Although multiple ideas were inspired by the ‘hacking and making’ session, only specific ones were taken through for jacquard design. The final jacquard designs were reflective QR code, multi-haptic graphic jacquard, giant speaker, digibird graphic e-textile tracks, mind the gap music/braille code. Each jacquard outcome is explained as follows: •	Reflective QR code (Sensory response: SIGHT) Visual contrasts to aid clarity and visibility are vital on Transport for London designs. This jacquard outcome grew from how visual contrasts could be transformed as data, and led to the idea of QR codes (digital data as a visual response). The graphics of QR codes are usually a black and white code, read by a digital reader much like a serial barcode. The contrast between the dark and light space is what enables the code to be encrypted to a weblink. Generating a QR code for the @WeavingFutures twitter handle resulted in the visual graphic. Pattern manipulation in some of the idle code areas enabled swirl pattern aesthetics. The QR code was woven in reflective yarn and phosphorescent yarn to give multiple visual contrasts effects depending on the lighting condition viewed in, while still working as an active code. •	Multi-haptic graphic jacquard (Sensory response: HAPTIC & SIGHT) A photograph of the iconic ‘mind the gap’ text between the train and platform, enabled the designers to think about the multiple details integrated in this one image i. e. text, yellow boundary lines, paving indentations. Every detail served a purpose, thus the jacquard translation could also respond via multiple tactile materials (e. g. mohair - furry, polyester -smooth/shiny, matt chenille - soft/moquette like, yellow - reflective) while still keeping the ‘mind the gap’ text in a single woven design. •	Giant speaker (Sensory response: SOUND & SIGHT) This sample was a reaction to all the sound data on the London underground. When hacking the digibird and earphones, small speakers play an integral part of these functions. One of the physical qualities required for a speaker are coils of copper around a magnetic field. This could be translated as a literal spiral graphic and specifically designed structures, which would enable the piece to operate as a speaker. A giant coil was woven and requires connection to active sound source and magnetic field. In addition, this piece is also woven with a UV-reactive yarn to change visually when exposed to UV light. •	Digibird graphic e-textile tracks (Sensory response: SIGHT, SOUND & HAPTIC) The digibirds were integral to inspire many trails of thought during the residency. The dissected digibirds enabled the designers to study the internal ‘guts’ and understand the methods of connections and actuation. The visual photograph of the step-by-step dissection was used as the graphic for the jacquard design, with multiple tactile yarns. Disguised amongst the aesthetic design, multiple conductive yarn tracks were woven in to act as a fabric electronic breadboard. The piece is able to connect to a circuit of multiple electronic outputs to emulate to multiple outputs of the digibirds. •	Mind the gap music code (Sensory response: SIGHT & HAPTIC) The wind up analog music machine inspired this piece. The punch card system that operates the music machine requires holes to be punched in a specific sequence to play notes/ tunes. The visual aesthetic of the punched music card resembled that of braille, leading the designers to research and analyse the configuration of the braille alphabet. The 2 x 3 dot configuration that can make any braille letter could be reconfigured as a linear 1 x 6; hence, each braille alphabet letter could be translated as a punch card music machine sound/ note. Using this method, phrases from the London underground were translated as complete tunes, including ‘mind the gap’. The visual aesthetic of this translated braille to music machine notes were woven as a jacquard design in this piece. The braille-music note hybrid coded dots were woven in structures that enabled raised surfaces, relating back to the original haptic of braille...|$|R
