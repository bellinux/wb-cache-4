5|$|Viva Piñata is a first-person life {{simulation}} game {{in which}} the player restores and tends to a neglected garden on Piñata Island. The player uses gardening tools, such as shovels and <b>watering</b> <b>cans,</b> to plough their garden, sow seeds, create ponds, and sculpt the garden to their liking. When certain requirements are fulfilled, the garden will attract a black-and-white outline of a given piñata species. After fulfilling additional requirements, the piñata will become a resident, changing into a full-color version.|$|E

5000|$|Animal Crossing: City Folks {{gameplay}} {{is built}} upon the gameplay of previous Animal Crossing games. The Wii Remote pointer and motion controls (including the Nunchuk) {{can be used}} for handling tools, such as axes, <b>watering</b> <b>cans,</b> slingshots, fishing rods, and bug-catching nets. The game also has shovels and <b>watering</b> <b>cans.</b> Players live in individual houses spread apart from each other, unlike Animal Crossing, in which all four houses are located in a central plaza, and Animal Crossing: Wild World, in which all players share one house. Each town begins with six animal residents, and can grow to a maximum of ten. In Animal Crossing for the GameCube, up to 15 animal residents can live in a single town, and in Animal Crossing: Wild World, there can be only 8. In previous iterations of Animal Crossing, custom clothing involves a single image that is repeated on the front, back and sleeves; in City Folk, the player can make separate images for each, which is called a [...] "Pro" [...] design.|$|E

50|$|Born {{and raised}} in Hamilton, NZ he was schooled in music from age 5. Starting with piano lessons, he progressed on to drums, harmonica, and bass.

50|$|Heating is {{therefore}} only necessary later, since warm <b>water</b> <b>can</b> {{be taken from}} above for longer, as opposed to mixed storage. In addition, <b>water</b> <b>can</b> be drawn with almost the same temperature very quickly after filling with hot water, since {{not all of the}} storage tank has to be heated. This optimises energy efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Altruism {{does not}} require {{self-sacrifice}} but sacrifice, such as time or energy, is shown to be of greater significance. Second, <b>water</b> <b>can</b> {{be said to be}} modest since naturally water always goes to the lowest position. Instead of competing for a high position, water is yielding moving to a position below others. Again, one <b>can</b> learn from <b>water</b> to be humble and modest. Third, <b>water</b> <b>can</b> be described as adaptable and flexible as it matches the shape of any container. <b>Water</b> <b>can</b> not be broken and is able to adjust to pressure and work around it. The lesson, according to Lee, is to be flexible and adaptable to different people in different situations. Fourth, <b>water</b> <b>can</b> be very clear and transparent. Being clear shows others that you are trustworthy, as you have nothing to hide. Gentle and persistent force will complete the task overtime, rather than forcing a task and creating more problems. In other words, human beings should be honest and transparent with others. Finally, <b>water</b> <b>can</b> be very soft and gentle (making it difficult to catch) but also strong and persistent (even the hardest rock will yield to continuous drips of water).|$|R
