5|$|Ida's {{regolith}} {{is composed}} of the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene. Its appearance changes over time through a process called space <b>weathering.</b> Because of this process, older regolith appears more red in color compared to freshly exposed material.|$|E
5|$|Other source {{minerals}} for zinc include smithsonite (zinc carbonate), hemimorphite (zinc silicate), wurtzite (another zinc sulfide), {{and sometimes}} hydrozincite (basic zinc carbonate). With {{the exception of}} wurtzite, all these other minerals were formed by <b>weathering</b> of the primordial zinc sulfides.|$|E

25|$|In July 2012, The <b>Weather</b> Company (former {{owner of}} The <b>Weather</b> Channel) {{purchased}} competing <b>weather</b> website <b>Weather</b> Underground. While The <b>Weather</b> Channel already had success {{with its own}} mobile apps, it planned to use <b>Weather</b> Underground's large network of digital forecasting and tracking websites to bolster its digital growth. <b>Weather</b> Underground operates separately from The <b>Weather</b> Channel and continues to provide its own forecasts, though its website incorporates some <b>weather</b> news and video content from TWC.|$|R
50|$|WFIE-DT2 was {{launched}} in Fall 2005 as an affiliate of the NBC <b>Weather</b> Plus service, a 24-hour <b>weather</b> channel that provided regional and national <b>weather</b> information forecasts in a continuous basis, along with cut-ins of local <b>weather</b> forecasts from WFIE's <b>weather</b> forecasting team. WFIE's <b>weather</b> team provided the cut-ins for WFIE-DT2 during the entire existence of NBC <b>weather</b> plus. The channel's original branding was First Alert <b>Weather</b> Now.|$|R
5|$|The Galileo images {{also led}} to the {{discovery}} that space <b>weathering</b> was taking place on Ida, a process which causes older regions to become more red in color over time. The same process affects both Ida and its moon, although Dactyl shows a lesser change. The <b>weathering</b> of Ida's surface revealed another detail about its composition: the reflection spectra of freshly exposed parts of the surface resembled that of OC meteorites, but the older regions matched the spectra of S-type asteroids.|$|E
5|$|Dactyl shares many {{characteristics}} with Ida. Their albedos {{and reflection}} spectra are very similar. The small differences {{indicate that the}} space <b>weathering</b> process is less active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible. This contrasts with Ida, which is covered by a deep layer of regolith.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy <b>weathering,</b> {{the ditch}} is still visible in short sections, {{which can be}} 45yards wide and up to 5feet deep. A 330-yard stretch through Denton Golf Course, and a section running through Platt Fields Park, are {{considered}} the best preserved remains. In 1997, {{a segment of the}} ditch 150-yard long in Platt Fields was protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The rest of the ditch remains unprotected.|$|E
5000|$|According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), severe <b>weather</b> can be {{categorized}} into two groups: general severe <b>weather</b> and localized severe <b>weather.</b> Nor'easters, European wind storms, and the phenomena that accompany them form over wide geographic areas. These occurrences are classified as general severe <b>weather.</b> [...] Downbursts and tornadoes are more localized and therefore have a more limited geographic effect. These forms of <b>weather</b> are classified as localized severe <b>weather.</b> The term severe <b>weather</b> is technically not the same phenomenon as extreme <b>weather.</b> Extreme <b>weather</b> describes unusual <b>weather</b> events {{that are at the}} extremes of the historical distribution for a given area.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} <b>weather</b> advisory or warning is not {{an official}} National <b>Weather</b> Service product, instead it is issued within a special <b>weather</b> statement. Special <b>weather</b> statements are also used for any type of <b>weather</b> approaching watch/warning/advisory levels. Many NWS offices do not use significant <b>weather</b> advisories, instead issue normal special <b>weather</b> statements mentioning {{much of the same}} text used in such an advisory.|$|R
40|$|<b>Weather</b> related {{disruptions}} {{account for}} {{seventy percent of}} the delays in the National Airspace System (NAS). A key component in the <b>weather</b> plan of the Next Generation of Air Transportation System (NextGen) is to assimilate observed <b>weather</b> information and probabilistic forecasts into the decision process of flight crews and air traffic controllers. In this research we explore supporting flight crew <b>weather</b> decision making through the development of a flight deck predicted <b>weather</b> display system that utilizes <b>weather</b> predictions generated by ground-based radar. This system integrates and presents this <b>weather</b> information, together with in-flight trajectory modification tools, within a cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) prototype. that the CDTI features 2 D and perspective 3 D visualization models of <b>weather.</b> The <b>weather</b> forecast products that we implemented were the Corridor Integrated <b>Weather</b> System (CIWS) and the Convective <b>Weather</b> Avoidance Model (CWAM), both developed by MIT Lincoln Lab. We evaluated the use of CIWS and CWAM for flight deck <b>weather</b> avoidance in two part-task experiments. Experiment 1 compared pilots' en route <b>weather</b> avoidance performance in four <b>weather</b> information conditions that differed in the type and amount of predicted forecast (CIWS current <b>weather</b> only, CIWS current and historical <b>weather,</b> CIWS current and forecast <b>weather,</b> CIWS current and forecast <b>weather</b> and CWAM predictions). Experiment 2 compared the use of perspective 3 D and 21 / 2 D presentations of <b>weather</b> for flight deck <b>weather</b> avoidance. Results showed that pilots could take advantage of longer range predicted <b>weather</b> forecasts in performing en route <b>weather</b> avoidance but more research will be needed to determine what combinations of information are optimal and how best to present them...|$|R

5|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca secretes {{large amounts}} of oxalic acid—a {{reducing}} agent and relatively strong acid—into the soil around its woody substrate. This chemical stimulates <b>weathering</b> of the humus layer of forest soil, as the organic matter in soil breaks down into smaller molecules. This influences the solubility and turnover of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen), which in turn affects their availability for use by forest trees.|$|E

30|$|According to the <b>weather</b> and outage data of {{transmission}} lines, appropriate <b>weather</b> factors are determined in the method and denoted as w 1, w 2, …, wp respectively. Due to the {{temporal and spatial}} variations of <b>weather</b> factors, temporal and spatial splits are needed. Distribution of <b>weather</b> factors is uneven over a vast area, such as a province. A transmission line might be in multiple areas with a different meteorological environment. A spatial split is the division of <b>weather</b> areas. Assuming that the meteorological environment in each <b>weather</b> area is consistent, the divided <b>weather</b> areas are denoted as WA 1, WA 2, …,WAq respectively. According to {{the data from the}} meteorological department, the <b>weather</b> area is divided the same as the administrative area. There are several lines in one <b>weather</b> area, which are in the same meteorological environment. All transmission lines with the same voltage level are taken as the basic samples for the estimation of one <b>weather</b> area. Temporal treatment of <b>weather</b> data contains both split and aggregation. First <b>weather</b> and outage data are split by a step of one day and the <b>weather</b> data is classified into several intensities. Based on the intensity classification, the <b>weather</b> and outage data with the same intensity are aggregated. Both temporal and spatial aggregation result in data smoothing and provides more meaningful patterns and it converts the time distribution of the <b>weather</b> factors to the intensity distribution. There are several <b>weather</b> factors in one area and the combination of different <b>weather</b> factors is defined as a <b>weather</b> block. As the <b>weather</b> factor w 1 and w 2 in a <b>weather</b> area is at level k and m respectively, the <b>weather</b> block is defined as WBkm. The outage data is divided according to the classification of the <b>weather</b> block.|$|R

5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, <b>weathering</b> of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography these small variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|As {{the desert}} {{mountains}} decay, {{large areas of}} shattered rock and rubble occur. The process continues and the end products are either dust or sand. Dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder granites, limestone and sandstone.
