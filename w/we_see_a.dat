5|$|Before <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{full shot}} of Tracy, we see {{individual}} shots of her upraised {{right and left}} arms. This is reminiscent of our first views of Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford) in the 1932 film Rain.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is carving a jack-o'-lantern while {{preparing}} {{to take his}} daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) trick-or-treating. As he leaves to collect her, he notices a demonic figure watching him from across the street. That night, Jordan deliberately passes by one house, telling Black that it is haunted. Black tells her {{there are no such}} thing as ghosts, but is reminded of a moment from his past. In a flashback, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> five-year-old Black being dared by his friends to knock the door of the same house; a man named Crocell (Dean Winters) answers and invites Black inside. Crocell is a Second World War veteran, and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black, telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living. Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war, and is dismayed when the young Black dismisses the possibility of ghosts.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the fact}} that <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> city down there means that - at least implicitly - {{there are people in}} this painting.|$|E
50|$|In Dante's Inferno (Canto VII, line 106) <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> {{example of}} Japanese utamakura, or poetic place name, in {{reference}} to the river Styx.|$|R

60|$|In {{these laws}} of Inheritance, as {{displayed}} under domestication, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> ample provision for the production, through variability and natural selection, of new specific forms.|$|R
25|$|In example (4a) {{we start}} with a stative in{{transitive}} adjective, and derive (4b) where we see an intransitive inchoative verb. In (4c) <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> transitive causative verb.|$|E
25|$|Through Fra Angelico's pupil Benozzo Gozzoli's careful {{portraiture}} {{and technical}} {{expertise in the}} art of fresco <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> link to Domenico Ghirlandaio, who in turn painted extensive schemes for the wealthy patrons of Florence, and through Ghirlandaio to his pupil Michelangelo and the High Renaissance.|$|E
25|$|The Mansa Sunjata forced some Fulani {{to settle}} in various regions where the {{dominant}} ethnic groups were Maninka or Bamana. Thus, today, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{number of people with}} Fula names (Diallo, Diakite, Sangare, Sidibe) who display Fula cultural characteristics, but only speak the language of the Maninka or Bamana.|$|E

5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>see</b> example 1 {{work because}} the French Embedded Language island Le matin de bonne heure, [...] "early in the morning", {{is a time}} expression. (Also, it is {{repeated}} in Wolof in the second sentence.) In example 2, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the quantifier <b>a</b> lot of is a predicted Embedded Language island. Here <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> objective complement of a finite verb begin with the quantifier.|$|R
50|$|The comic {{features}} <b>a</b> strip where <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> ambulance {{in front}} of the local YMCA. This is a reference to Julie Dwyer's death, which is mentioned in Clerks, Mallrats and Chasing Amy.|$|R
25|$|There <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{characteristic}} pattern, {{as we move}} {{outward from}} the edge of the riverbed, so that the woodlands that are most dependent on the aquifer are on the riverbank, that is, (alders and willow groves) and those less dependent on water are located further away, such as the (ash, elm, and poplar groves).|$|E
25|$|Later MPPNB {{populations in}} the Southern Levant were already {{witnessing}} severe changes in climate {{that would have been}} exacerbated by large population demands on local resources. Beginning at 8.9 cal ka BP <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> significant decrease in population in highland Jordan, ultimately leading to the complete abandonment of almost all central settlements in this region.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the {{millennium}} the South saw various smalled kingdoms rise and fall mostly independent to the turmoil in the Gangetic plains and the spread of the Buddhism and Jainism to the southern tip of India. During the second half of the millennium after the fall of the Gupta Empire <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> gradual shift of the balance of power both military and cultural from the northern states to the rise of large southern states.|$|E
5000|$|In The Matrix as Neo {{is running}} from Agent Smith in <b>an</b> {{apartment}} building, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> elderly lady {{in one of}} the rooms; while Agent Smith transports inside her and launches a knife at Neo <b>we</b> <b>see</b> that she was watching an episode from the series.|$|R

25|$|All {{the common}} blood types, {{such as the}} ABO blood group system, are genetic polymorphisms. Here <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> system where {{there are more than}} two morphs: the phenotypes A, B, AB and O are present in all human populations, but vary in {{proportion}} {{in different parts of the}} world. The phenotypes are controlled by multiple alleles at one locus. These polymorphisms are seemingly never eliminated by natural selection; the reason came from a study of disease statistics.|$|E
25|$|Another example {{would be}} a left neglect patient failing to {{describe}} left turns while describing a familiar route. This shows that the failure to describe things in the contralesional side can also affect verbal items. These findings show that space representation is more topological than symbolic. Patients show a contralesional loss of space representation with a deviation of spatial reference to the ipsilesional side. In these cases <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> left-right dissimilarity of representation rather than a decline of representational competence.|$|E
25|$|Viktoria {{leaves the}} resort {{immediately}} with the producer. To {{go to the}} competition she needs a new band, and the producer finds her one {{on the outskirts of}} Moscow. The role of the band is played by Mashina Vremeni (Time Machine). When Viktoria meets the band she recognizes the main player - her old school friend, although they give no sign of {{it in front of the}} producer. Rehearsals begin, and at his point in the film <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> music video featuring Rotaru, Boyarsky and Mashina Vremeni, all dressed in futuristic costumes made of tight shiny stretchy fabric, jumping on the trampoline.|$|E

30|$|When {{it comes}} to the {{indirect}} social and environmental effects of the production and use of biofuels <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> ongoing discussion on both whether there are such problems and which actor(s) should carry responsibility for these issues.|$|R
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> one-of-a-kind {{chance to}} make an {{investment}} that is true {{to all of our}} values and our giving priorities and that embodies the kind of flexible, creative, and transformative philanthropy we believe in. At its best, we hope our involvement may bolster the spirit of positive engagement and creativity in Detroit, catalyzing others to invest strategically across the region. It does not mark the start of philanthropy as a solution to public insolvency. This is a unique, clear-eyed move to push forward positive negotiations, with our philanthropic dollars being exclusively pegged for two roles: safeguarding the DIA and protecting pensions.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} fake Galleons enchanted by Hermione for Dumbledore's army, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> few other methods of closed channel {{communications}} {{used in the}} books and films. Subjects painted into wizarding portraits are frequently used to carry messages between locations where their portraits hang. Phineas Nigellus (former Hogwarts headmaster {{and member of the}} Black Family) is used to send messages between Dumbledore's office and his other portrait in Grimmauld Place. Hermione takes Phineas from Grimmauld Place during Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and uses Phineas to obtain information about events at Hogwarts. Dumbledore also uses two other former headmasters in a similar fashion when Arthur Weasley is attacked by Nagini in the Ministry of Magic. A portrait is also carries messages between the Minister of Magic and the Muggle Prime Minister in the opening of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.|$|E
25|$|The devil, {{dressed in}} a monk's habit and with fearsome teeth, holds out some stones {{in his left hand}} and a globe in his right hand. He teases Jesus asking him to turn the stones into bread and telling Jesus, with {{reference}} to the globe, that he could be the ruler of the entire world if he chose to be so. Between the devil and the second image of Jesus we see Jesus wearing the crown of thorns, his hands bound and held by a soldier. He is appearing before Pontius Pilate who is seated and wears a turban. He touches his thumb with his left index finger to show that he is speaking. Then <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> second image of Jesus but without the crown of thorns. To understand this scene it is best to see the image of the devil and the image of Christ without the crown of thorns as apparitions and speaking across Pontius and that group.|$|E
5000|$|Increased {{competition}}: {{as competition}} intensifies across all business categories, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> {{increasing number of}} companies reviving their brands to {{stand out from the}} competition and capture a larger share of the market. Branding has been <b>seen</b> as <b>a</b> way of building a strong reputation.|$|R
3000|$|In {{selection}} relaying (without antenna diversity) {{the maximum}} implementation loss is 10 [*]dB. However, if we disregard data with SNR less than 8 [*]dB, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> implementation loss of about 2 [*]dB {{except for one}} outlier ([...] [...]...|$|R
50|$|The {{environment}} {{should be}} constant throughout testing {{in order to}} provide accurate and reliable results. If the testing is <b>a</b> success, <b>we</b> should <b>see</b> <b>a</b> proportional change in performance. For example, if we double the users on the system, <b>we</b> should <b>see</b> <b>a</b> drop in performance of 50%.|$|R
25|$|Historically, work on radio-loud {{unification}} has {{concentrated on}} high-luminosity radio-loud quasars. These can be unified with narrow-line radio galaxies {{in a manner}} directly analogous to the Seyfert 1/2 unification (but without the complication of {{much in the way}} of a reflection component: narrow-line radio galaxies show no nuclear optical continuum or reflected X-ray component, although they do occasionally show polarized broad-line emission). The large-scale radio structures of these objects provide compelling evidence that the orientation-based unified models really are true. X-ray evidence, where available, supports the unified picture: radio galaxies show evidence of obscuration from a torus, while quasars do not, although care must be taken since radio-loud objects also have a soft unabsorbed jet-related component, and high resolution is necessary to separate out thermal emission from the sources' large-scale hot-gas environment. At very small angles to the line of sight, relativistic beaming dominates, and <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> blazar of some variety.|$|E
25|$|A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), {{who never}} quite understands {{what is going}} on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, idiocy and pretense annoys {{everyone}} he meets, although he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> flashback of Darill {{as a child in}} Belgium, and the strange rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date he has brought back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals that the only thing he ever daydreams about is a tiny oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end of The Kids in the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill onto that show.|$|E
25|$|The building’s {{interior}} is distributed across three floors: a basement floor, {{which includes the}} kitchen, pantry and service areas; a ground floor including all the living rooms, dining rooms, atriums and library; and a first-floor which corresponds to the private quarters. Visitors entering the Villa through the main entrance from the street, that is relatively dark, will gain their first impression of the building’s structure and {{its relationship with the}} garden, from the impressive two-storey central hall. Looking in front, through the vast exterior window, they will see the central parterre and park. Looking to the right, they will see the vast salon which extends via the window to the lateral parterre. The Villa’s private quarters can be sensed rather than seen, via the first floor gallery around the central atrium. To the left, with a slight difference of floor levels, there is an elegant dining room that overlooks the garden and a billiards room, on the other side, that looks over the street. Beyond them <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> wrought iron gate designed by Edgar Brandt, which separates this social zone from the Villa’s private quarters on the first floor and also the library and service areas on the ground floor.|$|E
