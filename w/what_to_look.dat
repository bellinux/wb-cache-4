5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as to <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium {{had been}} {{predicted}} by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869 and Henry Moseley measured in 1914 the effective nuclear charge by X-ray spectroscopy to be 72, placing it between the already known elements lutetium and tantalum. Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy {{were the first}} to search for the new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. There has been some controversy surrounding the discovery of hafnium {{and the extent to which}} Coster and Hevesy were guided by Bohr's prediction that hafnium would be a transition metal rather than a rare earth element. While titanium and zirconium, as relatively abundant elements, were discovered in the late 18th century, it took until 1923 for hafnium to be identified. This was only partly due to hafnium's relative scarcity. The chemical similarity between zirconium and hafnium made a separation difficult and, without knowing <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for, hafnium was left undiscovered, although all samples of zirconium, and all of its compounds, used by chemists for over two centuries contained significant amounts of hafnium..|$|E

Revillame hosted the live telecast of the eviction and the public revelation of the nomination for evictees, but only for the first season.

500|$|Forensic chemists' {{analysis}} can provide leads for investigators, {{and they can}} confirm or refute their suspicions. [...] The identification of the various substances found at the scene can tell investigators <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for during their search. [...] During fire investigations, forensic chemists can determine if an accelerant such as gasoline or kerosene was used; if so, {{this suggests that the}} fire was intentionally set. [...] Forensic chemists can also narrow down the suspect list to people who would have access to the substance used in a crime. [...] For example, in explosive investigations, the identification of RDX or C-4 would indicate a military connection as those substances are military grade explosives. [...] On the other hand, the identification of TNT would create a wider suspect list, since it is used by demolition companies {{as well as in the}} military. [...] During poisoning investigations, the detection of specific poisons can give detectives an idea of <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for when they are interviewing potential suspects. For example, an investigation that involves ricin would tell investigators to look for ricin's precursors, the seeds of the castor oil plant.|$|E

[...] The JNA also participated in the looting; an official in the Serbian Ministry of Defence commented: [...] "Tell me of even one reservist, especially if he is an officer, who {{has spent more than}} a month at the front and has not brought back a fine car filled with everything that would fit inside the car." [...] More than 8,000 works of art were looted during the battle, including the contents of the municipal museum, Eltz Castle, which was bombed and destroyed during the siege. Serbia returned 2,000 pieces of looted art in December 2001.|$|E
500|$|During Linnaeus' time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University, {{he taught}} many devoted students, 17 {{of whom he}} called [...] "apostles". They were the most promising, most {{committed}} students, {{and all of them}} made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with his help. The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a scholarship or a place on an expedition. To most of the apostles he gave instructions of <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for on their journeys. Abroad, the apostles collected and organised new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus' system. Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished. Thanks to these students, the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland. The British botanist William T. Stearn notes without Linnaeus' new system, {{it would not have been}} possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens. Many of the apostles died during their expeditions.|$|E
500|$|Cott was a protege of John Graham Kerr who had quarrelled with Norman Wilkinson in the First World War about dazzle {{camouflage}} for ships. Wilkinson remained {{influential in}} 1939 as an inspector of camouflage, so a political argument developed. Cott {{was invited to}} camouflage a 12-inch rail-mounted gun, alongside a similar gun camouflaged conventionally. Cott carefully combined disruptive contrast {{to break up the}} gun barrel's outlines with countershading to flatten out its appearance as a solid cylinder. The guns were then photographed from the air from various angles, and in Peter Forbes's view [...] "the results were remarkable." [...] Cott's gun is [...] "invisible except to the most minute scrutiny by someone who knows exactly where to look and <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for. The other gun is always highly visible." [...] The authorities hesitated, appearing to be embarrassed by the evidence that Cott was right, and argued that countershading would be too difficult to use as an expert zoologist would be needed to supervise every installation. Cott was posted to the Middle East, and Kerr unsuccessfully intervened, pleading for guns to be painted Cott's way and Cott to be brought home.|$|E

2500|$|Although Fermi {{calculations}} {{are often}} not accurate, as there may be many problems with their assumptions, this sort of analysis does tell us <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for {{to get a better}} answer. For the above example, we might try to find a better estimate of the number of pianos tuned by a piano tuner in a typical day, or look up an accurate number for the population of Chicago. [...] It also gives us a rough estimate that may be good enough for some purposes: if we want to start a store in Chicago that sells piano tuning equipment, and we calculate that we need 10,000 potential customers to stay in business, we can reasonably assume that the above estimate is far enough below 10,000 that we should consider a different business plan (and, with a little more work, we could compute a rough upper bound on the number of piano tuners by considering the most extreme reasonable values that could appear in each of our assumptions).|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Jones's {{remains were}} {{identified}} by U.S. Ambassador to France Gen. Horace Porter, who had searched for six years {{to track down the}} body using faulty copies of Jones's burial record. Thanks to the kind donation of a French admirer, Pierrot Francois Simmoneau, who had donated over 460 francs, Jones's body was preserved in alcohol and interred in a lead coffin [...] "in the event that should the United States decide to claim his remains, they might more easily be identified." [...] Porter knew <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for in his search. With the aid of an old map of Paris, Porter's team, which included anthropologist Louis Capitan, identified the site of the former St. Louis Cemetery for Alien Protestants. Sounding probes were used to search for lead coffins and five coffins were ultimately exhumed. The third, unearthed on April 7, 1905, was later identified by a meticulous post-mortem examination by Doctors Capitan and Georges Papillault as being that of Jones. The autopsy confirmed the original listing of cause of death. The face was later compared to a bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon.|$|E
