5|$|The attic {{floor above}} the second floor, {{which is not}} open to the public, {{contains}} some garret rooms that <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> been secondary bedchambers. It is likely that in the 16th and 17th centuries {{they would have been}} occupied by the senior servants; the lower servants would have slept in any vacant corner or space on the ground or basement floors.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{left the}} Black Order because the {{previous}} story arc {{had too many}} characters and required too much effort. Hoshino was pleased with her portrayal of Allen's farewell to comrade Lenalee Lee because it indicated that the character had matured. She noted that Allen had grown taller; early in the series, he and Lenalee were the same height. Hoshino said that although Allen's departure fit the series' tragic theme, he <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> comrades. Allen and Kanda part on good terms in the previous story arc despite their frequent arguments, and Hoshino said that Kanda would assist him in the next storyline.|$|E
5|$|Naming and {{classifying}} our surroundings {{has probably}} been taking place as long as mankind {{has been able to}} communicate. It <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> been important to know the names of poisonous and edible plants and animals in order to communicate this information to other members of the family or group. Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC, indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place.|$|E
50|$|Other {{characters}} either {{miss the}} opportunity to conceal their identities or choose to stay public. For instance, the Fantastic Four, who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> difficulties concealing the Thing, have typically maintained a public appearance from the Manhattan based Baxter Building.|$|R
50|$|Wallace, again {{writing for}} Game Informer, was excited for Varric's return, noting his wild stories, {{intriguing}} past, funny banter, and wondering if, like with Hawke, Varric <b>would</b> still <b>always</b> <b>have</b> your back.|$|R
25|$|In his analysis, any {{enduring}} essential nature {{would prevent}} the process of dependent origination, {{or any kind of}} origination at all. For things <b>would</b> simply <b>always</b> <b>have</b> been, and will always continue to be, without any change.|$|R
5|$|The actual {{benefit of}} the TRIM command depends upon the free user space on the SSD. If the user {{capacity}} on the SSD was 100GB and the user actually saved 95GB of data to the drive, any TRIM operation would not add more than 5GB of free space for garbage collection and wear leveling. In those situations, {{increasing the amount of}} over-provisioning by 5GB would allow the SSD to have more consistent performance because it <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> the additional 5GB of additional free space without having to wait for the TRIM command to come from the OS.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} period, {{different}} helms {{began to be}} used for different ranks: sovereigns' and knights' helms faced forwards (affront√©), whereas those of peers and gentlemen faced to the right (dexter). In the medieval period crests <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> faced {{the same way as the}} helm, but as a result of these rules, the directions of the crest and the helm might be at variance: a knight whose crest was a lion statant, would have the lion depicted as looking over the side of the helm, rather than towards the viewer. Torses also suffered artistically, being treated not as silken circlets, but as horizontal bars.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{precautions}} against further resistance, Darius sent {{soldiers to}} seize Intaphernes, {{along with his}} son, family members, relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves. Darius believed that Intaphernes was planning a rebellion, {{but when he was}} brought to the court, there was no proof of any such plan. Nonetheless, Darius killed Intaphernes's entire family, excluding his wife's brother and son. She was asked to choose between her brother and son. She chose her brother to live. Her reasoning for doing so was that she could have another husband and another son, but she <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> but one brother. Darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother's and her son's life.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, the guard's {{position}} in the train varied. It {{could be in a}} trailer car as car 6 or 7, a steel car with no speedometer on view, or in car 4 or 5, a steel or wooden car, {{which may or may not}} have a speedometer on view. The guard <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> access to the air brakes which could stop the train.|$|R
60|$|The change once made, Peter greatly admired {{himself in}} a glass, and thought, could he have had the taste of Mr. John Moseley in his youth to direct his toilet, that the hard heart of Patty Steele <b>would</b> not <b>always</b> <b>have</b> {{continued}} so obdurate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Spare me, sir," [...] said Doubledick. [...] "She {{would never}} have heard any good of me. She {{would never have}} had any pride and joy in owning herself my mother. Love and {{compassion}} she might have <b>had,</b> and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>had,</b> I know but not--Spare me, sir! I am a broken wretch, quite at your mercy!" [...] And he turned {{his face to the}} wall, and stretched out his imploring hand.|$|R
25|$|When filming at St John's Street in December, the {{schedule}} {{had to be}} shortened from 13 to nine days because locals complained about how they <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to park cars elsewhere during the shoot.|$|E
25|$|In indoor American football, the 1988 {{proposed}} World Indoor Football League {{had intended}} to establish a perpetual power play, in which the offense <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> one man more on the field than the defense.|$|E
25|$|Arrows {{would become}} famous {{for having the}} longest losing streak in Formula One history, 382 races with no wins. However, the team <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> well-presented cars which would usually be competitive, if not front-runners, and would often give breaks to talented drivers - besides Patrese, Thierry Boutsen, Gerhard Berger, Marc Surer and Martin Donnelly would all drive for the team early in their career.|$|E
50|$|Ismail <b>would</b> <b>always</b> say he <b>had</b> {{taken his}} Bay'ah in that Vision in 1887. Yousaf named {{him as the}} first Ahmadi among the Pashtoons of the North West Frontier.|$|R
50|$|Hammer Terhune - an {{overweight}} poacher who despises Jack Tenrec {{indicating that they}} have met before but on very bad terms. He tries to kill Jack and Hannah many times but he <b>would</b> <b>always</b> fail. He <b>has</b> two brothers named Wrench and Vice.|$|R
50|$|Unlike similar {{projects}} {{to search for}} near-Earth asteroids or near-Earth objects (NEOs) such as NASA's Near-Earth Object Program, Sentinel would have orbited between Earth and the Sun. Since the Sun <b>would</b> therefore <b>always</b> <b>have</b> been behind {{the lens of the}} telescope, it would have never inhibited the telescope's ability to detect NEOs and Sentinel {{would have been able to}} perform continuous observation and analysis.|$|R
25|$|Gleason {{was raised}} by his mother. When she died in 1935 of sepsis from a large neck {{carbuncle}} (which young Jackie had tried to lance), Gleason was 19, he had nowhere to go, and he had 36 cents to his name. The family of his first girlfriend, Julie Dennehy, offered to take him in; Gleason, however, was headstrong and insisted {{that he was going}} {{into the heart of the}} city. His friend Sammy Birch made room for him in the hotel room he shared with another comedian. Birch also told him of a weeklong gig in Reading, Pennsylvania, that would pay $19, more money than Gleason could imagine. The booking agent advanced him bus fare for the trip against his salary. This was Gleason's first job as a professional comedian; henceforth, he <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> regular work in small clubs.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to receiving the DFC and DSO, Arthur was twice mentioned in despatches during the war. His official final tally of victories was ten enemy aircraft destroyed, though this {{has also been}} reported as eight confirmed kills and two [...] "probables". Reflecting later on being a fighter pilot throughout his military career, Arthur {{said that he was}} glad to have flown single-seat aircraft rather than bombers, because [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> felt very uncomfortable with anybody else for whom I'd be responsible".|$|E
500|$|Speaking in 2007, Rob Fahey of Eurogamer {{stated that}} Jumping Flash! was arguably {{one of the}} most {{important}} ancestors of any 3D platform game, as well as asserting that the game <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a part in videogaming history. Albert Kim of Entertainment Weekly stated that the game provided perhaps the most euphoric sensation of videogaming at the time and described the first-person perspective as [...] "hypnotic". Matt Thorson, the creator of the indie video game TowerFall, praised the game, saying [...] "something about the sensation of leaping through 3D space captured my childhood imagination".|$|E

60|$|Did she love John? Well, she {{was quite}} pleased to be loved by him, and she liked the {{prospect}} of being his wife. She was sure he <b>would</b> <b>always</b> let her <b>have</b> her own way, and that he had a plenty of worldly means to do it with.|$|R
500|$|In {{his third}} year, Lewis founded The McGilliad campus magazine. It {{published}} {{many of his}} anti-communist views, though the December 1930 issue included an article he wrote expressing his approval of the Russian Revolution and calling for {{a greater understanding of}} the Soviet Union; throughout his career, he would attack communism, but <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a sympathy for the 1917 revolutionaries. [...] Also at McGill, Lewis met and worked with prominent Canadian socialists like F. R. Scott, Eugene Forsey, J. King Gordon, and Frank Underhill. He would work with all of them again in the 1940s and 50s in the CCF.|$|E
500|$|Cindy {{returns in}} 2011 after Alistair dies and {{attempts}} to rekindle her romance with Darren but fails. Dawson later admitted that Darren may still be tempted by Cindy before adding that Cindy is [...] "shocked" [...] that Darren [...] "would go for anyone but her". Waring felt that the pair <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a [...] "spark between them" [...] but any romance between them ends when Cindy discovers that Darren has become a father and is engaged to Nancy. She felt that Cindy [...] "gets over it pretty quickly" [...] but Cindy [...] "has her moments with Darren" [...] as Darren is [...] "the only person who [...] lets her guard down in front of. With everyone else, a big wall comes up and she doesn't let anybody else see that vulnerable side".|$|E
500|$|The band's {{penchant for}} {{addressing}} {{political and social}} issues, {{as well as their}} staid depiction in Corbijn's black-and-white sleeve photographs, contributed to the group's earnest and serious image as [...] "stone-faced pilgrim". This image became a target for derision after the band's critically maligned Rattle and Hum project in 1988. Various critics called them [...] "po-faced", [...] "pompous bores", and [...] "humourless". The group's continued exploration of American music for the project was labelled [...] "pretentious" [...] and [...] "misguided and bombastic". After Bono told fans on the 1989 Lovetown Tour that U2 would [...] "dream it all up again", the band reinvented themselves in the 1990s. They incorporated alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music into their sound, and adopted a more ironic, flippant image by which they embraced the [...] "rock star" [...] identity they struggled with in the 1980s. Bono referred to their 1991 album Achtung Baby as [...] "the sound of four men chopping down the Joshua Tree". Author Bill Flanagan summarised the impact of The Joshua Tree on the group's career in his liner notes for the album's 20th anniversary release: [...] "The Joshua Tree made U2 into international rock stars and established both a standard they <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to live up to and an image they would forever try to live down." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1974, Howell and {{his wife}} Laurie moved to Boston. Of the trip back East Howell has said [...] "In 1974 we {{decided to leave the}} West Coast, I already had two kids with another on the way. We decided to move east to Boston. We drove cross-country. I took with me some whole bean coffee and a grinder. We stopped at the various Howard Johnson‚Äôs that were on the interstates on our way and I would go into men‚Äôs room, grind the coffee there, leaving it smelling a whole lot better than when I walked in, and then I would take out my French press on the counter, ask for hot water for 35 cents and make my French press at the Howard Johnson‚Äôs counter. And within minutes I <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> several people around me {{wondering}} what that was, and this is before I even had any clue that I would get into a coffee business.

25|$|At {{the time}} of the church's construction, West Somers was a {{thriving}} agricultural community. Burials had begun in the cemetery almost a decade earlier; most of the area's congregants attended the established Mount Zion Methodist Church some distance away. One of West Somers's more prominent residents built the church so his neighbors <b>would</b> not <b>always</b> <b>have</b> to travel so far; it was so small that circus pioneer Hachaliah Bailey, also a Somers resident, likened it to a tiger's cage.|$|R
50|$|The Bramble {{class were}} {{therefore}} designed with a sailing rig {{to supplement their}} engines. This was still widely accepted in the 1890s as a necessity for long-range warships, which <b>would</b> not <b>always</b> <b>have</b> reliable access to coaling stations. Modern ships which retained a full sailing rig in the 1890s included the Russian armoured cruiser Rurik, the six German Bussard-class light cruisers, the United States Navy's Annapolis-class gunboats, and the Royal Navy's own Condor-class and Cadmus-class sloops.|$|R
2500|$|Seacrest {{was born}} on December 24, 1974, in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Constance Marie (n√©e Zullinger), a homemaker, and Gary Lee Seacrest, a real estate lawyer.

Joes or Cowboys and Indians, Ryan <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a little {{microphone}} and do shows in the house." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1897, King Attakapas, {{the first}} Lafayette Mardi Gras king was crowned. He rode into {{town on a}} Southern Pacific train {{decorated}} {{to look like a}} royal throne and led the parade. [...] After 1897, formal Mardi Gras parades and balls seemed to come and go until 1934 when the Southwest Louisiana Mardi Gras association was formed by representatives from civic and service organizations to ensure that Lafayette <b>would</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> a Mardi Gras celebration.|$|E
