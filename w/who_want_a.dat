25|$|Despite {{his success}} with the {{national}} finances, Thiers was in a precarious political position. France was predominantly rural, religious and conservative, and the National Assembly reflected this. A majority of the Assembly members supported some form of constitutional monarchy, though they were about equally divided between those <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> King from the former Bourbon monarchy, and the Orleanists, <b>who</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> descendant of Louis-Philippe.

25|$|Fixed rate {{bonds are}} subject to {{interest}} rate risk, meaning that their market prices will decrease in value when the generally prevailing interest rates rise. Since the payments are fixed, {{a decrease in the}} market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the market price of bonds will fall, reflecting investors' ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere — perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder, so long-term investors <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> specific amount at the maturity date do not need to worry about price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from interest rate risk.|$|E
25|$|In milling, the {{incoming}} graphite products and concentrates can be ground before being classified (sized or screened), with the coarser flake size fractions (below 8 mesh, 8–20 mesh, 20–50 mesh) carefully preserved, {{and then the}} carbon contents are determined. Some standard blends can be prepared from the different fractions, each with a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. Custom blends can also be made for individual customers <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> certain flake size distribution and carbon content. If flake size is unimportant, the concentrate can be ground more freely. Typical end products include a fine powder {{for use as a}} slurry in oil drilling and coatings for foundry molds, carbon raiser in the steel industry (Synthetic graphite powder and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser). Environmental impacts from graphite mills consist of air pollution including fine particulate exposure of workers and also soil contamination from powder spillages leading to heavy metal contamination of soil.|$|E

The curricula do not include any classical high school discipline or a traditional examination process. These diplomas are awarded based on vaguely construed life experience. Some critics alleged this policy was an effort to make up the poor national statistical indicators on education, with little impact {{on the quality of the}} work force's qualification of Portugal in the European Union context.|$|E
25|$|The {{first years}} of {{parliamentary}} democracy proved to be very unstable for Indonesia.

500|$|Theologian of new {{religious}} movements George D. Chryssides {{described the}} Raëlian Church {{as being in}} an [...] "early developmental stage" [...] and that their beliefs distance it from a [...] "dominant intellectual climate". Raëlism claims that all life on Earth, humans included, was created scientifically by Elohim, members of an extraterrestrial race who appeared similar to small humans and so were often depicted as angels, cherubs, or gods. Raëlians, who are not monotheists, believe the correct historical {{meaning of the word}} Elohim is the plural sense, [...] "those who came from the sky".

While he found the medley on side two to be their [...] "most impressive music" [...] since Rubber Soul, Nik Cohn of The New York Times said that, [...] "individually", the album's songs are [...] "nothing special". Albert Goldman of Life magazine wrote that Abbey Road [...] "is not one of the Beatles' great albums" [...] and, despite some [...] "lovely" [...] phrases and [...] "stirring" [...] segues, side two's suite [...] "seems symbolic of the Beatles' latest phase, which might be described as the round-the-clock production of disposable music effects".|$|E
