These caftans, usually sewn from light gray or white <b>woolen</b> <b>cloth,</b> were later replaced by coats. Shirts, resembling a tunic, were sewn from white linen cloth and were not usually decorated. The most ormamental detail of men's garments were the decorative patterned sashes they wore around their waists. Men also wore high boots and hats with straight brims that were decorated with feathers and flowers.|$|E

25|$|A {{coat with}} a wide collar called a frock coat, derived from a {{traditional}} working-class coat, was worn for hunting and other country pursuits in both Britain and America. Although originally designed as sporting wear, frock coats gradually came into fashion as everyday wear. The frock coat was cut with a turned down collar, reduced side pleats, and small, round cuffs, sometimes cut with a slit to allow for added movement. Sober, natural colors were worn, and coats were made from <b>woolen</b> <b>cloth,</b> or a wool and silk mix.|$|E

The nap was raised by water driven drums of teasels and {{it is thought that}} Knapp Mill, on the Avon, played a part in the production. Knapp Mill, mentioned in the Domesday book, was originally a corn mill which was converted for fulling. In 1760 it burnt down and was rebuilt as a corn mill once more. In 1895 ownership passed to the West Hants Water Company who again rebuilt it. It is now the pumping station.|$|E
25|$|Some historians {{mention that}} the trade deficit of Portugal in {{relation}} to England while the Methuen Treaty was in force has also contributed to redirect much of the gold mined in Brazil during the 18th century to Britain. The Methuen Treaty was a trade treaty signed between England and Portugal, by where all <b>woolen</b> <b>cloth</b> imported from Britain would be tax free in Portugal, whereas Portuguese wine exported to Britain would be taxed at {{a third of the}} previous import tax on wines. Port wine became increasingly popular in Britain at that time, but cloth amounted to a larger share of the trade value than wines, hence Portugal eventually incurred in trade deficit with England.|$|E

Bishop Juan de Palafox asserted the income from the diocese of Puebla as being twice that of the archbishopic of Mexico, due to the tithe income derived from agriculture. In its first hundred years, Puebla was prosperous from wheat farming and other agriculture, as the ample tithe income indicates, plus manufacturing <b>woolen</b> <b>cloth</b> for the domestic market. Merchants, manufacturers, and artisans were important to the city's economic fortunes, but its early prosperity was followed by stagnation and decline in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.|$|E
25|$|Since the 17th century, British wine merchants {{had been}} {{consolidating}} their {{power over the}} Portuguese wine trade—particularly in the Douro region, which produced the style of wine that included some addition of brandy, which was becoming popular in the London market. The 1703 Methuen Treaty between England and Portugal had both direct and indirect effects on the Portuguese wine industry. The treaty not only stipulated {{that the amount of}} duties on Portuguese wines was to never be more than two-thirds that of which was levied on French wines, it also allowed English <b>woolen</b> <b>cloth</b> to be admitted into Portugal free of duty. This second stipulation ended up having a devastating effect on the Portuguese textile industry, leading to huge numbers of shepherds and weavers becoming unemployed. In and around the Douro region, this segment of labor turned to the wine industry and encouraged a boom in vineyard planting. Over the next few decades the resulting grape surplus, coupled with some unscrupulous examples of wine fraud and adulteration, led to a general decline in Port quality and a depression in prices.|$|E
25|$|A {{factor was}} {{dispatched}} to Venice {{to seek out}} investment opportunities. He did well and on March 25, 1402, the third branch of the Medici bank was opened. It suffered from some initial mismanagement (by the factor who had previously done so wellhe made the fatal mistake of violating the partnership agreement and loaning money to Germans; on a more humane note, he would eventually become a pauper and be sent 20 florins by Giovanni, who felt that a past partner deserved some charity), but soon was prospering. It was this branch that established the practice of having a general manager's remuneration be paid through shares in the branch that he purchased with his investment. Also in 1402, the first Medici factory was established {{for the production of}} <b>woolen</b> <b>cloth,</b> and then another in 1408. By this point, the Rome branch had established a branch in Naples (closed in 1425 and was replaced with one in Geneva) and Gaeta. It may seem that the Medici bank was flourishing and rapidly expanding its assets across Italy, but nevertheless there were perhaps only 17 employees in total of the bank in 1402, with only five at the central bank in Florence, although they were reasonably well-paid and promotions seem to have been rapid when warranted (such {{as in the case of}} Giuliano di Giovanni di ser Matteo, who went from being a clerk in 1401 to a junior partner in 1408).|$|E

40|$|Suppose {{the nominal}} money supply {{could be cut}} {{literally}} overnight by, say, %. What would happen to prices, wages, output? The answer {{can be found in}} s France, where just such an experiment was carried out, repeatedly. Prices adjusted instantaneously and fully on one market only, that for foreign exchange. Prices on other markets (such as commodities) as well as prices of manufactured goods and industrial wages fell slowly, over many months, and not by the full amount of the nominal reduction.

Mr. Mompesson lived many more years, was offered the Deanery of Lincoln, but did not accept it, and died in 1708. So virulent was the contagion that, ninety-one years after, in 1757, when five laboring men, who were digging up land near the plague- graves for a potato-garden, came upon what appeared to be some linen, though they buried it again directly, they all sickened with typhus fever, three of them died, and it was so infectious that no less than seventy persons in the parish were carried off.|$|R

[...] Both woad and indigo {{have been used}} since ancient times in {{combination}} with yellow dyes to produce shades of green. [...] Medieval and Early Modern England was especially known for its green dyes. [...] The dyers of Lincoln, a great cloth town in the high Middle Ages, produced the Lincoln green cloth associated with Robin Hood by dyeing wool with woad and then overdyeing it yellow with weld or dyer's greenweed (Genista tinctoria), also known as dyer's broom. [...] <b>Woolen</b> <b>cloth</b> mordanted with alum and dyed yellow with dyer's greenweed was overdyed with woad and, later, indigo, to produce the once-famous Kendal green.

For a long march there could be no doubt that these bandages--wound round the foot instead of stockings--are very preferable, as they obviate the liability to foot sores. Even with well-made boots all pedestrians may, at times, suffer from sore feet; but the liability is immensely increased when--as in the case of the British soldier--the boots are coarse, roughly sewn, and frequently ill fitted.|$|E
6000|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} explained that the conditions called.

Even if <b>woolen</b> <b>cloth</b> could be made cheaper in England than in [...] the United States, we know that neither capital nor labor would [...] easily leave the United States for England, although it might go [...] from Rhode Island to Massachusetts under similar inducements. If [...] shoes {{can be made with}} less advantage in Providence than in Lynn, [...] the shoe industry will come to Lynn; but it does not follow that [...] the English shoe industry would come to Lynn, even if the [...] advantages of the latter were greater than those in England. If [...] there be no obstacle to the free movement of labor and capital [...] between places or occupations, and if some place or occupation can [...] produce at a less cost than another place or occupation, then [...] there will be a migration of the instruments of production. Since [...] there is no free movement of labor and capital between one country [...] and another, then two countries stand in the same relation as that [...] of two “non-competing groups” within the same country, as before [...] explained. When this fact is once fully grasped, the subject of [...] international values becomes very simple.
