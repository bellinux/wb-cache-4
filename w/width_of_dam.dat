40|$|A {{study of}} the effects of dam-foundation {{interaction}} on the response of earth, rockfill and concrete-faced rockfill dams to obliquely incident P, SV and Rayleigh waves is presented. Emphasis is placed on the effects of the foundation flexibility, the spatial variability of the ground motion and the material nonlinearity. The study is based on a rigorous hybrid numerical formulation that combines the efficiency and versatility of the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the ability of Boundary Element Method (BEM) to account for the radiation conditions at the far field. The developed hybrid method is very powerful, and can be used efficiently to obtain accurate solutions of problems of complex geometry, material heterogeneity and, for time-domain analysis, material nonlinearity. The 2 -D frequency-domain formulation is used at first to investigate the linear response of earth and rockfill dams to incident P, SV and Rayleigh waves and the response <b>of</b> concrete-faced rockfill <b>dams</b> to incident Rayleigh waves. Furthermore, the nonlinear time-domain coupled BE-FE formulation is used to investigate the response of earth and rockfill dams to vertically incident SV waves. By accounting rigorously for the energy radiated back into the halfspace, the study demonstrates the dramatic effect of the flexibility of the foundation rock in reducing the overall response <b>of</b> the <b>dam.</b> The effects <b>of</b> the spatial variability of the ground motion across the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> are also shown to be important, but less dramatic than those of the foundation flexibility.

The lake was built for water supply, flood control, and recreation purposes. Figures given herein represent total contents. Data regarding the dam and lake are given in the following table (USGS data): ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{hydraulic}} analysis published in 2016 confirms what {{had long been}} suspected, that the changes made to the dam by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club severely reduced the ability <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> to withstand major storms. [...] Lowering the dam {{by as much as}} 0.9 meter (3ft) and failing to replace the discharge pipes at the base <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> cut in half the safe discharge capacity <b>of</b> the <b>dam.</b> [...] This fatal lowering <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> greatly reduced the capacity of the main spillway and virtually eliminated the action of an emergency spillway on the western abutment. [...] Walter Frank first documented the presence of that emergency spillway in a 1988 ASCE publication. [...] The existence of the emergency spillway is supported by topographic data from 1889 which shows the western abutment to be about one foot lower than the crest <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> remnants, even after the dam had previously been lowered as much as 3 feet by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. [...] Adding the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the emergency spillway to that of the main spillway yields the total <b>width</b> <b>of</b> spillway (wasteway) capacity that had been specified in the 1847 design of William Morris, a State Engineer. Lowering the top <b>of</b> the <b>dam</b> by the Club eliminated nearly all of the capacity of the emergency spillway and greatly reduced the discharge capacity of the main spillway on the eastern side. [...] The dam was now vulnerable to large storm events and was unable to survive the May 1889 storm.|$|R
