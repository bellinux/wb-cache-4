At Tampa Stadium in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record {{set by the}} Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert and grossing $309,000. Three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (The Song Remains the Same) was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's performance, $180,000 of the band's money from gate receipts <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Murray Hill Publishing sued 20th Century Fox for $150,000, {{claiming}} that {{the idea for the}} film <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> screenplay they had purchased from high school teacher Brian Webster entitled Could This Be Christmas?. They said the script had 36 similarities with Jingle All the Way, including the plot, dialogue and character names. Murray Hill President Bob Laurel bought the script from Webster in 1993, and sent it to Fox and other studios in 1994 but received no response and claimed the idea was copied by Kornfield, who was Fox's script reader. In 2001, Fox were found guilty of stealing the idea and ordered to pay $19 million ($15 million in damages and $4 million in legal costs) to Murray Hill, with Webster to receive a portion. Laurel died {{a few months after the}} verdict, before receiving any of the money. On appeal, the damages figure was lowered to $1.5 million, before the verdict itself was quashed in 2004 after a judge decided the idea was not stolen, as Fox had bought Kornfield's screenplay before he or anybody else at Fox had read Could This Be Christmas?.|$|E

25|$|These {{first three}} (and {{subsequently}} more) Russian language imprints were published and circulated in the Russian Empire during the 1903–6 period {{as a tool}} for scapegoating Jews, blamed by the monarchists for the defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and the Revolution of 1905. Common to all three texts is the idea that Jews aim for world domination. Since The Protocols are presented as merely a document, the front matter and back matter are needed to explain its alleged origin. The diverse imprints, however, are mutually inconsistent. The general claim is that the document <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> secret Jewish organization. Since the alleged original stolen manuscript does not exist, one is forced to restore a purported original edition. This has been done by the Italian scholar, Cesare G. De Michelis in 1998, in a work which was translated into English and published in 2004, where he treats his subject as Apocrypha.|$|E
25|$|Lagos Analysis Corp., {{also called}} Lancor, a Lagos, US-based Nigerian-owned company, sued OLPC {{in the end}} of 2007 for $20 million, {{claiming}} that the computer's keyboard design <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Lancor patented device. OLPC responded by claiming that they had not sold any multi-lingual keyboards in the design claimed by Lancor, and that Lancor had misrepresented and concealed material facts before the court. In January 2008, the Nigerian Federal Court rejected OLPC motion to dismiss LANCOR's lawsuit and extended its injunction against OLPC distributing its XO Laptops in Nigeria. OLPC appealed the Court's decision, the Appeal is still pending in the Nigerian Federal Court of Appeals. In March 2008, OLPC filed a lawsuit in Massachusetts to stop LANCOR from suing it in the United States. In October 2008, MIT News magazine erroneously reported that the Middlesex Superior Court granted OLPC’s motions to dismiss all of LANCOR’s claims against OLPC, Nicholas Negroponte, and Quanta. On October 22, 2010 OLPC voluntarily moved the Massachusetts Court to dismiss its own lawsuit against LANCOR.|$|E
25|$|The {{volunteer}} {{election monitoring}} group Oy ve Ötesi {{claimed that the}} AKP had been recorded an extra 17,880 votes, the MHP 3,666 votes, the HDP 1,091 votes and the CHP 181 votes. The group also claimed that 6,018 votes for the Felicity Party (SP) had been unrecorded. In Muş, violence broke out after several HDP activists alleged that votes had been stolen in the province, with the police firing on the activists with tear gas. The President of the Sakarya Bars Association, Zafer Kazan, claimed on Twitter that two bags of votes had been stolen in Sakarya, with false results being recorded using forged signatures. After their seats in Kocaeli fell from two to one, the MHP demanded a re-count, with some activists claiming that election fraud {{had taken place in}} the province. A stamp, used to vote on ballot papers, <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> polling station in Esenyurt, İstanbul, which could have potentially allowed the culprits to vote more than once on fake ballot papers. In Adıyaman, an individual who was filmed walking out of a polling station with a bag full of votes claimed {{that he was going to}} Mosque, but was violently apprehended by many voters who had arrived on the scene. The police later escorted the individual out of the hostile crowd. The CHP raised concern over the lack of up-to-date voter records, having identified 2,860 non-existent voters on the electoral rall in the İstanbul district of Kadıköy alone.|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, {{the mass}} media renewed long-dormant public {{attention}} to the 1955 theft of an even more spectacular Jenny specimen.

[...] The top right stamp from this block has never been found; the two left stamps surfaced in the 1970s as single copies offered in auction catalogues and were recovered by the FBI, although they had been camouflaged by minor mutilation: the portions of the right-edge perforations on which parts of the guide line were originally visible had been trimmed off or abraded to remove the red ink. [...] Mrs. McCoy’s will had made the American Philatelic Research Library the legal owner of all four stamps in the block. [...] In 2014 Donald Sundman of the Mystic Stamp Company offered $100,000 in reward money—$50,000 for the two stamps that were still missing—to anyone who could bring them to their rightful owner.

6000|$|... 'The {{stolen goods}} that {{were brought to}} the public-house by the Warehouse Porters, were always {{disposed}} of in a back parlour. For a long time, I never could get into this parlour, or see what was done there. As I sat smoking my pipe, like an innocent young chap, by the tap-room fire, I'd hear some of the parties to the robbery, as they came in and out, say softly to the landlord, [...] "Who's that? What does HE do here?" [...] "Bless your soul," [...] says the landlord, [...] "he's only a" [...] - ha, ha, ha! - [...] "he's only a green young fellow from the country, as is looking for a butcher's sitiwation. Don't mind HIM!" [...] So, in course of time, they were so convinced of my being green, and got to be so accustomed to me, that I was as free of the parlour as any of 'em, and I have seen as much as Seventy Pounds' Worth of fine lawn sold there, in one night, that <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> warehouse in Friday Street. After the sale the buyers always stood treat - hot supper, or dinner, or what not - and they'd say on those occasions, [...] "Come on, Butcher! Put your best leg foremost, young 'un, and walk into it!" [...] Which I used to do - and hear, at table, all manner of particulars that it was very important for us Detectives to know.|$|E

[...] It was not till a fat {{person in a}} black dressing-gown began to squeal demands for horrible stuff called [...] "a bottle of wine" [...] that I began to understand {{the glory of the}} situation. I was seeing Life. [...] "Life" [...] is a great thing. It consists in swigging sweet champagne that <b>was</b> <b>stolen</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> steward of the P. and O., and exchanging bad words with pale-faced baggages who laugh demnibly without effort and without emotion. The argot of the real [...] "chippy" [...] (this means man of the world--Anglice, a half-drunk youth with his hat {{on the back of his}} head) is not easy to come at. It requires an apprenticeship in America. I stood appalled at the depth and richness of the American language, of which I was privileged to hear a special dialect. There were girls who had been to Leadville and Denver and the wilds of the wilder West, who had acted in minor companies, and who had generally misconducted themselves in a hundred weary ways. They chattered like daws and shovelled down the sickly liquor that made the rooms reek. As long as they talked sensibly things were amusing, but a sufficiency of liquor made the mask drop, and verily they swore by all their gods, chief of whom is Obidicut. Very many men have heard a white woman swear, but some few, and among these I have been, are denied the experience. It is quite a revelation; and if nobody tilts you backwards out of your chair, you can reflect on heaps of things connected with it. So they cursed and they drank and they told tales, sitting in a circle, till I felt that this was really Life and a thing to be quitted if I wished to like it. The young man who knew a thing or two, and gave the girls leave to sell him if they could, was there of course, and the hussies sold him as he stood for all he considered himself worth; and I saw the by-play. Surely the safest way to be fooled is to know everything. Then there was an interlude and some more shrieks and howls, which the generous public took as indicating immense mirth and enjoyment of Life; and I came to yet another establishment, where the landlady lacked the half of her left lung, as a cough betrayed, but was none the less amusing in a dreary way, until she also dropped the mask and the playful jesting began. All the jokes I had heard before at the other place. It is a poor sort of Life that cannot spring one new jest a day. More than ever did the youth cock his hat and explain that he was a real [...] "chippy," [...] and that there were no flies on him. Any one without a cast-iron head would be [...] "real chippy" [...] next morning after one glass of that sirupy champagne. I understand now why men feel insulted when sweet fizz is offered to them. The second interview closed as the landlady gracefully coughed us into the passage, and so into the healthy, silent streets. She was very ill indeed, and announced that she had but four months more to live.|$|E
