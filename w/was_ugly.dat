It was screened in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, receiving a standing ovation. The film's theatrical release was halted {{for over a year}} regarding censorship issues over depiction of smoking in it. Though it was released on 26 December 2014 to generally positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|Around 1500, the {{innovation}} of the angled bastion {{was developed in}} Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as trace italienne. The elite responsible for castle construction {{had to choose between}} the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first <b>was</b> <b>ugly</b> and uncomfortable and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, not least of which is that many castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, {{it has been estimated that}} between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} American culture codify racism. For example, the {{prevailing}} idea in American culture, perpetuated by the media, {{has been that}} black features are less attractive or desirable than white features. The idea that blackness <b>was</b> <b>ugly</b> was highly damaging to the psyche of African Americans, manifesting itself as internalized racism. The Black is beautiful cultural movement sought to dispel this notion.|$|E

25|$|Another {{tradition}} of European masks developed, more self-consciously, from court and civic events, or entertainments managed by guilds and co-fraternities. These {{grew out of}} the earlier revels and had become evident by the 15th century in places like Rome, and Venice, where they developed as entertainments to enliven towns and cities. Thus the Maundy Thursday carnival in St Marks Square in Venice, attended by the Doge and aristocracy also involved the guilds, including a guild of maskmakers. There is evidence of 'commedia dell'arte' inspired Venetian masks and by the late 16th century the Venetian Carnival began to reach its peak and eventually lasted a whole 'season' from January until Lent. By the 18th century, it was already a tourist attraction, Goethe saying that he <b>was</b> <b>ugly</b> enough not to need a mask. The carnival was repressed during the Napoleonic Republic, although in the 1980s its costumes and the masks aping the C 18th heyday were revived. It appears other cities in central Europe were influenced by the Venetian model.|$|E

He said, [...] "I {{feel that it is}} now necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed. It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band, and from my perspective, has undermined our artistic and political ideal." [...] "There was so much squabbling over everything", explained Morello, [...] "and I mean everything. We would even have fist fights over whether our T-shirts should be mauve or camouflaged! It was ridiculous. We were patently political, internally combustible. It <b>was</b> <b>ugly</b> for a long time".|$|E

500|$|With {{aggregated}} {{scores of}} 57percent and 54 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively, Battle for Naboos PC port garnered significantly lower review scores than its Nintendo 64 counterpart. Many {{complaints about the}} PC version stemmed {{from the fact that}} the game was not optimized for the PC when it was ported. Computer Games Magazines Adam Fleet thought the game <b>was</b> <b>ugly,</b> citing [...] "truly bland textures and sad-looking 2D sprites". Next Generations Jim Preston bluntly wrote that the [...] "graphics suck." [...] Of the audio, GameSpot's Giancarlo Varanini wrote, [...] " [...] isn't that bad, but it isn't quite as good as the audio in other similar games", and goes on to describe the music as sounding [...] "tinny." [...] Varanini also took issue with the PC version's aiming controls, stating that because Battle for Naboo was originally designed for the Nintendo 64's analog controller, it is difficult to aim using a PC's digital keyboard. Preston agreed, writing that controlling the game is [...] "nearly impossible" [...] with a digital controller or mouse.|$|E

Lucky struggled {{to come to terms}} with the revelation while Luke and Laura dealt with the unresolved issues surrounding the rape. In a 2000 interview with Soap Opera Digest, Geary said, for the taping of the scenes, [...] "Alan Pultz, who had directed the rape originally, used his original notes and directed me that day to recall all of that. I was able to finally put out what I think is Luke's definitive statement: that it was rape, it <b>was</b> <b>ugly,</b> he'd probably never recover." [...] He added, [...] "I was grateful that the directors and the writers were interested in what Luke's experience was and didn't try to spin it for audience control." ...|$|E

2500|$|The two came {{face-to-face}} in four pulsating {{games in}} the season finale, and the fixtures were hyped as the definitive games as to {{which of the two}} was the better player. In {{the first game of the}} series on 16 April 2011, Messi scored a 51st-minute penalty to give Barcelona the lead until the 82nd minute, when Ronaldo scored a penalty of his own to give Real Madrid a share of the points. In the second game, the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, Ronaldo scored the only goal of the game in extra time to give Real Madrid a 1–0 win, and the club's first trophy under manager José Mourinho. The third game was the first leg of the Champions League semi-final. The match <b>was</b> <b>ugly</b> and ill-tempered, with Madrid's Pepe and Barcelona's José Manuel Pinto both sent off, before Messi provided two moments of magic, including one described as [...] "one of the best goals in Champions League history", to give Barcelona a two-goal lead in the tie. Following the game, Messi was praised as both the current best in the world and amongst the greatest players of all time. Of the seven goals scored in the four games, Messi scored three and Ronaldo scored two.|$|E
