2500|$|<b>Wipers</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers</b> (single speed {{intermittent}} wipers for 1965–1966, 2-speed from 1967) ...|$|R
25|$|The low {{belt line}} and window design afforded the driver with {{outstanding}} visibility. The Pacer had {{laminated safety glass}} in the windshield. The articulated front wipers were hidden when in their parked position, <b>and</b> a rear <b>wiper</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer</b> was optional.|$|R

25|$|For 1961 the Rambler American for Mexico was {{available}} {{as the new}} second generation of the line, growing from three to four body styles {{with the introduction of}} the four-door station wagon. <b>Wipers</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers</b> changed to electric units, an Motorola AM radio with antenna as well as twin-circuit brakes became standard. The line continued with minor changes in 1962 and 1963, which were mostly cosmetic.|$|R
50|$|A WoF test checks tyre condition, brake condition, {{structural}} condition, lights, glazing, windscreen <b>wipers</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers,</b> doors, seat belts, airbags (if fitted), speedometer, {{steering and}} suspension, exhaust, and fuel system. A vehicle must meet certain criteria {{in each category}} to pass the Warrant of Fitness. Many local car repair garages throughout New Zealand are authorised to perform testing and to issue Warrants of Fitness.|$|R
50|$|The US {{cars were}} fitted with four fixed round exposed lamps. Buyers outside North America could also opt for {{headlight}} <b>wipers</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers</b> and/or headlights {{with a special}} vacuum-operated linkage whose aim could be adjusted at the dash depending on vehicle load. Separate glass windshields for headlights were illegal in the USA after 1967, {{which is why the}} DS did not get them on USA cars when it was restyled for 1968, and the VW Beetle and Vanagon/Kombi and Jaguar E-Type lost their headlight glass windshields at the same time.|$|R
2500|$|The 1981 {{model year}} AMC Spirits {{received}} a new crosshatch grille {{with a single}} crosshair element. New optional [...] "Noryl" [...] wheelcovers were added. The leather-clad Limited models were canceled, leaving the DL as the top-rung model. The liftback still featured a GT package, available on both base and DL trims, with both engines. New options included power windows, rear window <b>wiper</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer,</b> power antenna, as well as tricolored [...] "rally" [...] stripes. The AMX version did not return for 1981. The optional three-speed automatic now included a lockup torque converter, and radial tires were standard fitment across the lineup.|$|R
50|$|Kautex Textron is a {{supplier}} to the automotive industry. The company produces plastic fuel systems, {{selective catalytic reduction}} <b>systems,</b> windshield <b>and</b> headlamp <b>washer</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>and</b> other products.|$|R
50|$|The 6.9 lacked {{expected}} luxury touches such as power-adjustable outside mirrors or front seats, {{although a}} unique power rear seat, heated seats and even orthopedically designed front seats were options. Buyers outside North America could also opt for headlight <b>wipers</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers</b> and/or headlights {{with a special}} vacuum-operated linkage whose aim could be adjusted at the dash depending on vehicle load. There was also a new standard feature in 1976: most Mercedes-Benz automobiles that year were equipped with a sophisticated electronic climate control system developed for Chrysler Corporation for use in their top models. The system turned on the heater, air conditioner or both, depending on the thermostat's setting and ambient temperature, automatically maintaining whatever temperature the driver selected. The compressor was an American import as well, supplied by the Harrison division of General Motors.|$|R
25|$|The list {{of items}} tested has been {{continually}} expanded over the years, including in 1968 – a tyre check; 1977 – checks of windscreen <b>wipers</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers,</b> direction indicators, brakelights, horns, exhaust system and condition of the body structure and chassis; 1991 – checks of the emissions test for petrol engine vehicles, together with checks on the anti-lock braking system, rear wheel bearings, rear wheel steering (where appropriate) and rear seat belts; 1992 – a stricter tyre tread depth requirement for most vehicles; 1994 – a check of emissions for diesel engine vehicles; 2005 – introduction of a computerised administration system for issuing non-secure test certificates. Also rolled out in 2005 {{was the creation of}} the 'Automated Test Bay' this differs from traditional testing by adding additional equipment to the bay to negate the use of an assistant during the test; 2012 – checks of secondary restraint systems, battery and wiring, ESC, speedometers and steering locks.|$|R
50|$|Starting in the 1986 model year, the Grand Wagoneer {{received}} a new four part front grille and a stand-up hood ornament. An updated audio system became a standard feature and a power sunroof installed by American Sunroof Corporation, became a factory option. However, {{the most significant}} change was the installation of a fully revamped interior including a new dashpad, new instrumentation, new door panel design, shorter nap cut-pile carpeting, new leather seat cover designs and front seats that now featured adjustable headrests. Changes {{were made to the}} instrument panel that now featured square gauges, featured woodgrain overlays and contained an improved climate control system. A new two spoke steering wheel also included new stalks for the lights <b>and</b> <b>wiper</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer</b> controls on the column. The Select-Trac driveline gained a new Trac-Lok limited slip differential to send power to the wheel with the best traction. There were 17,254 Grand Wagoneers built in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|The Chevette {{itself was}} {{initially}} available {{only as a}} two-door hatchback with a 1.4 L OHV or 1.6 L OHC gasoline inline-four engine. Engines produced from [...] (subsequently [...] ), driving the rear wheels. A four-speed manual transmission was standard while a three-speed automatic transmission was optional. Other features included rack-and-pinion steering, front disc brakes, front stabilizer bar, 13-inch tires, tri-color taillights, front bucket seats, an onboard diagnostic system, extensive acoustic insulation, a single steering-column-mounted stalk (integrating controls for signal indicators, <b>wipers</b> <b>and</b> windshield <b>washers)</b> <b>and</b> optional swing-out rear quarter windows.|$|R
50|$|When {{a vehicle}} fails the MOT test {{it can be}} re-tested within the end of 10 working days to gain a pass. There may be a charge payable. If the vehicle remains at the test station for repair after failure then it can have a free partial re-test within 10 working days after the {{original}} test has been carried out. If it {{is removed from the}} premises for repair and then returned before the end of 10 working days it can have a retest at half the original fee paid. If the failed vehicle is taken away but then brought back to the same test station and retested {{before the end of the}} next working day on one or more of the following items only then no fee is charged for a retest: Bonnet, horn, sharp edges, boot lid, lamps, steering wheel, brake pedal anti-slip, loading door, tailboard, direction indicators, mirrors, tailgate, doors rear reflectors, VIN, drop sides, registration plates, windscreen and glass, fuel filler cap, seat belts, <b>wipers</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers,</b> hazard warning, seats, wheels and tyres.|$|R
5000|$|After {{giving the}} Lerma the correct {{appearance}} for a luxury car -at {{least for the}} preferences of the Mexican buyer- and correcting the error of the limited trunk space, VAM proceeded {{to solve the problem}} of the price. The company achieved a solution by creating two different trim levels for the model, the lower-priced intermediate [...] "Lerma 610" [...] and the upscale top-of-the-line [...] "Lerma 620". Despite their focus and advertisement, both versions were almost the same, the differences between each were limited to only five different standard accessories. The Lerma 610 was equipped with two-speed electric wipers, round dome light, heater with windshield defroster, plain passenger's side sun visor and a plain rear hatch glass. The Lerma 620 incorporated intermittent wipers, reading dome light, air conditioning, vanity mirror on passenger's side sun visor <b>and</b> rear <b>wiper</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer.</b> All five additional accessories of the 620 models could be ordered separately in the 610 models. Cosmetically and mechanically, both the 610 and 620 Lerma were equal with the only exception of the visually noticeable presence of the rear wiper.|$|R
5000|$|... 2010 to date. The third {{generation}} Swift has been launched by Pak Suzuki in 2010 after being retired {{in all other}} countries. It uses the same M13A engine which liana has. The Pak Suzuki Motors version of the Swift is {{a variant of the}} international 2004-2010 Suzuki Swift 1.3 but with much lesser features. The Pakistani model lacks airbags, luggage area light, force limiters, UV glass, <b>and</b> rear view <b>wiper</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer</b> which was standard in the international version when it was being sold from 2004-2010. The Swift is available in three trims: the DX (no alloy rims, different grill, no fog lamps, and no matching color side view mirrors), the DLX (with alloy rims, different grill, fog lamps, matching side view mirrors, and two options for navigation systems), and the Automatic (with all the features and options of the DLX, however with an automatic gearbox). The {{third generation}} swift has been discontinued in all other countries and Pakistan is the only country where it is still being produced.|$|R
5000|$|The Charger was now {{marketed as}} the Chrysler Charger {{rather than as}} the Chrysler Valiant Charger [...] with Chrysler script badging having {{replaced}} Valiant badging front and rear. Some further changes with the VK model included 'white-out' grille treatment, revised rear light clusters, and revised 'C' pillar ornamentation utilising extended fibreglass panels in black, incorporating XL or 770 badge identification. Inside, <b>wiper</b> <b>and</b> windscreen <b>washer</b> controls were now integrated into the indicator stalk and there were also some trim revisions that included bold Boca-Raton cloth seat inserts for the Charger 770.|$|R
2500|$|Standard {{convenience}} equipment {{included a}} two-tone padded dashboard with a three-pod instrument cluster, electric windshield <b>wipers</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers,</b> a 200km/h speedometer, side marker lights, four-way hazard lights, antitheft steering column locking mechanism, base steering wheel, brake system warning light, AM radio {{with a single}} in-dash speaker, front ashtray, cigarette lighter, locking glove box with [...] "RAMBLER" [...] emblem on the door, padded sunvisors, day/night rearview mirror, cardboard-type sound-absorbing and heat-isolating headliner, round dome light, dual coat hooks, flip-open rear side vents, full carpeting, driver's side rubber floor mat sewed to the carpet, front bench seat with split folding backs on two-door sedan or with a fixed back on the four-door, bench rear seat, two-point front seatbelts, dual rear ashtrays, front and rear side armrests, vinyl-cloth upholstery on seats and side door panels, aluminum grille, backup lights, steel wheels with center hubcaps, dual [...] "232 SIX" [...] rear quarter panel emblems, dual [...] "bulleye" [...] emblems on the lower corner of the rear side vents, script [...] "American" [...] emblems on both front fenders, capital-lettered [...] "RAMBLER" [...] rectangular emblem between the right taillight and the gas filler, non-locking gas cap, manual driver's side remote mirror, and radio antenna.|$|R
50|$|The Auto Moto is a three-wheel scooter {{powered by}} a 150cc single {{cylinder}} 4 stroke engine with an automatic CVT transmission and positraction rear wheels. It incorporates a rocker system that allows the cab to rock {{from side to side}} while carving through turns, all the while keeping its two back wheels and engine firmly planted on the ground. The Auto Moto gets a claimed 83 mpg, making it more fuel-efficient than most hybrid cars on the market. The Auto Moto features an FM radio player with MP3 connection that plays music through its integrated stereo system. Other standard features included on The Auto Moto are a built in 72 liter trunk, 2 dashboard storage compartments on 2010 models and some 2011 models, an ABS braking system for the front disc brake, rear disc brakes on 2011 models(drum brakes on 2010 models), a cell phone call recognition system, seating for two, an alarm system, and a full windshield with windshield <b>wiper</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer</b> fluid. Being that The Auto Moto has three wheels, some states only require the use of a regular car driver license to operate it.|$|R
2500|$|The Rally GT and the Rally SST did not {{disappear}} completely this year; {{this can be}} described that they were downgraded from being trim levels to optional packages that were offered by several VAM dealerships. A Rally SST equivalent was created including most of the still available optional items including automatic transmission, air conditioning, rear <b>wiper</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer,</b> reading dome light, intermittent wipers, lighted vanity mirror on passenger's side sunvisor, and built-in side armrest safety reflectors. The only option that were virtually separate at all times were the new tape player, electric antenna and mirror controls. This set of components was called [...] "paquete de lujo" [...] by VAM's dealerships and the units carrying it had no particular name or designation. On {{the other side of}} the coin, there was a second optional package for Rally AMXs with manual transmission that included all mechanical components of the Rally GT 4.6 / X engine (302 degree camshaft, headers, Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor, counterweight-modified high-acceleration Prestolite electronic distributor and 3.31:1 rear gears) except for the ported head. Unlike the luxury package, units equipped with the performance one did get a special name that was either Rally ZX or Rally TX, depending on the dealership that sold the unit.|$|R
5000|$|A move {{orchestrated by}} the Mexican {{government}} {{that in the}} end turned out to be equivocated took its toll on the Lerma as a luxury model and also on all of its competitors. Luxury automotive accessories were mostly among the percentage of imported automotive components by all of the Mexican auto industry. In an effort to reduce importation, the government banned the acquisition of luxury automotive accessories in an effort to have them produced or sourced locally. This meant an inevitable reduction in the lists of both standard and optional equipment. In the first, the Lerma lost the Quartz digital clock, the rear defroster and the [...] "Noryl" [...] wheelcovers. The extra-charge equipment list no longer offered power door locks, power windows, power seats, power trunk release and tilt steering column. Items that were standard in 1981 and survived became optional in 1982 {{in the form of the}} remote-controlled exterior mirrors. The full list of optional equipment for the 1982 VAM Lerma 620 consisted of electric antenna, tape player AM FM stereo radio, remote controlled mirrors, headers and sports steel wheels. The new aluminum wheels for 1982 were practically a replacement of the previous year's wheelcovers while the new-for-the rear <b>wiper</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer</b> took the place of the rear defroster.|$|R
5000|$|The 1963 Rambler Classics were {{available}} only in two- and four-door sedan body designs, both called Rambler Classic 660. No other trim levels or versions {{were available}}. The standard engine and transmission combination was the OHV 195.6 CID L I6 engine with a single barrel carburetor producing [...] at 4200 rpm with a 8.7:1 compression ratio and coupled to a three-speed manual transmission with column-mounted shifter. The [...] two-barrel version of the 195.6 six was also available at extra cost. Standard equipment for all included built-in flow-through ventilation, four wheel drum brakes with twin-circuits and a double master cylinder, manual steering, electric <b>wipers</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers,</b> coil-spring-based suspension, carpeting, front and rear bench seats consisting of foam rubber and coil springs, side marker lights, hazard lights, backup lights, luxury steering wheel with horn ring and [...] "R" [...] emblem, 200 km/h speedometer, fuel and water temperature gauges, dual front ashtrays, cigarette lighter, electric clock, AM radio, rearview mirror, front and rear side armrests, dual rear ashtrays, dual coat hooks, round dome light, padded sunvisors, driver's side remote mirror, {{as well as a}} bright molding package.

2500|$|The {{introductory}} 1974 Gremlins became unique {{by incorporating}} the front clip of the 1974 U.S. AMC Hornet models. VAM never attempted {{to hide the}} relation between the two models, which never harmed the sales or image of either model and was favored by the public. The launch of the Gremlin in Mexico also meant the resurrection of the [...] I6 engine that was discontinued in 1972. The engine was practically the same as in its final year except for a slightly lower compression ratio (8.3:1 instead of 8.5:1). The advertised output was still the same at 145 gross horsepower at 4,400 revolutions per minute and was restricted to one-barrel carburetors. In contrast, since 1973 all VAM-based Hornets had the [...] six as the standard and only engine. VAM Gremlins were basic economy cars with manual 3-speed transmission, four-wheel drum brakes, manual steering, front sway bar, column-mounted shifters only, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, folding bench seats, two-point front seatbelts, electric <b>wipers</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers,</b> monaural AM radio, cigarette lighter, front and rear ashtrays, locking glovebox, flip-open rear side vents, roof rack, full carpeting with driver's side rubber mat, padded sunvisors, sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner, dual coat hooks and round dome light. Options for 1974 included a column-mounted automatic transmission, power steering, power drum brakes, heater, parcel shelf, light group, remote-controlled driver and passenger side outside mirrors, sports steering wheel, bright molding package, and wheel trim rings. All VAM Gremlins used the AMC's three-pod instrument cluster from the domestic-built Hornet with a blank in the third gauge position from the factory. The introductory year production was 2,137.|$|R
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the VAM Pacer was entirely {{different}} compared to the AMC Pacer. The car was focused to be a high-end luxury car from its introduction to its end, while American Motors counterpart started as an economy car and import fighter. This was reinforced after the first 200 units produced when the three-speed automatic transmission joined the standard equipment list, which by default created the addition of an [...] "Automático" [...] emblem on the bright rear panel. The VAM Pacer became the most costly and luxurious VAM car at the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic line. The uniqueness of the model coupled to its level of luxury and price range practically made the car a flagship for the company, {{even though it was}} never officially considered as such. Probably the most unusual aspect of the 1976 VAM Pacer lies in its seat designs. VAM created a design based on AMC's Oleg Cassini interior for the 1974–1975 Matador coupe that used not just in the Pacer but in all three VAM Classic models for the year. The Pacer's seats incorporated a golden Cassini crest on the adjustable headrests and a pattern with copper buttons forming squares. Unlike the AMC Pacer, the VAM Pacer had a very short list of factory optional equipment. These included rear <b>wiper</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer,</b> rear defroster, reading dome light, trunk cover, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, luxury wheel covers and heavy duty cooling system (seven-bladed flexible fan and fan shroud).

25|$|VAM's {{decision}} to focus all {{efforts on the}} new two-version Lerma model plus the loss of luxury accessories meant the discontinuation of Rally SST for 1982. The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and front hood molding were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from edge to edge. An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the parking lights and headlights and a vertical bar at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines. Both bumpers for the year were those of the AMC Eagle SX/4 Sport, being blacked out equipped with thick nerfing strips with central bright moldings and longer more aerodynamic bumper end caps with their respective bright molding. Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978–1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a tilt steering column). The door panels were the same units as in 1981 except for the change in the fabric portion from plain to a pattern of vertical stripes and the removal of a fake chrome molding in place of a woodgrain unit. The six-bolt sports steering wheel was replaced by a leather-wrapped three-arm Nardi unit. VAM managed to find a local company to reproduce the center console, but it was reduced to the shifter and gauges portions, deleting the armrest with the rear ashtray. Despite the loss in accessories, two new options arrived for the year in the form of the AM FM stereo tape player radio <b>and</b> the rear <b>wiper</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer.</b> The car received two changes in the mid year, the first being a new wooden sports steering wheel and the second a new set of ten-round-spoke steel wheels. Mechanically, the only novelties for the year were wider gear ratios for the A998 automatic transmission and in the mid year a new head design with rounded internal intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets, still retaining the metal valve cover of the previous years. A different head gasket was used to bring the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1.|$|R
