5|$|A {{variation}} of the route operating via the Rossendale Valley between Rawtenstall and Burnley was introduced in 2002, taking the number X45.

This pattern continued until the August 2005 rebranding, when the extension was withdrawn. The most recent variation was route X44, <b>which</b> <b>ran</b> until October 2011.
