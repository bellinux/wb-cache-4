5|$|In 1905, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Wilfrid Laurier, the Northwest Territories seat of government was moved to Ottawa, Ontario, the capital of Canada. This change was made when Northwest Territories defaulted back to the 1870 constitutional status after Alberta and Saskatchewan <b>were</b> <b>sectioned</b> off from the territory on September 1, 1905. After the populated regions of the territory were made into their own jurisdictions, there were very few settlements left in the territory with any significant population or infrastructure. The non-Inuit population was estimated to total around 1,000. Inuit were not counted at the time because they had no status under Canadian law, and were not yet settled in towns or villages.|$|E

On 13 November an auction was held, although the railway failed to attract much interest. Most rolling stock, and every loco except for Lew, was scrapped at Pilton. Some coaches <b>were</b> <b>sectioned</b> for use as garden sheds. Third class seats became garden furniture, and first class seats {{found their way into}} local snooker halls and Masonic lodges. In December, Plymouth ship breaker Sidney Castle won the tender to dismantle the railway. The remaining track was lifted by June 1936, and in September, surviving loco Lew was shipped to Brazil. The stations and track bed were auctioned in 1938.|$|E

50|$|Districts 1, 2, and 3 are all each {{identical}} to one another, including their common designation as At-Large Districts.

As a result, Districts 1, 2, and 3 serve a citywide constituency of Tampa's electorate.

5000|$|Long Hair in Three Stages was {{released}} on October 24, 1995 by Skin Graft Records on CD and LP, with the LP edition containing a bonus track, [...] "Found a Place to Have My Kittens." [...] A promotional version was also released on cassette. The band and Sking Graft Record's CEO, Mark Fischer, traveled to Fischer's father's metal manufacturing shop in St. Louis, Missouri to create the packaging of the LP edition. According to Fisher's design, [...] "we would to turn raw material into album jackets. Large sheets of aluminum <b>were</b> <b>sectioned,</b> trimmed and cut to size by the five of us. The jackets were then punch-pressed and the edges dulled. The spine alone required three precise bends. Each jacket was then hand polished by everyone, leaving no two alike. More than fifty hours hard labor went into the making and design for the album jackets alone." [...] Due to the individually crafted sleeves, approximately 1,000 copies of the LP were made, and as such the LP edition became a rare, collector's item. All copies of the LP sold out within its first month of release. No singles were released from the album, but the band produced a music video for [...] "State is Bad." ...|$|E
50|$|The bumpers on the 1933 Series 355C <b>were</b> <b>sectioned,</b> with plain {{ends and}} a three bar center. The grille was made V-shaped and blended into the painted (chrome optional) {{radiator}} shell. The radiator cap disappeared {{under the hood}} {{on the right side}} (same side as the oil level gauge). The fender tie bar, after a year's absence was sectioned and the center section was hidden behind the grille. Six horizontal doors replaced the vertical hood doors. Skirts were added to the front and rear fenders. The most significant change in body detail was the introduction of no-draft Individually Controlled Ventilation (ICV) or pivoting vent windows in the front doors and the rear quarter or rear door windows. In early production the front door window had to be lowered to disengage the channel at its front edge from the vent window to allow the vent window to pivot. In later production the sealing channel was attached to the door frame rather than to the window glass so that the vent window could be operated independently of the window glass. Windshield and rear quarter windows were made stationary. Absence of a windshield operating mechanism on the closed car allowed room to conceal the wiper motor behind the headboard. The cowl ventilator was baffled and drained {{in such a way as}} to be rainproof. Chassis changes were few and minor in nature. Controlled free wheeling was discontinued. Vacuum assist was added to the brake system. Changes in shock absorber valves extended the range of the ride control system. During the model year the dual point four lobe distributor was replaced by a single point eight lobe unit. A radio was optional. Model year sales were 2,100.|$|E

5000|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Paul Weiss while earning his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, Sperry became interested in neuronal specificity and brain circuitry and began questioning the existing concepts about these two topics. He asked the simple question first asked in his Introduction to Psychology class at Oberlin: Nature or nurture? He {{began a series of}} experiments in an attempt to answer this question. Sperry crosswired the motor nerves of rats' legs so the left nerve controlled the right leg and vice versa. He would then place the rats in a cage that had an electric grid on the bottom separated into four sections. Each leg of the rat was placed into one of the four sections of the electric grid. A shock was administered to a specific section of the grid, for example the grid where the rat’s left back leg was located would receive a shock. Every time the left paw was shocked the rat would lift his right paw and vice versa. Sperry wanted to know {{how long it would take}} the rat to realize he was lifting the wrong paw. After repeated tests Sperry found that the rats never learned to lift up the correct paw, leading him to the conclusion that some things are just hardwired and cannot be relearned. In Sperry’s words, [...] "no adaptive functioning of the nervous system took place." [...] During Sperry's postdoctoral years with Karl Lashley at Harvard and at the Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology in Orange Park, Florida, he continued his work on neuronal specificity that he had begun as a doctoral student and initiated a new series of studies involving salamanders. The optic nerves <b>were</b> <b>sectioned</b> and the eyes rotated 180 degrees. The question was whether vision would be normal after regeneration or would the animal forever view the world as [...] "upside down" [...] and right-left reversed. Should the latter prove to be the case, it would mean that the nerves were somehow [...] "guided" [...] back to their original sites of termination. Restoration of normal vision (i.e., [...] "seeing" [...] the world in a [...] "right-side-up" [...] orientation) would mean that the regenerating nerves had terminated in new sites, quite different from the original ones. The animals reacted as though the world was upside down and reversed from right to left. Furthermore, no amount of training could change the response. These studies, which provided strong evidence for nerve guidance by [...] "intricate chemical codes under genetic control" [...] (1963) culminated in Sperry's chemoaffinity hypothesis (1951).|$|E
