5|$|In 1922, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} privately a pamphlet This is the World that Man Made, or The New Creation that {{was influenced by the}} rationalist writing of Ray Lankester. In it Pick was pessimistic that mankind was not achieving its creative potential. He returned to the subject in lectures he gave in the 1930s when he outlined his concern that at some not too distant point progress in civilisation would come to a natural end and a stable condition would arise where, he believed, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> maintain creativity and an entropic decline would follow. Later, {{in the last year of}} his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace. Pick wrote the introduction to the English translation of Walter Gropius's The New Architecture and the Bauhaus published in 1935.|$|E
5|$|When {{the film}} {{screened}} at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California from May 29 to July 23, 2009, it {{was accompanied by}} Lighten Up!, a live show featuring Disney characters. Other tie-ins included children's books such as My Name is Dug, illustrated by screenwriter Ronnie del Carmen. Despite Pixar's track record, Target Corporation and Walmart stocked few Up items, while Pixar's regular collaborator Thinkway Toys did not produce merchandise, claiming its story is unusual and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> promote. Disney acknowledged not every Pixar film would have to become a franchise. Promotional partners include Aflac, NASCAR, and Airship Ventures, while Cluster Balloons promoted the film with a replica of Carl's couch lifted by hot air balloons for journalists to sit in.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E

25|$|The rise of DJs {{was really}} the next step for the Japanese hip hop scene. Before 1985, there weren't very many DJs on the radio, but with the {{increase}} in the number that year, it led to the opening of the first all hip hop club in 1986. But despite the fact that DJing caught on rather quickly, it was initially thought that rapping wasn't going to have the same cache as it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> rap in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Notably, while every {{witness to}} the Commission gave {{evidence}} of frequent corporal punishment, applied contrary to the regulations and therefore criminally, no Church witness came forward to certify a single such case. Difficulties arose where complainants or the accused were involved in parallel criminal or civil cases, such as the vaccine trials performed on inmate children. With such divergent views the CICA's task has been difficult and contentious, but it has agreed with the evidence given by the complainants. Given Mr. Ahern's general apology in 1999, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> conclude otherwise.|$|E

25|$|Among the Doric temples, the Peisistratid Olympieion at Athens has {{a special}} position. Although this {{building}} was never completed, its architect apparently attempted to adapt the Ionic dipteros. Column drums built into the later foundations indicate that it was originally planned as a Doric temple. Nonetheless, its ground plan follows the Ionic examples of Samos so closely that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> reconcile such a solution with a Doric triglyph frieze. After the expulsion of Hippias in 510 BC, work on this structure was stopped: Democratic Athens {{had no desire to}} continue a monument of tyrannical self-aggrandisation.|$|E
25|$|Cattle drives had {{to strike}} a balance between speed and the weight of the cattle. While cattle could be driven as far as 25 miles in a single day, they would lose so much weight that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> sell when they reached the end of the trail. Usually they were taken shorter {{distances}} each day, allowed periods to rest and graze both at midday and at night. On average, a herd could maintain a healthy weight moving about 15 miles per day. Such a pace meant that it would take as long as two months to travel from a home ranch to a railhead. The Chisholm trail, for example, was 1,000 miles long.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Raszyn on April 19, where Poniatowski's Polish troops {{brought an}} Austrian force twice their number to a {{standstill}} (but neither side defeated the other decisively), the Polish forces nonetheless retreated, allowing the Austrians to occupy the Duchy's capital, Warsaw, as Poniatowski decided that the city <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> defend, and instead decided to keep his army mobile {{in the field and}} engage the Austrians elsewhere, crossing to the eastern (right) bank of the Vistula. Indeed, the Duchy's capital was seized by the Austrian army with little opposition, but it was a Pyrrhic victory for them, since the Austrian commander diverted most of his forces there {{at the expense of other}} fronts. Prince Este garrisoned Warsaw with 10,000 soldiers, and split his remaining forces, sending 6,000 corps to the right bank of the Vistula, and the rest towards Toruń and other targets on the left bank.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of {{participatory}} governance being resource intensive, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> expand this to regional levels and beyond. It is also important to not necessarily enrol too many stakeholders, as there may be the ‘participation paradox’ that essentially means the greater the number of stakeholders, the fewer the responsibilities and involvement of each one and their effectiveness is reduced in the process.|$|R
25|$|The {{first home}} {{game of the}} 2008–09 season, at 3pm on a Saturday, saw the lowest-ever Premier League {{attendance}} at the expanded ground, of 47,711, resulting in cash turnstiles. It was speculated {{at the time that}} this was due to the credit crunch; however, with the shock departure of Kevin Keegan before the next home game, future changes in attendances <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> attribute to this alone. The first game after Keegan's resignation, a league fixture against Hull on 13 September 2008, registered a crowd of 50,242 amid protests against Ashley and Dennis Wise. This was followed by an attendance of 44,935 on 27 September in a league fixture against Blackburn Rovers, which followed a record low attendance of 20,577 on Wednesday, 24 September in a League Cup fixture, the lowest ever attendance for a competitive first-team match since the 1993 promotion to the top flight, and a drop of over 4,000 from previous lows.|$|E
25|$|Decentralization {{is also a}} key ideological idea to technoliberalism, {{sought to}} work though the {{deregulation}} of rules that stop businesses competing with the government services. Decentralization means distributing the power away {{from the center of}} an organization, diffusing authority outwards to workers in the field. The rapid growth of information technology has aided this concept as the likes of the internet have made the distribution of information accessible and cheap. On the other hand, is the ideological idea of free markets. Strongly enforced rules would be needed here as this type of market would be based on supply and demand with little government control. Technoliberalist's believe that knowledge and technology can be geographically transferred without much difficulty or state action, envisaging a completely free market where buyers and sellers are allowed to transact unreservedly, based on a mutual agreement on price without state intervention in the form of taxes, subsidies or regulation. Whilst this is an idealized view, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> implement.|$|E
25|$|Assembly {{language}} is still taught in most computer science and electronic engineering programs. Although few programmers today regularly work with assembly {{language as a}} tool, the underlying concepts remain very important. Such fundamental topics as binary arithmetic, memory allocation, stack processing, character set encoding, interrupt processing, and compiler design <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level. Since a computer's behavior is fundamentally defined by its instruction set, the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language. Most modern computers have similar instruction sets. Therefore, studying a single assembly {{language is}} sufficient to learn: I) the basic concepts; II) to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate; and III) to see how efficient executable code can be created from high-level languages. This is analogous to children needing to learn the basic arithmetic operations (e.g., long division), although calculators are widely used for all except the most trivial calculations.|$|E
50|$|In 1759, {{a severe}} drought struck Stockholm. As both {{buildings}} and vegetation dried out, the fire hazard grew. In addition, {{the water supply}} {{was on the verge}} of running dry, (except near Mälaren.) which meant that any fire <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> fight.

25|$|On 12 August 2008, Komsomolskaya Pravda {{reported}} that in South Ossetia several soldiers were wounded and one was killed, who were from Tatarstan.

Lieutenant Aleksandr Popov was participating in the exercises on the height near Tskhinvali when his group was requested by the intelligence to reinforce them. According to Popov's mother, Popov told her he could see how the Georgians fired on Tskhinvali one week before the war. The mother of Eldar Lotfullin, 23-year-old contract soldier, said {{that she was able to}} call her son for the last time at around 10 PM MSK on 7 August 2008.

25|$|In {{selecting}} {{their team}} for Australia the MCC selectors (Sir Pelham Warner, Harry Altham, Gubby Allen, Les Ames, William Findlay, Tom Pearce, Walter Robins, Brian Sellers and Bob Wyatt) {{made the mistake}} on relying on experience {{on one hand and}} youth on the other, but with little between. In this they were not helped by the hole left in English cricket by the Second World War, but only three players (Godfrey Evans, Trevor Bailey and Reg Simpson) were aged between 26 and 31 and could be said to be at their prime; nine of the players were 32 or more and six 26 or less. The captain Freddie Brown had last toured Australia in 1932-33 with Douglas Jardine and Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Denis Compton, Doug Wright, Alec Bedser and Godfrey Evans in 1946-47 under Wally Hammond; {{the rest of the team}} had never travelled down under. Bill Edrich who had made a gutsy 462 runs (46.20) in 1946-47 and would tour Australia again in 1954-55, but was out of favour at Lord's (he was being divorced, and such things counted in the 1950s) and had had an injury-struck season. The two biggest wicket-takers of 1950 were the top spinners Jim Laker and Johnny Wardle. Laker had taken an astounding 8/2 in the 1950 Bradford Test Trial, but his brand of off-spin was deemed too slow for the hard Australian pitches and he was not chosen for the 1954-55 tour either. In the 1956 Ashes series he took 46 wickets (9.60) including 19/90 at Old Trafford and when he finally toured Australia in 1958-59 he took 15 wickets (21.20). The Yorkshireman Johnny Wardle was also left behind, but would finish with 102 Test wickets (20.39) with his combination of Slow Left Arm bowling and Chinamen. To be fair to the selectors Laker had only taken 32 Test wickets (37.34) at the time and Wardle just 2 (56.50). The MCC were committed to a youth policy that consistently failed them. In 1950 they relied overly on young undergraduates from Cambridge University and had lost 3-1 to the West Indies as a result. A continuation of this policy was unlikely to succeed in Australia, but John Dewes, David Sheppard and John Warr were chosen for the tour along with the young professionals Brian Close, Gilbert Parkhouse and Bob Berry. They all failed when faced with real class and only served to increase the burden on the senior players. Remembering his torrid time in 1946-47 Cyril Washbrook declined to tour when selected, but was later flown out with Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham. Washbrook's fears were full realised, Tattersall failed and Statham would not make his Test debut until the party reached New Zealand. Freddie Brown was the selector's third choice to lead the tour, after Norman Yardley of Yorkshire and George Mann of Middlesex both declined the job and he was only chosen as Lord's was determined to have an amateur captain. It was a thankless job as even with the retirement of the great Don Bradman it was clear that Australia were the stronger team and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> beat on their own ground. They had defeated Wally Hammond 3-0 in 1946-47 and Yardley 4-0 in 1948 and England had not won a Test against them in twelve years.|$|E

5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began {{shifting}} strategies. The UN began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations, so that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> attack or take hostage. More importantly, Gen.
