5|$|Three weeks later, some {{children}} {{playing in the}} street <b>wandered</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> yard of the now-vacant house. One of them fell into the cellar and discovered the tunnel. While the prison's Board of Inspectors was unable to identify the inmate involved in the escape attempt, the warden punished Berkman by sending him to solitary confinement for nearly a year. Days after {{he was released from}} solitary, Berkman tried to hang himself with a strip of his blanket.|$|E
5|$|It is {{told that}} an Indian boy named Mariano Mayta {{used to watch}} over his father's herd of alpaca {{on the slopes of}} the mountain. He <b>wandered</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> snowfields of the glacier, where he {{encountered}} a mestizo boy named Manuel. They became good friends, and Manuel provided Mariano with food. When the boy did not return home for meals, Mariano's father went looking for his son. He was surprised to find his herd had increased. As a reward, he sent Mariano to Cusco to get new clothes. Mariano asked to buy some also for Manuel, who wore the same outfit everyday. His father agreed, so Mariano asked Manuel for a sample in order to buy the same kind of cloth in Cusco.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers {{knew from}} the {{beginning}} of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled that they were prepared to change to another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult. When Humphrey the Whale <b>wandered</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> San Francisco Bay, Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so. Other footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on 35mm film or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script. Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve the whale problem, Rodis hired robotics expert Walt Conti. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well-equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.|$|E

Little Hawk was the nephew of his {{maternal}} step-grandfather, Long Face, and a cousin, High Horse. In 1854, the camp was entered by Lieutenant John Lawrence Grattan and 29 other U.S. troopers, who intended to arrest a Miniconjou man for having stolen a cow. The cow had <b>wandered</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> camp, and after a short time someone butchered it and passed the meat out among the people. When the soldiers fatally shot Chief Conquering Bear, the Lakota returned fire, killing all 30 soldiers and a civilian interpreter in what was later called the Grattan massacre.|$|E
25|$|Now the Kandyans {{concentrated}} {{their attack}} on the middle column. After heavy fighting they were repulsed, but this took some time during which the middle column became separated from the vanguard, who were continuing their running battle. In the confusion the elephants carrying Dona Catarina and other valuables, including the ammunition reserves, left the column and <b>wandered</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forest. Meanwhile the advance guard, now proceeding without a guide, took a wrong turn and stumbled into a marshy field. Here the Kandyans surrounded and overwhelmed them. Following them in, the second column mounted a better resistance, managing to hold out for three hours, but they were eventually annihilated after their captains Henrique Pinto and Diogo Borges were killed.|$|E

25|$|Two {{settlers}} {{who were}} staying near Fort Antes {{were killed in}} June 1777. A party of four men and two women had left {{the safety of the}} fort and crossed the West Branch of the Susquehanna River to milk some cows that had been left there to pasture. Zephaniah Miller, Abel Cady, and James Armstrong left the riverbank and meadow to gather a cow who had <b>wandered</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> surrounding woods. These three men came under attack by a group of warriors who had been hiding in the woods. Sounds of fighting stirred the men at the fort. They crossed the river despite the objections of Colonel Antes who thought that the Native Americans might have set a trap. Upon reaching {{the other side of the}} river, the militiamen found Miller dead and Cady and Armstrong mortally wounded. Only Bouser and the women, one of them Cady's wife, survived the attack. This was just one of many attacks in the West Branch Valley that continued to make life more dangerous for the settlers, who were encroaching on tribal land.|$|E

The remix is fundamentally different from the original, described as having [...] "a faster, springier backbeat" [...] by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times. Lyrically, the song {{is similar to the}} album version of the song, in which both rappers' verses contemplate on past memories. Styles P raps [...] "Past is the past, just let it be bygones / Matter of fact I know a fly song that we could vibe on", which Sanneh writes [...] "Cheerfully out of place, he sounds like a man who has <b>wandered</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wrong summertime party, but so what? He figures he might as well stick around and enjoy it." [...] In two separate reviews of The Emancipation of Mimi, Sanneh referred to the song as both [...] "great" [...] and [...] "excellent", in regards to the remix.|$|E

500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know if I would be making movies or working in a restaurant, I {{had no idea what}} I would be doing. I just <b>wandered</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E
500|$|Tony Norman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {{praised the}} episode, {{which he said}} [...] "has <b>wandered</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> heart of Dostoyevsky {{territory}} with its storylines". He particularly praised the episode for going outside its normal conventions by portraying lead characters like Pembleton and Gee as being so reluctant {{to do the right}} thing. Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News gave the episode four out of five stars; he particularly praised the performances of Thorne and Gerety, and said the show did an impressive job of introducing the new cast members. Michael Storey of Arkansas Democrat-Gazette said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] lived up to the high standards he said the show had set for itself. Ron Miller of Fort Worth Star-Telegram praised [...] "Blood Ties", although he said he does not always enjoy Homicide: Life on the Street. He said the episode [...] "starts fast and gets better and more intense by the minute", and described the climactic argument in the second episode as [...] "the most turbulent internal dispute we've ever seen among the detectives". Rocky Mountain News writer Dusty Saunders praised the main story-line and said the subplots were well juxtaposed into the episode. He also said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] could serve as a good introduction to the series for new viewers. Alan Sepinwall, television critic for The Star-Ledger, criticized the addition of [...] "silly" [...] action-oriented scenes the traditionally more intelligent show, but praised [...] "Blood Ties" [...] and the addition of the new cast members. Sepinwall particularly praised the acting of Andre Braugher: [...] "Pitted against a powerhouse like James Earl Jones, he not only holds his own, but at times is so dramatically forceful that the former voice of Darth Vader sounds intimidated." [...] Not all reviews of [...] "Blood Ties" [...] were positive. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post said the series benefited from the new characters, but that the episode [...] "asks viewers to believe rather too strongly in the inherent racism of certain characters we've come to know as heroes in seasons past". Ostrow also thought Pembleton's clashes with the new detectives was predictable.|$|E
