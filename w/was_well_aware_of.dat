5|$|As {{evident in}} his {{imperial}} edicts, the Hongwu Emperor <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the Buddhist link between Tibet and China and wanted to foster it. Rolpe Dorje, 4th Karmapa Lama (1340–1383) rejected the Hongwu Emperor's invitation, although he did send some disciples as envoys to the court in Nanjing. The Hongwu Emperor also entrusted his guru Zongluo, one of many Buddhist monks at court, to head a religious mission into Tibet in 1378–1382 {{in order to obtain}} Buddhist texts.|$|E
5|$|Following the July 20 Plot, Model was {{the first}} senior {{commander}} to reaffirm his loyalty to Hitler. However, he also {{refused to give up}} General Hans Speidel, his chief of staff at Army Group B who was heavily implicated in the plot, to the Gestapo. Model <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> Speidel's political leanings, as were his predecessors at Army Group B, Erwin Rommel and Günther von Kluge. Like them, he shielded Speidel for as long as possible, while ignoring such treasonous talk as might take place.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter {{was the only time}} that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E

5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he {{would have to go to}} him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Evangelis Zappas {{was often}} {{described}} as a solitary and eccentric personality, who had no children. On the other hand, {{he was a man}} of vision, determination and a patriot, who <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the magnitude of his acts. His cousin, Konstantinos Zappas, was the executor of his will and he continued Evangelis Zappas philanthropic works through his legacy. Zappas's wish was to be initially buried in Romania, where he lived most of his life. But after four years his bones were exhumed and reinterred at the school's courtyard in Labovo where he was born, and his skull was enshrined beneath his memorial statue outside the Zappeion in Athens, Greece. A ceremony for the interment was held at 10am on 20 October 1888 at the Zappeion. Baron Pierre de Coubertin made a similar gesture by having his heart buried at Olympia.|$|E
5|$|In foreign policy, the Vaasa Senate {{leaned on}} the German Empire for {{military}} and political aid, in order to defeat the Finnish Red Guards, end the influence of Bolshevist Russia in Finland, and expand Finnish territory to Russian/East Karelia, which held geopolitical significance, and was home to people speaking Finno-Ugric languages (Irredentist campaigns/Heimosodat). The weakness of Russia induced an idea of Greater Finland among the expansive factions of both the right and left; the Reds had claims concerning the same areas. General Mannerheim agreed {{on the need to}} take over eastern Karelia and for German weapons, but opposed German intervention in Finland. Mannerheim recognized the lack of combat skills of the Finnish Red Guards, and he {{leaned on the}} high military skills of the Finnish Jägers. As a former Russian army officer, Mannerheim <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the demoralization of the Russian army. He co-operated with White Russian officers in Finland and Russia.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes {{arms were}} {{purchased}} {{on the black}} market from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports. Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important. All such purchases were highly risky, as the Gestapo <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, as {{the allied}} Christian fleet resumed operations, it faced a renewed Ottoman navy of 200 vessels under Kılıç Ali Pasha. The Spanish contingent under Don John {{did not reach}} the Ionian Sea until September, meaning that the Ottomans enjoyed numerical superiority for a time, but the Ottoman commander <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the inferiority of his fleet, constructed in haste of green wood and manned by inexperienced crews. He therefore actively avoided to engage the allied fleet in August, and eventually headed {{for the safety of}} the fortress of Modon. The arrival of the Spanish squadron of 55 ships evened the numbers on both sides and opened the opportunity for a decisive blow, but friction among the Christian leaders and the reluctance of Don John squandered the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the {{military}} {{power of the}} Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy. The king was furious at the demand and kept the Mongol envoys waiting for weeks. The court finally devised a compromise: the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king. Accompanying them was a Burmese envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the Burmese king's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing. The king then promptly ordered an expedition, which retook the rebellious borderland regions in April 1272. The rebel leader A-Pi (အပိ) was brought back to Pagan. Dali relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the army}} was summoned to {{assemble}} at York on 24 June, it did not approach Scotland until mid-August. This {{was due to the}} gradual arrival of army supplies (in some cases, with much delay — the King's own tents, for example, were not despatched from Westminster until halfway through July). Brown suggests that Henry <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the delays these preparations would cause the campaign. At some point before the army left for Scotland, the muster was met by the Constable of England, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and the Earl Marshal, Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland. Individual leaders of each retinue present were then paid a lump sum to later distribute in wages to their troops: Men-at-arms reived one shilling a day, archers half that, but captains and leaders do not apear to have been paid at a higher rate. The army left York on 25 July and reached Newcastle-upon-Tyne four days later; it was plagued by shortages of supplies, particularly food, of which more had had to be requested before even leaving York. As the campaign progressed, bad weather exacerbated the problem of food shortages, and Brown has speculated that this was an important consideration in the short duration of the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to promote}} a {{commemorative}} coin for the exposition began around January 1892. They were strongly advocated {{by the head of}} the Company's Committee on Liberal Arts, James Ellsworth, who was particularly interested as he had recently purchased a 16th-century painting by Lorenzo Lotto of a learned man, said to be Columbus. Ellsworth wanted the portrait to be the basis of the coin. In this, he was advised by author and journalist William Eleroy Curtis, also a fair official. In April 1892, partisans had gained the support of the Director of the Bureau of the Mint, Edward O. Leech, who envisioned a coin carrying a visage of Columbus on one side, and a suitable inscription on the other. Curtis <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the difficulties with the Mint's failed competition for new silver coins in 1891, which had led to the issuance of the Barber coinage, designed by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber. The new coins were widely criticized, and Curtis counseled Ellsworth to gain control of the commemorative coin's design process, to ensure both a better design {{and the use of the}} Lotto portrait. No United States coin had depicted an actual person, although the goddess of Liberty had often been portrayed.|$|E
5|$|The Brindle Tails {{desperately wanted}} Clayton {{out of the}} governor's office. Conveniently, Lieutenant Governor James M. Johnson was a Brindle Tail, so the natural course of action {{was to try to}} get rid of Clayton and let Johnson succeed him. Clayton <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their plans, and when he left the state briefly for New York on {{business}} concerning the Holford Bonds, he informed no one. When Johnson, who was at home some distance from the capital, found out he tried to head to the capital to take control and have Clayton arrested and impeached. He arrived too late. Subsequently, after Johnson made a speech demanding changes in the administration, the Minstrels started to target Johnson. On January 30, 1871, they introduced articles of impeachment in the General Assembly against him. The chief charge was that Johnson, acting as the President of the Senate, had administered the oath of office to Joseph Brooks, who had recently been elected as state senator, and then recognized him on the floor. Although this was legitimately within his powers as the lieutenant governor to do, he escaped impeachment by only two votes. The scrutiny of the proceedings seriously damaged his reputation, even though he had done nothing wrong, and his political career never recovered.|$|E

5|$|The German host {{was waiting}} for the Romans, {{probably}} drawn up on the crest of the hill, to give Chnodomar's men the advantage of the slope. The German left wing was held by Chnodomar and his cavalry. Demonstrating that he <b>was</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the threat posed by the Roman heavy cavalry, Chnodomar had devised a stratagem. He interspersed lightly armed infantry among his cavalry. These were easy to conceal in the standing grain. The idea was that in a mêlée, the foot soldiers would bring down the cataphracts by crawling along the ground and stabbing their horses in their underbellies, which were unprotected. The dismounted riders, weighed down by their armour, could then easily be despatched on the ground. The German right wing blocked the highway to Strasbourg, while in the woods beyond the highway were a substantial force of warriors hidden in ambush on Chnodomar's orders. The right wing was under his nephew Serapio (who was given his Greek name by his Hellenophile father). Although still a teenager, Serapio had already proved a military leader worthy of his uncle. The rest of the line was probably divided into pagi units under five major kings and ten petty kings.|$|E
