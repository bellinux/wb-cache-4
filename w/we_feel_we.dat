We again emphasise that they should pursue the path of peace or resign themselves to the path of war". The IRA also attempted to apply indirect pressure to the British government with a statement sent to non-United States foreign-owned businesses in the City, warning that [...] "no one should be misled into underestimating the IRA's intention to mount future planned attacks into the political and financial heart of the British state ...

500|$|The film conveys {{what some}} viewers have {{described}} as {{a sense of the}} sublime and numinous. Roger Ebert writes in his essay on 2001 in The Great Movies: [...] In a book on architecture, Gregory Caicco writes that Space Odyssey illustrates how our quest for space is motivated by two contradictory desires, a [...] "desire for the sublime" [...] characterized by a need to encounter something totally other than ourselves—"something numinous"—and the conflicting desire for a beauty that makes us feel no longer [...] "lost in space," [...] but at home. Similarly, an article in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, titled [...] "Sense of Wonder," [...] describes how 2001 creates a [...] "numinous sense of wonder" [...] by portraying a universe that inspires a sense of awe, which at the same time <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> can understand. Christopher Palmer wrote that there exists in the film a coexistence of [...] "the sublime and the banal," [...] as the film implies that to get into space, mankind had to suspend the [...] "sense of wonder" [...] that motivated him to explore space to begin with.|$|E

500|$|Despite Australia's {{ruthless}} on-field {{dominance and}} {{a succession of}} one-sided victories, the touring team drew unprecedented levels of spectator and media interest. Bradman's dominant cricketing stature was {{a key factor in}} his team's popularity with the public, especially as it was known that it would be his last international campaign. A leading cricket writer of the time, R. C. Robertson-Glasgow, said [...] "we want him to do well. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> have a share in him. He is more than Australian. He is a world batsman." [...] The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that [...] "cities, towns and hotels are beflagged, carpets set down, and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome. He is the Prince of Cricketers." [...] Writing later, Haigh opined that [...] "perhaps no touring cricketer... has been as feted as Bradman in that northern summer". Bradman received hundreds of personal letters every day, and one of his dinner speeches was broadcast live, causing the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the news bulletin. Of Bradman's retirement, Robertson-Glasgow said in the 1949 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack: [...] "...a miracle has been removed from among us... So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal." ...|$|E

The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that [...] "cities, towns and hotels are beflagged, carpets set down, and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome. He is the Prince of Cricketers." [...] Haigh said that [...] "cricket approached the 50s at the peak of its popularity, albeit, after Bradman's final Test... without the player chiefly responsible for it".

Within the month, he fulfilled his contractual obligation to EMI/Capitol for one more album by releasing Shaved Fish, a compilation album of previously recorded tracks. He devoted himself to Sean, rising at 6am daily to plan and prepare his meals and to spend time with him. He wrote [...] "Cookin' (In the Kitchen of Love)" [...] for Starr's Ringo's Rotogravure (1976), performing on the track in June in what would be his last recording session until 1980. He formally announced his break from music in Tokyo in 1977, saying, [...] "we have basically decided, without any great decision, to be with our baby {{as much as we can}} until <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> can take time off to indulge ourselves in creating things outside of the family." [...] During his career break he created several series of drawings, and drafted a book containing a mix of autobiographical material and what he termed [...] "mad stuff", all of which would be published posthumously.|$|E

500|$|The Wilson {{murder is}} a [...] "red ball", a police case {{involving}} an innocent victim, widely known suspects {{or a combination}} of the two. Red ball cases tend to draw attention from the media, the public and high-ranking police brass, and often result in additional detectives being added to the case. Fontana thought these elements of the red ball case would help produce a strong season premiere and tension among the veteran characters who resent the meddling of the new detectives. Julie Martin, one of the show's writers and supervising producers, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] marked a deliberate change in the series, focusing on darker story lines that are [...] "a little messier and unresolved" [...] and more interpersonal relationships: [...] "The show's been on for six seasons, and it absolutely has to change. We can't keep doing the same show." [...] Media outlets noted that [...] "Blood Ties" [...] included more action-oriented elements such as car chases and a chase sequence involving helicopters at an airport. Fontana denied allegations of tampering from NBC executives and said any such changes would have come from him: [...] "I don't want us to have a style every week that <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> have to conform to. ... I want people not to know what to expect when they tune in every week. We're not formulaic." ...|$|E

On August 11, Rodriguez hit his first home run of the season off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. With the home run, Rodriguez passed Stan Musial for fifth place in career RBIs. Rodriguez continued to feud with Yankees management following his return, as his lawyers accused the team, and specifically Christopher S. Ahmad MD, of mishandling his hip injury in several ways; Rodriguez's legal team contends the team withheld the injury from him and continued to play him in 2012 despite his health, and that team president Randy Levine told Rodriguez's hip surgeon that he would be happy if Rodriguez never played again. In response to the accusations, Cashman said, [...] "I'm not comfortable talking to Alex about this because <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>we</b> are in a litigious environment.

2500|$|When Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, who worshiped {{and taught}} Islamic studies at Dar Al-Hijrah, {{for which he}} also was a camp counselor, was charged by U.S. {{prosecutors}} with plotting with members of al-Qaeda to assassinate President George W. Bush, Abdul-Malik said in February 2005: [...] "Our whole community is under siege. They don't see this as a case of criminality. They see it as a civil rights case. As a frontal attack on their community." [...] He added: [...] "The feeling I get here on a daily basis must be {{what it was like to}} be a member of Martin Luther King Jr.'s church following the case of Rosa Parks. People always ask, 'What is the latest from the courthouse?'" [...] Abdul-Malik accused the government of singling out Abu Ali to stir anti-Muslim sentiment. Abu Ali was convicted in 2005 of providing material support to the al-Qaeda terrorist network, and conspiracy to assassinate President Bush, and is serving a life sentence. [...] When in April 2005 Ali al-Timimi of Fairfax, Virginia, an American-born Muslim cleric, was convicted of inciting followers to wage war against the US just days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and of recruiting for the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the paintball terrorist cell, Abdul-Malik said: [...] "There is a view many Muslims have when they come to America that you could not be arrested for something you say.
