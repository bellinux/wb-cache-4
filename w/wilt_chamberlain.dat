5|$|Quadruple-doubles {{have only}} been {{possible}} since the 1973–74 season, when the NBA started recording both blocked shots and steals. It is often speculated by observers that other all-time greats, namely Oscar Robertson (all time triple-doubles leader with 181), <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain,</b> Bill Russell and Jerry West could conceivably have had quadruple-doubles. West's biography at NBA.com claims that he once recorded an unofficial quadruple-double with 44points, 12rebounds, 10assists and 10blocks. A biography of <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> claims that he also recorded an unofficial quadruple-double in Game1 of the 1967 Eastern Division Finals against the Boston Celtics, when he had 24points, 32rebounds, 13assists and 12blocks.|$|E
5|$|Double-triple-double (at least 20 of any 3 statistics): <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> (Philadelphia 76ers) is {{the only}} player to have {{accomplished}} this; in a February 2, 1968 game versus Detroit Pistons, Chamberlain tallied 22 points, 25 rebounds, and 21 assists.|$|E
5|$|Men's {{professional}} {{basketball in the}} United States (notably the National Basketball Association) widened it further to 16feet (4.9m) in the 1964–65 NBA season to lessen the effectiveness of centers, especially <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain.</b> The NCAA retains the 12‑foot key to this day.|$|E
5|$|Despite his fierce nature, Auerbach {{was popular}} among his players. He {{recalled}} that on his 75th birthday party, 45 {{of his former}} players showed up; and when he turned 80, his perennial 1960s victim <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> showed up, a gesture which Auerbach dearly appreciated.|$|E
5|$|Longest {{continuous}} {{streak of}} triple-doubles: <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> (Philadelphia 76ers) holds {{the record for}} the most consecutive triple-doubles. In 1968, from March 8 to March 20, he recorded a triple-double in nine straight games. The second longest streak is seven, a record jointly held by Robertson, Michael Jordan, and Westbrook.|$|E
5|$|Most points {{scored in}} a triple-double: Russell Westbrook (Oklahoma City Thunder) holds {{the record for}} the most points scored in a triple-double with 57 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists on March 29, 2017 against the Orlando Magic in overtime. The {{previous}} record was 53 points, by both <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> and James Harden.|$|E
5|$|Special double-doubles are rare. One such double-double {{is called}} double double-double (also {{referred}} to as 20–20 or Double-20). It occurs when a player accumulates 20 or more in two different statistical categories in a game. Another such double-double is called a triple double-double (also {{referred to as}} 30–30). The only player in NBA history to record a 40-40 is <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain,</b> who achieved the feat eight times in his career. Of the five instances, four were recorded in his rookie season, and the fifth was achieved the following year where he recorded 78 points and 43 rebounds in a game. <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> also holds the record for most career double-doubles (regular season and playoffs) with 1111. Tim Duncan is second with 1005, followed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with 1004.|$|E
5|$|Before playing college basketball, Garland starred for John Bartram High School in his {{hometown}} and was a first-team All-State selection {{and one of the}} top scorers {{in the history of the}} Philadelphia Public League (PPL). In his time, he scored the third-most points by any player in the Public League, only being exceeded by Maureece Rice and <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain.</b> Garland is currently the fourth-best scorer in PPL history.|$|E
5|$|Longest {{continuous}} {{streak of}} double-doubles: According to the Elias Sports Bureau, <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> holds the record with 227 consecutive double-doubles from 1964 to 1967. Chamberlain also holds {{the second and}} third longest continuous streaks of double-doubles with 220 and 133. This record is before the ABA–NBA merger in 1976. The longest streak of double-doubles since the merger was 53 games, achieved by Kevin Love, then of the Minnesota Timberwolves.|$|E
5|$|Most 50-point triple-doubles in {{a single}} season: Russell Westbrook (Oklahoma City Thunder) {{recorded}} three 50-point triple-doubles in the 2016–17 season. James Harden is the other player to record more than one 50-point triple double with two in the same season. It is more than likely that <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> recorded many 50-point triple-doubles during his historic 1961-62 NBA season, but they remain unofficial, as steals and blocked shots were not yet recorded as official statistics.|$|E
5|$|Nine All-Rookie Team {{members have}} won both the Rookie of the Year Award and the Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) during their careers. <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> and Wes Unseld {{are the only}} players to {{accomplish}} this feat in the same season. As {{of the end of}} the , 29 members of the All-Rookie Team have been elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, 28 members were not born in the United States and 120 members are active in the NBA.|$|E
5|$|The Tar Heels {{won their}} first NCAA Men's Basketball National Championship and {{received}} a large welcome at Raleigh–Durham International Airport when they arrived back in North Carolina. Due {{to the success of}} televising the National Championship game in North Carolina, the broadcasting of collegiate basketball for the Atlantic Coast Conference expanded greatly. Kansas' <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> received heavy criticism for his inability to win the National Championship and eventually left Kansas after his junior year in order to join the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> {{holds the}} all-time records for total points scored (4,029) and {{points per game}} (50.4) in a season; both records were {{achieved}} in the 1961–62 season. He also holds the rookie records for points per game when he averaged 37.6 points in the 1959–60 season. Among active players, Kevin Durant has the highest point total (2,593) and the highest scoring average (32.0) in a season; both were achieved in the 2013–14 season.|$|E
5|$|Basketball {{today is}} played by more than 300 million people worldwide, {{making it one of}} the most popular team sports. In North America, {{basketball}} has produced some of the most-admired athletes of the 20th century. ESPN and the Associated Press both conducted polls to name the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century. Basketball player Michael Jordan came in first in the ESPN poll and second (behind Babe Ruth) in the AP poll. Both polls featured fellow basketball players <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> (of KU, like Naismith) and Bill Russell in the Top 20.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{losing in}} the {{championship}} game, Kansas' <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> was named the NCAA Tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Chamberlain was also named to the Consensus All-Americans squad for the 1956–57 season. North Carolina's Lennie Rosenbluth was named the Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year for his performance throughout the basketball season, {{as well as a}} Consensus AllAmerican. The Tar Heels' coach Frank McGuire was named UPI College Basketball Coach of the Year for leading North Carolina to a win in the National Championship game and a perfect record of 320.|$|E
5|$|Jordan had {{completely}} recovered {{in time for}} the 1986–87 season, and he had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history. He joined <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> as the only two players to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting. In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season. Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the league's Most Valuable Player Award. The Bulls reached 40 wins, and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year. However, they were again swept by the Celtics.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2012, the Los Angeles Lakers {{acquired}} Nash in a sign-and-trade {{deal with}} Phoenix. Nash also considered signing with New York or Toronto, {{but he decided}} that Los Angeles was the best fit {{for him and his}} family. Nash switched his jersey number, as his customary No. 13 was retired by Los Angeles in honour of <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain.</b> Nash, an avid soccer fan, chose No. 10 to pay homage to Glenn Hoddle, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi and other soccer playmakers who wore the number. Entering his 17th NBA season, Nash came to the Lakers with concerns over his defense and the health of his back.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers won 60 {{games in}} the 1972–73 NBA season, and took another Pacific Division title. <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain,</b> playing in his final season, again {{led the league in}} {{rebounding}} and set the still standing NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7%. The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven {{games in the}} conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals. They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.|$|E
5|$|After {{surviving}} numerous close games {{during the}} regular season, conference tournament, and most recently a triple overtime game against Michigan State in the national semifinal, North Carolina came into the National Championship game with an unblemished record of 310. Led by coach Frank McGuire and Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year Lennie Rosenbluth, the Tar Heels were ranked first overall in the AP Poll. Kansas came into the National Championship game with two losses, which were credited to poor ball control on the Jayhawks part. The Kansas Jayhawks, led by Sophomore phenom and Firstteam All-American <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain,</b> came into the game favored to win against the Tar Heels of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E
5|$|In {{an earlier}} 2009 Class AAAA playoff contest vs Pocono Mountain East High School, Garland scored eight {{consecutive}} {{points in the}} final 44 seconds of regulation. He capped the streak by making a 30-foot shot with 3.3 seconds remaining, and his 40 total points helped Bartram win, 72–67. Garland scored a total of 2,198 points, making him the top scorer in school history and the third-leading scorer in Public League history. Maureece Rice, who scored 2,681, and <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain,</b> who scored 2,206, were the only players who had accumulated more points in their high school careers in the league. Maurice Watson, from the Boys' Latin of Philadelphia Charter School, broke both Chamberlain's and Garland's records in 2012, pushing Garland to fourth on the list.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} Rookie of the Year winner is Malcolm Brogdon. Twenty-one winners were drafted first overall. Fourteen winners have {{also won the}} NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in their careers; <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> and Wes Unseld earning both honors the same season. Nineteen of the forty two non-active winners have been elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Three seasons had joint winners—Dave Cowens and Geoff Petrie in the , Grant Hill and Jason Kidd in the , and Elton Brand and Steve Francis in the 1999–2000 season. Five players won the award {{unanimously}} (by capturing all of the first-place votes) – Ralph Sampson, David Robinson, Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard, and Karl-Anthony Towns.|$|E
5|$|Anchored by {{defensive}} stalwart Russell, {{the tough}} Celtics forced their opponents to take low-percentage shots from farther distances (there was no three-point arc at the time); misses were then often grabbed by perennial rebounding champion Russell, who then either {{passed it on}} to elite fast-break distributor Cousy or made the outlet pass himself, providing their sprinting colleagues opportunities for an easy slam dunk or layup. Auerbach also emphasized the need for role players like Frank Ramsey and John Havlicek, who became two of the first legitimate sixth men in NBA history, a role later succeeded in by Don Nelson. Auerbach's recipe proved devastating to the opposition. From 1957 to 1966, the Celtics won nine of ten NBA championships. This included eight consecutive championships—which is the longest championship streak in North American sports—and six victories over the Los Angeles Lakers of Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West in the NBA Finals. The streak also denied perennial scoring and rebounding champion <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> a title during Auerbach's coaching reign.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Russell {{was one of}} {{the first}} big earners in NBA basketball. His 1956 rookie {{contract}} was worth $24,000, only fractionally smaller than the $25,000 of top earner Bob Cousy. In contrast to other Celtics, who had to work in the offseason to maintain their standard of living (Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Auerbach invested in plastics and a Chinese restaurant), Russell never had to work part-time. When <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> became the first NBA player to earn $100,000 in salary in 1965, Russell went to Auerbach and demanded a $100,001 salary, which he promptly received. For his promotion to coach the Celtics paid Russell an annual salary of $25,000 which was in addition to his salary as a player; although the salary was touted in the press as a record for an NBA coach, it is unclear whether Russell's continued $100,001 salary as a player was included in the calculation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> {{received}} {{criticism for}} {{his inability to}} win lead Kansas to a win in the National Championship game; Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful in his life. He returned to Kansas for his junior year and to play another season under coach Dick Harp. Chamberlain quickly became frustrated with the opposing teams' way of playing him, which primarily consisted of double or triple teaming Chamberlain in order to limit his offensive production and effectiveness. In addition, many teams resorted to running out {{the time on the}} clock when in the lead against the Jayhawks to increase their odds of winning the game. After the Jayhawks failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament that year, Chamberlain decided to forgo his senior season to play with the Harlem Globetrotters. He did not return to Kansas' campus for over 40 years after leaving for the Globetrotters; he finally returned in 1998, the year before his death, when his jersey was retired.|$|E
5|$|Following the All-Star game, Wade {{recorded}} 50 {{points on}} 56.6% shooting and added 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a blow-out loss against the Orlando Magic. Wade became the fourth player in NBA history to score at least 50 points while his team lost {{by at least}} 20 in a game. The following game, Wade recorded a career-high 16 assists and added 31 points and 7 rebounds in a 103–91 win against the Detroit Pistons. Wade became the second player to record 15 or more assists after scoring at least 50 points since <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> did so in 1968. Two games later, Wade tied a franchise record with 24 points in the fourth quarter, as he led the Heat back from a 15-point deficit in the final nine minutes of the quarter to secure a 120–115 win over the New York Knicks. For the game, Wade recorded 46 points on 55% field goal shooting, 10 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks. Wade followed the performance with a second consecutive 40-point game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Playing against his Eastern Conference rival and good friend, LeBron James, Wade registered 41 points on 53% shooting, 9 assists, 7 steals, 7 rebounds and one block as the Heat lost 107–100. The following game, in former teammate Shaquille O'Neal's return to Miami since being traded, Wade tied a career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, 6 rebounds, a steal and a block, as the Heat defeated the Phoenix Suns 135–129. Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with at least 30 points and 15 assists. Less than a week later, Wade tied his franchise record with his 78th consecutive game of scoring in double figures in a double overtime thriller against the Chicago Bulls, in which he scored the game-winning three-point basket to secure a 130–127 win. Wade finished with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks in 50 minutes. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Wade joined <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> as the only other player in NBA history to score that many points and have that many assists in a game, while having as high of a field goal percentage. Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning and became the Heat's all-time leading scorer in a triple overtime classic against the Utah Jazz. Wade finished with 50 points, 10 rebounds, 9 assists, 4 steals, and 2 blocks in a 140–129 win.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} career playoff series, Davis {{averaged}} 31.5 points and 11.0 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game. Although swept by the overall number one seeded Golden State Warriors, {{who went on}} to win the NBA championship, Davis joined Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Karl Malone as the only players in the past 20 seasons to average 30 points and 10 rebounds in the playoffs. Davis also became the first player in 40 years to average 30 points and 10 rebounds in a player's first playoff series, with the only other players to do so being <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain,</b> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Bob McAdoo. At the end of the season, Davis finished 4th in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting, 5th in the NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting, sixth in the NBA Most Improved Player Award voting. He was selected to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career, becoming the first player to make the first team in his first three seasons since Derrick Rose did so in the 2010–11 NBA season. He was also an NBA All-Defensive Team second team selection.|$|E
5|$|In the 1963–64 season, the Royals {{achieved}} a 55–25 record, which put them {{second place in}} the Eastern Division. Under new coach Jack McMahon, Robertson flourished, {{and for the first time}} in his career, he had a decent supporting cast: second scoring option Jack Twyman was now supplemented by Jerry Lucas and Wayne Embry, and fellow guard Adrian Smith helped Robertson in the backcourt. Robertson led the NBA in free-throw percentage, scored a career-high 31.4 points per game, and averaged 9.9 rebounds and 11.0 assists per game. The averages for his first five NBA seasons are a triple-double: 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 10.6 assists per game. He won the NBA MVP award and became the only player other than Bill Russell and <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> to win it from 1960 to 1968. Robertson also won his second All-Star Game MVP award that year after scoring 26 points, grabbing 14 rebounds, and dishing off 8 assists in an East victory. In the postseason, the Royals defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, but then were dominated by the Celtics 4 games to 1.|$|E
5|$|Many {{basketball}} analysts, coaches, fans, {{and current}} and former players consider James {{to be one of}} the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall. He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season. With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain,</b> and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span. While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals. James has appeared in the Finals eight times and won three championships. Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that James usually performed well but was defeated by superior competition.|$|E
5|$|On the hardwood, he was {{considered}} the consummate defensive center, noted for his unmatched defensive intensity, his stellar basketball IQ and his sheer will to win. Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds. Opponent <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> said Russell's timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled. Russell “was the smartest player ever {{to play the game}} ” according to Bill Bradley, Russell’s erstwhile Knicks opponent writing in 2009. He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast break points. He also was known as a fine passer and pick-setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot and finished strong on alley oops. However, on offense, Russell's output was limited. His NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he was never {{the focal point of the}} Celtics offense, instead focusing on his tremendous defense.|$|E
5|$|The highest-scoring {{regular season}} game in {{regulation}} {{was between the}} Golden State Warriors and the Denver Nuggets on November 2, 1990. In that game, Golden State defeated Denver 162–158. The Warriors' Chris Mullin scored a game-high 38 points. The Nuggets were coached by Doug Moe from 1980 to 1990 and Paul Westhead from 1990 to 1992, both of whom employed a run and gun offensive strategy, which focuses on attempting {{a high number of}} field goals while also conceding a large number of points on defense. In fact, Moe's and Westhead's Nuggets were participants in five of the ten highest-scoring regular season games in NBA history. The Warriors were coached by Don Nelson from 1988 to 1995 and 2006 to 2010. He employed Nellie Ball, a style of run and gun that uses smaller, more athletic players to outrun opponents. Another notable high scoring regular season game is a March 2, 1962 game between the Philadelphia Warriors and the New York Knicks. In that game, the Warriors' <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> scored an NBA-record 100 points.|$|E
5|$|West {{ended his}} playing career with 14 All-Star, 12 All-NBA Team and five All-Defensive Team selections, and scored 25,192points, 6,238assists and 5,366rebounds in 932 games, {{translating}} {{to an average}} of 27.0points, 6.7assists and 5.8rebounds per game. Among retired players, only Michael Jordan, Elgin Baylor and <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> surpass his 27.0 points per game average. He led the Lakers in scoring in seven seasons, only Jordan had a higher career scoring average in the playoffs (33.5 versus 29.1). In 1979, West was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and the Lakers retired his No. 44 jersey in 1983. In March 2008, ESPN voted West the third greatest shooting guard of all time. As a coach, West led the Lakers into three consecutive playoff campaigns, and then went on to win seven NBA championships as a general manager, building the 1980s Lakers dynasty under coach Pat Riley and players Magic Johnson, Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy and the 2000s under coach Phil Jackson and players Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1957–58 season, Spivey spent 10 of his {{remaining}} 12 professional {{seasons in the}} EBL. The first two of those EBL seasons were spent with the Wilkes-Barre Barons, and Spivey led the team to consecutive league championships. On April 20, 1958, he scored 62points in the title-clinching game against the Easton Madisons, setting an EBL playoff record. In 1958–59, {{he became the first}} player in league history with a 1,000-point season, and had 64points in a March 1959 game. Along with his play in the EBL, Spivey reached an agreement to join the Ansonia Norwoods of the semi-professional Connecticut Basketball Association (CBA) in 1958. Over two years with the Norwoods, his points-per-game average exceeded 30.0. Spivey moved to the Baltimore Bullets for the 1959–60 season, and played two seasons for the club. In Spivey's first season with the Bullets, he had 36.3points per game, the highest average of his EBL career. Outside EBL competition, he received an opportunity to play opposite leading NBA center <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> in a 1960 exhibition game, held in Milford, Connecticut, against the CBA's Milford Chiefs. Spivey had a 30-point, 23-rebound performance; his statistics were comparable to those of Chamberlain, who recorded a 31-point, 27-rebound game.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1964–65 NBA season, West averaged 31.0points (at the time, a career-high), only surpassed by perennial scoring champion <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain.</b> After ending {{the regular season}} with 49 wins, L.A. played the Baltimore Bullets {{in the first round}} of the 1965 NBA Playoffs, but then team captain Baylor suffered a career-threatening knee injury. West spectacularly took over Baylor's leader role, as he scored 49points and willed the shocked Lakers to the win. In Game 2, Baltimore was unable to stop the Lakers guard, who scored 52points, nearly half of L.A.'stotal, in the 118–115 win. The Bullets took their two home games, despite West scoring 44 and 48points respectively, but in the decisive Game 5 in L.A., the guard helped beat the Bullets with 42points in a close 117–115 win. West averaged 46.3points per game, a figure that is still an NBA record. However, in the 1965 NBA Finals, the Celtics easily beat the short-handed Lakers, 4–1. In Game 1, which Boston easily won, defensive Celtics guard K. C. Jones kept West to only 26points, and in Game 2, West scored 45points, but Boston still won 129–123. In Game 3, West scored 49points, and L.A. finally won a game, but in Games 4 and 5, the Lakers were beaten by double digits; in the last quarter of Game 5, West missed 14 of 15 shots and could not prevent yet another Celtics win. Still, the Lakers guard finished the playoffs with 40.6points per game.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 1968, {{the team}} {{acquired}} <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers. In {{his first season}} as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1rpg. West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division. The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston {{for the first time}} in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points, and had a 3–2 lead after five. Boston won the series in seven games however, and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons. West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award. In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2ppg, the team returned to the finals, and {{for the first time in}} 16 years, they did not have to face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3. The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} NBA full season (1957–58), Russell {{became the first}} player in NBA history to average more than 20 rebounds per game for an entire season, a feat he {{accomplished}} 10 times in his 13 seasons. Russell's 51 rebounds in a single game is the second-highest performance ever, only trailing Chamberlain's all-time record of 55. He still holds the NBA record for rebounds in one half with 32 (vs. Philadelphia, on November 16, 1957). Career-wise in rebounds, Russell ranks second to <b>Wilt</b> <b>Chamberlain</b> in regular season total (21,620) and average per game (22.5), and he led the NBA in average rebounds per game four times. Russell is the all-time playoff leader in total (4,104) and average (24.9) rebounds per game, he grabbed 40 rebounds in three separate playoff games (twice in the NBA Finals), and he never failed to average at least 20 rebounds per game in any of his 13 post-season campaigns. Russell also had seven regular season games with 40 or more rebounds, the NBA Finals record for highest rebound per game average (29.5 rpg, 1959) and by a rookie (22.9 rpg, 1957). In addition, Russell holds the NBA Finals single-game record for most rebounds (40, March 29, 1960, vs. St. Louis, and April 18, 1962, vs. Los Angeles), most rebounds in a quarter (19, April 18, 1962 vs. Los Angeles), and most consecutive games with 20 or more rebounds (15 from April 9, 1960 – April 16, 1963). He also had 51 in one game, 49 in two others, and twelve straight seasons of 1,000 or more rebounds. Russell was {{known as one of}} the most clutch players in the NBA. He played in 11 deciding games (10 times in Game 7s, once in a Game 5), and ended with a flawless 11–0 record. In these eleven games, Russell averaged 18 points and 29.45 rebounds.|$|E
