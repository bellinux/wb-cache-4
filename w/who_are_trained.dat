He discovers {{that the world is}} ruled by humanoid apes who speak English, use domesticated horses for transportation, and treat human beings as slaves.|$|E
5|$|La Masia is {{also the}} name of FC Barcelona's {{football}} training facilities, originally located near the Camp Nou in the Les Corts district of Barcelona. The original building itself was an ancient country residence (In Catalan: masia) built in 1702, and once Camp Nou was inaugurated in 1957, the building was remodelled and extended for use as the club's social headquarters. With the gradual expansion of the club, the building became too small for headquarters, and on 20 October 1979, La Masia was converted into a dormitory for young players from outside Barcelona. On 30 June 2011, the Masia building ceased housing the young sportsmen <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>trained</b> {{to become a part}} of the club’s professional teams. In a simple ceremony, the doors were closed and the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper took over the function of the residential center for the youngsters.|$|E

The experimental study with 2 x 2 factorial designs was conducted at the Regional Labor Training Centre of West Jakarta with training participants of the center involved as subjects of the study. The study {{has been focused on}} four Research Questions: (1) Is there any significant difference in the environmental-based attitude of prospective labors <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with fieldtrip strategy and those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with group discussion strategy?; (2) Is there any significant difference in the environmental-based attitude of prospective labors with high level of knowledge of basic concepts of ecology <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with fieldtrip strategy and those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with group discussion strategy?; (3) Is there any in the environmental-based attitude of prospective labors with low level of knowledge of basic concepts of ecology <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with fieldtrip strategy and those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with group discussion strategy?; and (4) Is there any interactions between the effect of training strategies and knowledge of basic concepts of ecology on the environmental-based attitude of prospective labors?Findings of the study signify that (1) there is {{no significant difference in the}} environmental-based attitude of prospective labors <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with fieldtrip strategy and those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with group discussion strategy; (2) prospective labors with high level of knowledge of basic concepts of ecology <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with fieldtrip strategy show better environmental-based attitude compared to those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with group discussion strategy; (3) prospective labors with low level of knowledge of basic concepts of ecology <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with group discussion strategy show better environmental-based attitude compared to those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> with fieldtrip strategy; and (4) there is an interaction between training strategies and knowledge of basic concepts of ecology on the environmental-based attitude of prospective labors. To sum up, to promote better environmental-based attitude of prospective labors requires appropriate <b>training</b> strategies that <b>is</b> determined by carefully considering their knowledge level on basic concepts of ecology...|$|R

25|$|In recent years, the {{popularity}} {{and interest in}} food and wine pairings have increased and taken on new connotations. Industries have sprung up with print publications and media dedicated to expounding on the principles and ideals of pairing the perfect wine with the perfect dish. In the restaurant industry, {{there is often a}} dedicated individual or staff of sommeliers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>trained</b> to recommend wine pairings with the restaurant's fare. The origins of this recent phenomenon {{can be traced to the}} United States in the 1980s when the wine industry began to advertise wine-drinking as a component of dining rather than as just an alcoholic beverage meant for consumption and intoxication. Winemakers started to emphasize the kind of food dishes that their wines would go well with, some even printing pairing suggestions on back wine labels. Food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{ambulances}} became largely {{municipal services}} {{shortly after the}} end of World War II. Training was frequently conducted internally, although national levels of coordination led to more standardization of staff training. As of 2010, public ambulance services were operated by regional entities, most often trusts, under the authority of the National Health Service, with significant standardization of training and skills. The UK model utilizes three levels of ambulance staff: internally trained Emergency Care Assistants, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>trained</b> to provide support and assistance to their Ambulance Technician and Paramedic colleagues, Ambulance Technicians, which are similar to EMTs in the US, and Paramedics with advanced life support skills. Initially, paramedics were mainly trained internally, with experienced ambulance technicians often progressing to the role of paramedic. Increasingly, however, university qualifications are being expected for paramedics, with the entry level being an Honours Bachelor of Science degree in Pre-Hospital or Paramedic Care. Some British paramedics have gone on to become Paramedic Practitioners, a role that practices independently in the pre-hospital environment in a capacity similar to that of a nurse practitioner, but with more of an acute care orientation.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this can be seen in Sierra Leone, Africa where young girls are {{mutilated}} every year. The number of girls mutilated in Africa per year has risen to 3 million. Rugiatu Turay, founder of the Amazonian Initiative Movement, protects young girls from being circumcised by other women in secret societies like Sande and other female practitioners who still engage in the ceremonial tradition today. Girls as young as the age of five assist in the mutilation of other young girls in the country. At the age of 12, Turay was snatched by female family members, held down and had her clitoris cut off with a knife. She was beaten, forced to walk, and had hot pepper water poured in her eyes. As she was mutilated, the women sang, danced, and clap ceremoniously. According to these women, Turay had become a woman. However, females are generally mutilated under the age of 15. Girls <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>trained</b> to assist in this ceremony are trained as young as five years old. Turay has convinced 400 practitioners to stop the practice of female mutilation, but 97 million females have been mutilated within the country and the numbers remain constant, even increasing. The practice has been enforced by politicians within the country and locals refer to the practice as a ceremony that initiates womanhood, prepares females for marriage, and restricts their sexual conduct.|$|E
