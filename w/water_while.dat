5|$|In {{order for}} the heated water to form a geyser, a {{plumbing}} system made of fractures, fissures, porous spaces, and sometimes cavities is required. This includes a reservoir to hold the <b>water</b> <b>while</b> it is being heated. Geysers are generally aligned along faults. Constrictions in the system {{are essential to the}} building up of pressure before an eruption.|$|E
5|$|To {{capture the}} straight-on {{shot of the}} shower head, the camera had to be {{equipped}} with a long lens. The inner holes on the shower head were blocked and the camera placed a sufficient distance away so that the <b>water,</b> <b>while</b> appearing to be aimed directly at the lens, actually went around and past it.|$|E
5|$|A {{reflective}} layer behind the tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons of visible light, enhancing vision in low-light conditions. A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through <b>water,</b> <b>while</b> the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.|$|E

The {{partially}} dressed bodies of all three women indicated that the underlying crime was sexual assault. All three victims had ropes tied around their necks with a concrete block {{at the other end}} to ensure they died from either suffocation or drowning, and that their bodies would never be found. However, the bodies bloated as a result of decomposition, and floated to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of <b>water</b> <b>while</b> feeding. The throat pleats extend from the mouth to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E
5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be <b>water.</b> <b>While</b> surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport.|$|E

5|$|Harmless watersnakes of {{the genus}} Nerodia are often mistaken for it. These are also semiaquatic, thick-bodied snakes with large heads that can be {{aggressive}} when provoked, but they behave differently. For example, watersnakes usually flee quickly into the <b>water,</b> <b>while</b> A. piscivorus often stands its ground with its threat display. In addition, watersnakes do not vibrate their tails when excited. A. piscivorus usually holds its head at an angle around 45° when swimming or crawling.|$|E
5|$|Like many powders, {{dysprosium}} powder {{may present}} an explosion hazard when {{mixed with air}} and when an ignition source is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by static electricity. Dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water. It can react with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas. Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished with <b>water,</b> <b>while</b> dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable. Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO3)3, is a strong oxidizing agent and will readily ignite on contact with organic substances.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{was born}} on 7 or 8 December 1542 at Linlithgow Palace, Scotland, to King James V and his French second wife, Mary of Guise. She {{was said to have}} been born prematurely and was the only {{legitimate}} child of James to survive him. She was the great-niece of King Henry VIII of England, as her paternal grandmother, Margaret Tudor, was Henry VIII's sister. On 14December, six days after her birth, she became Queen of Scots when her father died, perhaps from the effects of a nervous collapse following the Battle of Solway Moss, or from drinking contaminated <b>water</b> <b>while</b> on campaign.|$|E

5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats {{to expand}} their mouths, which allow them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need to build up water pressure in order {{to expand their}} mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the <b>water</b> <b>while</b> doing this.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} energy {{released}} by oxidative phosphorylation is high, compared with the amount produced by anaerobic fermentation. Glycolysis produces only 2 ATP molecules, but somewhere between 30 and 36 ATPs are produced by the oxidative phosphorylation of the 10 NADH and 2 succinate molecules made by converting one molecule of glucose to carbon dioxide and <b>water,</b> <b>while</b> each cycle of beta oxidation of a fatty acid yields about 14 ATPs. These ATP yields are theoretical maximum values; in practice, some protons leak across the membrane, lowering the yield of ATP.|$|E

5|$|The impala {{occurs in}} {{woodlands}} and sometimes {{on the interface}} (ecotone) between woodlands and savannahs; it inhabits places close to <b>water.</b> <b>While</b> the black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia, the common impala is widespread across its range and has been reintroduced in Gabon and southern Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the impala as a species of least concern; the black-faced subspecies has been classified as a vulnerable species, with less than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild as of 2008.|$|E

5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of <b>water</b> <b>while</b> they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.|$|E
5|$|Although sharks rarely bite humans, {{the tiger}} shark is {{reported}} to be responsible for a large percentage of fatal shark bite incidents, and is sometimes {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous shark species. They often visit shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans. The tiger shark also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich <b>water.</b> <b>While</b> the tiger shark is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans, its bite rate is low. It is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans, with the great white shark being first. On average, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii, but they are rarely fatal. This bite rate is very low considering thousands of people swim, surf, and dive in Hawaiian waters every day. Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.|$|E
5|$|At the Horn Island {{lighthouse}}, {{the lighthouse}} keeper was killed {{along with his}} wife and daughter due to the hurricane. In addition to the death of the three at the lighthouse, it was noted that the schooner Daisy had been dismantled there, with one person killed. A person who was climbing a small tree was thrown away by the wind and drowned. Several people were trapped in their homes after a creek topped its banks. A warehouse and four other buildings were destroyed, while a bank's roof was blown off. A train near Brookhaven was washed away along the tracks of the Mississippi Central Railroad, resulting in the injury of five people. 25 schooners along the Mississippi coastline were completely destroyed. Two barks, the Nurnberg and Hercules were destroyed during the hurricane. Mandeline, owned by Norway, was filled with <b>water,</b> <b>while</b> Sigrav suffered severe damage, completely torn apart. A boat known as the Florine was washed ashore. A total of 78fatalities occurred.|$|E
