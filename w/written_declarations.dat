50|$|The {{massacre}} of the Hindu population started on 10 October, {{on the day}} of Kojagari Lakshmi Puja, and continued unabated for about a week. It is estimated that a minimum of more than 5,000 Hindus were killed, hundreds of Hindu women were raped and thousands of Hindu men and women were forcibly converted to Islam. Around 50,000 to 75,000 survivors were sheltered in temporary relief camps in Comilla, Chandpur, Agartala and other places. Around 50,000 Hindus remained marooned in the affected areas under the strict surveillance of the Muslims, where the administration had no say. In some areas, Hindus had to obtain permits from the Muslim leaders in order to travel outside their villages. The forcibly converted Hindus were coerced to give <b>written</b> <b>declarations</b> that they had converted to Islam of their own free will. Sometimes they were confined in others' houses and only allowed to be in their own house when an official party came for inspection.

"About {{halfway between}} the towns of Uceda and Torrelaguna {{and to the left}} of the road is a large pass in the mountains, which seals a small valley, called [...] " [...] The Place of The Patones [...] " [...] It is the scene of a legend which is as follows: In the unfortunate age in which the Saracens became masters of Spain, we know that many of our {{inhabitants}} fled to the mountains and the most hidden nooks and crannies therein. Some good Christian Goths fled to this area, in search of refuge from their fierce and ruthless enemies in this rough and rugged country. Here they found asylum from the worst savagery of Muslim power, maintaining their customs, beliefs and sustaining themselves by hunting, fishing, beekeeping, herding of goats and growing of some rye crop, as they do now.These men, who were called Patones chose a wise person from a family of integrity to govern and decide their disputes, so were keeping from century to century an hereditary government, calling their chief the [...] "King of the Patones". Is this not the most curious thing that, Spain having regained its former freedom, and fully shaken off the yoke of the Saracens, that here should have been preserved among the Patones this kind of government (rather than subordinating themselves to the Spanish Court) surviving into modern times when the last king of Patones was known to have gone to Torrelaguna to sell bundles wood, and where he was known to several individuals to whom I have spoken.This man, who was peaceful and adverse to gossip, kept accounts and managed the estates of his subjects according to tradition - a flood of legal formulas of his kingdom where trials were entirely verbal, lacking <b>written</b> <b>declarations,</b> formal transactions or recorded judgments. Finally, when the occupation of government became so onerous as to impede his own subsistence, so he abdicated his throne, leaving Patones without a shepherd, until were placed under the jurisdiction of district of Uceda, in which municipality the Kingdom of the Patones is now administered.The subjects of this tiny kingdom thus lost many significant and ancient privileges, which is no small consideration when the Royal Council of Spain issues decrees and orders to the captain-generals, governors and justices, and wrote separately that ancient village, addressing its governor as: [...] "The King of Patones." [...] It should no laughing matter that this may well be tested in Madrid in some respects and even, I have understood that His Majesty, Don Fernando VI, who wanted to inquire about some unusual circumstances of the kingdom of Patones ... How many moral and political reflections spring to mind! A hereditary kingdom of a thousand years at least, ruled in profound peace, with no other rules save that of natural reason, a kingdom preserved in the middle of Spain, which was unable to accept the Koran, nor such errors more lately visited upon us, a kingdom happy within its own narrow limits, without other influence, obligation or need other than to cultivate their lands, the children obedient to their parents, and all subject to the ordinances of their king [...].Therefore be advised, dear readers of this unique purposeful and enduring Platonic monarchy, and wonder how is it possible that there it was, but twelve leagues distant from Madrid, unknown, or at least its spirit unremarked? I wonder no more, for now I have spoken thereof. We know that our curiosity leads us to investigate what happens to two or three thousand leagues distant, ignoring that which seems familiar, merely because is in our own house [...]. [...] " ...|$|E

40|$|The social {{dimension}} in the EU, explored through the document {{texts of the}} Treaty of Rome, the Lisbon Strategy, the Social Policy Agenda and the Swedish Strategy Report This paper explores the {{social dimension}} of EU social policy, except the aspects {{of the economic and}} labour market. The EU documents reveal an underlying line of thought stemming from the alignment of the six founding countries, spearheaded by France, with the conservative corporatist welfare model. As one of four European welfare models, the conservative corporatist model emphasises labour market issues, corporate social responsibility and the subsidiarity principle in EU social policy. It also influences how the texts define the terms social, social policy and social exclusion. The definitions determine how policymakers combat problems such as social exclusion and identify the policy issues to be included in EU social policy. The Swedish Strategy shows how the country is responding to the objectives that it has been assigned by the EU and how it plans to attain them. Other key issues include how Sweden defines and plans {{to address the problem of}} social exclusion domestically. The Lisbon Strategy and the Social Policy Agenda of the EU underline the importance of civil trust. Accordingly, I have included Bo Rothstein's theory of social trust, which demonstrates that open dialogue with citizens and <b>written</b> <b>declarations</b> of cooperation in the EU are not enough. Actions that instil trust and impartial universal institutions are also required for the European project to work. Thus, civil trust in the EU requires the existence of such institutions. ...|$|E

40|$|It is now {{generally}} accepted {{that in the}} rise and subsequent evolution of mass communication, some sustained classical entities have played a crucial and formative role: these are official epistles, declarative letters, and publicly circulated written decrees, agreements and covenants-all of which are found in organized societies prior to {{the widespread use of}} paper. Focusing on the period of Islamic history know as the Age of the Rightly Guided Caliphs (Rashid), this thesis studies the journalistic and mass communicative functions and characteristics of these entities, arguing that such pre-Paper epistles and agreements etc. were no less than structured information documents for wide public consumption and cannot be overlooked of we are to explain the historic antecedents of the modern world of mass media. Research in this area is fundamentally important both from the viewpoints of political history and mass communication, since such research illuminates both, and since it has still not been conducted in earnest, though there do exist passing mentions of pre-paper documents of public communication in some histories of journalism. This is then, promises to accomplish three things: 1) to fill a research lacuna: 2) to ask fresh historical and journalistic questions arising from a critical study of formal letters, <b>written</b> <b>declarations,</b> covenants and similar documents belonging to the Rashidin period: and 3) to open up new avenues for explaining the very powerful phenomenon of the modem-day media. This research undertaking is mainly based on primary sources. Therefore by far the largest body of sources used for this thesis consists of medieval Arabic works, many of which are now available in modern editions. The reliance on primary material is such that this whole research may well be considered to be grounded essentially on historical Arabic writings. Quite often, we note, these writings assume the narrative character of Hadith compilers, in addition to primary Arabic works secondary sources have also been consulted for this thesis: many of this, in turn, drawing upon primary materials. Not only secondary writings and research data in English language (and, indirectly, in other modern Western languages) have been examined but also a large number of Urdu writings also form the bibliographic source of this work...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo desta pesquisa é analisar a contribuição de uma prática de ensino orientada pela Psicanálise e pela Psicologia Escolar, realizada em grupos de formação para educadores na instituição Espaço Pedagógico. Toma-se como perspectiva compreender a natureza das contribuições que esta prática tem proporcionado na construção de mudanças profissionais e pessoais, aos educadores que dela participam. As fontes de dados dessa pesquisa são os registros escritos pelos educadores, alunos dos cursos de formação, bem como registros de diário do {{professor}} no período de 1992 a 2001. Dentre um montante de 378 documentos, foram selecionadas dois para serem detalhadamente analisados. A análise do material foi feita a partir do referencial teórico da Psicanálise, destacando a presença de mudanças na posição subjetiva do aluno-educador frente ao ato de ensinar e aprender, ocorridas dentro de um grupo e numa instituição, representadas nos depoimentos orais e escritos. Para tanto, consideramos nos textos as ênfases dadas pelos alunos-educadores em determinadas temáticas e questões, os temas recorrentes, as repetições, denegações, lapsos e hesitações. Procuramos marcar as posições subjetivas ocupadas pelos alunos-educadores em seus discursos, analisando as conseqüências profissionais e pessoais que decorrem da posição em que se colocam, bem como das posições que delegam ao outro. Para tal apresentou-se as falas iniciais dos alunos-educadores, seguidas das intervenções feitas pelo professor do curso de formação, juntamente com a intervenção dos outros membros do grupo. O intuito foi identificar os efeitos produzidos, através das intervenções sofridas pelos alunos-educadores, nas suas posições subjetivas. A pesquisa demonstrou que a maneira de ensinar, orientada pela Psicanálise, juntamente com os temas desenvolvidos ao longo do curso de formação, impulsionam a problematização da prática dos educadores, configurando-se como temas que podem convocar a subjetividade dos mesmos, abrindo a possibilidade para mudanças na posição subjetiva, que por sua vez, incidem em mudanças no ambiente profissional. Conclui-se que esta prática articula os campos da Psicologia Escolar em uma perspectiva crítica, da Educação e da Psicanálise, constituindo um lugar próprio e intermediário entre os três campos. The aim of {{this research}} is to analyze the contribution of teaching practice oriented by Psychoanalysis and by Scholastic Psychology performed in groups of educators training at the Espaço Pedagógico institution. What is taken as a perspective is {{to understand the nature of}} contributions that this practice has offered in the performance of professional and personal changes for the educators who participate in it. The data sources of this research are the registers written by the educators, students of the training courses, as well as teachers daily registers from 1992 to 2001. Among 378 documents, two have been selected for detailed analysis. The analysis of the material has been done based on the theoretical reference of Psychoanalysis, highlighting the occurrence of changes in the subjective student-educator position to be formally considered in relation to the act of teaching and learning which took place in a group and in an institution, represented in the oral and <b>written</b> <b>declarations.</b> For this purpose we have considered in the texts the emphasis given by the educator-students with regard to certain themes and matters, the recurrent themes, the repetitions, denials, lapses and hesitations. We have tried to point out the subjective positions defended by the educator-students in their discourses, evaluating the professional and personal consequences that follow the position in which they place themselves, as well as the positions they delegate to others. Aiming at this the initial speakings of the educator-students were presented, followed by the interventions performed by the teacher of the training course along with the intervention performed by other members of the group. The intention was to identify the effects produced by means of the interventions that were posed to the educator-students in their subjective positions. The research has demonstrated that the manner of teaching oriented by psychoanalysis along with the themes developed during the training course stimulate the problematics of the practice of the educators, being configured as themes that can raise the subjectivity of the latter, giving room to the possibility for changes in the subjective position which, in turn, cause changes in the professional environment. Its concluded that such practice articulates the fields of Scholastic Psychology in a critical perspective, as well as the ones of Education and Psychoanalysis, constituting its own and intermediate place among the three fields...|$|E
