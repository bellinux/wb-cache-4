500|$|The ride {{experience}} was different in its earlier years. Passengers would enter under {{the middle of}} the coaster's lift. After entering an eerie space soundtrack played. The first room was [...] "Mission Control". Black lights lit the room. Travel posters and a rocket diagram were on the side walls. Two airport loading gates were seen next to two TV monitors (showing the head of the company [...] "The Dispatch Master" [...] or random space pilots) and were on either side of a desk in the middle. An employee sitting at the desk <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> riders that the loading gates on were both malfunctioning and the riders had to be rerouted through the [...] "service rooms" [...] of the hangar. Walking into the next room deemed [...] "Rocket Recovery", guests would see a [...] "rocket locator" [...] robot named [...] "Dave" [...] working up on a platform at a terminal trying to contact the companies rockets (one according to him crashed outside of Akron). Walking down another hallway, guests could glance at crates inside of a warehouse within the building. After the short hallway, guests entered the [...] "Repair Bay". A room showcasing a [...] "binocular security camera" [...] robot named [...] "Franc" [...] looking around the room (he was later removed). There were also suspended conveyor baskets carrying various items, a high voltage generator, pneumatic robotic arms [...] "repairing" [...] a rocket, and a security scanner that flashed [...] "REJECT" [...] after scanning guests.A small room outside the Repair Bay had the company's logo subtlety broken to reveal the ride's true name. Entering the [...] "Launch Area" [...] rockets moved from behind a curtain without passengers. After ten people loaded on a rocket the ride began. The rocket moved out on a block section where an [...] "on-board computer" [...] welcomed you and started the [...] "automatic launch sequence". Two spinning laser light spheres projected a star field around the rocket as it climbed the lift. Upon reaching the top your computer takes notice of nearby [...] "space pirates" [...] and begins to perform abrasive maneuvers. As riders went through the coaster, they would see exploding rockets, meteors, laser projections, and a satellite that shot lasers. Your on-board computer shouts [...] "I'm losing control, I'm losing control!" [...] before an Alaskan landscape came into view and the rockets entered the brake run. Riders entered the unloading station where they were greeted by an employee that yells [...] "WELCOME TO ALASKA!" [...] The riders disembarked their vehicle and exited on the left.|$|E

Rabbi Hunia omitted the word [...] "I" [...] ( [...] , anoki) and substituted God's special secret name ( [...] , the Shem HaMephorash).|$|E

"Riba in the pre-Islamic period {{consisted}} of the doubling and redoubling , and in the age [...] At maturity, the creditor <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> debtor, ‘Will you pay me, or increase ’? If the debtor had anything, he would pay. Otherwise, {{the age of the}} cattle [...] would be increased ... If the debt was money or a commodity, the debt would be doubled to be paid in one year, and even then, if the debtor could not pay, it would be doubled again; one hundred in one year would become two hundred. If that was not paid, the debt would increase to four hundred. Each year the debt would be doubled." ...|$|E
2500|$|At a press conference, Deputy Chief Constable Doug LePard of the VPD {{apologized to}} the victims' families, saying [...] "I wish {{from the bottom of}} my heart that we would have caught him sooner. I wish that, the several {{agencies}} involved, that we could have done better in so many ways. I wish that all the mistakes that were made, we could undo. And I wish that more lives would have been saved. So on my behalf and behalf of the Vancouver Police Department and all the men and women that worked on this investigation, I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> families how sorry we all are for your losses and because we did not catch this monster sooner." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Johnston, {{a son of}} James, {{devised a}} test for the witch, {{something}} no one outside his family would know, asking the entity what his Dutch step-grandmother in North Carolina <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> slaves if she thought they did something wrong. The witch replied with his grandmother's accent, [...] "Hut tut, what has happened now?" [...] On another occasion, an Englishman stopped to visit and offered to investigate. On remarking on his family overseas, the witch suddenly began to mimic his English parents. Again at early morning, the witch woke him to voices of his parents worried as they had heard his voice as well. The Englishman quickly left that morning and later wrote to the Bell family the entity had visited his family in England and apologized for his skepticism.|$|E

60|$|Stoutenburg {{had every}} reason to congratulate himself on his shrewd guess, for at his words all {{resistance}} on the girl's part vanished, and though she began to tremble in every limb and even for a moment seemed ready to swoon, she murmured words which if incoherent certainly sounded submissive, and then silently led the way upstairs.

6000|$|... "Ay, I {{guess how}} it is," [...] said Trois Eschelles; [...] "our patron {{is like the}} old Kaisers of Rome, who, when things came to an extremity, or, as we <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ladder foot with them, were wont to select from their own ministers of justice some {{experienced}} person, who might spare their sacred persons from the awkward attempts of a novice, or blunderer in our mystery.

6000|$|His valet, {{coming in}} to prepare him for dinner, found him asleep. He had for the old man as much admiration as may be felt for one who cannot put his own {{trousers}} on.

60|$|On the day fixed a close {{carriage}} awaited {{them at the}} Dillsborough Station. They arrived both {{dressed in}} black and both veiled,--and with but one maid between them. This arrangement had been made with some vague idea of escaping scrutiny rather than from economy. They had never hitherto been known to go anywhere without one apiece. There were no airs on the station now as on that former occasion,--no loud talking; not even a word spoken.
