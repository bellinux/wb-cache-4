5|$|A <b>well</b> <b>organized</b> {{tropical}} wave over northern Africa {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean on May 31. The wave never {{showed signs of}} organization while crossing the Atlantic. It emerged into the eastern north Pacific on June 10. It was not until June 13 when the convection associated with the wave became better organized. On June 14, Tropical Depression Two-E formed at a location about 515.7miles (830km) from Acapulco, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{decrease}} in convection shortly after forming, the large depression remained <b>well</b> <b>organized,</b> with a wind field 575mi (930km) in diameter. On August 22, as it passed 140mi (225km) to south of the Cape Verde islands, deep convection developed over the center of circulation, and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Debby about 300mi (485km) southwest of Cape Verde. Banding features continued to organize as the system slowly strengthened, and on August 23 Debby attained a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters predicted Debby to continue to intensify to attain hurricane status, while its projected path placed the storm {{in an area of}} warm water temperatures and moderate upper level shear.|$|E

5|$|In late July2003, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather {{began to}} persist northwest of Chuuk in the Philippine Sea, and was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) early on July30. As atmospheric conditions remained favorable throughout the day's duration, the system organized, and was upgraded to tropical depression status by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) at 0600UTC on July31, followed by the JTWC at 0600UTC and Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) six hours later. The PAGASA consequently named the system Juaning for local purposes. Tracking north-northwestward {{under the influence of}} a passing trough, the system intensified further into a tropical storm by 0600UTC on August2, thus receiving the name Morakot. At the time, the storm was <b>well</b> <b>organized</b> with a steady outflow pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} <b>well</b> <b>organized</b> for defense, {{and in the}} Battle for Brest Middleton's units went about {{capturing}} it methodically. The defense {{of the city was}} under German Generalleutnant Hermann Ramcke with whom Middleton carried on a dialog during the siege. Ramcke sent Middleton a map showing where several hundred American prisoners were being held in the city, but also slyly placed on the map a number of red crosses where the Allies knew some good bombing targets were located, such as ammunition depots. Middleton wrote back to Ramcke telling him to remove some of the bogus red crosses, or some terms of the Geneva Convention might have to be ignored. Middleton also reminded Ramcke of the Allies' superior artillery and air power.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August28 and entered into the Atlantic Ocean. Initially, the wave had moderate amounts of deep convection and was already <b>well</b> <b>organized,</b> which allowed it to quickly become a tropical cyclone. Based on ship reports, the wave was classified as Tropical Depression Ten beginning at 1200UTC on August30. Located 1,000miles (1,609km) southeast of Tropical Storm Felix, the depression tracked westward as a high pressure ridge formed between the two storms. Satellite imagery showed the depression developing a good outflow pattern. As a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gabrielle on August31. It was noted that by as early as 1200UTC later that day, Gabrielle was already rather large and well-defined. Gabrielle continued to move westward at 17mph (27km/h), and by early on September1, the storm was upgraded to a hurricane. However, the storm was not operationally upgraded to a hurricane until late on September2; Gabrielle was then located about 625miles (1006km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E
