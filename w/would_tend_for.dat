Women farmers <b>would</b> <b>tend</b> crops <b>for</b> $1.20 a day, compared to the going rate of $2.00 a day for male labor. There was some resistance in the community to using women laborers. Governor Emerson Harrington gave {{a speech at the}} mansion porch in support of the efforts in July 1918. Troops were also able to live at the house and commute to war-effort jobs. Most of Baker's ships were lost in the war. He died later that year in California.|$|R

The {{children}} <b>would</b> usually <b>tend</b> <b>for</b> both {{the home and the}} store. Jerry usually helped Sam make deliveries of music and instruments around New York, Paul would help out within the store with Marcia, and Marcia would also help out around the house. During this time, Sam’s son Jerry joined the army and the family moved the store once again. It was now located in 236 Utica Avenue Brooklyn, only this time they owned the whole building and no longer had to rent. When Sam's son Jerry came home, Jerry married Bernice. Later Paul, like his brother Jerry, joined the army for three years.|$|R
30|$|Bias in the unchanged-pixel mean {{represents}} average phenological difference or possible {{atmospheric effects}} between acquisitions, when known causes of change (e.g. land use, fire, infestation, or snow) are avoided in sampling. If beta variation within unburned is spatially uniform (unlike Figure 7), the biased distribution is approximately normal {{with a standard}} deviation ca. < 50 (Figure 8 center). In those cases, the unchanged-pixel statistics can be used to calibrate one dNBR to another, by subtracting the bias from the dNBR dataset. Then, the adjusted unburned distribution has a mean of zero to better represent no ecological change due to fire. Figure 8 center is a case where shifting the dNBR by about + 25 points would be warranted, due to the normal distribution and relatively low standard deviation. This <b>would</b> <b>tend</b> to compensate <b>for</b> the ecological difference between scenes that was not related to fire, and make fire-caused change more directly comparable between the dNBR datasets.|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli grew {{exponentially}} at {{a reduced}} {{rate in the}} presence of 50 or 100 μg of trimethoprim/ml if the low-molecular-weight products of folate metabolism or their precursors (thymidine, purines, methionine, glycine, and pantothenate) were supplied in the medium. Folate metabolism was inhibited 99. 9 % by these concentrations of trimethoprim, but a low level of formylation of methionyl transfer ribonucleic acid (met-tRNAF) could be detected. However, in a medium containing all major amino acids, nucleosides, and vitamins, formylation of met-tRNAF was undetectable {{in the presence of}} trimethoprim. No other amino-masked amino acids were detected, and methionine remained a major amino-terminal amino acid of mature proteins. met-tRNAF was rapidly labeled with exogenous methionine and was associated with 30 s ribosomal subunits and 70 s ribosomes. It was concluded that initiation of protein synthesis can occur with unformylated met-tRNAF in E. coli. Changes in macromolecular composition were associated with the lack of formylation, in particular a fourfold increase in both met-tRNAF and ribosomal subunits. These changes <b>would</b> <b>tend</b> to compensate <b>for</b> the low specific rate of initiation with unformylated met-tRNAF...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a general}} notion in the {{literature}} that, with increasing latitude, trees have deeper crowns {{as a result of}} a lower solar elevation angle. However, these predictions are based on models that did not include the effects of competition for light between individuals. Here, I argue that there should be selection for trees to increase the height of the crown base, as this decreases shading by neighbouring trees, leading to an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). Because the level of between-tree shading increases with decreasing solar angle, the predicted ESS will shift to higher crown base height. This argument is supported by a simulation model to check for the effects of crown shape and the change of light intensity that occurs with changing solar angle on model outcomes. So, the lower solar angle at higher latitudes <b>would</b> <b>tend</b> to select <b>for</b> shallower, and not deeper, crowns. This casts doubt on the common belief that a decreasing solar angle increases crown depth. More importantly, it shows that different assumptions about what should be optimized can lead to different predictions, not just for absolute trait values, but for the direction of selection itself. 8 page(s...|$|R
