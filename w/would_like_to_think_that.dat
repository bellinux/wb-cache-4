But I think that's half the picture. It has as much as {{to do with the}} survival of temperament. There are few people still working now that started when I did. Not many people have the temperament to deal with that." ...|$|E

I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you do not cherish any ill-will against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> over, Emery," [...] said de Marmont thoughtfully. [...] "As you say, we of the Bonapartist Club at Grenoble have spies {{inside the}} Hôtel de Ville. We must {{try and find}} out what Fourier means to do as soon as he realises that the Emperor is marching on Grenoble: and then we must act {{accordingly}} and trust to luck and good fortune." ...|$|E

60|$|Not {{far away}} is another equestrian statue, which {{never failed to}} give me a start, when I {{suddenly}} came upon it in a cab. It looked for an instant quite like many statues of George Washington, as it swept the air with its doffed hat, but a second glance always showed it the effigy of George the Third, bowing to posterity with a gracious eighteenth-century majesty. If it were possible, one <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the resemblance mentioned had grown upon it, and that it in the case of Americans was the poor king's ultimate concession to the good-feeling which seems to be reuniting the people he divided.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked by}} Stephen Colbert in 2009 {{if there was}} a leader in the gay {{community}} on par with Martin Luther King, Fouratt said, [...] "Well, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I'm that leader." ...|$|E
5000|$|Wendy Woods said of {{the closure}} {{at the time that}} Newsbytes [...] "was a long fun ride. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we made a bit of the same history that we were writing about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> so. But as {{we seem to}} {{be getting}} serious, isn't the {{question}} whether it prevails or not another matter from an altruistic point of view?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Baigent himself {{conceded that}} none of his {{theories}} yielded any positive results: [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> in due course {{a lot of this}} material will be proven,” he said, “but it’s just a hope of mine.” ...|$|R
5000|$|I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{because of}} the things I did, my {{daughter}} can {{do the things that}} she does. She barely has a recognition that she's black. —Jackson reflecting on his actions during the Civil Rights Movement ...|$|R
5000|$|On December 3, 2007, Reynato S. Puno {{stated that}} the writ {{released}} only 3 victims (including Luisito Bustamante, Davao City), since amparo was enforced on October 24: [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> after the enactment and effectivity (of the writ), the number of extrajudicial killings and disappearances have gone down." ...|$|E

5000|$|It’s a non-partisan position, so I’m not {{representing}} the government, I’m not representing a political party, I’m {{representing the}} Queen. So that’s {{the role of}} the Head of State, and I think it’s a very important one. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we’ve had a very good string of Lieutenant Governors in Saskatchewan. I feel that I am part of a heritage of very strong, hardworking people who have been Lieutenant Governor over the decades. [...] Gordon Barnhart, Saskatoon, 2006 ...|$|E

3000|$|And it {{was just}} like a year of, basically, {{inaction}} from head office and they were burying their head in the sand and not dealing with it. […] So I have learned to make moral compromises, and I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> on the serious ones that I would not accept it, but, who knows. (P 5) [...]...|$|R
50|$|When {{speaking}} to a reporter from the Mansfield local newspaper later during November 2013 regarding redeveloping the old bus station site, Egginton stated: I'm fairly confident it will happen - it's one of my legacy aims. When I retire in 18 months' time, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> the issue is resolved and plans are in place.|$|R
5000|$|I’ve {{believed}} for a {{long time}} that photographers are like the antennae of civilization. We are an integral part of the sensing mechanism of the human animal. We are out there feeling in the darkness, trying to see what’s around us and reveal what hasn’t been revealed before. Not all photographers work that way, but to me that’s one of the central elements of photography. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> passionate, involved photographers would be looking at the world and trying their hardest to speak about the important things that are going on today.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{people in}} England—and also around the world—don't {{take what they}} say as being [...] I {{actually}} {{had a lot of}} really good press, and so, as far as I can tell it was about time to give me a hard time, but, for me, the only way I can judge the shows was from the audiences' reactions and they were just great. And of course the outfits were a bit, maybe, a little bit too much, but that wasn't a mistake, that was meant to cause a bit of a stir." ...|$|E
5000|$|His {{other works}} are {{normally}} {{not related to}} disabilities. However, Matthew Higgs argues in his commentary about Gander's work, that his disability actually contributes to Gander's unique way of seeing: [...] "The first thing I ever noticed about Ryan was that he uses a wheelchair. I mention this not in passing, nor as a gratuitous aside. Whilst I accept that some people might argue that this information is irrelevant, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the fact that Ryan uses a wheelchair does - at least - have some bearing on my subsequent understanding of his work." ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{its live}} nature, Creosote noted, [...] "It's teasing people along to my live shows {{because if you}} miss one version of it, you have missed it entirely. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> small labels can survive by being more creative. We {{have tried to do}} various stunts that build in value to our albums and gigs.” ...|$|R
2500|$|I'm {{not sure}} about that. [...] was a free spirit... He was his own person {{when it came to}} {{different}} things. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he (<b>would</b> still be with Chicago), but he was very independent and I wonder what he would have thought about the 1980s. I'd have to say it's 50/50. It could have gone either way.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the guide}} is licensed, the {{prospect}} will be quoted the retail {{price of the}} particular unit that best seemed to fit the prospective buyer's needs. If the tour guide is not a licensed agent, a licensed agent will now step in to present the price. If the prospect replies with [...] "no", or [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it", the prospect will then be given a new incentive to buy. This incentive will usually be a discounted price that will only be good today (good today only is an untrue statement, and {{has been used as}} a sales closing device since day one of the timeshare industry's inception). If again, the reply is [...] "no", or [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it", the sales agent will ask the prospect to please talk to one of the managers before the prospect leaves. It is at this moment that the Prospect realizes that the Tour has actually just begun.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1970, a Seattle-based {{group called}} the United Indians of All Tribes (re-)occupied Fort Lawton, {{demanding}} the return of Indigenous lands that {{were about to be}} declared surplus. The organization and their action was expressly modelled on the Indians of All Tribes and the occupation of Alcatraz. Bernie Whitebear, one of those involved, stated that [...] "We saw what could be achieved there and {{if it had not been}} for their determined effort on Alcatraz, there would have been no movement here. We <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Alcatraz lives on in part through Ft. Lawton." ...|$|E
5000|$|Your {{good looks}} never spoiled {{you for the}} cruel reality of the rolling dice and when pain came you were a Stoic. We who remain <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we are stoic too but would prefer a version that didn’t hurt. We would prefer a life from which you were not gone. But your {{influence}} is alive and will last for a long time, {{passed on to the}} young ones as an example and a name: the name of a hugely impressive — all right, an impressive — man we once met, and who is all ours now.|$|E
5000|$|... "What {{is certain}} {{is that she was}} not wearing a seat belt and this made things worse. We <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if she had been wearing a seat belt, we'd have been able to save her," [...] said Prof. André Lienhart, who {{reviewed}} the emergency services' response for the French government investigation of the incident. CNN did an analysis of the crash in early September 1997 and concluded that injuries would have been minor had the occupants been wearing seat belts. The conclusions were provisional owing to limited data about the specific Mercedes model as the limousine was not sold in the US.|$|E
5000|$|... "Jag skulle vilja tänka en underbar tanke" [...] ("I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> a {{wonderful}} thought") is a pop song written by Swedish singer and composer Per Gessle. It {{is the second}} single released from the album En händig man, in digital format only. A promotional single (CDPRO 4410) was also released. It spent 7 weeks in the Swedish Singles Chart, peaking at #29.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to Govind Nihlani, filmmaker, Purushottam Agrawal says, [...] "My novel is dark because I wrote it {{in a state}} of bechaini (anxiety). In truth, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of myself as {{in a state of}} neither extreme pessimism nor optimism." [...] Nihlani had said that NACOHUS is deeply dystopian, making it hard to read. Nihlani compared this novel to George Orwell's novel 1984.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered; {{and he felt}} absurdly disappointed. He <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that his}} work had helped her to sing.|$|R
5000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{when people}} {{go on the}} Web they're very tough integrators of information, they compare sources, they think really hard," [...] says Fogg, [...] "but {{the truth of the}} matter--and I didn't want to find this in the {{research}} but it's very clear--is that people do judge a Web site by how it looks. That's the first test of the Web site. And if it doesn't look credible or it doesn't look like what they expect it to be, they go elsewhere. It doesn't get a second test. And it's not so different from other things in life. It's the way we judge automobiles and politicians.|$|E
5000|$|Deal {{recognizes that}} {{activism}} {{can be an}} exhausting pursuit, especially when issues involved evoke such passion from both sides. When asked what motivates him to continue in his art and activism, Deal responded with: “Quite honestly, it’s my family, particularly my kids. This world we live in, the land we reside on, it’s Indian Land. No matter where you go in America, or Canada or even south of the border, it’s all Indian Land. Unfortunately the land we live on is hostile towards us, and I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I can {{at least try to}} make things a little better for my own kids.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} generally positive reviews, praised for its historical accuracy, cast, and intense action. Military.com wrote, [...] "The script is compelling on several levels. Whittlesey, the bookish-looking New York lawyer turned soldier, is the Everyman Warrior that viewers enjoy identifying with. Most <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{placed in a}} similar situation they too would find the courage to act as Whittlesey did. Moreover, the movie offers another take on the classic theme that pits an intrepid underdog David against the prohibitive favorite Goliath. As with the Biblical David -- but not with Col. Davy Crockett at the Alamo and Custer at Little Bighorn -- the underdog prevails here".|$|E
5000|$|Lie with Me {{received}} a 38% [...] "Rotten" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Writing for Variety, Leslie Felperin says that [...] "Barry Stone's lensing, favoring a soft, Northern-climes afternoon light for the sex scenes in particular, looks dreamy throughout", but that [...] "with its drawn-out last act and sentimental ending, this pic {{is a long}} way from being the Gen-Y [...] "Last Tango in Paris" [...] it <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it is." ...|$|R
30|$|Clearly, one <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the Walrasian {{equilibrium}} as an {{unique and}} stable steady-state of the model, {{and the economy}} would reach in the long run. In the absence of externalities, coordination failures {{and other types of}} inefficiencies it would result from the invisible hand of the Walrasian auctioneer and would also act as a Nash equilibrium. Picard (1993) reviews in detail the microeconomic foundations of disequilibrium models and the stability of adjustment in different regimes.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the play, and {{specifically}} when Ubu feels insecure about being found out, an animated eye, intercut {{with a real}} one in classic Kentridge fashion, emerges on the screen to convey {{the sense that the}} main character is not quite so alone as he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> The screen was used repeatedly and effectively in Kentridge's production. [...] "In every instance the images are more suggestive than real," [...] wrote Triplett, [...] "and hence more powerful." ...|$|R
