On 2 March, Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament that the Singapore legal team has studied Malaysia’s application carefully, including the three documents relied on by Malaysia to support its application, and strongly believes that the documents relied on by Malaysia do not satisfy the criteria under Article 61. Singapore has until 14 June to submit to the ICJ its comprehensive and compelling rebuttal to Malaysia’s application.|$|E
5|$|The San Francisco {{regulators}} {{finished their}} report in May 1987 and recommended that Lincoln be {{seized by the}} government due to unsound lending practices. Gray, whose time as chair was about to expire, deferred action on the report, saying that his adversarial relationship with Keating <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> action he took seem vindictive, and that instead the incoming chair should take over the decision. Meanwhile, Keating {{filed a lawsuit against}} the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The new FHLBB chair was M. Danny Wall, who was more sympathetic to Keating and took no action on the report, saying its evidence was insufficient. In September 1987, the Lincoln investigation was removed from the San Francisco group and in May 1988, the FHLBB signed an agreement with Lincoln that included not going ahead with a criminal referral to the Department of Justice. In July 1988, a new audit of both Lincoln and American Continental began in Washington.|$|E

25|$|As already mentioned, dwarfs {{were allowed}} to have several high ranked jobs and could move up the ranks during their career. Old Kingdom reliefs depict dwarfs {{performing}} mainly easy, rather creative jobs, because their shortened and fragile stature did not allow for hard or dangerous physical work. Unsurprisingly then dwarfs mainly worked as jewelers, tailors, cup-bearers and even as zookeepers. As at other periods, dwarfs were particularly valued as treasurers or jewellers, as their very distinctive appearance <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> dishonest dealings on their part that {{much more difficult to}} get away with.|$|E
25|$|Local residents, however, {{were seriously}} divided. Those {{who would like}} to return to their houses, were afraid, that an interim-storage might prove to be a very {{permanent}} storage, and <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> return impossible. But others had already accepted the fact, that the radiation-levels around their former houses would be too high, and would make living there impractical for a long time. Some local residents realized that without the interim storage facility, there would no place to dispose radioactive waste at all, and the construction of the facility would create also new jobs.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{take the}} term kenning broadly to include any noun-substitute {{consisting of two}} or more elements, including merely descriptive epithets (such as Old Norse grand viðar “bane of wood” = “fire” (Snorri Sturluson: Skáldskaparmál 36)), while others would restrict it to metaphorical instances (such as Old Norse sól húsanna “sun of the houses” = “fire” (Snorri Sturluson: Skáldskaparmál 36)), specifically those where “he base-word identifies the referent with something which it is not, except in a specially conceived relation which the poet imagines between it and the sense of the limiting element'” (Brodeur (1959) pp.248–253). Some even exclude naturalistic metaphors such as Old English forstes bend “bond of frost” = “ice” or winter-ġewǣde “winter-raiment” = “snow”: “A metaphor is a kenning only if it contains an incongruity between the referent and the meaning of the base-word; in the kenning the limiting word is essential to the figure because without it the incongruity <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> identification impossible” (Brodeur (1959) pp.248–253). Descriptive epithets are a common literary device {{in many parts of the}} world, whereas kennings in this restricted sense are a distinctive feature of Old Norse and, to a lesser extent, Old English poetry.|$|E

Ananda Vikatan, in {{its original}} review dated 24 May 1959, praised the performance of Sivaji Ganesan, and said the film <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> Tamil proud. Baradwaj Rangan praised Ganesan's performance, stating that: [...] "To watch Veerapandiya Kattabomman is to marvel at the shades and nuances an actor can infuse into oratory." [...] Arun Ram and Riju Mehta of India Today stated in 2001, [...] "One doesn't have to be well-versed in Tamil to feel the fire in Veerapandiya Kattabomman." ...|$|E
500|$|The depot {{was reached}} on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, {{was unable to}} pull or to eat {{anything}} but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: [...] "BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit". A few days later, {{the rest of the}} party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> delay fatal. Fortunately a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate.|$|E

500|$|When {{they first}} {{occupied}} the country, the Germans prohibited {{the activity of}} all Serbian political parties except Zbor. Although they originally intended to make Ljotić {{the head of a}} Serbian puppet government, both Ljotić and the Germans realized that his unpopularity <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> government led by him a failure. The Germans believed that Ljotić had a [...] "dubious reputation among Serbs". Ljotić told Gestapo officer Karl Wilhelm Krause that [...] " [...] uncompromised man with generally recognized authority and force of personality... needed to convince the people that the Germans are their friends, that they want the best for the people and that they are the saviours of humankind from Communism." [...] The Germans soon invited Ljotić to join the initial Serbian puppet government, the Commissioner Administration of Milan Aćimović. Ljotić was offered the position of economic commissioner but never took office, partly because he disliked the idea of playing a secondary role in the administration and partly because of his unpopularity. He resorted to indirectly exerting his influence over the Serbian puppet government through two of his closest associates, Stevan Ivanić and Miloslav Vasiljević, whom the Germans had selected as commissioners. The only official function Ljotić held in German-occupied Serbia was administrator of Smederevo. He helped in the town's reconstruction after large parts of it were destroyed in an ammunition depot explosion in June 1941.|$|E
500|$|Britain unofficially {{told the}} United States on 17 December {{that it would}} accept {{arbitration}} in principle, and that Germany would soon agree too, and it did on 19 December. Castro's failure to back down left limited options {{in the face of}} the Monroe Doctrine, which <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> seizure of Venezuelan territory, even temporarily, problematic. In addition, the negative reaction in the British and American press had raised the costs of the intervention particularly for Germany, whose relations with the US were more fragile than the United Kingdom's and who placed great value on the attitude of the British press. Germany had followed the United Kingdom's lead throughout the planning and execution of the operation, and as the British Ambassador in Berlin observed, [...] "The idea of arbitration did not smile on them, but they accepted it at once because we had proposed it". Fourteen years later (during a presidential campaign against the backdrop of World War I), then US President Theodore Roosevelt claimed that Germany's acquiescence to arbitration came from his threat to attack the German ships in Venezuelan waters using Dewey's fleet. No documentary evidence has been found to confirm the claim. However, following the 18 December announcement that the US Navy fleet would be dispersed to West Indian ports for Christmas, which would take some of it to Trinidad, near the Venezuelan coast, the German embassy in Washington sought clarification from the US government.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fourth}} week of November – {{well into the}} lucrative Christmas sales period and close to {{four months after the}} concerts – Harrison voiced his {{frustration}} at the stalemate with Capitol on ABC's late-night chat show, The Dick Cavett Show. Harrison was on the program to promote the Raga documentary with Shankar, but after making a surprise guest performance with Gary Wright's new band Wonderwheel, he launched into a complaint about his US record company's interference and threatened to take the whole album package to Columbia. With the outburst attracting unfavourable attention in the press, where Capitol were viewed as [...] "profiteering on the backs of famine victims", the company eventually backed down and agreed to release the album on Harrison's terms. Of all the labels involved, only Columbia <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> money from The Concert for Bangladesh – 25 cents on every copy sold. Although none of these royalties went to the artist, Dylan and his record company were already benefiting from the exposure provided by the Bangladesh concerts, through the timely release of Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II. Of the other featured artists at the Concert for Bangladesh, the careers of both Preston (A Records) and Russell (Shelter) likewise prospered {{as a result of their}} participation, but their record companies imposed no such conditions on Apple and Capitol. In January 1972, Melody Makers Richard Williams remarked in his Concert for Bangladesh album review: [...] "Between them, Capitol and CBS have proved that, when it comes to awareness and enlightenment, the business is still several years behind the musicians." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing in The New York Times, Richards Vidmer {{opened his}} account of the game as follows: [...] "The {{greatest}} naval disaster of them all took place on Ferry Field today when a hungry pack of Wolverines set upon the Navy eleven from Annapolis, snarled and snapped, chewed and clawed, and finally buried the Easterners under a defeat of 54 to 0. [...] It probably was the worst defeat the Navy ever has suffered on land or sea." [...] Vidmer added that the Michigan squad played [...] "like one big monster" [...] and opined that the team would probably {{go down in history as}} Fielding Yost's masterpiece. [...] Writing in the Chicago Daily Tribune, James Crusinberry also employed a naval metaphor: [...] "Under a maze of forward pass plays, double passes, delayed passes, and criss-cross, Uncle Sam's proud gridiron dreadnaught, rocked by a great Michigan tidal wave, limped into port tonight on the leeward side of a 54 to 0 score." [...] Crusinberry opined that Michigan had [...] "played more new football [...] [...] [...] than any team ever did in one game" [...] and declared quarterback Benny Friedman the star of the game:"If any one man stood out, it was Benny Friedman, who hurled forward passes with accuracy and abandon time after time[...] [...] [...] Besides that, Benny was a regular whirligig in carrying the ball. [...] And it was Benny who was the field general. [...] His selections of plays was something that <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> general envious." ...|$|E

Over this branch of the underground road many a run-away slave passed on his way to freedom. There was such a strong sentiment against the [...] traffic that conductors and stations were found in sufficient number to carry on the work successfully." ...|$|E

The Los Angeles Times quoted a senior law enforcement source as saying authorities may not pursue charges even if the coroner declares the case a homicide, because Jackson's well-documented drug abuse <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> prosecution difficult. Nonetheless, the source said prosecutors had not ruled out more serious charges [...] "all the way up to involuntary manslaughter" [...] if it were determined that Jackson's death was indeed caused by the drug propofol.|$|E
