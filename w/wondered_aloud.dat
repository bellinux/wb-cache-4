500|$|Soon {{after the}} Whiskey Rebellion, actress-playwright Susanna Rowson wrote a stage musical about the insurrection {{entitled}} The Volunteers, with music by composer Alexander Reinagle. The play is now lost, but the songs survive {{and suggest that}} Rowson's interpretation was pro-Federalist. The musical celebrates as American heroes the militiamen who put down the rebellion, the [...] "volunteers" [...] of the title. President Washington and Martha Washington attended a performance of the play in Philadelphia in January 1795. W. C. Fields recorded a comedy track in Les Paul's studio in 1946, shortly before his death, entitled [...] "The Temperance Lecture" [...] for the album W. C. Fields... His Only Recording Plus 8 Songs by Mae West. The bit discussed Washington and his role in putting down the Whiskey Rebellion, and Fields <b>wondered</b> <b>aloud</b> whether [...] "George put down {{a little of the}} vile stuff too." ...|$|E
500|$|Grossmith had {{appeared}} in charity performances of Trial by Jury, where both Sullivan and Gilbert had seen him (indeed, Gilbert had directed one such performance, in which Grossmith played the judge), and Gilbert had earlier commented favourably on his performance in Tom Robertson's Society at the Gallery of Illustration. Sullivan mentioned to Arthur Cecil, the leading tenor from the Gallery of Illustration, {{that he was looking}} for someone to play the comic title role in his new comic opera, The Sorcerer. [...] Cecil reminded Sullivan about Grossmith, and Sullivan seized on the idea. After singing for Sullivan, upon meeting Gilbert, Grossmith <b>wondered</b> <b>aloud</b> if the role shouldn't be played by [...] "a fine man with a fine voice". [...] Gilbert replied, [...] "That is exactly what we don't want." [...] Although Grossmith had reservations about cancelling his touring engagements and going into the [...] "wicked" [...] professional theatre (a move that might lose him church and other engagements in the future), and Richard D'Oyly Carte's backers objected to casting a sketch comedian in the central role of a comic opera, Grossmith was hired.|$|E

2500|$|In 1969 Hersey {{donated the}} {{services}} of his bulldog 'Oliver' as mascot for the Yale football team.

Other, unbroadcast {{incidents}} of racism were later alleged, including a late-night limerick game between O'Meara, Lloyd, Goody and Tweed in which the word [...] "Paki" [...] was implied but not said. Goody allegedly <b>wondered</b> <b>aloud</b> if Lloyd used [...] "the P-word", and referred to Shetty as [...] "Shilpa Pashwa whoever you fucking are".|$|E

2500|$|For the {{character}} role of Mrs. Partlet, they chose Harriett Everard, an actress {{who had worked}} with Gilbert before. [...] Carte's agency supplied additional singers, including Alice May (Aline), Giulia Warwick (Constance), and Richard Temple (Sir Marmaduke). [...] Finally, in early November 1877, the last role, that of the title character, John Wellington Wells, was filled by comedian George Grossmith.

2500|$|In 2009 AirTran Airways removed nine Muslim passengers, {{including}} three children, from a flight {{and turned them}} over to the FBI after one of the men commented to another that they were sitting right next to the engines and <b>wondered</b> <b>aloud</b> where the safest place to sit on the plane was. Although the FBI subsequently cleared the passengers and called the incident a [...] "misunderstanding," [...] AirTran refused to seat the passengers on another flight, forcing them to purchase last minute tickets on another airline that had been secured with the FBI's assistance. A spokesman for AirTran initially defended the airline's actions and said they would not reimburse the passengers for the cost of the new tickets. Although the men had traditional beards and the women headscarves, AirTran denied that their actions were based on the passengers' appearance. The following day, after the incident received widespread media coverage, AirTran reversed its position and issued a public apology, adding that it would in fact reimburse the passengers for the cost of their rebooked tickets.|$|E
2500|$|On March 8, 2008, Obama won the Wyoming caucus by {{nineteen}} points. The Clinton camp {{continued to}} suggest that Obama {{would make a good}} vice presidential candidate for Clinton, and former President Bill Clinton made known his support of this as a [...] "dream ticket" [...] which would be an [...] "almost unstoppable force". On March 10, Obama flatly rejected such suggestions. Obama noted that he, not [...] Clinton, held the lead in pledged delegates and that he had won more of the popular vote than Clinton. [...] "I don't know how somebody who is in second place is offering the vice presidency to somebody who is in first place", he said. He told supporters in Columbus, Mississippi, that Clinton's VP suggestion was an example of what he called [...] "the old okey-doke", further stating that the Clinton camp was trying to [...] "bamboozle" [...] or [...] "hoodwink" [...] voters., Biloxi Sun Herald, March 10, 2008 Obama <b>wondered</b> <b>aloud</b> why the Clinton campaign believed him competent for the vice presidency, but said he was [...] "not ready" [...] to be president. Obama stated that the nomination process {{would have to be a}} choice between himself and Clinton, saying [...] "I don't want anybody here thinking that 'Somehow, maybe I can get both'," [...] by nominating Clinton as president and assuming he would be her running mate". Some suggested that it was a ploy by the Clinton campaign to denigrate Obama as less qualified for the presidency.|$|E

Mrs. Gould, looking at all these things in turn, <b>wondered</b> <b>aloud</b> why the talk of these wealthy and enterprising men discussing the prospects, the working, and the safety of the mine rendered her so impatient and uneasy, whereas she could talk of the mine by the hour with her husband with unwearied interest and satisfaction.

60|$|In {{the lower}} valley, {{a mass of}} waving holcus, we met a {{multitude}} of Galla peasants coming from the city market with new potlids and the empty gourds which had contained their butter, ghee, and milk: all <b>wondered</b> <b>aloud</b> at the Turk, concerning whom they had heard many horrors. As we commenced another ascent appeared a Harar Grandee mounted upon a handsomely caparisoned mule and attended by seven servants who carried gourds and skins of grain. He was a pale-faced senior with a white beard, dressed in a fine Tobe and a snowy turban with scarlet edges: he carried no shield, but an Abyssinian broadsword was slung over his left shoulder. We exchanged courteous salutations, and as I was thirsty he ordered a footman to fill a cup with water. Half way up the hill appeared the 200 Girhi cows, but those traitors, the Habr Awal, had hurried onwards. Upon the summit was {{pointed out to me}} the village of Elaoda: in former times it was a wealthy place belonging to the Gerad Adan.|$|E
