5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that hydrogen peroxide is abundant {{across much of}} the surface of Europa. Because hydrogen peroxide decays into oxygen and water when combined <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> water, the authors argue that it could be an important energy supply for simple life forms.|$|E
5|$|Gemological {{laboratories}} {{make use}} of spectrophotometer machines that can distinguish natural, artificial, and color-enhanced diamonds. The spectrophotometers analyze the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet absorption and luminescence spectra of diamonds cooled <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> nitrogen to detect tell-tale absorption lines that are not normally discernible.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} readily evaporates to form gaseous nitrogen, {{and hence}} the precautions associated with gaseous nitrogen also apply to liquid nitrogen. For example, oxygen sensors are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space.|$|E

5|$|Wu {{chose to}} do this by taking a sample of {{radioactive}} cobalt-60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed {{to reduce the amount}} of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to practically nil. Also, Wu needed to apply a constant and uniform magnetic field across the sample of cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line up in the same direction. For this cryogenic work, she needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cryogenic}} liquid, {{liquid nitrogen}} {{can be dangerous}} by causing cold burns on contact, although the Leidenfrost effect provides protection for very short exposure (about one second). Ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades {{atmospheric}} (or high) pressure non-thermal plasmas in and in contact <b>with</b> <b>liquids</b> have received a lot of attention in view of their considerable environmental and medical applications. The simultaneous generation of intense UV radiation, shock waves and active radicals makes these discharges particularly suitable for decontamination, sterilization and purification purposes. This paper reviews the current status of research on atmospheric pressure non-thermal discharges in and in contact <b>with</b> <b>liquids.</b> The emphasis is on their generation mechanisms and their physical characteristics...|$|R
5|$|Brown {{speculates that}} the {{predicted}} planet {{is most likely}} an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture of rock and ice with a small envelope of gas. Based on its size, the considerable gravitational pull of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in subsurface oceans <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> water in nearby moons. Subsurface oceans have been discovered on the moons Enceladus (water), Dione (possibly water), and subsurface water is postulated for Neptune's largest moon Triton, and possibly also found on Europa.|$|E
5|$|Makeup artist Baker {{provided}} the special makeup effects for The Incredible Melting Man, {{which included the}} gradual melting of Steve West. Rebar wore facial appliances that simulated melting flesh, and {{his hands and feet}} were fitted <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> substances that dropped off as he walked, creating the appearance that West's body was falling apart. During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes on the rocks below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which burst out upon impact.|$|E
5|$|Seizing upon a new {{development}} to visualize particle tracks, created by Donald Glaser and known as a bubble chamber, Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it {{could be made to}} function <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> hydrogen. Hydrogen nuclei, which are protons, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.|$|E

40|$|Problems of {{instability}} {{of the mass}} of stainless steels reference weight may find an explanation in the long term corrosion phenomena which may occur on their surfaces. It has to be considered that reference weights although maintained under controlled atmosphere may sometimes come in contact <b>with</b> <b>liquids,</b> e. g. for cleaning operations, for density determinations. An investigation on the effect of contact <b>with</b> <b>liquids</b> on austenitic stainless steel weights has been carried out by means of immersion of AISI 304 specimens in bidistilled water at room temperature for three years...|$|R

5|$|The tetrafluoride, PrF4, is also known, and is {{produced}} by reacting a mixture of sodium fluoride and praseodymium(III) fluoride with fluorine gas, producing Na2PrF6, following which sodium fluoride {{is removed from the}} reaction mixture <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> hydrogen fluoride. Additionally, praseodymium forms a bronze diiodide; like the diiodides of lanthanum, cerium, and gadolinium, it is a praseodymium(III) electride compound.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{can catch}} fire when a fresh, non-{{oxidized}} surface {{comes in contact}} <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> oxygen. Fresh metal may be exposed when the oxidized surface is struck or scratched with a hard object, or when mechanical strain causes a crack. This poses a limitation to its use in liquid oxygen systems, {{such as those in}} the aerospace industry. Because titanium tubing impurities can cause fires when exposed to oxygen, titanium is prohibited in gaseous oxygen respiration systems. Steel tubing is used for high pressure systems (3,000 p.s.i.) and aluminium tubing for low pressure systems.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists— Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (uranium enrichment) could be achieved assumed enormous importance. Frisch's first thought about how this could be achieved was <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> thermal diffusion.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics was {{experiencing}} serious difficulties. It lost {{its ability to}} compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch {{of a new generation}} of Japanese-produced calculators <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> crystal displays, which were much more capable and power-efficient than Sinclair's LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures. The company made losses of more than £350,000 in 1975–76, bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.|$|E
5|$|However, Sterling Products did not market Panadol in the United States {{or other}} {{countries}} where Bayer Aspirin still dominated the aspirin market. Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs, most significantly, McNeil Laboratories <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> Tylenol in 1955, and Tylenol pills in 1958. By 1967, Tylenol was available without a prescription. Because {{it did not}} cause gastric irritation, acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another analgesic, anti-inflammatory drug was introduced in 1962: ibuprofen (sold as Brufen in the U.K. and Motrin in the U.S.). By the 1970s, aspirin had a relatively {{small portion of the}} pain reliever market, and in the 1980s sales decreased even more when ibuprofen became available without prescription.|$|E
5|$|Mixing about 2.0% {{beryllium}} into copper {{forms an}} alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone. Beryllium alloys {{are used in}} many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic properties, as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance. These applications include non-sparking tools that are used near flammable gases (beryllium nickel), in springs and membranes (beryllium nickel and beryllium iron) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices. As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> magnesium leads to {{a significant increase in}} oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.|$|E

50|$|Water is {{miscible}} <b>with</b> many <b>liquids,</b> {{for example}} ethanol in all proportions, forming a single homogeneous liquid. On the other hand, water and most oils are immiscible usually forming layers according to increasing density from the top. This can be predicted {{by comparing the}} polarity. Water being a relatively polar compound will tend to be miscible <b>with</b> <b>liquids</b> of high polarity such as ethanol and acetone, whereas compounds with low polarity will tend to be immiscible and poorly soluble such as with hydrocarbons.|$|R

5|$|Narrated by Tseng, {{leader of}} the elite espionage and {{assassination}} division known as the Turks, Last Order switches between the Nibelheim incident and Zack Fair's escape to Midgar with his unconscious friend, Cloud Strife. During the Nibelheim event, Sephiroth, insane after discovering his origins, sets fire {{to the village of}} Nibelheim. After killing many villagers, he proceeds to the Nibelheim reactor where Jenova has been encased. Tifa, a resident of Nibelheim, attacks him soon after he arrives. Sephiroth knocks her aside and continues to Jenova's body, preserved in a large glass tank filled <b>with</b> <b>liquid.</b> Zack follows Sephiroth into the reactor and they engage in combat, but Sephiroth is able to disarm and incapacitate him. Sephiroth returns to Jenova's body, but does not notice Cloud approaching.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, while US battleships were {{standardized}} {{as much as}} possible, design improvements {{were incorporated}} whenever possible. Most {{of the changes in}} the Tennessees were incorporated prior to any of their keels being laid. However, plans for the underwater protection—the ships' main defense against torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship but traveled through the water to hit underneath the waterline—could not be worked out in time. The problem was that tests in caissons—experiments that would eventually prove that a series of compartments divided between being filled <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> and being left empty would be a very effective defense against torpedoes—were not yet complete. In order to commence construction of the ships as soon as possible, bids sent out to shipbuilding corporations noted that if they were selected to build the ships, an alteration to the design of the ships three months after their keels were laid must be allowed.|$|E
5|$|Spiders have {{a narrow}} gut {{that can only}} cope <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> food, and have two sets of filters to keep solids out. Some spiders pump {{digestive}} enzymes from the midgut into the prey and then suck the liquified tissues of the prey into the gut, eventually leaving behind the empty husk of the prey. Others grind the prey to pulp using the fangs and the bases of the pedipalps, while flooding it with enzymes; in these species the fangs and the bases of the pedipalps form a preoral cavity that holds the food they are processing.|$|E
