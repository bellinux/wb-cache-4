40|$|Calculation {{of machine}} basic parts means to {{determine}} of calculation basic {{elements in the}} previous proceeding. It is <b>working</b> and critical <b>stresses</b> of parts, stress distribution, as well as, degree of overlapping the <b>working</b> and critical <b>stresses.</b> Working stresses of basic elements and their distribution are sizes which may be relative easy determined, as analytical so as experimental. However, determinations of distribution of critical stresses, spilling, as well as shape of distribution are very complicated if there is stochastic change of <b>working</b> <b>stresses</b> (<b>working</b> strength). By that, character of change of <b>working</b> <b>stresses</b> has essential impact on parameters of working dynamic strength.

5000|$|Finally, {{connections}} {{consisting of}} bolts, dowels, pins or nails, {{especially in the}} case of wooden components, significantly reduce usable sections. For elements in traction, a reduction of 25% in the <b>working</b> <b>stress</b> or an increase of 25% in the volume is therefore also necessary in the majority of cases. Determining the volume and the displacement of a structure using the indicators W and Δ is therefore reliable theoretically, providing that: ...|$|E
50|$|It {{follows that}} initially, only W and Δ {{should be taken}} into account for the {{morphological}} design of a structure, assuming that it is ultra-dampened (i.e. its internal damping is greater than the critical damping), which makes it impervious to dynamic stress. The volume V of a structure is therefore directly proportional to the total intensity of the force F which is applied to it, to its length L and to the morphological factor W; it is inversely proportional to the stress σ to which it can be subjected. Furthermore, the weight of a structure is proportional to the density ρ of the material from which it is constructed. However, its maximum displacement δ remains proportional to the span L and the morphological factor Δ, as well as the ratio between its <b>working</b> <b>stress</b> σ and the modulus of elasticity E.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the large}} {{majority}} of compressed elements, it is possible to limit the reduction of the <b>working</b> <b>stress</b> to 25% by taking into account elastic instability, providing that the designer focuses on ensuring an efficient geometric design from as early as the initial sketches. This means that the increase in their volume indicator can also be limited to 25% [...] The volume of the elements subject to pure traction is also only very rarely limited to the product of the net distance over which a force is applied by a section strained at the permissible stress. In other words, their real volume indicator is thus also higher than the one which results from the calculation of W. A bar under traction can be welded at its extremities; no extra material apart from the negligible welding material is added, but the rigidity introduce parasitic moments which absorb some of the permissible stress.|$|E

5000|$|For stability, it is {{not enough}} that other fibers be able to take over the load of a failed strand [...] - [...] the system must also survive the immediate, {{dynamical}} effects of fiber failure, which generates projectiles aimed at the cable itself. For example, if the cable has a <b>working</b> <b>stress</b> of 50 GPa and a Young's modulus of 1000 GPa, its strain will be 0.05 and its stored elastic energy will be 1/2 &times; 0.05 &times; 50 GPa = 1.25&times;109 joules per cubic meter. Breaking a fiber will result in a pair of de-tensioning waves moving apart at the speed of sound in the fiber, with the fiber segments behind each wave moving at over 1,000 m/s (more than the muzzle velocity of a standard [...]223 caliber (5.56 mm) round fired from an M16 rifle). Unless these fast-moving projectiles can be stopped safely, they will break yet other fibers, initiating a failure cascade capable of severing the cable. The challenge of preventing fiber breakage from initiating a catastrophic failure cascade seems to be unaddressed in the current literature on terrestrial space elevators. Problems of this sort would be easier to solve in lower-tension applications (e.g., lunar elevators). This problem has been described by physicist Freeman Dyson.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In this paper, the {{prediction}} of <b>working</b> <b>stress</b> of {{quenched and tempered steel}} has been done. The <b>working</b> <b>stress</b> was characterized by yield strength and fracture toughness. The method of computer simulation of <b>working</b> <b>stress</b> was applied in workpiece of complex form. Design/methodology/approach: Hardness distribution of quenched and tempered workpiece of complex form was predicted by computer simulation of steel quenching using a finite volume method. The algorithm of estimation of yield strength and fracture toughness was based on steel hardness, HV. Yield strength and fracture toughness distributions have been predicted using the Hahn-Rosenfield approach. Findings:It can be concluded that <b>working</b> <b>stress</b> of quenched and tempered steel can be successfully predicted by proposed method. The further experimental investigations are needed for final verification of established model. Research limitations/implications: For efficient estimation of fracture toughness from hardness, additional data about microstructure are needed. Practical implications: Estimation of hardness distribution can be based on time, relevant for structure transformation, i. e., time of cooling from 800 to 500 ºC (t 8 / 5). The prediction of distribution of microstructure composition, yield strength, and fracture toughness, can be based on steel hardness.
