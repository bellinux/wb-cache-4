The results of the research indicates: (1) water system dynamic condition is the main factor causing the <b>water</b> <b>bloom,</b> the change of water system dynamic condition {{is the best way}} for avoiding the eruption of <b>water</b> <b>bloom.</b> (2) The present concentration of Chl-a is main pre-warning index, if the <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> has erupted, the measure of emergency allocation water may relax the tension of <b>water</b> <b>bloom,</b> so far as to reduce red into green pre-warning situation. (3) The velocity of flow is the decisive factor of <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> eruption. When the velocity of flow is great enough the <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> erupts seldom; and when the velocity is zero, even if the concentration is not very big, the <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> will erupt possibly after 7 days. (4) The temperature of water is not the essential condition of <b>water</b> <b>bloom.</b> Even if the temperature is very lower, when the velocity of flow is very slow and the nutrition level is great enough, the <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> will erupt possibly. (5) The eutrophication is not the inevitable factor. Under the good water dynamic condition, even if the nutrition level is very high, the <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> will not erupt. Only when the temperature is suitable and velocity of flow is slow, the <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> will erupt...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevention}} {{and management of}} water blooms is an important measure of environment protection.

40|$|The massive {{development}} of bluegreen algae (Cyanophyta/Cyanobacteria), the so [...] called <b>water</b> <b>bloom,</b> {{is a frequent}} phenomenon in fishpond ecosystems. This study analyses <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> development in three carp fishponds owned by a fishbreeding company at Donji Miholjac (Croatia), where one-year-old carps (Cyprinus carpio), were bred in defferent fishstock densities. Analyses of physicallychemical properties of water and phytoplankton biomass were per- formed in fortnight intervals from May till October, 1992. In all there investigated fishponds the <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> of bluegreen algae developed, but at a different time and showing a different qualitative composition. In the fishpond with fishstock density of 250 kg/ha <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> consisted of the species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, and the biggest biomass (131. 92 mg/I) was found in August. In the fishpond with fishstock density of 437 kg/ha a <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> consisting of species from the genues Anabaena and species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae developed {{at the end of}} July.

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2007, <b>blooms</b> of "black" <b>water</b> in Lake Taihu entered into the potable water supply of Wuxi City and left more than 1 million people without water. Attempts to monitor these black <b>water</b> <b>blooms</b> have not been {{successful}} due to their irregular nature. In May 2012, two black <b>water</b> <b>blooms</b> were observed {{in one of the}} lake's eutrophic bays. The bio-optical analyses of these blooms show that they were dominated by higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter and lower backscattering coefficients with respect to the surrounding lake conditions. We show the contribution of each optically active component to the perceived radiance and demonstrate that elevated absorption due to dissolved organic matter and phytoplankton combined with reduced backscattering led to the perception of these water areas as "black", while the true color was dark green. The present analysis indicates that formation of black <b>water</b> <b>blooms</b> is favored during springtime conditions in the macrophyte dominated areas of the lake's hypereutrophic bays...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} {{process of}} algae is described inaccurately and <b>water</b> <b>blooms</b> are predicted {{with a low}} precision by current methods. In this paper, chemical mechanism of algae growth is analyzed, and a correlation analysis of chlorophyll-a and algal density is conducted by chemical measurement. Taking into account the influence of multi-factors on algae growth and <b>water</b> <b>blooms,</b> the comprehensive prediction method combined with multivariate time series and intelligent model is put forward in this paper. Firstly, {{through the process of}} photosynthesis, the main factors that affect the reproduction of the algae are analyzed. A compensation prediction method of multivariate time series analysis based on neural network and Support Vector Machine has been put forward which is combined with Kernel Principal Component Analysis to deal with dimension reduction of the influence factors of blooms. Then, Genetic Algorithm is applied to improve the generalization ability of the BP network and Least Squares Support Vector Machine. Experimental results show that this method could better compensate the prediction model of multivariate time series analysis which is an effective way to improve the description accuracy of algae growth and prediction precision of <b>water</b> <b>blooms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the phenomenon of algal <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> in lakes efficiently and properly, an integrated evaluative function F of algal <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> is proposed in this paper. The study of the function involves three aspects: algal average activation energy of photosynthesis(E), integrated nutritional status index (TLI(∑)), and transparency (SD),which are considered from the microcosmic level., the macroscopic level and the intuitionistic level respectively. The values of the function are classified properly. At the meantime, the weight value of each evaluative parameter is determined objectively, via the theory of multiple criteria decision making,. By analyzing and calculating the experimental data, the obtained values of the function and the classification results can be verified using the data of the samples. Good agreement is obtained between the results and the fact. In this way, the evaluative function of algal <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> offers a significant theoretical basis for the algal <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> prediction of lakes...|$|E

Valid and accurate water-bloom prediction can be obtained by combining various multidimensional time series methods. Comparing the proposed model based on multi-sensors data to a traditional one-dimensional time series model based on one-sensor data, it has been found that a multidimensional model is a useful and accurate model for establishing multiple influential factors time series of <b>water</b> <b>bloom.</b> The optimum model can be used not only to predict <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> but also to determine the period and random change rule of multiple influential factors...|$|E
40|$|A lot of ponds {{exist in}} Nara Park, and the {{occurrence}} of a <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> is frequently confirmed {{in recent years in}} the pond.

40|$|In this diploma thesis, I {{deal with}} the {{influence}} of the sampling site on water quality in natural bathing lakes (Hostivar reservoir, Seberak pond and Vyzlovka pond) in this. I have established that hygienically significant kinds of phytoplankton may differ in terms of water quality especially where there are cyanobacteria constituting <b>water</b> <b>bloom.</b> Surface <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> may be moved by wind to the lee side of the water body (Microcystis sp.). Aphanizomenon flos-aquae <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> floating in water column can be affected by wind and by water flow (which may be partly affected by wind as well). With the prevailing fibrous Planktothrix agardhii which does not connstitute <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> the concentration of chlorophyll-a and cyanobacterial cell abundance in individual sampling sites are similar although the concentration of chlorophyll-a a is about 200 g. l- 1. Microcystis sp. and Scenedesmus sp. survive under eutrophic conditions in competition. From the microbiological perspective, water quality can differ within a single sampling site in places at a distance of less than 100 m. Microbial contamination can be caused by bathers, water birds, farm animals and probably by the removing of microorganisms from sand, mud and sediments on the beach or shore. Rain episodes probably increase the abundance of E. coli [...] ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{understanding}} of bacterial community composition {{is a fundamental}} goal of identifying ecological efficiency caused by Microcystis bloom in aquatic system. In this study, we employed bar-coded 454 pyrosequencing approach to investigate the bacterial community variation during a Microcystis <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> in Guanting Reservoir, Beijing. More than 140, 000 sequences were generated and assigned to 7133 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) which belong to 18 phyla through Ribosomal Database Pyrosequencing (RDP) database. Microcystis was detected at low abundance in July then broke out and became the exclusive dominant genus in September. Meanwhile, bacteria composition changed dramatically after the Microcystis <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> reflected by the decrease of bacteria abundance, diversity and evenness indices. The classify results indicated that dominant species in July were Pelagibacter, Haliscomenobacter, Rhodobacter and Fluviicola. In September, Methylotenera, Flavobacterium and Methylophilus were the dominant genera. It is worth noticing that all the dominant genera in July {{was more or less}} related to nitrogen and phosphorus cycling while in September, dominant genera Flavobacterium was reported as Microcystis lysing bacterium and may be a symptom of the coming postbloom phase of Microcystis <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> in Guanting Reservoir...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{cyanobacteria}} <b>blooms</b> (or <b>water</b> <b>blooms)</b> {{occurred on}} the surface of water bodies frequently and extensively due to eutrophia of the water.

40|$|The {{vertical}} migration and accumulation of Microcystis {{is an important}} process in <b>water</b> <b>blooms,</b> and colony migration is influenced by colony size and wind-wave disturbance. The {{vertical migration}} of Microcystis colonies in turbulence can be simulated in a numerical model. In this study, we model such migration by coupling the colony size and hydrodynamics, including the gravity, colony buoyancy, and the viscous drag force of turbulence. The turbulence intensity was represented by the turbulent kinetic energy (K Z); the larger the K Z, the stronger the wind-wave disturbance. The simulated vertical distribution of Microcystis well agreed with the measured values in a laboratory experiment indicating that our model can simulate the vertical distribution of Microcystis under different hydrodynamic conditions. We also found a size-dependent critical turbulent kinetic energy (T K Z), such that if the turbulent kinetic energy of water exceeds the critical value (i. e., K Z > T K Z), the colonies sink under the drag forces of turbulence; conversely, if K Z < T K Z, the colonies can overcome the turbulent mixing and float. The T K Z of each colony was linearly related to colony diameter. The model is crucial for prediction and prevention of <b>water</b> <b>blooms.</b> The simulated threshold turbulent kinetic energy, at which <b>water</b> <b>blooms</b> disappear in Lake Taihu (a large freshwater lake in the Yangtze Delta, Jiangsu Province, China), was 55. 5 cm 2 s − 2.  </p...|$|R

40|$|From a {{practical}} viewpoint, cyanobacteria have two opposite aspects: {{one is that}} some of the species participate in <b>water</b> <b>bloom,</b> and the other is that they may be used in agriculture as a biofertilizer. Akinete, a dormant cell, is the key to the engineering analysis of both cases. In order to analyze the behavior of cyanobacteria in water, Anabaena cylindrica, a filamentous cyanobacterium, was investigated in terms of the behavior of algal biomass in a water column and its characteristics in akinete formation. The algal culture transferred to a glass cylinder settled down initially and then floated to the surface of the water column, forming an algal mat due to oxygen bubbles generated extracellularly by photosynthesis. The differentiation of vegetative cells into akinetes was not induced by light limitation but iron depletion. Akinetes tended to separate from trichomes and settle down because their density is higher than that of water. This phenomenon suggests an operational method for removing the source of <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> from an aquatic environment, or harvesting akinetes as the see...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the molecular diversity of cyanobacteria and bacteria during a <b>water</b> <b>bloom</b> {{in a lake}} {{with a long history}} of toxic cyanobacterial blooms (Lake Kastoria, Greece). We also tested the hypothesis whether bloom-forming cyanobacteria are preserved in the lake's sediment 2 years after the bloom. The dominant cyanobacteria during the bloom included the potentially toxin-producing Microcystis aeruginosa and several other Chroococcales forms closely related to the genus Microcystis. This suggests that the use of cyanobacterial-specific primers seems to be very informative in describing the cyanobacteria during the water blooms. The bacterial community showed high diversity, consisting mostly of singleton and doubleton phylotypes. The majority of the phylotypes were typical lake bacteria including some potential pathogens and toxin metabolising bacteria, suggesting that the dominant toxic cyanobacteria did not have any significant effect on the bacterial community structure. In the sediment, 2 years after the <b>water</b> <b>bloom,</b> no bloom-forming cyanobacteria were retrieved, suggesting that they cannot be preserved in the sediment.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to explain {{expansion}} of cyanobacterial blooms and the change of their species composition in surface standing waters during the last 2 - 3 decades {{as a result of}} fishery management, land use in catchments, and climate change. Cyanobacteria possess a range of unique and highly-adaptable eco-physiological traits, which enable them a mass occurrence and a dominance over the other phytoplankton groups under recent anthropogenic changes (nutrient loading and rising temperatures). Moreover, many species of cyanobacteria produce cyanotoxins, which increase their resistence against zooplankton grazing and cause severe deterioration of the water quality. In consequence of changes in fishery management (a decrease in the use of superphosphate as a fertilizer during the year 1970), the fish stock density increased and the clear water phase disappeared. This is responsible for a change in species composition of cyanobacterial <b>water</b> <b>blooms.</b> Summer blooms of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae were replaced with A. flos-aquae var. klebahnii. The current composition of <b>water</b> <b>blooms</b> in ponds differs considerably from the typical composition in the 1990 s.
