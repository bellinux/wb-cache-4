5|$|Although {{the exact}} numbers are unknown, the {{vertebral}} column of Megalosaurus <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> divided into ten neck vertebrae, thirteen dorsal vertebrae, five sacral vertebrae and fifty to sixty tail vertebrae, as {{is common for}} basal Tetanurae.|$|E
5|$|Augustine consecrated Justus as {{a bishop}} in 604, over a {{province}} including the Kentish town of Rochester. The historian Nicholas Brooks {{argues that the}} choice of Rochester <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> not {{because it had been}} a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of Watling Street and the estuary of the Medway, and was thus a fortified town. Because Justus <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> not a monk (he was not called that by Bede), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.|$|E
5000|$|More is {{required}} than {{proof that the}} accused <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> guilty. A jury which concludes only that the accused <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> guilty must acquit.|$|R

The northeast window and blocked north doorway <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> 14th century and a buttress on the west wall <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> 15th century.

5|$|Barbara (Benedicta) Fitzroy (1672–1737) – She <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{the child}} of John Churchill, later Duke of Marlborough, who was another of Cleveland's many lovers, and was never {{acknowledged}} by Charles as his own daughter.|$|E
5|$|Bedford Castle <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> built after 1100 by Henry I in {{the town}} of Bedford, {{overlooking}} the River Great Ouse. The castle was constructed inside the town itself, and many of the older Anglo-Saxon streets had to be destroyed and diverted to make room for it, leaving a permanent mark in the formal grid system. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design and <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> much smaller than the later castle, just consisting of the motte and the inner bailey.|$|E

5|$|Dux Romanorum (commander of the Romans): <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{given to}} Odaenathus to {{recognize}} {{his position as}} {{the commander in chief}} of the forces in the east against the Persians; it was inherited by Odaenathus' son and successor Vaballathus.|$|E

5|$|In 906, al-Muktafi {{married a}} {{daughter}} of the second Tulunid ruler, Khumarawayh. She <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a half-sister of the famous Qatr al-Nada, another daughter of Khumarawayh who was intended for him but ended up being married to his father in 893.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 10th century and early 9th century BC, {{the site was}} reoccupied but its name during that time is unknown; three human head sculptures made of basalt were {{discovered}} in the site; they probably date to the mid-9th century BC. At this time, the region <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{under the control of}} Palistin, with Qatna under the rule of Hamath, which <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> part of Palistin. The basalt heads bear similarities to a statue discovered in Palistin's capital, but there is not enough information to allow a general conclusion over the borders of Palistin and its extent into Qatna. The settlement was a small one; it included large buildings that were used both as residences and manufacturing facilities.|$|E
50|$|Chapters 46-51: six chaptersof which chapter 51, {{including}} {{even its}} title, has been lostthat contain stories and dialogues about Mozi and his followers. These chapters <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> of somewhat later date, and <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> partly fictional.|$|R
50|$|Cymbitidae <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> monogeneric family. It {{is named}} after genus Cymbites Neumayr, 1878. One more genus has been added there and it is Hyerifalchia Fucini, 1907, but this one <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> only a synonym of Cymbites.|$|R
50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{closely related}} to and looks like a small version of the orange-breasted falcon. These two, in turn, <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> closest to the aplomado falcon and {{constitute}} a rather old American lineage of Falco species.|$|R
5|$|It is {{not known}} if West Compo had a {{civilian}} career after her Navy career ended. Sources conflict as to the ship's ultimate fate, but she <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> broken up in 1936 at Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Later in the year, in April, {{he was one}} of four Scottish envoys sent to Canterbury for {{abortive}} {{talks with}} the English and French. In the next few years, Nicholas' activities are difficult to trace, but he <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> involved in much diplomatic activity, including perhaps having a hand in drawing up the brief which Baldred Bisset would later deliver to the pope in the interests of Scottish independence. It <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> in this time too that Nicholas became a clerk at Arbroath Abbey and perhaps a canon of Dunblane Cathedral.|$|E
