5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{wrote of}} another {{tradition}} which {{stated that the}} flag was <b>waved</b> at a battle in Waternish, in about 1580; and of another which told of how it was <b>waved</b> {{during a time when}} a cattle plague was raging, and that it stopped the murrain. R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been <b>waved</b> twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on the losing side! R.C. MacLeod also wondered if it had been <b>waved</b> in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.|$|E

5|$|Among vertebrates, the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has a startling display in which wide semicircular frills {{on either side}} of the head are fanned out; the mouth is opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is <b>waved</b> over the body, and the body is raised, so that the animal appears as large and {{threatening}} as possible.|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} {{properties of}} short wind <b>waves</b> {{under the influence}} of long <b>waves</b> are investigated based on <b>wave</b> data from a laboratory experiment carried out in the large Marseille-Luminy wind <b>wave</b> tank. The wind <b>waves</b> are generated with various fetches and speeds. The long <b>wave</b> is mechanically generated by a submerge paddle and propagates in the wind direction. Surface <b>wave</b> elevations are measured by an array of capacitance <b>wave</b> gauges aligned in the wind direction. The long <b>wave</b> effects are examined based on the statistical parameters derived from the probability distribution and zero-up-crossing <b>wave</b> height and <b>wave</b> period of wind <b>waves.</b> In the absence of long <b>waves,</b> the skewness of the probability distributions, an index of <b>wave</b> nonlinearity, shows a clear dependence to the increase of the significant slopes of wind <b>waves.</b> The presence of long <b>waves</b> significantly decreases the skewness and the dependence to the <b>wave</b> slopes.

Two {{new types of}} nonlinear <b>waves</b> called compacton-like <b>waves</b> and kink-like <b>waves</b> are displayed. Furthermore, two kinds of new bifurcation phenomena are revealed. The first phenomenon is that the kink <b>waves</b> can be bifurcated from five types of nonlinear <b>waves</b> which are the bell-shape solitary <b>waves,</b> the blow-up <b>waves,</b> the valley-shape solitary <b>waves,</b> the kink-like <b>waves,</b> and the compacton-like <b>waves.</b> The second phenomenon is that the periodic-blow-up <b>wave</b> can be bifurcated from the smooth periodic <b>wave...</b>|$|R

5|$|Most {{albatrosses}} {{range in}} the Southern Hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia, South Africa and South America. The exceptions to this are the four North Pacific albatrosses, of which three occur exclusively in the North Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, California and Alaska; and one, the <b>waved</b> albatross, breeds in the Galápagos Islands and feeds {{off the coast of}} South America. The need for wind to enable gliding is the reason albatrosses are for the most part confined to higher latitudes: being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing the doldrums extremely difficult. The exception, the <b>waved</b> albatross, is able to live in the equatorial waters around the Galápagos Islands because of the cool waters of the Humboldt Current and the resulting winds.|$|E
25|$|In seismology, {{several types}} of surface <b>waves</b> are encountered. Surface <b>waves,</b> in this {{mechanical}} sense, {{are commonly known as}} either Love <b>waves</b> (L <b>waves)</b> or Rayleigh <b>waves.</b> A seismic <b>wave</b> is a <b>wave</b> that travels through the Earth, often as the result of an earthquake or explosion. Love <b>waves</b> have transverse motion (movement is perpendicular to the direction of travel, like light <b>waves),</b> whereas Rayleigh <b>waves</b> have both longitudinal (movement parallel to the direction of travel, like sound <b>waves)</b> and transverse motion. Seismic <b>waves</b> are studied by seismologists and measured by a seismograph or seismometer. Surface <b>waves</b> span a wide frequency range, and the period of <b>waves</b> that are most damaging is usually 10 seconds or longer. Surface <b>waves</b> can travel around the globe many times from the largest earthquakes. Surface <b>waves</b> are caused when P <b>waves</b> and S <b>waves</b> come to the surface.|$|R

5|$|The {{meeting at}} Aintree had been beset by {{problems}} before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had also {{happened at the}} 1991 Grand National) resulting in a delayed start. A first false start was caused by several riders becoming tangled in the starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, <b>waved</b> his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around. At the second attempt, the tape became tangled again — {{around the neck of}} jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he <b>waved</b> it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, oblivious to the recall.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or <b>waved</b> about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.|$|E

5000|$|Surface <b>waves</b> are seismic <b>waves</b> {{that travel}} {{at the surface}} of the earth, along the air/earth boundary. [...] Surface <b>waves</b> are slower than P-waves(compressional <b>waves)</b> and S-waves(transverse <b>waves).</b> Surface <b>waves</b> are {{classified}} into two basic types, Rayleigh <b>waves</b> and Love <b>waves.</b> Rayleigh <b>waves</b> travel in a longitudinal manner (the <b>wave</b> motion is parallel to the direction of <b>wave</b> propagation) with particle motion in a retrograde elliptical motion (Figure 1). The Rayleigh <b>waves</b> result from the interaction between P-waves and vertically polarized S-waves. [...] Conversely, Love <b>waves</b> travel in a traverse manner (Figure 1) (the <b>wave</b> motion is perpendicular to the direction of <b>wave</b> propagation), consisting of horizontally polarized S-waves.In seismology, surface <b>waves</b> are collected along with other seismic data, but are traditionally considered noise and an impedance in interpreting deeper reflection and refraction information. Seismologists usually modify seismic equipment and experimental procedures to remove surface <b>wave</b> information from the data. Earthquake seismologists however require the information seismic surface <b>waves</b> provide and thus design their equipment to amplify and gather as much information on these <b>waves</b> as possible. The work by early earthquake seismologists to extract substantial information from surface <b>wave</b> data was the basis for surface <b>wave</b> inversion theory.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Love <b>waves</b> or shear <b>waves</b> are {{referred}} to dispersive SH <b>waves.</b> The diffusive parameters are found to produce complex amplitude and diffusive <b>waves</b> for energy hauling. Approach: Analytical solutions are found for analysis and discussions. Results: When the standing <b>waves</b> are compared with the Love <b>waves,</b> similar cosine component is found in both <b>waves.</b> Energy hauling between <b>waves</b> is impossible for Love <b>waves</b> if the cosine component is independent. In the view of 3 D particle motion, the sine component of the Rayleigh <b>waves</b> will interfere with shear <b>waves</b> and thus the energy hauling capability of shear <b>waves</b> are formed for generating directed dislocations. Nevertheless, the cnoidal <b>waves</b> with low elliptic parameter are shown to act analogous to Rayleigh <b>waves.</b> Conclusion: Love <b>waves</b> or Rayleigh <b>waves</b> are unable to propagate energy once the sine component does not exist...|$|R

40|$|When first-order natural <b>waves</b> are {{reproduced}} {{in the laboratory}} using the first order <b>wave</b> generation technique, the primary <b>waves</b> and their locked bounded <b>waves</b> are generated along with some unwanted free <b>waves.</b> Those free <b>waves</b> are evidently generated and propagate towards the test model and reflect from the boundaries. The free <b>waves,</b> having the same frequency of the bounded <b>wave</b> are reproduced, as the boundary conditions of the <b>wave</b> paddle are not properly satisfied up to second-order. The other two types of free <b>waves</b> are due to the <b>wave</b> paddle displacement and local disturbances.
