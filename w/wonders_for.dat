5|$|On {{the next}} matchday, Juventus {{played host to}} Newcastle on 1 October and Del Piero hit a brace to help his club {{maintain}} the top spot in their group. Juventus advanced to the second group stage where the club managed to progress, along with Manchester United, on goal differential over FC Basel and Deportivo de La Coruña. Juventus then saw off Barcelona in the quarter-finals through an extra time goal by Marcelo Zalayeta, and faced Spanish opposition again in the likes of defending champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals. The triumvirate attacking partnership proved <b>wonders</b> <b>for</b> Juventus, as the team overturned a 2–1 first leg deficit to record a 4–3 aggregate win as all three attacking stars netted in a 3–1 home win in the second leg. Juventus faced Italian rivals Milan in the Final in Manchester on 28 May 2003. After a goalless 120 minutes, the tie went to a penalty shoot-out, where Del Piero finished his spot-kick, but it wasn't enough, as Juventus fell 3–2 in the shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|Other promotional campaigns {{included}} introducing bound {{versions of}} {{the first chapter of}} the novel, across city bookstores. Tripathi felt that a celebrity name associated with the book would do <b>wonders</b> <b>for</b> its promotion. Hence he sent the book to various known faces in the publishing world like Anil Dharker and Prahlad Kakkar. Ultimately, when Tripathi's agent Tiwari decided to publish around 5,000 copies of the book himself, they already had the celebrity preview attached to it, and it helped in promotion. The UK publication rights of the Shiva trilogy, including The Immortals of Meluha was purchased by Jo Fletcher Books, with the deal being made by Claire Roberts at Trident Media Group, acting on behalf of the author and Bahri from Red Ink Literary Agency. The book would be released in the United States in summer 2013. In 2013, a music album called Vayuputras, an original soundtrack based on the Shiva Trilogy books, was released. The album is an extension of The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas with special tracks inspired by important junctures like Shiva's dance and the war speech in the books. Artists like Sonu Nigam, Taufiq Qureshi, Palash Sen, Bickram Ghosh worked on the album. This was the first time ever that an original soundtrack was made for a book series.|$|E

25|$|The {{macroeconomic}} measures worked <b>wonders</b> <b>for</b> production. GDP shot up 9.5 {{percent in}} 1986 and a further 7.7 percent in 1987. Manufacturing output and construction both increased {{by more than}} one-fourth in these two years. An even greater surprise was that agricultural production per capita went up, running counter to its long downward trend. And the rate of inflation came down from 163 percent in 1985 to 78 percent in 1986, although it edged back up to 86 percent in 1987. In response to stronger market conditions and perhaps also to growing confidence that Peru's economic problems were at last being attacked successfully, private fixed investment went up by 24 percent in 1986, and capital flight went down.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode an 8.4/10, calling {{the change of}} pace from the show's usual random storytelling [...] "pleasant". The Misery segment was criticized as being flat, but was made up for by the other two, particularly The Shawshank Redemption. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave it a B- and called the Stand by Me story [...] "too earnest to turn into much of a comic romp" [...] and that the gags in The Shawshank Redemption were [...] "too expected".

500|$|Farrell next {{appeared}} in Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream, which premiered in 2007 and was {{distributed in the}} US in early 2008. Reviews were mixed, with Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide writing that Allen's work was [...] "shallow and unconvincing from beginning to end" [...] and Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle saying that although [...] "it's {{not as good as}} Match Point or Crimes and Misdemeanors...taken on its own, it's a fairly impressive piece, a directorially vigorous, well-acted, tightly constructed movie". LaSalle praised Farrell: [...] "Allen is notorious for not giving his actors explicit instructions, and yet somehow this worked <b>wonders</b> <b>for</b> Farrell, who has never seemed so naked, so clear and so unencumbered as he does here." [...] Manohla Dargis concurred in the New York Times, adding that she thought Farrell was well-matched with co-star Ewan McGregor.|$|E

[...] However, he criticized the series being [...] "cheesy and melodramatic more often than not." [...] He concluded the review saying, [...] "Despite some laughable melodrama, the raw emotions and Shaft's hypnotic animation makes ef ~a tale of memories~ a memorable romance.

500|$|Returning to Paris in February 1849, Offenbach {{found the}} grand salons closed down. He {{went back to}} working as a cellist, and {{occasional}} conductor, at the Opéra-Comique, but was not encouraged in his aspirations to compose. His talents had been noted by {{the director of the}} Comédie Française, Arsène Houssaye, who appointed him musical director of the theatre, with a brief to enlarge and improve the orchestra. [...] Offenbach composed songs and incidental music for eleven classical and modern dramas for the Comédie Française in the early 1850s. Some of his songs became very popular, and he gained valuable experience in writing for the theatre. Houssaye later wrote that Offenbach had done <b>wonders</b> <b>for</b> his theatre. The management of the Opéra-Comique, however, remained uninterested in commissioning him to compose for its stage. The composer Debussy later wrote that the musical establishment could not cope with Offenbach's irony, which exposed the [...] "false, overblown quality" [...] of the operas they favoured – [...] "the great art at which one was not allowed to smile".|$|E
