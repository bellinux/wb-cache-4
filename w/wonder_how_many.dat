25|$|In 1535 {{the abbey}} was valued in the Valor Ecclesiasticus {{as having an}} income of £540, a very {{comfortable}} sum, which leads one to <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of the abbey's financial problems were due to bad management. This figure meant that Vale Royal escaped being dissolved {{under the terms of}} the First Suppression Act, King Henry VIII's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot was John Hareware (elected 1535), who had previously been abbot of Hulton Abbey. He pursued a two-pronged policy of attempting to ensure the survival of his abbey and, should that fail, the security of himself and his brethren thereafter. He bribed courtiers, influential nobles and in particular chief minister Thomas Cromwell with money and property in the hope of gaining respite; he also leased out most of the abbey lands to friends and associates of the monastery to keep them out of royal hands should the abbey fall (many of these leases had a clause which stated that they should be void if the abbey survived). He began to realise the other assets such as livestock and timber for cash.|$|E
500|$|Harvey's attacking style {{often led}} to {{criticism}} that his batting was risky, with England captain Len Hutton {{feeling that he}} played and missed too much, while dour all-rounder Trevor Bailey quipped [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> runs Harvey would make if he decided to stop playing strokes with an element of risk about them". Harvey was nevertheless happy to continue his flamboyant strokeplay. However, as Harvey progressed in seniority, he eschewed his hook shot and played more conservatively for his team's sake. He typically evaded bouncers by tilting his head, rather than ducking the ball.|$|E
500|$|The {{difficulty}} {{and significance of}} the game's final boss, the Creator, has elicited several mentions. GamePro named {{him one of the}} [...] "47 Most Diabolical Video-Game Villains of All Time", placing him 37th on the list and adding [...] "You gotta <b>wonder...</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> hit points did the developers give God?" [...] 1UP.com described the battle as [...] "epic", considering it part of a recurring theme of Japanese role-playing games in which characters band together to kill God. Comedian Jackie Kashian referenced the Creator on Comedy Central Presents, describing the game's final battle as [...] "the worst premise ever of any video game", and recalling how she still tried for eight months to defeat the boss. Despite the final boss' difficulty, it can be killed easily by the instant-death [...] "chainsaw" [...] weapon. In 2009, Square Enix battle planner Nobuyuki Matsuoka paid homage to the fact in the game Final Fantasy XIII, by deliberately giving the title's final boss a similar vulnerability.|$|E

Not only that, but five year old grit, cos this first saw {{you through the}} Xmas of 1973. <b>Wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> copies they had left over that they're still releasing it. A hit of course but a shame they couldn't do something new cos I think they're great." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cronkite {{spoke out}} against the War on Drugs {{in support of the}} Drug Policy Alliance, writing a {{fundraising}} letter and appearing in advertisements on behalf of the DPA. In the letter, Cronkite wrote: [...] "Today, our nation is fighting two wars: one abroad and one at home. While the war in Iraq is in the headlines, the other war is still being fought on our own streets. Its casualties are the wasted lives of our own citizens. I am speaking of the war on drugs. And I cannot help but <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> more lives, and how much more money, will be wasted before another Robert McNamara admits what is plain for all to see: the war on drugs is a failure." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{sat there}} {{thinking}} {{of her in the}} abstract, and <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> maids outside Japan were dowried with like grace and the like voice.

60|$|This was downright generous of Mr. Cooke. We have all, no doubt, drawn {{our line}} {{between what is}} right and what is wrong, but I have often <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of us with the world's indorsement across our backs {{trespass}} as little {{on the other side of}} the line as he.|$|R

60|$|Then {{and there}} he {{delivered}} a remarkably neat little oration--pat, well put together, and clearly delivered. So it came to pass that the Queen's health was best honoured by an American.
