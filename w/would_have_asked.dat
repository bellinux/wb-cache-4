25|$|La Rose des Vents and Arc-en-ciel ("Rainbow") network {{were part}} of Gladio. François de Grossouvre was Gladio's leader for the region around Lyon in France until his alleged suicide on April 7, 1994. Grossouvre <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> Constantin Melnik, leader of the French secret {{services}} during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62), to return to activity. He was living in comfortable exile in the US, where he maintained links with the Rand Corporation. Constantin Melnik {{is alleged to have}} been involved in the creation in 1952 of the Ordre Souverain du Temple Solaire, an ancestor of the Order of the Solar Temple, created by former A.M.O.R.C. members, in which the SDECE (French former military intelligence agency) was interested.|$|E
25|$|Barron {{believes}} that United States {{history is not}} accurately taught in schools, and has expressed interest in promoting African-American history throughout the New York City public school system. He has drafted legislation mandating the teaching of African-American history in required school curriculum. He has used his position as Councilman to propose renaming buildings and schools as well as decorating them with mementos of black history. He wishes to publicize black history greater, including erecting portraits of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, as important leaders in American history. Barron proposed bills to honor America's African American heritage and such individuals as Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, Frederick Douglass, Paul Robeson, and W.E.B. Du Bois. He drafted a bill which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> President George W. Bush to cancel all debts African nations owe the U.S.|$|E
25|$|A {{year before}} this, Manchester <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> for and acted upon {{the advice of}} a capable soldier, such as Cromwell or Crawford. Now, however, his mind was warped by a desire for peace on any terms, and he sought only to avoid defeat, pending a happy {{solution}} of the quarrel. Those who sought to gain peace through victory were, meanwhile, driving Maurice back from hedge to hedge towards the open ground at Newbury. But every attempt to emerge from the lanes and fields was repulsed by the royal cavalry, and indeed, by every available man and horse. Charles's officers had gauged Manchester's intentions, and almost stripped the front of its defenders to stop Waller's advance. Nightfall {{put an end to the}} struggle around Newbury, and then too late, Manchester ordered the attack on Shaw House. It failed completely, in spite of the gallantry of his men, and darkness being then complete, it was not renewed.|$|E
5000|$|The Elder Mother {{is thought}} to be the {{guardian}} of the elder trees, and it was said, until recent times in various parts of England and Scandinavia that to take wood from the elder tree one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>ask</b> the Elder Mother first, or else ill luck would befall the woodsman. The woodsman <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to <b>ask</b> the Elder Mother like so: ...|$|R

500|$|When the Korean animators were animating the {{sequence}} with Marge in the gun training course, {{they did not}} know how to correctly animate the [...] "shell com out of the gun" [...] because guns were illegal in Korea. They had to consult with the American animators, who advised them to watch movies so they could properly animate the guns. The original design for Marge's police uniform had Marge's hair standing up (as it normally is) with the hat on top. Director Mark Kirkland found that it made for awkward staging in scenes, so they altered the design to have her hair pulled down. David Mirkin later stated that if the design had been used, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> for it to be changed because they were trying to depict Marge as a serious cop.|$|E
500|$|The protests {{have drawn}} {{criticism}} from some {{observers of the}} Sri Lankan Civil War. In an opinion piece titled [...] "Misguided Tamil protesters" [...] published by the National Post, Martin Collacott, a former High Commissioner of Canada to Sri Lanka, questioned {{the objectives of the}} protesters. In the editorial, he insisted that if the primary concern of the protesters was the safety of Tamil civilians, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> the LTTE to free those trapped in the war zone instead of using them as human shields. However, by asking for a ceasefire, he said, the protesters want to [...] "bring about a situation that would allow the Tigers to preserve their fighting capability and prolong the insurgency." [...] The article goes on to question why children who were born in Canada to native Sri Lankan parents were brought out to protests among others who were waving the flag of an organisation Canada has labelled a terrorist organization.|$|E

Apart from Tangerine Dream's score, some excerpts from Keith Jarrett's Hymns/Spheres were employed. Friedkin also featured one licensed song, [...] "I'll Remember April", by jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker, and a cover version of [...] "So What" [...] by Miles Davis. For the film's screening, Paramount and William Friedkin prepared specific instructions regarding music: they demanded a three-and-half-minute musical overture to be played prior to each screening, and prohibited any alterations to it.|$|E

2500|$|Smith started {{arguing that}} Hutchison had {{approved}} {{to make the}} $50,000 expenditure, but {{wanted to talk to}} Hewitt first in July 1928. Hewitt also went and stated that the entire parkway would cost $50million (1928USD) to be constructed. Smith rebuffed that saying the parkway would be spread out over a period of a minimum of six years from the beginning of construction. The first piece would only be $5million spent. Smith called the opposition reasons by Hutchinson and Hewitt as [...] "absurd", though Smith admitted he said no funds for construction would be asked on until completion of the Southern State and the causeway to Jones Beach State Park. Smith said that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> for the money this year if the legislature had not cut money that made it harder to get construction to Wantagh.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prospect}} of an independent Scotland {{raised questions about the}} future of the Northern Isles (Orkney and Shetland) and the Western Isles, island groups off the Scottish mainland. Some islanders called for separate referendums to be held in the islands on 25 September 2014, one week after the Scottish referendum. In March 2014, the Scottish Parliament published the online petition it had received calling for such referendums, which was supported by Shetland MSP Tavish Scott. The proposed referendums <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> islanders to choose from three options: that the island group should become an independent country; that it should remain in Scotland; or that (in the event of Scottish independence) it should remain in the UK. The third option would have implemented a conditional promise made in 2012 by an SNP spokesperson, who said that Orkney and Shetland could remain in the United Kingdom if their [...] "drive for self-determination" [...] was strong enough.|$|E
2500|$|In a September 2010 {{interview}} from the prison, Van der Sloot admitted to extorting Twitty, stating: [...] "I {{wanted to get}} back at Natalee's family — her parents have been making my life tough for five years." [...] On September 11, Twitty traveled to Peru with Peter R. De Vries and his Dutch television crew to visit the prison. According to Van der Sloot's attorney Maximo Alonso Altez Navarro, his client was taken [...] "practically by force" [...] to a meeting with Twitty that took [...] "less than one minute." [...] Altez Navarro said that when Twitty asked questions about the disappearance of her daughter, Van der Sloot responded by saying that he could not speak to her without his lawyer present and handing her his lawyer's business card. Altez Navarro claimed that Twitty was [...] "snuck" [...] into the prison without being identified by the Dutch media crew who she was with. A prison spokesperson stated that Twitty's name was not found in the visitor registry. [...] Colonel Abel Gamarra of the Peruvian National Police stated that no arrests had been made. Twitty's attorney John Q. Kelly commented, [...] "I know she didn't tell me ahead of time because I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> her to exercise a little more caution." [...] While in Peru, Twitty spoke with Flores's brother Enrique on camera. On September 17, Holloway and the group left the country for Panama and arrived in Aruba on the same day. Twitty spent a few days in Aruba working with De Vries on a documentary about her missing daughter to be run on Dutch television, reportedly with the cooperation of prosecutors who had been investigating Van der Sloot. The video premiered in November 2010 on SBS6 in the Netherlands and as a special episode of 48 Hours on CBS in the United States, resulting in the suspension of Miguel Castro Castro prison warden Alex Samamé Peña.|$|E
