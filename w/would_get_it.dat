5|$|There was a seat vacant on the U.S. Supreme Court in 1889, and Governor Foraker {{suggested}} President Harrison appoint Taft to fill it. Taft was 32 and {{his professional}} goal {{was always a}} seat on the Supreme Court. He actively sought the appointment, writing to Foraker to urge the governor to press his case, while stating to others it was unlikely he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b> Instead, in 1890, Harrison appointed him Solicitor General of the United States. When Taft arrived in Washington in February 1890, the office had been vacant two months, with the work piling up. He worked to eliminate the backlog, while simultaneously educating himself on federal law and procedure he had not needed as an Ohio state judge.|$|E

Wayland fetched the stone but, when he came back, the king's dróttseti (seneschal) asked for it. Wayland refused to give it up and killed the knight. Niðung banished him.|$|E
500|$|Mercury {{released}} the demo in 1989 as The Kentucky Headhunters' debut album, Pickin' on Nashville. The album produced four singles, {{all of which}} reached top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. The first of these, the [...] "Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine" [...] cover, peaked at number 25 in December 1989. After it came [...] "Dumas Walker," [...] about a then-74-year-old marbles player who owned a liquor store that the band frequented. According to Doug, Mercury Records was initially reluctant to release the song as a single: [...] " [...] thought it was too regional, {{and that no one}} outside the area <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>it,</b> but what they didn't see, was the reaction we got to it every night that we played it in front of a crowd, and it didn't matter where we were playing either." [...] The single peaked at number 15 on the Billboard chart.|$|E

The film was outgrossed by fellow opener Wild Hogs and saw a decline of over 50% in its second weekend, losing out to the record-breaking 300. It grossed $33 million in North America and $51 million {{in the rest of}} the world, {{bringing}} its current total to $84 million, above its estimated $65 million production budget. In an interview with Sight & Sound magazine, Fincher addressed the film's low gross at the North American box office: [...] "Even with the box office being what it is, I still think there's an audience out there for this movie. Everyone has a different idea about marketing, but my philosophy is that if you market a movie to 16-year-old boys and don't deliver Saw or Seven, they're going to be the most vociferous ones coming out of the screening saying 'This movie sucks.' And you're saying goodbye to the audience who <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> because they're going to look at the ads and say, 'I don't want to see some slasher movie.'" ...|$|E
