He {{served in the}} Virginia State Senate, and represented Virginia in the United States Senate <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> was readmitted after the American Civil War. He was United States Senator for 13 years. In national politics, he was a Democrat.|$|E

When the RNC met in mid-June, {{just prior to the}} convention, McKinley was easily victorious in almost all cases.|$|E

Congressional Bill H.R. 5426, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, removed agricultural export sanctions applied to Libya, Sudan, and North Korea (agricultural trade with Cuba remained under some restrictions) and gave Congress veto power over unilateral presidential actions in this regard.|$|E

5|$|The current highway was {{designated}} in 1979, replacing the former route of M-131; the routing has remained unchanged since. This section of highway {{had been part}} of M-13 on July 1, 1919, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> trunkline highway system debuted. Later on November 11, 1926, M-13 south of Fife Lake was redesignated as part of US131, and the remainder of M-13 {{was designated}} as M-131.|$|E

As such, these cities and towns were incorporated by means other than those stipulated by current state law and the constitution. Phoenix, for example, was incorporated in 1881 by an act of the Territorial Legislature.|$|E

In 1926, when M-40 was extended from Allegan to Martin, M-89 was rerouted out of Allegan to the southeast along its present-day alignment to terminate at US131 in Plainwell.|$|E
3000|$|An {{extreme case}} of {{intermittent}} control is impulsive control {{which has been}} gained increasing interest and intensively researched [33, 34]. The prominent characteristic of impulsive control is that <b>the</b> <b>states</b> of controlled system will [...] "jump" [...] at certain discrete time moments, namely, the control is with zero duration of time. Because <b>the</b> <b>states</b> of controlled systems are changed directly, impulsive control is an effective approach <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> are observable, {{but it seems to}} be invalid <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> of controlled systems are unobservable.|$|R

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{highway system}} was {{initially}} signposted in 1919, the westernmost section of today's M-136 was designated {{as part of}} M-19.

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{highway system}} was {{originally}} signed in 1919, M-99 was designated {{on a road}} between the Lake Michigan shoreline and M-11 (now US31) between Muskegon and Hart. This highway was decommissioned in 1929. In 1931, M-99 was designated on a gravel road in the Upper Peninsula from US2 just east of Gulliver) to Port Inland on Lake Michigan. This highway was decommissioned as well in 1939.|$|E

5|$|A road {{bearing the}} M-81 {{designation}} has existed {{since at least}} July 1, 1919, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> initially numbered its trunkline highways. Since that time, it has been extended, rerouted or shortened several times. These changes resulted in essentially the modern highway routing by 1926; the highway was fully paved in the 1940s. A change made in 1929 was reversed in 1933, and an extension through downtown Saginaw in the 1960s was overturned in the 1970s. The last change was {{the construction of a}} pair of roundabouts at the I-75/US23 interchange in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has been}} a county road since 1960, F-41 was a state highway in 1919 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> {{trunkline}} highway system was formed. It was a segment of the original M-10 that was replaced by US23 in 1926. Later changes to US23 shifted that road closer to Lake Huron, and the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) created two different routings for M-171 out of the former US23 routings in the area. The second of these highways has been designated F-41 since 1970.|$|E

Melbourne-based Hawthorn played one game in 2001 and two in 2002, and in 2003 were joined by another Melbourne team, St Kilda. In 2004, {{it was estimated that}} the cost to the government per game was between $300,000 and $500,000, but Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon stated that the government was making a profit on its investment, estimating that each game injected between $1million and $1.5million into the Tasmanian economy.|$|E

5|$|Built in {{a modernist}} style, the {{building}} {{has been the subject}} of vigorous public debate about its heritage value. Some parties, such as the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, consider the building to be an important example of modernist architecture in the city, whilst others consider it ugly. These conflicting views led to animosity in the 1990s, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Government refused to heritage list the property, and instead recommended its demolition. Despite this, the City of Perth opted to renovate the tower and keep it as its headquarters. Following this, the building was admitted to the State's Heritage Register.|$|E
5|$|During the Brazilian Revolution of 1930, Bahia {{served with}} Rio Grande do Sul—until that ship defected—and {{five or six}} destroyers {{off the coast of}} Santa Catarina; they were once again {{commanded}} by Belford Gomes. Two years later, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of São Paulo rebelled in the Constitutionalist Revolution, Bahia—under the command of Frigate Captain Lucas Alexandre Boiteux—and other vessels blockaded the rebel-held port of Santos. Bahia was under repair from 1934 into 1935. In November 1935, Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul sailed to Natal, the capital of Rio Grande do Norte, to lend support against another rebellion. As part of their mission, they were ordered to sink the steamship Santos on sight, as several escaping leaders of the revolution were on board.|$|E

The business loop was created after US10 was moved to bypass downtown Reed City in the late 1950s. This realignment was completed, and the business loop commissioned, by 1960. Until 1986, the western half of the loop along Chestnut Street ran concurrently with US131 until that highway was moved to its current freeway routing.|$|E
