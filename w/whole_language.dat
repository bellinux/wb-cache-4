This method aims to make reading fun and keep children motivated, which is beneficial because learning to read depends heavily on what the student does and not the teacher. While the child is typically very engaged in this method, many children struggle to infer the specific rules of the language on their own, which causes the child's decoding and spelling to suffer during development.|$|E

50|$|Wundt became {{interested}} in Völkerpsychologie very early in his career. He became so interested in the topic that he offered a course on social psychology at the University of Heidelberg in 1859. In his first book, Beiträge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung(Natural History of Man), which he wrote {{when he was at}} Heidelberg, Wundt talked about the programs involving experimental psychology and Völkerpsychologie. In the second volume, Vorlesungen über die Menschen-und Thierseele (Lectures on the Human and Animal Mind), which Wundt wrote 16 years prior to when he started the experimental psychology program at Leipzig. He focused many pages to the explanation and development of Völkerpsychologie. This shows his growing interest and seriousness for implementing this form of psychology into mainstream psychology. The immediate topics in Völkerpsychologie are language, myth, and custom. For Wundt, the whole reason to study the comparative and historical study of these mental topics was to provide an objective point of view for making inferences about the psychological processes involved when they are produced. However, Wundt was not interested in studying these topics just because they are interesting topics like other professionals might. An example for this: “The origin and development of these products depend in every case on general psychical conditions which may be inferred from their objective attributes. Psychological analysis can, consequently, explain the psychical processes operative in their formation and development.” Wundt naturally thought that experimental methods were wrong to the study of <b>whole</b> <b>languages,</b> myths, and customs, because they cannot be used properly in a scientific manor by introspection itself. Although the “supraindividual”, which means above or beyond the individual in groups, nature of <b>whole</b> <b>languages,</b> myths, and customs comes before their experimental investigation.|$|R

6000|$|This is a {{concession}} to common-sense, and argues an ignorance {{of the fact that}} sane and (apparently) waking men may have hallucinations. On the theory that we may have inappreciable moments of sleep when we think ourselves awake, it is not an ordinary but an extraordinary coincidence that Brougham should have had that peculiar moment of the [...] "dream" [...] of G--- on the day or night of G---'s death, while the circumstance that he had made a compact with G--- multiplies the odds against accident in a ratio which mathematicians may calculate.
