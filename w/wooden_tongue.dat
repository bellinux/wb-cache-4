60|$|It's my turn {{to write}} it so I suppose I must. I guess my worst {{adventure}} {{was two years ago}} when a whole lot of us were coasting on Uncle Rogers hill. Charlie Cowan and Fred Marr had started, but half-way down their sled got stuck and I run down to shove them off again. Then I stood there just a moment to watch them with my back {{to the top of the}} hill. While I was standing there Rob Marr started Kitty and Em Frewen off on his sled. His sled had a <b>wooden</b> <b>tongue</b> in it and it slanted back over the girls' heads. I was right in the way and they yelled to me to get out, but just as I heard them it struck me. The sled took me between the legs and I was histed back over the tongue and dropped in a heap behind before I knew what had happened to me. I thought a tornado had struck me. The girls couldn't stop though they thought I was killed, but Rob came tearing down and helped me up. He was awful scared but I wasn't killed nor my back wasn't broken but my nose bled something awful and kept on bleeding for three days. Not all the time but by spells.|$|E

Mixed by Cornel Wilczek and mastered by François Tétaz, their second effort for Mush Records received equally positive praise. Brian Turner of WFMU described the album having [...] "flowing rhymes and scratches that complement Muslimgauze-ish beats, baroque horns, kid choruses and operatic flights, Bollywood cooing, Balkan horn blasts all presented in sharp precision {{appropriate to the}} assorted lyrics (which focus, needless to say, on worldly diversity/cultural unity).

Beat Magazine noted that [...] "the biggest shock is that the second half plays with shade and texture, revealing subtlety {{to be one of}} their strengths, possibly the only thing not sampled on their debut".|$|R
50|$|The {{case was}} of the variety known as giraffe. The space under the {{keyboard}} was enclosed, a knee-hold being left in which were two pedals used to set in rotation a large wooden cylinder fixed just behind the keyboard over the levers, {{and covered with a}} roll-top similar to those of modern office desks. The cylinder (in some specimens covered with chamois leather) tapered towards the treble-end. When a key was depressed, a little tongue of wood, one end of which stopped the string, was pressed against the revolving cylinder, and the vibrations produced by friction were transmitted to the string and reinforced as in the piano and violin by the soundboard. The adjustment of the parts and the velocity of the cylinder required delicacy and great nicety, for if the little <b>wooden</b> <b>tongues</b> rested too lightly upon the cylinder or the strings, harmonics were produced, and the note jumped to the octave or twelfth.Sometimes when chords were played the touch became so heavy that two performers were required, as in the early medieval organistrum, the prototype of the harmonichord. Carl Maria von Weber must have had some opinion of the possibilities of the harmonichord, which in tone resembled the glass harmonica, since he composed a concerto with orchestral accompaniment for the instrument.|$|R

The left end is held firmly against the cheek, while a string tied to the right end is jerked rhythmically to set the tongue into motion (in contrast to other jaw harps in which the tongue itself is plucked to produce sound). Different harmonics are produced by pronouncing different vowel sounds.|$|R

50|$|Epoxy resins and hardeners are universally used in boat {{building}} due {{to their}} superior holding power and ease of use. In its thickened state it {{is used as a}} strong filler and for a range of joints that do away with more traditional fastenings. A large supply of cheap <b>wooden</b> <b>tongue</b> depressors is useful for mixing and applying epoxy resin. The curved ends are useful for shaping coved joints with epoxy. Silicon bronze ring nails are excellent for permanent fastening of wood and ply as they are strong and easily driven. Many small boats are almost entirely fastened by epoxy resin. In stitch and glue construction the hull panels are temporarily held together with either copper wire, nylon fishing line or plastic cable ties, until the epoxy cures, after which the stitching material is removed. Polyester filler is a quick setting (20mts), softer filler, suited to very small holes and scratches and is far more easily sanded to a fair shape than harder, stronger epoxy filler which takes 24 hours to set hard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Occupational {{exposure}} to toxic chemicals such as Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) from diesel engine exhaust implicates genotoxic risk. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the DNA damage among KL Sentral depot workers exposed to TVOC by means of cytogenetic analysis. Data were obtained partially from disseminated questionnaires and buccal cells samples were collected from a total of 27 depot workers and 10 office workers by using <b>wooden</b> <b>tongue</b> depressor. TVOC measurement was carried out by using Photoionisation Detector (PID). 4 sampling points were selected, namely Locomotive (LOCO), Power Generating Car (PGC), refuelling of diesel and coach. Cytogenetic analysis was done by using Acridine Orange (AO) staining. Micronucleus (MN) frequency as a biomarker for DNA damage was scored from 1, 000 cells per sample observed under fluorescence microscope. The results showed that the overall means of concentrations for TVOC were 0. 1 ± 0. 1, 0. 0 ± 0. 0, 0. 1 ± 0. 0 and 0. 1 ± 0. 0 in LOCO, PGC, refuelling of diesel an...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic reliability of a simplified tool to detect high-risk overjet for dental trauma. Material and Methods: The study population {{was composed of}} 131 volunteers {{divided into two groups}} according to the overjet measurement in terms of risk for traumatic dental injury (GRAB: risk absent and GRPR: risk present). The distance between the most prominent labial surface and its corresponding counterpart was measured using both the conventional (WHO, 1997) and the simplified tool. The measurements were taken independently and on separate occasions by two previously calibrated dental surgeons (Kappa= 0. 86). The gold standard method, as recommended by the WHO (1997), was performed by an external examiner. The simplified method, based on pencil-marked <b>wooden</b> <b>tongue</b> depressors was carried out in a blind manner by the other examiner. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated for the classification of risk for dental trauma in terms of overjet using the simplified method and compared to the conventional method. Results: The results revealed high values for sensitivity (S= 1), specificity (E= 0. 93), positive (PPV= 0. 95) and negative predictive value (NPV= 1). Conclusion: The examination using the simplified tool was reliable in identifying high-risk overjet, thus offering an alternative to the conventional examination...|$|E
40|$|AbstractZygomycosis {{refers to}} a group of {{uncommon}} and frequently fatal mycoses caused by fungi of the class Zygomycetes, the organisms of which are usually found in decaying organic matter. Disease can be transmitted by the inhalation of spores or by direct inoculation on disrupted skin or mucosa. For rare diseases such as zygomycosis, two or more cases occurring in a short time should be investigated as a probable epidemic. Twelve hospital outbreaks and two pseudoepidemics caused by Zygomycetes have been cited in the English literature. The first epidemic was recorded in 1977 and the last in 2008. Outbreaks {{have been reported in the}} USA, the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Cases have included cutaneous, disseminated, pulmonary and rhinocerebral disease. Species identified have included Rhizopus arrhizus, Rhizopus rhizopodiformis, Rhizopus microsporus, Rhizopus spp., Absidia corymbifera and Rhizomucor pusillius. Sources of infection have included Elastoplast adhesive bandage rolls, ventilation systems, <b>wooden</b> <b>tongue</b> depressors, karaya (plant-derived adhesive) ostomy bags, and water damage to a linen store and patient shower room. Patients have included cardiosurgery patients, renal transplant recipients, orthopaedic patients, adult leukaemia patients, intensive care unit neonates, immunocompromised haematology patients, and burn unit patients. Although zygomycosis outbreaks in the hospital environment are infrequent, a high index of suspicion should exist if necrotic lesions appear in proximity to a postoperative wound. Direct tissue examination and tissue culture and histopathology must be routinely performed...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the project}} {{is to build a}} {{functional}} low-cost prosthetic arm that is easily maintained. The focus is on prostheses that attach to the forearm. This design must perform daily life tasks such as picking up, holding and carrying objects while playing and working. To begin the design, a mechanical finger was built with <b>wooden</b> <b>tongue</b> depressors as bone material; rubber bands, string, and drinking straws as muscle material; and masking tape as ligament and tendon material. The length of each joint was set to the golden ratio. Using this method, a basic 2 ̆ 2 hand 2 ̆ 2 was created {{that could be used to}} grip objects. The second step was to determine the amount of surface area needed to impart appropriate pressure for gripping objects without causing damaging. This was measured using an olive as a model. The pressure required to puncture the skin of an olive with an object of known surface area was determined. Newton 2 ̆ 7 s first law was used to derive the graph of Force vs. Area of the finger tip. Each fingertip should have a surface area of at least 3. 67 mm 2 to prevent damage to objects encountered in daily life. The significance of the project is to develop an effective low-cost, easily maintained prosthetic arm that could benefit people with disabilities in developing nations or who are living below the poverty line...|$|E
40|$|A 24 {{year old}} {{thoroughbred}} gelding presented to Cornell University’s Equine and Farm Animal Hospital {{for a possible}} tongue laceration. He {{had a history of}} weight loss, hypersalivation, quidding, and dysphagia. The patient had several chronic medical conditions including Cushing’s disease, chronic uveitis, and Equine Odontoclastic Tooth Resorption and Hypercementosis (EOTRH). Five days prior to presentation the patient’s teeth were floated. The referring veterinarian diagnosed a presumptive tongue laceration and started the patient on oral trimethoprim sulfa, phenylbutazone, and gastrogard. Due to lack of improvement the patient was referred to Cornell for further evaluation. 	 On presentation the patient was quiet, alert, and responsive, but underweight. Vital parameters were all within normal limits. The left eye was atrophied and avisual due to previous uveitis. Mild submandibular lymphadenopathy was palpated. The patient was offered a small amount of hay and was observed to prehend and chew normally but when swallowing he tucked and shook his head and then dropped the hay. An oral exam revealed a large ulcerated lesion on the right caudolateral aspect of the tongue. No significant abnormalities were found on endoscopic exam of his nasopharynx or guttural pouches. The problem list consisted of the ulcerative lingual lesion and associated submandibular lymphadenopathy, hypersalivation, dysphagia, quidding, and weight loss. Differential diagnoses included lingual foreign body, abscess, neoplasia, trauma, or a primary infection such as actinobacillus lignieresii (<b>wooden</b> <b>tongue).</b> Secondary glossitis was considered likely with a foreign body, neoplasia, or trauma. Radiograph and ultrasound examinations were negative for a foreign body or abscess. Fine needle aspirates and biopsy samples were obtained under short duration anesthesia and were definitive for squamous cell carcinoma. Due to the location and extent of disease surgical resection was impossible and humane euthanasia was recommended. 	 This case report will discuss the presentation, possible etiologies, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of both equine squamous cell carcinoma and EOTRH...|$|E
40|$|Medical Devices’ include {{everything}} from highly sophisticated, computerized, medical equipment, {{right down to}} simple <b>wooden</b> <b>tongue</b> depressors. Regulations embody the public expectations for how buildings and facilities are expected to perform and as such represent public policy. Regulators, who develop and enforce regulations, are empowered {{to act in the}} public’s interest to set this policy and are ultimately responsible to the public in this regard. Standardization contributes to the basic infrastructure that underpins society including health and environment, while promoting sustainability and good regulatory practice. The international organizations that produce International Standards are the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). With the increasing globalization of markets, International Standards (as opposed to regional or national standards) have become critical to the trading process, ensuring a level playing field for exports, and ensuring that imports meet the internationally recognized levels of performance and safety. The development of standards is done in response to sectors and stakeholders that express a clearly established need for them. An industry sector or other stakeholder group typically communicates its requirement for standards to one of the national members. To be accepted for development, a proposed work item must receive a majority support of the participating members, who verify the global relevance of the proposed item. The regulatory authority (RA) should provide a method for the recognition of international voluntary standards and for public notification of such recognition. The process of recognition may vary from country to country. Recognition may occur by periodic publication of lists of standards that a regulatory authority has found will meet the Essential Principles. In conclusion, International standards, such as, basic standards, group standards, and product standards, are a tool for harmonizing regulatory processes, to assure the safety, quality, and performance of medical devices.

A series of experiments were designed to develop a collection of irradiation parameters for polymerizing a variety of molecular weights of polymer siloxanes for the purpose of bulking and conserving waterlogged archaeological organic materials. Waterlogged <b>wooden</b> <b>tongue</b> depressors (Betula spp) were bulked with five different silicone oils of varying molecular weights, denoted as PS 340, PS 341, PS 343, SFD- 1, and an equal mix of SFD- 1 and SFD- 5. The lightest weight oil being PS 340 and the heaviest being the SFD-I /SFD- 5 mix. These bulked samples were exposed to gamma radiation emitted from a nuclear research reactor and received gamma doses ranging from 30 Gy to 228 Gy with dose rates ranging from 0. 6 Gy/min to 5. 1 Gy/min. Following irradiation, thin cross sections of each tongue depressor were analyzed and photographed using a photomicroscope. The results of the irradiation indicated that the heavier molecular weights of siloxanes fully bulked the wood cells. For these fully bulked samples, large radiation doses induced polymerization in the oil to such an extent the cells swelled and became extremely distorted. However, for the same fully bulked samples, small radiation doses produced little to moderate polymerization of the oil in the wood cells. For the tongue depressors bulked with the lighter weight siloxanes, low radiation doses produced very little polymerization, whereas the higher doses induced substantially more polymerization within the wood cells but not to the point of distortion. With these lighter weight siloxanes, the wood cells were not as fully bulked nor looked as natural as those cells bulked with the heavier weight oils. The best combination of molecular weight and radiation dose occurred with the samples bulked in PS 343 and irradiated with gamma-rays to a dose of 150 Gy...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Silvicultural canopy gaps are {{emerging}} {{as an alternative}} management tool to accelerate development of complex forest structure in young, even-aged forests of the Pacific Northwest. I investigated patterns of nitrogen (N) availability along transects through 0. 1 and 0. 4 ha silvicultural gaps in three 50 - 70 year old Douglas-fir forests of western Oregon. Six indices of N availability in forest floor and mineral soil and several factors related to N cycling were measured from November 2005 to February 2007, approximately 6 - 8 years after gap creation. Results indicate that mineral soil pools of extractable ammonium (NH 4 ⁺) and nitrate (NO 3 ⁻), rates of net N mineralization and nitrification, and concentrations of ion-exchange resin NH 4 ⁺ and NO 3 ⁻ were significantly elevated in gaps relative to adjacent forest. Gap-forest differences in forest floor layers were less clear. For the majority of response variables, magnitudes and trends were similar in the centers of both gap sizes. N availability in gap edge positions more often resembled levels in the forest than in the gap interior, and there were few significant differences between positions {{north and south of}} gap centers. Forest floor and mineral soil percent moisture did not significantly differ along gap transects, nor did decomposition rates of <b>wooden</b> <b>tongue</b> depressors. Litterfall carbon (C) inputs and litterfall C:N ratios in gaps were significantly lower than in the forest. Reciprocal transfer incubations of mineral soil samples between gap and forest positions revealed that sample origin had a significant effect on net nitrification rates, while incubation environment did not. Variability of several indices of N availability also increased in gaps. The overall increase of N availability in 6 - 8 year old silvicultural gaps may be due more to {{the quality and quantity of}} litterfall inputs than temperature and moisture conditions. Increased quality of litterfall in gaps, as indicated by lower C:N ratios, may increase rates of decomposition and net N mineralization, while overall lower litterfall C inputs may lead to C-limitation of microbial immobilization, resulting in increased accumulation of inorganic N in soil. While environmental factors have been shown to drive N availability soon after gap creation, litter inputs from early-seral species may perpetuate increased N availability into early stages of vegetative succession. From a management perspective, increased N availability in gaps may increase tree productivity, but at the same time, increase the likelihood of invasion by exotic species. Gap creation may also increase gap-scale heterogeneity of available N in the short-term, while increasing stand-scale heterogeneity in the long-term...|$|E

This {{study was}} {{designed}} to gather data on infant feeding habits and oral hygiene practices of Hong Kong preschool children, on the dental knowledge and attitudes of their caregivers and on the oral health status of the same group of children. Design. Cross-sectional study. Sample and methods. Data was gathered for a total of 369 boys and 297 girls (207 1 -year-olds, 269 2 -year-olds and 190 3 -year-olds) {{with a mean age of}} 20 - 19 (± 0. 38) months. Information related to children attending six randomly selected Maternity and Child Health Centres. It was obtained by examining the children and by interviewing the attending caregivers and completing a questionnaire. Each child was given an oral examination using a torch, disposable mirror and <b>wooden</b> <b>tongue</b> spatula. Results. Only 7 % of the children were exclusively breast-fed. More than 98 % (656 / 666) of infants used a nursing bottle for at least some drinks. Over 62 % (411 / 656) had used a nursing bottle to take fluids other than water and infant formula. At bedtime, 56 % (361 / 656) were given a nursing bottle prior to sleep and 96 % (340 / 361) of these bottles contained formula milk. Of these children, only 37 % (131 / 361) finished the contents of the bottle before falling asleep. Over 73 % (139 / 190) of the children continued to use a feeding bottle after 2 years of age. Non-nutritive sucking habits were practised by 35. 6 % (237 / 666) of the children. Visible plaque, on the labial surface of at least two maxillary incisors, was found in 19. 5 % (120 / 615) of the children. Oral cleansing habits were practised for 66. 2 % (441 / 666) of the children. Toothbrushing habits were reported for 42. 3 % (260 / 615) of the dentate children, of whom 19 % (49 / 260) had their teeth brushed twice daily. Toothpaste was used by 49. 23 % (128 / 260) of the children and 57. 3 % (149 / 260) brushed their own teeth. Caries was seen in 7. 6 % of the infants (47 / 615). Of the caregivers, 67. 7 % said they did not think carious primary teeth needed to be restored. Among the mothers, 12. 6 % (43 / 342) did not know the oral condition of their child. Reportedly, 82 % (417 / 510) and 87. 5 % (446 / 510) of the mothers had not received any oral health care information during the ante- or postnatal periods.
