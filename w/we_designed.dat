A full year was spent building a specialized camera that could reproduce {{the effect of}} looking through someone else's eyes. Bigelow revealed that it was essentially [...] "a stripped-down Arri that weighed {{much less than the}} smallest EYMO and yet it would take all the prime lenses." [...] Cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti was also hired to help Bigelow film the scenes, which were choreographed weeks in advance. The opening sequence, which features a 16-foot jump between two buildings by a stunt performer without a safety harness, took two years to co-ordinate. According to Cameron, [...] "It's a major set piece. For the jump alone, we built special cameras, special rigs. <b>We</b> <b>designed</b> transitions that would work seamlessly. It was a very technical scene that doesn't look technical." ...|$|E

It was very unlikely even to have any 'break into song' moments within it, but the fact that <b>we</b> <b>designed</b> it so that it could I think gives it that sort of strange, music-driven resonance." [...] References to both Roxy Music's [...] "Love is the Drug" [...] and Jefferson Airplane's [...] "White Rabbit" [...] were seen in the original script, with the former being used in a musical sequence performed by actors Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac [...] "in the style of a Bob Fosse/Moulin Rouge kind of vibe", and the latter being picked by Snyder for his belief that it was [...] "perfect for our World War I [...] ". Bates considers Emilíana Torrini's cover of [...] "White Rabbit" [...] to be the soundtrack's standout. Nine songs are featured in the soundtrack, with Bates saying others were considered and discarded for among other reasons, veto from the original artists and [...] "lyrics too on the nose".|$|E

At length, by going half a dozen rods into the dense spruce and fir wood {{on the side of}} the mountain almost as dark as a cellar, we found a place sufficiently clear and level to lie down on, after cutting away a few bushes. The Indian cleared a path to it from the shore with his axe, and we then carried up all our baggage, pitched our tent, and made our bed, in order to be ready for foul weather, which then threatened us, and for the night. He gathered a large armful of fir twigs, breaking them off, which he said were the best for our bed, partly, I thought, because they were the largest and could be most rapidly collected. It had been raining more or less for four or five days, and the wood was even damper than usual, but he got dry bark from the under side of a dead leaning hemlock, which he said he could always do.|$|E
