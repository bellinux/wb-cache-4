500|$|Of the {{original}} 40-member Leningrad Radio Orchestra, only 14 or 15 {{still lived in}} the city; the others had either starved to death or left to fight the enemy. Shostakovich's symphony required an expanded orchestra of 100 players, meaning the remaining personnel were grossly insufficient. Eliasberg, at the time being treated for [...] "dystrophy", went door to door to seek out those musicians who had not responded to the orchestra's reassembly due to starvation or weakness. [...] "My God, how thin many of them were," [...] one of the organizers remembered. [...] "How those people livened up when <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> ferret {{them out of their}} dark apartments.

500|$|... {{women in}} Saudi Arabia have limited freedom of {{movement}} and in practice {{are not allowed to}} drive motor vehicles. In 1990, dozens of women in Riyadh drove their cars in protest, were imprisoned for one day, had their passports confiscated, and some of them lost their jobs. In September 2007, the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, co-founded by Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Uyyouni, gave a 1,100 signature petition to King Abdullah asking for women to be allowed to drive. On International Women's Day 2008, Huwaider filmed herself driving and received international media attention after the video was posted on YouTube. Inspired by the Arab Spring, a woman from Jeddah, Najla Hariri, started driving in the second week of May 2011, stating [...] "Before in Saudi, you never heard about protests.

Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E

Even without the deadline {{that contributed to}} the stress of The Bends, the band still had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: [...] "We're jumping from song to song, and when <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song... The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them." [...] The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly [...] "the loudest voice" [...] according to O'Brien. Selway said [...] "we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, {{but at the same time}} we are all very critical about what the other person is doing." [...] Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead [...] "need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility—the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across." [...] Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's [...] "sixth member", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the [...] "fifth Beatle".|$|E
500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' She told me about dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

[...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before <b>we</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back."
