2500|$|Subsequently, O'Neal {{earned an}} MBA online through the University of Phoenix in 2005. In {{reference}} to his completion of his MBA degree, he stated: [...] "It's just something to have on my resume for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> into reality. Someday I might have to put down a basketball and have a regular 9-to-5 like everybody else." ...|$|E
60|$|Charlie Ward. In earnest! Then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> I'll commit Paddy Cockfight {{to prison}} for hitting me yesterday.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gold is {{generally}} useful, isn't it?" [...] smiled Dane. [...] "It {{would help me}} to earn {{a little more than}} my bread <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to England." ...|$|E
60|$|Be {{it enough}} to say, that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Browndown, Lucilla went with me.|$|R
60|$|By the way, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to my lodging on that eventful day, the miller's wife met {{me at the}} door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly! through space--in that ball." [...] And I took {{a delicious}} mouthful of egg. I made a private note that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> {{to the moon}} I would take a box of eggs.|$|R
6000|$|... "All excellent--all too good," [...] {{answered}} Olifaunt; [...] "you {{have every}} thing so clean and tidy, dame, that I shall {{not know how}} to live <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to my own country--if ever I go back there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must be sure," [...] {{he said to}} her gravely, [...] "of what I {{tell your}} father <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to him. Can I declare, with a safe conscience, that you will never see Lord Harry again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said I, not {{understanding}} {{what she was}} talking about. [...] "I am sure he will be buried somewhere near his home, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> his grave {{will be one of the}} first places I will visit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hadn’t left it ten seconds," [...] he said, mysteriously. [...] "I {{went into}} the front room {{for a bit of}} stick, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> it had gone—vanished. I was never more {{surprised}} in my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{too old to}} go to {{such places}} for pleasure," [...] said the {{minister}} simply. [...] "But it was very interesting, and certainly very striking: especially <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> toward daylight, after seeing Mrs. Bowen home." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to {{the house}} the rain was {{beginning}} to fall; {{but there was no}} wind or sound in the air--only that dismal stillness, as if the world were holding its breath in expectation of a calamity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, your Majesty. I {{have seen}} your great city, {{and it is}} a {{wonderful}} one. And my friend has shown me this palace, with its woods and its grounds. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to my own country I will have much to say of what I have seen in your beautiful land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't a {{question}} of money. But--of course, you've never met my Aunt Agatha, so it's rather hard to explain. But she's a sort of human vampire-bat, and she'll make things most fearfully unpleasant for me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to England. She's {{the kind of woman}} who comes and rags you before breakfast, don't you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much better, much better, thank you. I hope to {{find her}} on the sofa <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> on Thursday. I could only run down for a few days, just to settle things, and see the children, before I join the Ramilies. Admiral Penrose very good-naturedly kept it open for me, till we could tell how SHE was," [...] said the Captain, with rather a {{trembling}} voice.|$|E
5000|$|... “My first albums as Dimmer {{were quiet}} and {{introverted}} as a kickback against all that rock glory. But Dimmer’s been going {{a while now}} and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and felt that rock glory, I thoroughly enjoyed it.”- Shayne Carter, September 2006 ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> my fears were realised: {{the door was}} refused to me--my Lady was not at home. This I knew to be false: I had watched the door the whole morning from a lodging I took at a house opposite.|$|R
60|$|However, {{they went}} {{off with an}} evident {{increase}} of comfort founded on their demonstrable advantage in being the real thing. I could fancy them shuddering over Miss Churm. She was very droll about them <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> for <b>I</b> told her what they wanted.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, that is {{the game}} I am going to play <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> We worked in a {{different}} direction last time and brought it off. I think we might have stopped safely enough, but I had particular reasons for wanting to get here out of the way, so I tell you I ran off the track and came over here. Do you think that game could be played here?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have all}} been very kind to me," [...] he said. [...] "In fact, {{so much so that}} I feel, if I stay any longer among you, I shall never be content to rough it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the bush. This is only too pleasant, but, being a poor man with a living to earn, it would be more {{consistent}} if I recommenced my work. Which of the operations should I undertake first?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Brooke was {{a trifle}} grim in face, but he laughed. [...] "I {{have no doubt}} that, {{considering}} everything, it is a trifle absurd of me, but I'm not," [...] he said. [...] "One has to get accustomed {{to the notion that}} he is being made use of in connection with an ingenious swindle. That, however, is a matter which rests between Saxton and me, and we may talk over it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> again. Why did you call him a fool?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Go to sleep!” {{said the}} American tranquilly. “I wouldn’t {{worry about the}} Sin Verguenza. Quite {{a few of them}} have picked up enough to retire on. I wish I hadn’t handed my haversack to black Domingo <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> for you. That’s what’s troubling me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{were all}} {{gone from the}} stable, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the farm, except the bearded nurse, and one tall fellow, {{who might have been}} the [...] "Dying Gaul," [...] as he {{crouched}} there in the straw; and the mare was sleeping--her head between her nurse's knees.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{met him in}} 1969 <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to a girl's {{apartment}} to reclaim the Hank and Merle albums that I'd left {{a couple of months}} before. I was going up the stairs for 'em just as he was heading down with 'em under his arm, and after some circling and sniffing, we've been fast friends ever since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not; anyhow, not yet. Until I'm twenty-five, Dick Leyland has control. Dick {{is a good}} mill manager, but {{his school}} is the old school. He holds down our work-people and they grumble; the machinery's crowded and some is not safe; the {{operatives}} have not the space and light that makes work easier. Then the office is dark and cold. One can't persuade Dick that harshness and parsimony no longer pay. Well, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> I must have power to put things straight. The house is famous, my father built its fortune, and after all I'm its head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We come, you see, {{the wind}} and tide making in our favour, {{in one of our}} Yarmouth lugs to Gravesen'. My sister she wrote to me the name of this here place, and wrote to me as if ever I chanced to come to Gravesen', I was to come over and inquire for Mas'r Davy and give her dooty, humbly wishing him well and {{reporting}} of the fam'ly as they was oncommon toe-be-sure. Little Em'ly, you see, she'll write to my sister <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> as I see you and as you was similarly oncommon, and so we make it quite a merry-go-rounder.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I could {{persuade her}} {{to write a}} word to say she liked her bracelet," [...] he thought, [...] "it would be a comfort <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to my solitary life." [...] He tore a leaf {{out of his pocket}} book and wrote on it, [...] "One line to say you accept my gift and my good wishes. Put it under the cushion of your chair, and I shall find it when the company have left the tent." [...] He slipped the paper into the case which held the bracelet, and instead of leaving the farm as he had intended, turned back to the shelter of the shrubbery.|$|E
6000|$|She was too languid to be {{more than}} {{indifferent}} when she saw us, and the first sign of warmth that she gave was her kiss, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to visit her after putting her to bed at the hotel. She looked up, put her arms round my neck, and said, [...] "This is like the old days." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{this had}} really taken {{but a few}} minutes. <b>I</b> was {{surprised}} <b>when</b> my eye met, through the chinks between the dark window blinds and the window cases, the brighter light of the coming dawn. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the sofa and took the tourniquet from Mrs. Grant, she went over and pulled up the blinds.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw God. God was light, God was truth. And <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> {{to my life}}, and God was hidden. God {{seemed to}} call me. He called. I heard him, I sought him and I touched his hand. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to my life I was {{presently}} lost in perplexity. I could not tell why God had called me nor what I had to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Now, {{what you}} want,' says the consul, 'is {{not to get}} excited. I'll send you over some chewing tobacco and some banana fritters <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> The United States can't {{interfere}} in this. You know you were caught insurging against the government, and you're subject {{to the laws of}} this country. To tell the truth, I've had an intimation from the State Department--unofficially, of course--that whenever a soldier of fortune demands a fleet of gunboats in a case of revolutionary katzenjammer, I should cut the cable, give him all the tobacco he wants, and after he's shot take his clothes, if they fit me, for part payment of my salary.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{can get all}} the Boston culture I want <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> if I {{carry out}} my plan, my happy vision, of going there to reside. I ought to direct all my efforts to European culture now, and keep Boston to finish off. But {{it seems as if}} I couldn't help taking a peep now and then, in advance--with a Bostonian. I don't know when I may meet one again; but if there are many others like Mr. Leverett there, I shall be certain not to want when I carry out my dream. He is just as full of culture as he can live. But it seems strange how many {{different}} sorts there are.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{first came}} to New Zealand," [...] he said, [...] "I thought it {{probable}} that I should only stay here a few weeks, or at most a few months, and I had a strong doubt whether it would repay my trouble in coming out here. Now I am {{sure that it was}} the very best step I ever took. I weighed the other day at Mitford's, and I did not turn eighteen stone, which is nothing out of the way for a man of my height and size. Last time I weighed I pulled down six-and-twenty. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to England I shall stick to my two meals a day, and go in regularly for racquets and horse exercise." ...|$|E
60|$|My best plan then {{seemed to}} be to <b>go</b> right <b>back</b> to the curly-headed pawnbroker, and take up with my first offer. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back,</b> the curly-headed man was very busy about {{something}} else, and kept me waiting a long time; at last I got a chance and told him I would take the three dollars he had offered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{interrupted}} Judson Tate; [...] "they have peculiar ways. But, as I {{was going}} to tell you: <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Oratama <b>I</b> found out from Manuel Iquito what was in that mixture he gave me for my lost voice. I told you how quick it cured me. He made that stuff from the chuchula plant. Now, look here." ...|$|R
60|$|My entrance, and my {{saying what}} I wanted, roused her. It {{disturbed}} the Doctor too, for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> {{to replace the}} candle I had taken from the table, he was patting her head, in his fatherly way, and saying he was a merciless drone to let her tempt him into reading on; {{and he would have}} her go to bed.|$|R
