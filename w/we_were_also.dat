25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{of the two}} episodes {{occurred}} from September 25, 2015, until October 15, 2015. The Flashs {{episode was}} directed by Ralph Hemecker, and Arrows by Thor Freudenthal. Berlanti discussed the logistic nightmare of bringing the three series together since {{the first couple of}} episodes of Legends of Tomorrow had already been shot before the filming of the crossover episodes. In addition, there were characters from The Flash and Arrow [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> shooting out of those respective shows before we went into shooting Legends to then have to come back and do the introduction of some of the characters here." [...] Falk Hentschel described the filming as [...] "an acting marathon" [...] constantly moving from one set to another during the day, but had a blast.|$|E
500|$|Residente o Visitante was {{recorded}} in various countries, as the band was on tour during {{the making of the}} album. [...] Residente explained that the group did not feel any pressure to compete with the success of Calle 13, and felt that the recording of Residente o Visitante was a smoother process than the first: [...] "The main difference for us this time around was that we had more opportunities, more tools and more money. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> on tour at the same time, unlike the first. I spent my time writing during the travels, while my brother would write the music." [...] Residente was invited by La Mala Rodriguez to come to Spain to collaborate on a song. [...] He agreed, as he greatly admired La Mala's work, and the two met for drinks where they discussed the kind of song they wanted to create before going to the studio to record what would later become [...] "Mala Suerta Con el 13".|$|E

500|$|Wayne Storr of On the Box {{stated the}} series premiere is [...] "another {{cracking}} episode," [...] and [...] "truly wonderful that Spooks still pulls it together {{to be one}} of the best British shows on telly." [...] Storr also stated the episode is an [...] "absolute must watch for anyone who has ever been a fan. For those who aren't, now is a good time to start." [...] Whilst also reviewing the second episode, as both episodes are considered a two-parter, Greg O'Keefe of the Liverpool Echo stated it was [...] "packed with great action sequences, razor-sharp writing and the usual quota of twists and turns. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> treated to some excellent scenes, shot in Moscow, as the pesky Russians were established as the villains of the series." [...] John Beresford of TV Scoop stated that although he found [...] "two dodgy moments" [...] in the episode, it [...] "didn't mar what was otherwise an excellent opener to the new series." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} for the album began with strife and tension. Bassist Jeff Ament wasn't made {{aware that the}} band was recording until three days into the sessions, {{and said that he}} [...] "wasn't super involved with that record on any level." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "I'm sure Jeff was pissed, but it was more about separating, because if we played all together nothing would get done. We'd all just get pissed off at each other." [...] At one point Ament even walked out of the recording sessions, and considered quitting the band due to lead vocalist Eddie Vedder's control of the creation process. Due to Pearl Jam balancing recording and touring, Irons commented that the band was [...] "more on-the-fly during the making of No Code, and some good things happened out of that, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> really tired. It was difficult to tour and play these shows that were two or three hours long and then force ourselves to produce something in a studio." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Telegraph stated [...] "after yesterday's shock {{demise of}} series pin-up Rupert Penry-Jones as Adam, {{fans of the}} spy drama may be forgiven for {{approaching}} the second episode of the new series with trepidation. Fear not, though, there are no star deaths [...] only one rather welcome one [...]" [...] John Beresford of TV Scoop praised the entire episode, stating [...] "the pace didn't let up from start to finish, the whole thing looked awesome, the acting was pitch perfect," [...] and the dialogue [...] "never drops into the realms of trite, or hyperbole, or parody. Each phrase is like a diamond. Tight, bright and sparkling. And able to cut deep," [...] adding [...] "this series is already {{shaping up to be}} a classic." [...] Beresford also noted Armitage's performance, although this was only his second appearance, [...] "Armitage looks and sounds like he's been here all along." [...] Greg O'Keefe of the Liverpool Echo, who also reviewed the first episode, as both episodes are considered a two-part story, stated it was [...] "packed with great action sequences, razor-sharp writing and the usual quota of twists and turns. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> treated to some excellent scenes, shot in Moscow, as the pesky Russians were established as the villains of the series." ...|$|E

500|$|Kekal has {{acknowledged}} in interviews that the band members, {{at the time}} interviewed, subscribed to Christianity, and {{has been described as}} one of the first black metal bands to profess Christian beliefs. Known to have fans from different religious backgrounds, and with the majority of their listeners being non-Christians, the band has stated on its Facebook page that as an institution it is not a Christian metal band and does not endorse any particular religion or ideology, and has always maintained that it is about music, life, and universality, and stands against any form of elitism and exclusivism in today's culture. Although Christianity has comprised a part of the band's lyrics, the band has said that from The Painful Experience (3rd album) onward its lyrics have not been associated with religion or ideology at all. Mark Allan Powell commented on this in Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music, stating that [...] "on the band's first two albums the songs testified to their Christian faith in an upfront way", but that on their third album, the band pulled back from an overt approach that [...] "Jeff says tended to turn people against the band before they gave the music a chance." [...] According to Powell, [...] "they maintain that three-fourths of their albums are purchased by non-Christians." [...] In an interview with HM Magazine, Jeff Arwadi clarified his view on Christian metal: [...] "I don't want to divide our fans and market as religious - secular dichotomy. We always see everything as one. When we started the band, we knew nothing about the Christian metal scene, and we started just like a normal band in our underground scene. We grew up in the normal underground metal scene, and have already got attention from that scene since the very beginning. Kekal never belong to any church or some kind of ministry and never will. We are 100% just like any band you would call them as secular band. But then we knew <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> accepted within the Christian metal scene as well, that's cool to know, although I think it still less than 50% of our general fan base." ...|$|E
2500|$|... was {{a fantastic}} {{place in the}} middle of nowhere with no {{facilities}} at all--and it was a fantastic test of what we could do in that environment. Because by that time we'd become obsessed with change, and the great thing was that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> able to create a pastoral side of Led Zep. Jimmy was listening to Davey Graham and Bert Jansch and was experimenting with different tunings, and I loved John Fahey. So it was a very natural place for us to go to.|$|E
2500|$|... "Scotland {{had lost}} both Tests against the All Blacks {{earlier in the}} season but the second, in Auckland, had been close: the Blacks just sneaked home by 21-18. Perhaps that persuaded people that, in the light of our Test series win over the French, we were favourites. Whoever made public that {{sentiment}} did us scant favour. We were lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and yet, on the day, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> intimidated because we didn't play our natural game, preferring instead to sit back and wait for them to come at us. Also, we didn't kick well that day, particularly Michael Lynagh. I hardly saw the ball, and when I did I was clobbered. Not feeling the ball in my hands destroys me anyway; I cannot take it. That day we were more afraid of making a mistake, worrying about who we were playing against, rather than getting on with our own game. And when we did run it we were totally predictable. The Blacks knew the ball would head out to me when it was shifted, and so whenever I got it they hammed me." ...|$|E

60|$|Accordingly, {{next morning}} after breakfast we set out, without imparting our plans to any one, {{and with great}} labour dragged the trough to the water.

60|$|Some {{neighbouring}} bells, {{reminding the}} poor soul {{that it was}} half-past nine, did more {{for us in the}} way of bringing our visit to an end than we could easily have done for ourselves. She hurriedly took up her little bag of documents, which she had laid upon the table on coming in, and asked if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> going into court.

60|$|There was a dusky, little, pear-shaped apple--from one of Uncle Stephen's trees--which was our favourite; {{and next}} to it a delicious, juicy yellow apple from Aunt Louisa's tree. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> fond of the big sweet apples; we used to throw {{them up in the}} air and let them fall on the ground until they were bruised and {{battered}} to the bursting point.

Fifteen minutes later he rang us up and informed us that the body had been discovered, yet warm, in the place indicated. That evening the papers teemed with glaring Jack-the-Strangler headlines, denouncing the brutality of the deed and complaining about the laxity of the police. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> closeted with the Inspector, who begged us by all means to keep the affair secret. Success, he said, depended upon silence.|$|E

60|$|My {{wife and}} I are Americans, {{and at the}} time of this story were middle-aged people and very fond of seeing in each other's company {{whatever}} there was of interest or beauty around us. We had a son about twenty-two years old, of whom <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> very fond; but he was not with us, being at that time a student in Germany. Although we had good health, we were not very robust people, and, under ordinary circumstances, not much given to long country tramps. I was of medium size, without much muscular development, while my wife was quite stout, and growing stouter.|$|E
60|$|At last in {{the hour}} when my perplexity was greatest--the decisive impetus came, brought by a chance visitor, a young clergyman from Portland, Maine, who arrived in the town to buy some farms for himself and a friend.

Upon hearing that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> from Wisconsin he came to call and stayed to dinner, and being of a jovial and candid nature soon drew from me a fairly coherent statement of my desire to do something in the world.|$|E

On March 8 we left Tumento in our big canoe, passed the night at Riverside House, and next evening were inhaling, not a whit too soon, the inspiriting sea-whiffs of Axim.|$|E
