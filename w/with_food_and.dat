5|$|Thorium {{exists in}} very small {{quantities}} everywhere on Earth: the average human contains about 100micrograms of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day.

5|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{specialized}} mandibles, {{scientists believe that}} the ants exhibited habits no longer seen in extant ants. The highly movable head suggests that mobility was an important factor for them (probably for feeding behavior), and the rugose projections {{may have played a}} major role in nest excavation because the mandibles would have prevented such activity. Zigrasimecia most likely interacted with the extinct ant genus Gerontoformica through conflict and probably shared some of their ecological niches. The mandibles of these ants were probably used for mechanical interactions <b>with</b> <b>food,</b> <b>and</b> they may also have served as traps for potential arthropod prey such as mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his victory}} at Marj Ibn Amer, 4,000 locals, {{including}} many residents of Nazareth, joined Zahir's forces to completely subdue Jabal Nablus. Among Zahir's supporters were Christian women from Nazareth who supplied his troops <b>with</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> water. Zahir's forces pursued the Jarrars to their throne village of Sanur, but ultimately withdrew {{after failing to}} subdue the fortress. This defeat marked the limit of Zahir's influence south of Marj Ibn Amer and established the Jarrars as the dominant force of Jabal Nablus over their rivals, the Tuqans. While the Jarrars and Zahir eventually concluded a truce, the former continued to mobilize the clans of Jabal Nablus to prevent Zahir's southward expansion.|$|E

5|$|Leftover waters {{from the}} storm led to an {{increase}} in mosquitoes in Texas, which prompted a widespread application of larvicide via airplane. On July1, the flood areas of southern Texas were declared a major disaster area. This followed a delivery of 2flood specialists, 20laborers, 2portable water treatment plants, 7trucks, and a quantity of insecticides and water treatment tablets. Residents in Laredo, Texas provided citizens of its neighboring city Nuevo Laredo, Mexico <b>with</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> water. The Mexican government provided temporary homes for the affected citizens of the flood. American officials distributed typhoid vaccinations, water purification tablets, and insecticides to the American cities along the Rio Grande. Safe water was eventually restored to Laredo, Texas on July12. All emergency work related to the disaster was finished by September3.|$|E

5|$|Sviatoslav {{retreated to}} Dorostolon, which the Byzantine armies besieged for sixty-five days. Cut off and surrounded, Sviatoslav came {{to terms with}} John and agreed to abandon the Balkans, renounce his claims to the {{southern}} Crimea, and return west of the Dnieper River. In return, the Byzantine emperor supplied the Rus' <b>with</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> safe passage home. Sviatoslav and his men set sail and landed on Berezan Island {{at the mouth of}} the Dnieper, where they made camp for the winter. Several months later, their camp was devastated by famine, so that even a horse's head could not be bought for less than a half-grivna, reports the Kievan chronicler of the Primary Chronicle. While Sviatoslav's campaign brought no tangible results for the Rus', it weakened the Bulgarian statehood and left it vulnerable to the attacks of Basil the Bulgar-Slayer four decades later.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{attempted}} {{to reclaim the}} citadel by sending reinforcements. Vĩnh Long and Mỹ Tho sent 1,800 and 800 troops respectively, but French shelling prevented them from reaching the scene. This left the 5,800-strong local self-defence militia to combat the French. These militia engaged in ambushing French patrols near the citadel, as well as evacuating local inhabitants, {{in order to create}} an open space close to their target. The local militia were supported by wealthy southern landowners, who supplied them <b>with</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> resources.|$|E

After a heavy naval bombardment on 2 August, the marines launched a pincer attack on the town, advancing south from the isthmus and north from Europa Point. Gibraltar's defenders were well stocked <b>with</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> ammunition but were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. The Spanish position was untenable and on the morning of 4 August, the governor, Diego de Salinas, agreed to surrender.|$|E
40|$|Food {{movement}} advocates {{articulate a}} diversity of approaches to address the current food crisis. These approaches resonate <b>with</b> both <b>food</b> security <b>and</b> <b>food</b> sovereignty discourses <b>and</b> range between reform and radical rights-based theories of change. This paper draws from research <b>with</b> urban <b>food</b> advocates in Australia to provide insights into the relations between tactics to change <b>food</b> systems <b>and</b> their resonance <b>with</b> <b>food</b> security <b>and</b> <b>food</b> sovereignty discourses. On {{the basis of this}} analysis, the paper concludes that tactics for social change – or the food politics enacted by urban food advocates – both converge <b>and</b> diverse <b>with</b> <b>food</b> security <b>and</b> <b>food</b> sovereignty discourses. These outcomes point to the diversity of approaches for identifying and evaluating pathways for rebuilding food systems...|$|R

5|$|About 200British {{soldiers}} {{arrived from}} Jamaica to quell looting and maintain order. At least 20people {{were arrested in}} the day after Hattie struck. The British government sent flights of aid to the territory containing food, clothing, and medical supplies. The House of Commons quickly passed a bill to provide £10,000in aid. The Save the Children fund sent £1,000to British Honduras, and the Mexican government sent three flights <b>with</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> medicine to the territory. Two American destroyers arrived in the country by November2, reporting the need for assistance.
