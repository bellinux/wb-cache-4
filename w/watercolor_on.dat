25|$|But Weston {{concluded}} that the working life was draining him of his creative energies. In 1920, {{with the help of}} some local carpenters, he built a one-room log cabin near St. Huberts, New York. Throughout 1921 and the winter of 1922, he painted and sketched in charcoal, pencil, oil and <b>watercolor</b> <b>on</b> cardboard and canvas. Weston was convinced that modern art had become stuck in a rut, and he was determined to create something new.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} to paint {{during the entire}} war and managed to exhibit in several shows. By 1917, Klee's work was selling well and art critics acclaimed him as {{the best of the}} new German artists. His Ab ovo (1917) is particularly noteworthy for its sophisticated technique. It employs <b>watercolor</b> <b>on</b> gauze and paper with a chalk ground, which produces a rich texture of triangular, circular, and crescent patterns. Demonstrating his range of exploration, mixing color and line, his Warning of the Ships (1918) is a colored drawing filled with symbolic images on a field of suppressed color.|$|E

25|$|Eight Bells was the {{outgrowth}} {{of a series}} of oil paintings that Homer made using three wooden panels he found in the cabin of his brother's sloop at Prouts Neck, Maine. On two of the panels Homer painted scenes of mackerel fleets at Prouts Neck, one at dawn and the other at sunset; on the third he painted a grisaille study of the work that inspired Eight Bells, which depicted a ship's officer standing alone, taking an observation with an octant. Several years earlier, Homer had painted a <b>watercolor</b> <b>on</b> his voyage to England that also showed a sailor performing this activity.|$|E
500|$|The work is {{composed}} in ink, pencil, colored pencil, and <b>watercolor</b> <b>on</b> paper and measures [...] When exhibiting this work along with alternate versions and sketches, the University of Pennsylvania summarized {{the work as}} a [...] "bird's-eye {{view of the city}} from Ninth Avenue in a straight line westward, with space becoming ever more condensed..." [...] They also described the work as a tongue-in-cheek view of the world. New York [...] interpreted the New York-centric mind's view {{of the rest of the}} world as a set of outer boroughs as iconic. National Post journalist Robert Fulford described the perspective as one in which the entire world is a suburb of Manhattan.|$|E
