This was the summary of his domestic life--a broken, coarse comb, a child crying because her hair was lugged, a wife who had let the hair go till now, when she had got into a temper to see the job through; and then the teddy-bear, pathetically cocking a black worsted nose, and lifting absurd arms to him.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of Alethopteris virginiana Fontaine & White {{from the lower}} Dunkard in the Appalachians of North America shows that three different taxa {{are likely to be}} represented in the initial illustration. The specific epithet ‘virginiana’ ought to be restricted to a form comparable to Callipteridium costei (Zeiller) Wagner, whereas the two other taxa are referred to pecopterid ferns. A neotype is proposed for Callipteridium virginianum (Fontaine & <b>White)</b> <b>comb.</b> nov. on the basis of topotypes. Zeiller’s illustration of ‘Alethopteris’ costei is reproduced for comparison. On the other hand, a full description and illustration are provided for Alethopteris leonensis Wagner, a species which had been identified previously with Alethopteris virginiana, apparently in error. An associated Holcospermum ‘seed’ is also illustrated. Comparisons include the rather similar Alethopteris bohemica Franke, 1912, which is also illustrated with an associated ‘seed’. The age of the lower Dunkard flora is determined as (early?) Autunian. The relative position of the Upper Pennsylvanian (upper Conemaugh, Monongahela, Dunkard) of eastern North America is depicted in a chart showing the full succession of substages in the West European chronostratigraphic classification of the Pennsylvanian Subsystem, as well as the corresponding megafloral zones...|$|E
40|$|Australian {{stiletto}} flies of the sister-genera Acupalpa Kröber, 1912 and Pipinnipons Winterton, 2001 (Diptera: Therevidae: Agapophytinae) are revised. Twelve {{new species}} of Acupalpa are described, while Acupalpa imitans (White, 1915), comb. n. is transferred from Pipinnipons and Acupalpa albimanis (Kröber, 1914), comb. n. is transferred from Ectinorhynchus Macquart as a senior synonym of Acupalpa pollinosa Mann. The total number of species of Acupalpa is therefore increased to 19 : A. albimanis (Kröber), comb. n., A. albitarsa Mann, A. boharti sp. n., A. divisa (Walker), A. dolichorhyncha sp. n., A. glossa sp. n., A. imitans (<b>White),</b> <b>comb.</b> n., A. irwini Winterton, A. melanophaeos sp. n., A. miaboolya sp. n., A. minuta sp. n., A. minutoides sp. n., A. notomelas sp. n., A. novayamarna sp. n., A. rostrata Kröber, A. semirufa Mann, A. westralica sp. n., A. yalgoo sp. n. and A. yanchep sp. n. Three {{new species of}} Pipinnipons are described, increasing {{the total number of}} species to five: P. chauncyvallis sp. n., P. fascipennis (Kröber), P. kampmeierae sp. n., P. kroeberi Winterton, and P. sphecoda sp. n. Pipinnipons and Acupalpa are rediagnosed in light of the new species presented herein and revised keys to species are included. A dichotomous key to genera of Australasian Therevidae is included. As an empirical example of cybertaxonomy, taxonomic descriptions were composed using a character matrix developed in Lucid Builder (in Structured Descriptive Data (SDD) format) to generate natural language descriptions supplemented by online specimen and image databases. Web resources are provided throughout the document including: a) links to high resolution colour images of all species on Morphbank, b) registration of authors, publications, taxon names and other nomenclatural acts in Zoobank, with assignment of Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) for each, c) links to Genbank accession records for DNA sequences, and d) assignment of LSIDs to specimen records with links to respective records in an online Therevidae specimen database...|$|E

5|$|Prior to the massacre, {{the town}} of Rosewood had been a quiet, {{primarily}} black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of unsupported accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter. When the town's black citizens rallied together to defend themselves against further attacks, a mob of several hundred <b>whites</b> <b>combed</b> the countryside hunting for black people, and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns.

The system described in this research is based on compact fan-beam type tomography, using a tungsten-anode x-ray tube with a relatively small focal spot (∼ 5 �m), coupled with a high-resolution x-ray detector system (∼ 10 �m). To produce a real 3 -D data used to calculate bone volume and bone surface. From these calculations, parallel plate equations were used to derive trabecular architectural parameters such as average trabecular plate thickness and average trabecular plate separation.
