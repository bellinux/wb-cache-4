5|$|Treadgold's {{claim that}} Diocletian {{increased}} the army's numbers by over 50% is considered implausible by Heather, who {{points out that}} even 33% <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> a Herculean effort.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the capitulation, Imperos hull was 88% {{complete}} and the engines were 76% complete, but overall the ship was only 28% complete; it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> about eighteen more months of full work to be finished. Key features like the armament, electrical wiring and a reworking of the bridge had still not been completed.|$|E
5|$|Direct Ascent: The {{spacecraft}} {{would be}} launched {{as a unit}} and travel directly to the Moon and land. It would return, leaving its landing stage on the Moon. This design <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> development of the extremely powerful Nova launch vehicle.|$|E

5|$|However, Lukin {{claims that}} hot-water {{drilling}} {{is much more}} dangerous for the microbiotic fauna, as it would boil the living species, plus disturb the entire structure of water layers of the lake.

5|$|Kefalas {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} explore alternative voting systems, which was defeated in committee, but {{which led to the}} creation of an 11-member multi-partisan task force to study related issues. Another of Kefalas' proposed bills, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> the Colorado Department of Revenue to regularly report on tax burdens across individual income groups, was also defeated in committee.|$|E

5|$|On 26 June, MNC-K {{officials}} {{petitioned the}} Léopoldville parliament to peacefully divide the Province of Kasai {{along the lines}} suggested by Kalonji. The motion, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> the modification of the Congo's new constitution (Loi fondamentale), was received by a parliament divided between Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu factions and no agreement could be reached.|$|E
5|$|The Olney–Pauncefote Treaty of 1897 was a {{proposed}} treaty between the United States and Britain in 1897 that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> arbitration of major disputes. The treaty {{was rejected by}} the U.S. Senate and never went into effect.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 35,000–40,000 {{people were}} killed outright by the bombing at Nagasaki. A total of 60,000–80,000 fatalities resulted, including from long-term health effects, the strongest of which was leukemia, with an attributable risk of 46% for bomb victims. Others died later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to the bomb's initial radiation. Most of the direct deaths and injuries sustained from the bombing were munitions or industrial workers. Mitsubishi's industrial production in the city were also severed by the attack; the dockyard would have produced at 80 percent of its full capacity within three to four months, the steel works <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> {{a year to get}} back to substantial production, the electric works would have resumed some production within two months and been back at capacity within six months, and the restoration of the arms plant to 60 to 70 percent of former capacity <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> 15 months. The Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works, the factory that manufactured the type 91 torpedoes released in the attack on Pearl Harbor, was destroyed in the blast.|$|E

5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E
5|$|England faced {{a target}} of 596, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> a world record Test run-chase—no team had {{successfully}} chased down more than 400 for victory. Early on, Washbrook pulled Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes in the nose in his customary short leg position. Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 to win by 409 runs and take a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Healthcare {{reform was}} a major topic during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, {{attention}} focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45million Americans estimated to not have health insurance at some point each year. Clinton's proposal <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's proposal provided a subsidy but rejected {{the use of an}} individual mandate.|$|E

5|$|Obama {{sponsored}} {{legislation that}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> nuclear plant owners to notify {{state and local}} authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee. Regarding tort reform, Obama voted for the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.|$|E
5|$|Paraguay is a {{landlocked}} country and {{for much of}} its history it was difficult of access, except by sailing from the Atlantic up the River Paraná and hence the River Paraguay (see map) as the early Spanish explorers had done. There were other means of ingress, but they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> an invading force to be resupplied through difficult and hostile country. So the command of the river was key {{to the security of}} Paraguay, who feared and distrusted its two much larger neighbours Brazil and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Seven of {{the nine}} {{surviving}} stones are under 90 centimetres (3 feet) tall, {{but two of the}} north-west stones are considerably larger. Located opposite the circle's two shortest stones, one is thin and pointed, reaching 2.1 metres (7 feet) high, while the other is broader, measuring 1.8 metres square (6 feet by 6 feet). The largest of the stones weighs approximately 7.3 tonnes (8 tons) and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> the efforts of many people to move and erect it.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} reissued {{nationwide}} once more on April 15, 1977, {{this time with}} simulated stereo sound. This edit featured the RKO distribution logo being replaced with that of Buena Vista Distribution, since RKO had not {{been part of a}} release since 1946. It had not been removed earlier as the credit sequence <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> to be re-shot. A two-and-a-half-minute reduction in the film's running time in this version remains unclear in existing records.|$|E
5|$|Advantages over {{conventional}} diesel equipment included increased availability, higher speed through curves, {{and decreased}} weight which caused less wear on the tracks. Impressed with their reliability, Amtrak purchased the trainsets and ordered another four trainsets, which entered service in 1975 on the Chicago–Milwaukee and Chicago–Detroit corridors. The purchase {{price for the}} six trainsets was $18 million. Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 14 trainsets for the partially-electrified Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. Doing so <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> a significant rise in fares between the two cities, and the United States Department of Transportation blocked the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Although the Xbox {{version of}} Halo lacks {{official}} support for online multiplayer play, third-party packet tunneling software provide unofficial ways around this limitation. The Windows and Macintosh ports of Halo support online matches involving up to 16 players and include multiplayer maps {{not in the}} original Xbox release. However, co-operative play {{was removed from the}} ports because it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>required</b> large amounts of recoding to implement. In April 2014, it was announced that GameSpy's servers and matchmaking, on which Halo PC relied, would be shut down by May 31 of the same year. A team of fans and Bungie employees announced they would produce a patch for the game to keep its multiplayer servers online. The patch was released on May 16, 2014.|$|E
