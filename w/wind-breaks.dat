50|$|FMNR can restore {{degraded}} farmlands, {{pastures and}} forests {{by increasing the}} quantity and value of woody vegetation, by increasing biodiversity and by improving soil structure and fertility through leaf litter and nutrient cycling. The reforestation also retards wind and water erosion; it creates <b>wind-breaks</b> which decrease soil moisture evaporation, and protects crops and livestock against searing winds and temperatures. Often, dried up springs reappear and the water table rises towards historic levels; insect eating predators including insects, spiders and birds return, helping to keep crop pests in check; the trees can {{be a source of}} edible berries and nuts; and over time the biodiversity of plant and animal life is increased. FMNR can be used to combat deforestation and desertification and can also be an important tool in maintaining the integrity and productivity of land that is not yet degraded.|$|E
50|$|The Laird of Hapland was {{the ruling}} elder in the Parish of Dunlop in 1649 {{and was a}} captain in the Scots army when Cromwell was in Scotland, for which his lands were sequestrated. The last of the male line died when he fell off his horse when {{returning}} from Stewarton about 1765 or 1770. Lillias Porterfield married William Somerville of Kennox. Their youngest child, a daughter, married Colonel McAlester, Laird of Loup, in Kintyre. A descendent built Chapelton House near Stewarton. Hapland is near Dunlop. In 1820 the estate was of 200 acre and the proprietor was Lieutenant-General Alexander Trotter. The old mansion house was demolished around 1876 as {{it was not in}} keeping with the modern age. A new steading was built at the site, possibly the 'Newhouse' marked on the OS maps. Some of the old tree <b>wind-breaks</b> and policies of the estate can still be made out.

40|$|The use of <b>wind-breaks</b> in {{orchards}} was studied. Similar {{observations were}} carried out on early horticultural crops such as strawberry and potato, and on field crops such as rye, wheat, sugar-beet, and maize. Net profits of 10 - 45 % with apple and 12 - 162 % with pear were calculated, if the <b>wind-breaks</b> were 4 - 6 h away (h = height of the wind-break). The analysis showed that wind-breaking had an important influence on fruit-setting. Higher mean temperature and humidity in sheltered places may favour pollination and fertilization. Therefore, the recommendation to plant more <b>wind-breaks</b> than usual should be accompanied by advice on planting of wind-break trees coming into leaf before blossom time. Strawberries yielded significantly more and were much more profitable in sheltered areas. With early potato, higher revenues were obtained only by promoting earliness, perhaps through 'hothouse' conditions in the sheltered zone. Smaller increases in yield were found for field crops in a zone of nearby 10 h away from the wind-break. <p/...|$|E

40|$|Beach hummocks are {{important}} ecological components of coastal ecosystems. Although hummocks are naturally adapted to harsh conditions, reestablishing them in arid areas poses great challenges. During a collaborative project, research-ers from Namdeb Diamond Corporation and the Millennium Seed Bank Partnership investigated practical methods to reestablish saltbush (Salsola nollothensis) beach hummocks to restore areas disturbed by alluvial diamond mining. With focus on simple methods {{that can be}} implemented over large areas, collecting seed-containing debris, placing <b>wind-breaks,</b> and seeding these with debris {{are some of the}} means currently investigated. Preliminary findings indicate that seed quality may deteriorate quickly if seeds are stored in ambient conditions, and storage under controlled conditions and/or seed harvesting shortly before restoration is recommended. Laboratory tests indicate a naturally high proportion of empty seeds, possibly short seed longevity, and that seeds must not be buried too deeply for seedling emergence. Further, seasonal and site-related variation in seed production influences the quality and amount of viable seeds avail-able. All this suggests a complex set of environmental conditions that have to be met to achieve natural recovery or restoration goals. This project illustrates the benefits of partnerships in restoration that made it possible to investigate practical field questions with scientific sophistication, making an international initiative relevant to applied restoration ecology in a developing country...|$|E

This study uses a numerical CFD tool to predict the shielding effect of <b>wind-break</b> fences on an ETR 500 high speed train. The analysis of the aerodynamic performances of the train is conducted by varying some design parameters of the wind breaks as the height of the barrier, the fence porosity and the inclination of the barrier slots. The shielding effect has been evaluated by analyzing the aerodynamic forces acting on the train. As a result it has been found that the shielding effect of a wind break fence can be maintained by reducing the porosity of the slots, while inclination has less influence on the aerodynamic forces on the train...|$|R
40|$|Cultivating {{trees in}} the {{agricultural}} systems {{is one of the}} major practices in the tropics of South and Southeast Asia 1. It is characterized by an intensive integration of forest trees, agricultural and horticultural crops, and shrubs with a basic objective to ensure sustained availability of multiple products as direct benefits such as food, vegetables, fruits, fodder, fuel, foliage, medicine, and raw materials for agricultural implements. Other indirect benefits and services such as ornamentals, shading, live-fencing and shelter-belt or <b>wind-breaks</b> are also derived 2. Such intermixing of species of agriculture and forestry, often termed as‘agroforestry’ came into international prominence as a potential source of solutions of many inter-related problems of production and conservation troubling land-use systems in the tropical and subtropical regions 3. It has also been stated that the tree components along with field crops lead to efficient use of sunlight, moisture and nutrients in agro-ecosystems than in monocropping of either agricultural or forestry crops 1. This kind of practice is more popular in Kerala, where home-gardens are built around coconut orchards 4. Such home-gardens and agroforestry systems also prevail in humid tropics of the Western Ghats, Karnataka.

This is both a reference handbook for those working in this field and a text book for students of agriculture and related subjects. Originally published in German in 1984, it describes over 1, 000 cultivated crops. An introduction {{to each of the}} main plant groups looks at the economics, production trends, nutritional value and uses of the group. The major crops are then discussed in more detail and information provided on production figures and distribution, breeding of cultivars, ecophysiology, cultivation, pests and diseases, and harvesting and processing. Much of the information on individual species. and on the less widely-grown cross. is presented in clear tables which include columns for specific points of interest. Food crops are divided into main groups; cereals, root and tuber crops, sugar, oil vegetables, fruit and nuts. There is a section on beverages and stimulants, which includes tobacco, and sections on spices, medicinal plants, essential oils, fibre plants, elastomers, dyes and tanning materials etc. Fodder grasses and fodder legumes are also included, as are crops which are used for ancillary purposes such as <b>wind-breaks</b> and soil stabilizers. The book is illustrated throughout with clear black-and-white line drawings.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, large scale land use changes {{took place in}} the Hailiutu River catchment, a {{semi-arid}} area in northwest China. These changes had significant impacts on the water resources in the area. Insights into groundwater and surface water interactions and vegetation-water dependencies help to understand these impacts and formulate sustainable water resources management policies. In this study, groundwater and surface water interactions were identified using the baseflow index at the catchment scale, and hydraulic and temperature methods as well as event hydrograph separation techniques at the sub-catchment scale. The results show that almost 88 % of the river discharge consists of groundwater. Vegetation dependencies on groundwater were analyzed from the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and groundwater depth at the catchment scale and along an ecohydrogeological cross-section, and by measuring the sap flow of different plants, soil water contents and groundwater levels at different research sites. The results show that all vegetation types, i. e. trees (willow (Salix matsudana) and poplar (Populus simonii)), bushes (salix (Salix psammophila)) and agricultural crops (maize (Zea mays)), depend on groundwater as the dominant water source for transpiration. The comparative analysis indicates that maize crops use the largest amount of water, followed by poplar trees, salix bushes, and willow trees. For sustainable water use with the objective of satisfying water demand for socio-economical development and to prevent desertification, more water use efficient crops such as sorghum, barley and millet should be promoted to reduce the consumptive water use for irrigation.

The objectives were to (1) identify and assess the most important agroforestry systems, (2) to investigate the main factors that affecting the sustainability of the systems, (3) to determine the important field crops that cultivated with trees and (4) to evaluate the effect of the agroforestry systems on the yield of the traditional field crops. For accomplishment of these study 80 questioners was designed and distributed in the selected villages. After the data collection data was analyzed by using descriptive statistic. The results showed that the most important agroforestry systems in the study area are parkland cropping system (58 %), boundary planting (26 %), <b>wind-breaks</b> (13 %) and alley cropping (3 %). The most important forest trees in the study area are Acacia senegal (32 %), Ziziphus spina- christia (28 %), Balanites aegeyptiaca (26 %), Sclerocary birrea and Guera senegalensis (3 %). The main field crops in the study area are groundnut (44 %), sorghum (35 %) and roselle (21 %). The results showed that yield of groundnut and sorghum is higher under agroforestry systems compared with the mono-cropping system. The results showed that the majority of respondents (70 %) prefer to cultivate field crops in agroforestry system, while (30 %) prefer to cultivate the field crops in a mono-cropping system. The cultivation methods used in the study area include shifting cultivation (52 %), mono-cropping (36 %) and intercropping (12 %). The majority of respondents (94 %) showed that trees improve soil fertility in their farm land. The benefits from trees in farm land include improvement of soil properties (36 %), protecting the farm land from wind erosion (28 %), improvement of micro-climate (24 %) and source of income which was indicated by (12 %) of the respondents. The study recommended that modern agroforestry system such as improved fallow system and alley cropping should be introduced in the study area and multi-purpose trees such as Acacia senegal, Fedherbia albida and Sclerocarya birrea that improve soil fertility and diversify farmers income should be maintained.

He scooped out a little hollow in the sand for his hips, took a last look at Silvermane haltered to the rock, and calling Wolf to his side stretched himself to rest. He was used to lying on the ground, under the open sky, out where the wind blew and the sand seeped in, yet all these were different on this night.
