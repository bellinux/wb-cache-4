500|$|During the sixties, Kraft was a {{household}} name in America. He appeared {{on the cover of}} the August 27, 1965 issue of Time Magazine, in which he was profiled as the [...] "Conductor in a Command Post". In his interview with Time, Kraft compared himself with namesake Christopher Columbus, displaying what the magazine described as [...] "an almost angry pride" [...] in his work. [...] "We know a lot more about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than he did," [...] Kraft said. [...] "And we know where we're going." [...] The article described Kraft's role in the Gemini 5 mission, and drew on Kraft's frequent comparisons of his position as flight director with that of an orchestra conductor.|$|E
500|$|Pascu parted with Divertis in 2007. At the time, he {{indicated}} that {{he could no longer}} handle their tight schedule. The break was not total, though, since Pascu continued to appear on Animat Planet. In a 2007 interview, reflecting on that show's impact, he stated, [...] "I'm not much of a fan of political humor. I simply like the impromptu kind of humor [...] If [...] happens to be political, it is because that is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in this series." [...] In 2012, he asserted that his break with political humor was definitive, and against the consensus in Divertis—in 2007, Pascu noted there was already a disagreement between him and Toni Grecu. Shortly after his departure, a conflict between Grecu and the other Divertis actors broke Divertis into competing halves.|$|E

500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E

[...] "We just don't get any credit", added safety Ray Horton, describing a defense that did not have any Pro Bowl selections. [...] "We come up and do <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Hey, we've won 12 games! Other higher-ranked defenses are at home right now. So it's not like we're riding the coattails of our offense." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1999 New York Times story, [...] "C.E.O. Round Table- Online Pioneers: The Buzz Never Stops", Espuelas {{explained}} his approach: [...] "I {{spent a lot}} of time learning how Winston Churchill ran the Second World War. I bring that up as a metaphor—not having information, not having clarity, the stakes being very high. Of course, the stakes he had to deal with were somewhat higher than <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> But that was part of the encouragement—to think that something so important could be managed, and all the mistakes that were made and the chaos of the moment. And the other thing, which he said, which I love as a philosophy, is: You don't have to get it right all the time. You just have to get it right 51 percent of the time, and that will carry you through. And that's a very, very liberating philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{thing the}} commissioners {{did not learn}} before their {{departure}} was that General Sir Henry Clinton had been ordered to evacuate Philadelphia, even though his orders had been issued one month before they left. [...] Carlisle was {{of the opinion that}} the administration had done this intentionally, since they might not otherwise have gone at all. [...] Carlisle wrote to his wife of the situation, [...] "We all look grave, and perhaps we think we look wise. [...] I fear nobody will think so when we return ... I don't see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> here." [...] Upon learning of the planned withdrawal, Carlisle appealed to Clinton to delay it, but, in rejecting the appeal, Clinton cited his orders to act without delay. This prompted Carlisle to observe that the administration wanted the commission to be [...] "a mixture of ridicule, nullity, and embarrassments." [...] Eden was upset that he wasn't told of Clinton's orders, since the British intent to withdraw further stiffened American resolve. [...] On June 13, the commissioners sent a package of proposals to Congress, which was then holding sessions in York, Pennsylvania. [...] Congress replied insisting that either American independence be recognised, or that all British forces first withdraw from the states, terms the commission was not authorised to accept. [...] The commission attempted to appeal to public opinion, with warnings of widespread destruction, but was unsuccessful. [...] Johnstone tried to bribe some Congressmen, and the Marquis de Lafayette challenged Carlisle to a duel over some anti-French statements he had made.|$|E
2500|$|Funeral for a Friend {{spent all}} of 2012, bar their brief festival {{appearances}} writing and recording for their sixth studio album. Over the year they released several studio updates showing the band members tracking different instruments for the album. On 4 October of that year the band confirmed the title and release date of their sixth album Conduit for a 28 January 2013 release in the United Kingdom and on 5 February 2013 through The End Records In the United States. To support {{the release of the}} album, the band underwent a headlining tour with support acts such as Such Gold, Daytrader and I Divide throughout January and February. However, Daytrader had {{to pull out of the}} tour, so Major League took their place on the bill. The band continues to work with Welsh music producer, Romesh Dodangoda, on the album as they did with their previous album. Vocalist Matthew Davies-Kreye spoke of their working union, [...] "To me, he gets our individual personalities and works his magic with each of us, making sure that we're all comfortable with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for the record." [...] Davies-Kreye has described the reasoning behind the title Conduit as [...] "the experiences of being in a band" [...] and summarised the album's style as “a post-hardcore record that is not afraid to drop into some hardcore for good measure.” The first single from the album, [...] "Best Friends and Hospital Beds", would be released on 12 November with the music video being released prior on 10 October.|$|E
