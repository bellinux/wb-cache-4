5|$|The modern {{practice}} of flagging ships {{in foreign countries}} began in the 1920s in the United States when shipowners, frustrated by increased regulations and rising labor costs, began to register their ships to Panama. The use of open registries steadily increased, and in 1968, Liberia grew to surpass the United Kingdom as the world's largest shipping register. , {{more than half of}} the world’s merchant ships were registered with open registries, and the Panama, Liberia, and Marshall Islands flags accounted for almost 40% of the entire <b>world</b> <b>fleet,</b> in terms of deadweight tonnage. In 2006 up to 20% of high-seas fishing vessels were registered in states they were not connected to.|$|E

25|$|The first open {{register}} was Panama in 1916. Fear for political instability and high and excessive consular fees led {{the president of}} Liberia, William Tubman, in 1948 to start an {{open register}} {{with the help of}} Edward Stettinius, Jr.. The World Peace of Stavros Niarchos was the first ship in that register. In 1967 Liberia passed the United Kingdom as the largest register.

25|$|Between 1916 and 1921, 316 tankers {{were built}} {{with a total}} {{capacity}} of 3.2million long tons of deadweight, where the entire <b>world</b> <b>fleet</b> before World War I was just above 2 million tons. In 1923 about 800,000 long tons were laid up, which gave enormous opportunities for speculators, such as Daniel Keith Ludwig. In 1925 he had bought the freighter Phoenix and put tanks in the holds. These riveted tanks leaked, which resulted in an explosive mixture. The resulting explosion killed two crew members and badly injured Ludwig. After this, he was a strong believer in welding.|$|E

6000|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--I am a devil certainly; but write I cannot. Look here, you {{had better}} get hold of G. C. Lichtenberg's Ausfürliche Erklarung der Hogarthischen Kupferstiche: Göttingen, 1794 to 1816 (it was {{published}} in numbers seemingly). Douglas the publisher lent it to me: and tho' I hate the damned tongue too cordially {{to do more than}} dip into it, I have seen some shrewd things. If you cannot get it for yourself, (it seems scarce), I dare say I could negotiate with Douglas for a loan. This adorable spring has made me quite drunken, drunken with green colour and golden sound. We have the best blackbird here that we have had for years; we have two; but the other is but an average performer. Anything so rich and clear as the pipe of our first fiddle, it never entered into the heart of man to fancy. How the years slip away, Colvin; and we walk little cycles, and turn in little abortive spirals, and come out again, hot and weary, to find the same view before us, the same hill barring the road. Only, bless God for it, we have still the same eye to see with, and if the scene be not altogether unsightly, we can enjoy it whether or no. I feel quite happy, but curiously inert and passive, something for the winds to blow over, and the sun to glimpse on and go off again, as it might be a tree or a gravestone. All this willing and wishing and striving leads a man nowhere after all. Here I am back again in my old humour of a sunny equanimity; to see the <b>world</b> <b>fleet</b> about me; and the days chase each other like sun patches, and the nights like cloud-shadows, on a windy day; content to see them go and no wise reluctant for the cool evening, with its dew and stars and fading strain of tragic red. And I ask myself why I ever leave this humour? What I have gained? And the winds blow in the trees with a sustained [...] "Pish"! and the birds answer me in a long derisive whistle.|$|E
