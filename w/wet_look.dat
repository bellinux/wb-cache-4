40|$|Davey's mediational {{hypothesis}} [Davey, G. C. L. (1994). Self-reported fears {{to common}} indigenous animals {{in an adult}} UK population: the role of disgust sensitivity. British Journal of Psychology, 85, 541 - 554. ] suggests that the sex difference in self-assessed animal fears can {{be accounted for by}} the sex difference in disgust sensitivity. An empirical test failed to support this hypothesis in a non-clinical sample (N = 214), Holding constant the influences of confounders such as age, fear of contamination, sex roles, neuroticism, psychoticism and disgust sensitivity, biological sex kept emerging as a significant predictor in relation to four types of animal fears (fear-relevant animals, dry or non-slimy invertebrates, slimy or <b>wet</b> <b>looking</b> animals and farm animals). Other things being equal, high disgust sensitivity either lost its predictive capability (in relation to dry or non-slimy invertebrates and slimy or <b>wet</b> <b>looking</b> animals) or predicted high fear of fear-relevant animals and of farm animals inequivalently across, respectively, the sexes (high in females only) and age groups (high in the old only). A multifactorial, interactionist approach should be advocated {{in the study of the}} aetiology of animal fears if progress in this area is to be achieved. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

50|$|This {{effect is}} {{sometimes}} called <b>wet</b> <b>look,</b> since wetting wood with water often displays the chatoyancy, albeit only until the wood dries. Certain finishes cause the chatoyancy (also referred to as wood iridescence, moire, vibrancy, shimmer or glow) to become more pronounced. Oil finishes, epoxy, and shellac can strongly bring out the <b>wet</b> <b>look</b> effect.|$|E

50|$|In 2015, Forza Motorsport 6 was {{released}} for Xbox One, offering {{more than double}} the number of cars available in Forza Motorsport 5 as well as introducing night and rain to the core Forza franchise for the first time. While Forza Horizon 2 did have night and rain, it lacked the realism of those introduced in Forza Motorsport 6. While night appears as a dark day in many other games, including Forza Horizon 2, it is truly pure blackness in Forza Motorsport 6. Rain does not simply make for a slightly slicker track surface and <b>wet</b> <b>look,</b> but instead makes a significant performance difference and three-dimensional puddles can spin cars if approached improperly. The game also increased the number of cars on track to twenty-four; up from sixteen in Forza Motorsport 5 and twelve in Forza Horizon 2.|$|E
5000|$|Tung oil or China {{wood oil}} is a drying oil {{obtained}} by pressing the seed from the nut of the tung tree (Vernicia fordii). Tung oil hardens upon exposure to air, {{and the resulting}} coating is transparent and has a deep, almost <b>wet</b> <b>look.</b> Used mostly for finishing/protecting wood, after numerous coats the finish can even look plastic-like. Related drying oils include linseed, safflower, poppy and soybean oils. The oil and its use {{are believed to have}} originated in ancient China and appear in the writings of Confucius from about 400 B.C.Raw tung oil tends to dry to a fine wrinkled finish; the US name for this is gas checking: this property was used to make wrinkle finishes, usually by adding excess cobalt drier. To stop this, the oil is heated to gas-proof it, and most oils used for coating are gas-proofed. Thus, to avoid the wrinkling, all tung oil available for finishing today is [...] "boiled".|$|E

50|$|Greasy hair is a hair {{condition}} {{which is}} common in humans, one of four main four types of hair conditioning— normal, greasy, dry and greasy dry. It is primarily caused by build-up of the natural secretion from the sebaceous glands in the scalp and is characterised by the continuous development of natural grease on the scalp. A chronic condition of greasy hair may often accompany chronic greasy skin conditions on the face and body and oily skin and acne. Excessive carbohydrate, fat and starch consumption can {{increase the likelihood of}} developing greasy hair and also poor personal hygiene and not washing the hair for a long duration will lead to a buildup of sebum in the hair follicles. Hair conditioners can decrease the likelihood of developing greasy hair after shampooing. Some cosmetics companies produce shampoos and conditioners specifically to deal with greasy hair and for oily or dry hair problems. Massaging the scalp and exposure to the sun can reduce the problem of greasy hair.In some men, a greased back wet hair look is considered desirable, and numerous hair gels and waxes specialize in giving a <b>wet</b> <b>look</b> appearance.|$|E
50|$|Some people {{consider}} catsuits to be a fetish item. Catsuits for fetish use are often made of latex or PVC where such a catsuit is typically highly shiny, tight fitting {{and may be}} (but is not exclusively) worn with a corset {{over the top of}} the suit. Other materials such as lycra, shiny <b>wet</b> <b>look,</b> or velvet are options for fetish wear too, with some lycra materials having animal print designs. Catsuits can have zippers on the front or rear for access, with some having zippers on the shoulders. Additional zippers can be placed in specific areas for access, if required. Typically a fetish catsuit will not have gloves or feet. Feet, if present, are typically form fitting like socks and the gloves will have individual fingers. Typically gloves and socks can be worn as additional accessories to a catsuit to give a whole body look, with some opting to add a hood as an option too. Hoods can also be incorporated into the catsuit. Rarely will a catsuit incorporate boots or shoes, although it is possible. An option instead of gloves might be bondage mittens, which might have a D-ring at the top, and such catsuits can be used as straitjackets in the context of bondage. More extreme options for catsuits have incorporated monoglove instead of sleeves and they can also be used for bondage. Catsuits may also have incorporated corset and/or neck corset, although these are typically added as accessories to complete a look.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We present {{techniques}} to improve visual realism in an interactive surgical simulation application: a mastoidectomy simulator {{that offers a}} training environment for medical residents as a complement to using a cadaver. As well as displaying the mastoid bone through volume rendering, the simulation allows users to experience haptic feedback and appropriate sound cues while controlling a virtual bone drill and suction/irrigation device. The techniques employed to improve realism consist of a fluid simulator and a shading model. The former allows for deformable boundaries based on volumetric bone data, while the later gives a <b>wet</b> <b>look</b> to the rendered bone to emulate more closely {{the appearance of the}} bone in a surgical environment. The fluid rendering includes bleeding effects, meniscus rendering, and refraction. We incorporate a planar computational fluid dynamics simulation into our three-dimensional rendering to effect realistic blood diffusion. Maintaining real-time performance while drilling away bone in the simulation is critical for engagement with the system. Index Terms—Health, virtual reality, volume rendering, bloo...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{creative}} project was for the artist to design a series in clay, construct them, and write a thesis about the series concerning the ideas and imagery. The artist chose sealife imagery as {{a focal point for}} the series because the shapes of their fins and curves of their bodies create a feeling of movement. Ten images were chosen for the design of the diptych sets. The negative space between the two diptychs made reference to the varied fish forms and sealife. The surface of these pieces have a highly textured appearance reflecting impressions of intrinsic detail of vegetation, coral, fin, and tail-like shapes. The color of the sculpture diptychs will relay to the viewer the feeling the artist desires. For example, a shark image would have black and dark blue on the sculpture to represent unknown threats and anxiety from this ominous form lurking amidst them. The construction of the diptychs was cardboard template and slab method. The artist rolled out clay slabs, with shaped cardboard templates, transfering an image to the clay slabs. This gave the sculpture temporary stability while it was being constructed. The cardboard was removed after the form was dry enough to be stable. After stabilizing, the form had reinforcement coils added. This also gave the form stability to stand on it's own. Then it was ready for the additive and subtractive process to create the fins and tail shapes on the positive forms. Wavy lines were then carved into the forms to add movement to the diptych set. Texture was added by pressing shells and coral into the clay to add to the imagery. The forms were then allowed to dry completely. The first firing was the bisque firing to cone 010 - 04 (1641 - 1940 F) [...] Cone 04 allowed for a more stable form. After the bisque the diptychs were glazed with Reward Underglaze, Reward Glaze, Duncan Underglaze, and Duncan Clear cone 05 - 06 (1915 - 1830 F). The clear was applied in a wave like affect giving the surface a <b>wet</b> <b>look</b> where applied. The creative project was a chance for the artist to push the media of ceramics, and to learn the limits of the medium. The artist has also opened a new door in her own personal experiences through exploration in the use of negative space as the image and the clay forms, or positive space as the area around the image.
