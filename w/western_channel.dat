5|$|For {{two weeks}} the British and French squadrons watched one another, the British unable to attack and the French unable to escape. In {{an effort to}} break the deadlock, Cochrane sent to Martinique for a body of 3,000 men under Major-General Frederick Maitland. With this force he {{launched}} a surprise invasion of the islands on 14 April, the amphibious operation commanded by Captain Philip Beaver in HMS Acasta and executed successfully with only minor casualties. Parties of seamen went ashore {{in the wake of}} the soldiers, working rapidly to establish a battery of two 8-inch howitzers on Morne-Russell. These guns began firing during the afternoon and by 20:00 Troude had given orders for his squadron to sail through the <b>western</b> <b>channel</b> during the night.|$|E
5|$|To disrupt British radio transmissions, Wolfgang Martini's unit, the Funkhorchdienst (Radio Enlightening Service, or Signals intelligence) {{attempted}} to jam radio-telephone frequencies. They created a subtle jamming technique which increased atmospheric interference which degraded {{the performance of}} British coastal radars. In addition Dornier Do 217s of Kampfgeschwader 2 (Bomber Wing 2) was ordered to fly electronic deception missions over the <b>western</b> <b>channel</b> to divert enemy aircraft. Joachim Coeler's Fliegerkorps IX prepared to strike at RAF bases in south-west England and to engage and slow down British naval forces that might attempt an interception. Fernaufklärungsgruppe 123 (strategic or long-range reconnaissance) was responsible for maintaining reconnaissance in the channel's east and west entrance and was to support Fliegerkorps IX.|$|E
5|$|The next lock is Compton Lock, {{the only}} one built on a river section. It is also called Compton Place Lock or Twyford Lock, and the extra flow {{compared}} to other locks may explain the erosion that has taken place, resulting in a circular area of water between {{the upper and lower}} gates. Just above Shawford Bridge, the river and navigation diverged, with Shawford Mill just below the junction. The building still stands. The bridge is a modern construction, and is located at a point where the towpath crosses to the western bank. Just to the south is a weir at the site of Shawford Single Gates, which probably ensured the mill had an adequate head of water. The village of Twyford lies to the east, and the Twyford Drain splits, with the <b>western</b> <b>channel</b> rejoining the river below the mill, and the eastern channel continuing as a relief channel. There are two more locks on the navigation, called Malm Lock and College Mead Lock, before the navigation rejoins the river. By the junction is the intake for Otterbourne Water Treatment Works.|$|E

25|$|Despite these proceedings, Mostyn {{remained}} {{in command of}} Hampton Court, and joined William Martin's squadron later in 1745. He enjoyed some considerable success against enemy cruisers and privateers, capturing Diane on 4 May 1745, and the 32-gun Lis in December that year. He captured several more privateers {{over the next few}} years, Dauphin on 27 January 1746, and the 20-gun Comte de Lowendahl in the <b>Western</b> <b>Channel</b> on 4 March 1747. He was with a squadron when they fell in with a convoy being escorted by Comte Dubois de la Motte on 20 June 1747, and took 48 merchants as prizes. Several more privateers were taken during 1747, Triomphant on 23 June, Grand San Juan on 7 December, and the 20-gun Thétis on 9 December. Hampton Court cruised with Sir Peter Warren's fleet in 1748.|$|E

25|$|Air battles {{went on for}} {{the rest}} of the day, and by nightfall it was clear that with the few {{aircraft}} Percival had left, Kallang could no longer be used as a base. With his assent, the remaining flyable Hurricanes were withdrawn to Sumatra. A squadron of Hurricane fighters took to the skies on 9 February, but was then withdrawn to the Netherlands East Indies and after that no Allied aircraft were seen again over Singapore; the Japanese had achieved complete air supremacy. That evening, three Fairmile motor launches attacked and sunk several Japanese landing craft in the Johor Strait around its <b>western</b> <b>channel</b> on the evening of 9 February. Later, on the evening of 10 February, General Archibald Wavell, commander of American-British-Dutch-Australian Command, ordered the transfer of all remaining Allied air force personnel to the Dutch East Indies. By this time, Kallang Airfield was so pitted with bomb craters that it was no longer usable.|$|E
500|$|Entering West Virginia from Ohio, I-70 {{crosses the}} <b>western</b> <b>channel</b> of the Ohio River onto Wheeling Island, the most {{populated}} island along the Ohio River. [...] The freeway passes above a light commercial zone, {{and has an}} interchange with Zane Street. US40 and [...] become concurrent with I-70 at this interchange, before traveling east toward the Fort Henry Bridge. The bridge crosses the main channel {{of the river and}} the Greater Wheeling Trail, a rail trail that parallels the eastern banks of the river. Elevated above the city of Wheeling, a complex interchange provides access to the downtown area and Benwood. Traveling eastbound, US40 departs the freeway at this interchange and becomes concurrent with West Virginia Route 2 (WV2) northbound. US40 and WV2 travel through downtown Wheeling on a one-way pair, the southbound lanes passing under I-70 and the northbound lanes passing over I-70. After the interchange, I-70 enters the approximately [...] Wheeling Tunnel which passes through Wheeling Hill. Immediately east of the tunnel, a directional T interchange provides access to WV2 southbound near homes north of the highway. US250 departs I-70 at this interchange.

2500|$|The Wainfleet Relief Channel is also crossed by the B1195 road, {{and shortly}} afterwards, the Lymn joins it. Cowcroft Drain, which joins the Lymn from the north, and the Lymn below the {{junction}} are both designated as main rivers, {{and are the}} responsibility of the Environment Agency, as is Croft Lane pumping station, which pumps the water from the Lymn into the relief channel. Croft Lane bridge is next, after which the A52 and the Boston to Skegness railway cross, and the relief channel rejoins Wainfleet Haven. The final section contains three flood defence structures. Haven House Sluice is first, after which the channel splits. Wainfleet Clough Outfall is on the <b>western</b> <b>channel,</b> which is tidal below the sluice. The Burgh Sluice Relief Channel is to the east, and Burgh Sluice protects it from the sea just before the two channels rejoin. Cow Bank Drain was excavated in 1812, as part of the last land reclamation scheme in the area. Cow Bank pumping station, owned by the IDB, pumps the drain into the outfall.|$|E

Both channels head towards the first ornamental lake supplied by the river. At this point, the river has dropped some [...] from its source. Welbeck Great Lake is part of the Welbeck estate, which was owned by the Dukes of Portland, and now owned by the Bentinck family. Millwood Brook flows into Gouldsmeadow Lake and through Shrubbery Lake, before joining the Great Lake. In the 1760s, the duke employed the architect and civil engineer Robert Mylne to construct a three-arched bridge, which had to be both functional and beautiful. Mylne experienced problems with the piers moving, which resulted in the central [...] arch collapsing in February 1768, after which Mylne was sacked. In the 1840s, the fifth duke, who built an underground ballroom and tunnels on the estate, employed the engineer William Tierney Clark to construct a suspension bridge. The resident engineer for the project was Bland William Croker, who had assisted Clark with the construction of the Szechenyi suspension bridge in Budapest. The <b>western</b> <b>channel</b> of the Poulter flows through a culvert into the Great Lake, while the lower eastern channel flows through a culvert into Carburton Forge Dam.|$|E

50|$|As the {{arrangement}} of aerial antennae on roofs differed depending on whether TV-owners watched one of these channels or one from Western Germany, especially during the 1950s and 1960s, viewers of Western TV were prone to denunciation by patriotic neighbours or FDJ members.
