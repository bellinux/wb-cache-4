40|$|Abstract. As {{improvement}} {{of science and}} technology, the life quality was significantly promoted. And people are more aware of health care. It has been proved that bamboo charcoal owns special properties including air purification, water refining, deodorization, far-infrared radiation, and anion release, thus it is widely applied on textile industry in form of fiber and yarn after mixing with its power. This study aims to seek for the optimal twist number of bamboo charcoal (BC) /Nylon(NY) / stainless steel(SS) <b>wrap</b> <b>yarn.</b> And then {{the one or two}} wrap yarns were fed into crocheting machine to weave BC/NY/SS elastic warp-knitted fabrics with different structures. Afterwards, the far-infrared radiation, anion amount, air permeability were discussed by changes of number of layers. The result shows that, as increasing layers of BC/NY/SS elastic warp-knitted fabrics, the far-infrared radiation and air permeability both decrease; but all the single-layer warp knitted fabric reaches above 0. 8, corresponding with the functional standards...|$|E
40|$|Stress-strain {{properties}} including loop strength, {{stress relaxation}} and elastic recovery of air-textured PES/PES core-wrap sewing threads manufactured on “Eltex ” air-texturing machine with HemaJet ® air-texturing nozzle are investigated. Torlen FY HT PES 13. 3 tex multifilament yarn distinguished by increased strength {{was used as}} raw material. Two PES yarns were fed to the nozzle as core threads and one as wrap effect. The properties of threads manufactured alternatively with thermosetting and without it are studied in dependence on overfeed of <b>wrap</b> <b>yarn</b> and pressure of air fed into the texturing nozzle. ZWICK/ROELL BDO-FBO. 5 TH testing machine with a 50 N load cell was used performing the tests. Mechanical properties of the PES multifilament yarns are markedly changed by air-texturing. Breaking tenacities of PES/PES air-textured sewing threads are only one half of those of the raw PES yarn due to core-wrap structure of the air-textured threads and the disordering of filaments of core threads during air-texturing. PES/PES threads are pretty less responsive to loop testing if comparing with straight thread test than the raw PES yarn. Air-pressure and overfeed in texturing are influential factors in respect of stress-strain properties and loop strength of air-textured PES/PES sewing threads. Their influence is markedly affected by thread thermosetting: lower air pressure and overfeed values are advantageous factors while texturing without thermosetting but they are disadvantageous ones while texturing with thermosetting. The thermosetting of threads does not markedly influences relaxation behaviour of air-textured PES/PES threads, but the thermoset threads show to have more stable elastic power at higher strains...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{sportswear}} fabrics are functional textiles {{that can}} mitigate the impaired muscles caused by exercises for the wearers, {{but they can}} also cause discomfort and skin allergy. This study proposes combining two yarns to form functional composite yarns, by using a twisting or wrapping process. Moreover, a different twist number is used in order to adjust the performance of functional composite yarns. A crochet machine is used to make the functional composite yarns into functional elastic knits that are suitable for use in sportswear. The test results show that, in comparison to the non-processed yarns, using the twisted or <b>wrapped</b> <b>yarns</b> can considerably decrease the water vapor transmission rate of functional elastic knits by 38 %, while also improving their far infrared emissivity by 13 %, water absorption rate by 39 %, and air permeability by 136 %. In particular, the functional elastic knits that are made of B-wrapped <b>yarns</b> (bamboo charcoal- <b>wrapped</b> <b>yarns),</b> composed of 20 twists per inch, have the optimal diverse functions...|$|R

40|$|In textile world, {{nearly all}} types of yarns that one can imagine can be created. Some of them are easier to create, and some others {{have to deal with}} more {{accurate}} processes. Those yarns made out of fibers which are difficult to be treated are sometimes wrapped by a filament in order to give them the consistence needed to develop the yarn. These particular types of <b>yarns</b> are called <b>wrap</b> <b>yarns.</b> According to that, the primordial aim of the project is to set the ideas of a future prototype able to create <b>wrap</b> <b>yarns.</b> To achieve it, it has been done a general study of the existing machines and possible alternatives. The prototype that is being sought would have to enable the study and creation of different types of <b>wrap</b> <b>yarns.</b> For this reason, it has been tried to develop a prototype able to deal with some particular features to create different types of yarns. Those features taken into account are the following: - The prototype should {{have to be able to}} treat {{all types of}} length fibers (long and short fibers). - The prototype should have to be able to create yarns out of ribbon or roving. In order to accomplish the objective of the project, first of all it has been studied what the prototype needs to have. Once the general idea of the prototype has been set, it has been discussed about how this idea could be achieved. In other words, which are the alternatives that can make the idea became into a reality. Once the brainstorming of alternatives has reached all of the possibilities, those which are more suitable are the ones that have been described and analyzed. By now, the possibility of developing the prototype looks more achievable and more documented and studied. Besides the main objective, there are other two more simple objectives that are also wanted to be achieved. Both objectives are related with extending the knowledge in textile engineering. On the one hand, the first aim is to get to know the fibers and their properties. On the other hand, familiarize with the manufacturing process that fibers follow to be converted into yarns and inquire into its last stage, the spinning stage. To achieve those objectives, some books have been greatly useful. Specifically: The Rieter Manual of Spinning; and Fundamentals of Spun Yarn Technology...|$|R

50|$|In {{order for}} the fiber to be made into cloth or clothing, it must be spun (or twisted) into a strand known as yarn. When the yarn is ready and dyed for use {{it can be made}} into cloth in a number of ways. Knitting and crochet are common methods of {{twisting}} and shaping the yarn into garments or fabric. The most common use of yarn to make cloth is weaving. In weaving, the <b>yarn</b> is <b>wrapped</b> on a frame called a loom and pulled taut vertically. This is known as the warp. Then another strand of yarn is worked back and forth wrapping over and under the warp. This <b>wrapped</b> <b>yarn</b> is called the weft.
