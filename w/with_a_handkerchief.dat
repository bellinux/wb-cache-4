5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against her having more {{children}} in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled his face <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief</b> to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect {{in the midst of}} her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|Coded {{letters were}} carried out of Leith by another soldier, a drummer {{messenger}} of the Lords of the Congregation.

500|$|In February 2014, a short {{preview of}} the song was {{released}} featuring the chorus, performed by Kanye West and Big Sean. Following the track list reveal for the album, on February 7, 2014, producer DJ Mustard revealed that he co-produced [...] "Sanctified" [...] with Kanye West. The song was also produced by Mike Dean, along with being written by William Roberts, Sean Anderson, Kanye West, and Dijon McFarlane. Betty Wright lent her vocal talent to the song during a late night studio session she did {{as a favor to}} DJ Khaled in order for him to meet a deadline. She recorded the hook in fifteen minutes while sitting on a sofa [...] In the song, West raps about how he feels about people playing up his earlier works and dismiss who he is now, before saying that he's not going to worry about it. Then later he says, [...] "Wipe my forehead <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief</b> and wash my sins in the blood of Jesus, People sayin', 'Ye, we need another Yeezus." [...] This being a reference to his experimental sixth studio album.|$|E

500|$|The gallows {{consisted}} of {{nothing more than}} a large elm tree. [...] Here the prisoners would step up a ladder with one end of a rope about their neck and the other end secured to the tree, and the ladder would then be pulled away. [...] William Robinson {{was the first of the}} three to mount the ladder, and when he was positioned he made a statement to the crowd, then died when the ladder was removed. [...] Marmaduke Stephenson was the next to hang, and then it was Dyer's turn, after she witnessed the execution of her two friends. [...] Dyer's arms and legs were bound and her face was covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief</b> provided by Reverend John Wilson who had been one of her pastors in the Boston church many years earlier. [...] She stood calmly on the ladder, prepared for her death, but as she waited, an order of a reprieve was announced. [...] A petition from her son, William, had given the authorities an excuse to avoid her execution. [...] It had been a pre-arranged scheme, in an attempt to unnerve and dissuade Dyer from her mission. [...] This was made clear from the wording of the reprieve, though Dyer's only expectation was to die as a martyr.|$|E
500|$|On 23 March 1939, on {{his return}} to Palestine after being officially {{confirmed}} as the rebellion's general commander, al-Hajj Muhammad was killed by the British Army {{in the village of}} Sanur, located between Jenin and Nablus. He had entered the village with two of his subordinate commanders and a few of his fighters. A peace band set up by Farid Irsheid had been surveilling him. Irsheid had sought revenge for the killing of his brothers Ahmad and Muhammad in May 1938, which were generally attributed to al-Hajj Muhammad. The information Irsheid's band of informants collected on al-Hajj Muhammad's movements were then passed to British intelligence. A large force from the British Army subsequently arrived at and sealed off Sanur. Irsheid's band served alongside the army unit. The village's residents had reportedly pleaded with al-Hajj Muhammad to escape from Sanur undercover, but he and his fighters entered the adjacent Marj Sanur plain and clashed with British troops. Al-Hajj Muhammad was killed in the firefight along with one of his deputy commanders. According to some residents who witnessed the clash, the British officer who headed the operation, Jeffrey Motrin, removed his hat and covered al-Hajj Muhammad's face <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief</b> in a sign of respect. Motrin later wrote [...] "Abdul Rahim had a special respect among his people, and among us." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1997, {{there was}} a {{controversial}} change {{from the use of}} the former British Airways branding (which incorporated stylised elements of the Union Jack) to a new livery which was intended mainly to reflect the diversity of places served by the airline – so-called [...] "World Images". This involved a range of different designs appearing on tailfins and elsewhere, although the bodies of all the planes would use the corporate colours consistently; the exception was the Concorde fleet, which would have a new tailfin design based on a stylised, fluttering Union flag. What became known as the [...] "ethnic images" [...] included Delftware or Chinese calligraphy, related to countries on the company's network of routes. This was reported to have caused problems with air traffic control: previously controllers had been able to tell pilots to follow a BA plane, but they were now harder to visually identify. Several people spoke out against the change, including the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who famously covered the tail of a model 747 at an event <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief,</b> to show her displeasure. BA's traditional rival, Virgin Atlantic, took advantage of the negative press coverage by applying the Union flag to the winglets of their aircraft along with the slogan [...] "Britain's national flagcarrier". In 1999 the CEO of British Airways, Bob Ayling, announced that all BA planes would adopt the tailfin design originally intended to be used only on the Concorde, based on the Union Flag.|$|E

2500|$|Enraged at his discovery, Sickles confronted his wife. Although she {{initially}} denied everything, Teresa eventually wrote a confession. Teresa {{described her}} numerous rendezvous with Key at a rented house on 15th Street. A few days later, on Sunday, February 27, 1859, [...] Sickles saw Key outside his house, {{located on the}} west side of today's Lafayette Square, signaling Teresa <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief.</b> Key continued walking, and Sickles sent an acquaintance outside to delay him. Sickles armed himself with several pistols, and intercepted Key at the corner of Madison Place N.W. and Pennsylvania Avenue, across the street from the White House. There, Sickles shot the unarmed Key twice, one shot directed at Key's groin. Key died about an hour later in a nearby house.|$|E
2500|$|Empress Dowager Longyu {{endorsed}} the [...] "Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor" [...] (清帝退位詔書) on 12 February 1912 under a deal brokered by Prime Minister Yuan Shikai (a {{general of the}} Beiyang Army) with the imperial court in Beijing and the Republicans in southern China. At the crucial meeting in the Forbidden City, Puyi watched the meeting between Longyu and Yuan, which he remembered as: [...] "The Dowager Empress {{was sitting on a}} kang [...] in a side room of the Mind Nature Palace, wiping her eyes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief</b> while a fat old man [...] knelt on a red cushion before her, tears rolling down his face. I was sitting {{to the right of the}} Dowager and wondering why the two adults were crying. There was nobody in the room besides us three and it was very quiet; the fat man was sniffing while he talked and I could not understand what he was saying ... This was the occasion Yuan directly brought up the question of abdication". Under the [...] "Articles of Favourable Treatment of the Great Qing Emperor after His Abdication" [...] (清帝退位 優待條件), signed with the new Republic of China, Puyi was to retain his imperial title and be treated by the government of the Republic with the protocol attached to a foreign monarch. This was similar to Italy's Law of Guarantees (1870) which accorded the Pope certain honors and privileges similar to those enjoyed by the King of Italy. Puyi and the imperial court were allowed to remain in the northern half of the Forbidden City (the Private Apartments) as well as in the Summer Palace. A hefty annual subsidy of four million silver taels was granted by the Republic to the imperial household, although it was never fully paid and was abolished after just a few years. Puyi himself was not informed in February 1912 that his reign had ended and China was now a republic and continued to believe that he was the still the Emperor for sometime afterwards. In 1913, when the Empress Dowager Longyu died, President Yuan Shikai arrived at the Forbidden City to pay his respects, which Puyi's tutors told him meant that major changes were afloat.|$|E
