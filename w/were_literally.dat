5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion {{system on the}} railway (referred to {{at the time as}} the atmospheric-propulsion system). A pumping station was built on Portland Road; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains <b>were</b> <b>literally</b> sucked towards the pumping station or blown away from it. The pumping station was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E
5|$|There were {{numerous}} types of belts produced for the Confederate Military during the Civil War. There <b>were</b> <b>literally</b> dozens {{of types of}} buckles used and produced by or for the Confederacy. The buckles ranged from single plates with hooks, to two piece interlocking buckles, to simple roller buckles and countless other variations. Many buckles use plates that bore the state seal or motto of their home states. The vast majority used simple roller buckle plates of the type found on a common dog collar. As the War progressed, more and more men used captured US belt plates, often wearing them upside down.|$|E
5|$|Although Chang'an was {{the capital}} of the earlier Han and Jin dynasties, after {{subsequent}} destruction in warfare, it was the Sui dynasty model that comprised the Tang era capital. The roughly square dimensions of the city had six miles (10km) of outer walls running east to west, and more than five miles (8km) of outer walls running north to south. The royal palace, the Taiji Palace, stood north of the city's central axis. From the large Mingde Gates located mid-center of the main southern wall, a wide city avenue stretched from there all the way north to the central administrative city, behind which was the Chentian Gate of the royal palace, or Imperial City. Intersecting this were fourteen main streets running east to west, while eleven main streets ran north to south. These main intersecting roads formed 108 rectangular wards with walls and four gates each, and each ward filled with multiple city blocks. The city was made famous for this checkerboard pattern of main roads with walled and gated districts, its layout even mentioned in one of Du Fu's poems. During the Heian period, the city of Heian kyō (present-day Kyoto) of Japan like many cities was arranged in the checkerboard street grid pattern of the Tang capital and in accordance with traditional geomancy following the model of Chang'an. Of these 108 wards in Chang'an, two of them (each the size of two regular city wards) were designated as government-supervised markets, and other space reserved for temples, gardens, ponds, etc. Throughout the entire city, there were 111 Buddhist monasteries, 41 Daoist abbeys, 38 family shrines, 2 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards. Some city wards <b>were</b> <b>literally</b> filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and cuju football. In 662, Emperor Gaozong moved the imperial court to the Daming Palace, which became the political center of the empire and served as the royal residence of the Tang emperors for more than 220 years.|$|E

5000|$|By contrast, Salmon {{maintains}} that [...] "Sherlock Holmes exists" [...] <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> true, whereas [...] "Sherlock Holmes was a detective" [...] <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> false. According to Salmon, Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character, {{a kind of}} abstract entity, created by author Arthur Conan Doyle, and the fiction is a story, or a collection of stories, which are about that very character but <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> false. Holmes really exists, but is only depicted as a detective in the fiction. In the fiction, Holmes is a detective; in reality, Holmes is merely a fictional detective.|$|R
25|$|Djoser {{was buried}} in his famous step pyramid at Saqqara.

Ybor readily agreed, and quickly moved to purchase 50 more adjoining acres. Haya bought his own smaller tract.|$|E
5000|$|Twenty (...) {{is used as}} a {{base number}} in the French {{language}} names of numbers from 70 to 99, except in the French of Belgium, Switzerland, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, the Aosta Valley and the Channel Islands. For example, , the French word for [...] "80", literally means [...] "four-twenties"; soixante-dix, the word for [...] "70", <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "sixty-ten"; [...] ("75") <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "sixty-fifteen"; quatre-vingt-sept ("87") <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "four-twenties-seven"; quatre-vingt-dix ("90") <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "four-twenties-ten"; and quatre-vingt-seize ("96") <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "four-twenties-sixteen". However, in the French of Belgium, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, the Aosta Valley, and the Channel Islands, the numbers 70 and 90 generally have the names septante and nonante. Therefore, the year 1996 is [...] "mille neuf cent quatre-vingt-seize" [...] in Parisian French, but it is [...] "mille neuf cent nonante-six" [...] in Belgian French. In Switzerland, [...] "80" [...] can be quatre-vingts (Geneva, Neuchâtel, Jura) or huitante (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg); in the past octante was also in use.|$|R

25|$|Obverse {{and reverse}} {{patterns}} are aligned at 180 degrees (top of obverse matches bottom of reverse). Mass-produced rubles {{of the period}} usually had their obverse, reverse and edge lettering pressed in a single operation. The automated presses produced nearly perfect alignment of edge lettering relative to obverse and reverse surfaces. Constantine rubles, on the contrary, <b>were</b> <b>literally</b> hand made on simple manually operated presses from blanks with pre-pressed edge lettering.

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Syriam, Alaungpaya waited out the monsoon season. In September, one Konbaung army marched from Syriam in the south, while another army marched from Toungoo (Taungoo) in the north. The advance was slow with great losses as the Hanthawaddy {{defenses}} still had cannon and they <b>were</b> <b>literally</b> fighting with {{their backs to the}} wall. By mid-October, the combined armies converged on Pegu. Konbaung war boats too flung off Hanthawaddy fire-rafts and completed the Konbaung line around the city.|$|E

Residents in the Monteiths' portion of town were mainly merchants and professionals, who aligned with the Republican Party. They tended to sympathize with the Union during the Civil War. The residents in Hackleman's portion of town to the east were made up mostly of working-class Democrats who sided with the Confederacy. The two sides planted a hedge near Baker Street separating their sides of town.|$|E

However, the debate continues.|$|E
25|$|After the report, another Guard officer came to Tripp and {{his colleagues}} with new {{information}} which did substantiate some of the allegations, and revealed to them DeZarn's role in the 1990 party. He was indicted on a perjury charge in 1996. His attorneys unsuccessfully sought to have the indictment dismissed {{on the grounds that}} his answers <b>were</b> <b>literally</b> truthful. The district court refused to do so since other witnesses had answered questions about the 1991 party with reference to the 1990 one, and that DeZarn's other answers had shown he knew which party was at issue.|$|E
25|$|Masks {{are used}} {{throughout}} Europe, and are frequently integrated into regional folk celebrations and customs. Old masks are preserved {{and can be}} seen in museums and other collections, and much research has been undertaken into the historical origins of masks. Most probably represent nature spirits, and as a result many of the associated customs are seasonal. The original significance would have survived only until the introduction of Christianity which then incorporated many of the customs into its own traditions. In the process their meanings were also changed so, for example, old gods and goddesses <b>were,</b> <b>literally,</b> demonised and were viewed as mere devils, subjugated to the Abrahamic God.|$|E

25|$|A {{network of}} Nazi {{concentration}} camps were established on German-controlled territories, {{many of them}} in occupied Poland, including {{one of the largest and}} most infamous, Auschwitz (Oświęcim).

Only high-ranking officials knew that one of the purposes of some of the camps, known as extermination camps (or death camps), was mass murder of the undesirable minorities, primarily the Jews; officially the prisoners were used in enterprises such as production of synthetic rubber, as was the case of a plant owned by IG Farben, whose laborers came from Auschwitz III camp, or Monowitz.

25|$|Herrnhaag was a {{community}} {{designed by the}} elder Zinzendorf, whose inhabitants were to live under the direct rule of Christ with Christian Renatus as his representative.

During the 1748 Single Brothers Festival at Herrnhaag, Christel and his assistants entered wearing white robes, implying it was Christ who was actually entering. Later that day, Christel and twelve assistants led Communion, further representing Christ and the apostles. During the service, those in attendance believed that the Sidehole of Christ was literally standing before them in the bodily forms of Christel and Rubusch, his co-leader of the brothers. Christel sang a welcoming hymn for Christ entering the hall, and while kissing, the brothers believed they <b>were</b> <b>literally</b> kissing the Sidehole.|$|E

The forces of Biron and Norreys suffered at least 3,200 casualties, and almost all the baggage, barrels of gunpowder, 36 flags and 3 banners captured. On the Spanish side the casualties were 400 dead or wounded. The French Marshal himself, who tried to repel the attack of the Spaniards, he fell from his horse and broke his leg.|$|E
