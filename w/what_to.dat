5|$|Justification {{for using}} the Sunnah {{as a source of}} law {{can be found in the}} Qur'an. The Qur'an {{commands}} Muslims to follow Muhammad. During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death. The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the Qur'an. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they can look at the way of life, or sunnah, of Muhammad and his companions to discover <b>what</b> <b>to</b> imitate and <b>what</b> <b>to</b> avoid.|$|E

5|$|A {{scene in}} the episode shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, {{listening}} to the radio. Because the scene consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons staff had difficulty figuring out <b>what</b> <b>to</b> show visually during the scene. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that these scenes “get a really big laugh at the table,” but are subsequently hard for the animators. The scene makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E

Goffredo and Eustazio are shocked at Rinaldo's impulsiveness and believe that he has deserted their cause.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, the Poles resented their {{change of}} {{fortunes}} because, before the war, Poles had a privileged position. Then, {{in the space}} of a few days, Jews and other minorities from within Poland occupied positions in the Soviet occupation government—such as teachers, civil servants and engineers—that they allegedly had trouble achieving under the Polish government. <b>What</b> <b>to</b> the majority of Poles was occupation and betrayal was, to some Jews—especially Polish communists of Jewish descent who emerged from the underground—an opportunity for revolution and retribution. There were even some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. Such behavior affronted non-Jewish Poles.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did {{this because he}} had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated over <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.|$|E

5|$|By 1907, new {{university}} buildings completely {{surrounded the}} observatory; {{dust from the}} construction clogged meteorological instruments, and at night electric lighting made astronomical work impossible. The Meteorological Office decided to abandon the site and {{move to a new}} building {{at the north end of}} campus on Bloor Street, trading the original Observatory to the University in exchange for the new parcel of land. There was some discussion regarding <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with the Cooke telescope, since the Meteorological Office had little use for this purely astronomical instrument. No other use was immediately forthcoming, and the telescope moved along with the Meteorological Office to their new Bloor Street Observatory.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do next {{and worried about}} his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's {{father had been a}} headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E

On April 6, the next portion of the freeway opened. However, there were concerns about <b>what</b> <b>to</b> call the freeway, citing confusion with the northern portion of SR75. The entire cost {{of the project was}} $6.3million. SR117 was extended east to SR125, replacing the southerly segment of SR75, by the Legislature in 1976; this took effect at the beginning of 1977.
