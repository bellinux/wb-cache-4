5|$|In {{the year}} 1602 in the Marvel Universe, for an unknown reason, superheroes have {{appeared}} about 400 years early. They {{were born and}} bred in this era and some hold important positions in high places. When the characters {{come to realize that}} something is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the universe, the heroes must solve the mystery behind their own existence, while dealing with intrigue at the courts of Elizabeth and James.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{eventually}} canceled by the Air Force in January 1959, seemingly {{out of fear}} of a negative public reaction and the risk to the population should anything have gone <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the launch. Another factor, cited by project leader Leonard Reiffel, was the possible implications of the nuclear fallout for future lunar research projects and colonization.|$|E
5|$|When {{you think}} about Goya, who painted the most horrendous {{pictures}} of violence and torture and so forth, and they're amazing, exquisite paintings, {{one of the reasons}} they're such wonderful paintings is because what he's saying is, 'Look– look at this.' So if you paint it badly or put it in the sort of wrong perspective, you draw more attention to what's <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the image rather than looking at the image.|$|E

5|$|Both events, not {{connected}} publicly for several weeks, caused the curious {{to visit the}} website ilovebees.com. The site, which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and beekeeping, was covered in confusing random characters and sentence fragments. Dana, the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site, created a weblog stating that something had gone <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> her website, and the site itself had been hacked. Suspecting {{that this was a}} mystery that could be unraveled, Halo and ARG fans spread the link and began to work on figuring out what was going on.|$|E
5|$|For many, the Vatican's actions {{encapsulated}} {{all that}} was <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the Papal States and exposed pontifical rule as an anachronism. Several historians highlight the affair {{as one of the}} most significant events of Pius IX's papacy, and juxtapose his handling of it in 1858 with the loss of most of his territory a year later. The case notably altered the policy of the French Emperor Napoleon III, who shifted from opposing the movement for Italian unification to actively supporting it. The traditional Italian historiography of unification does not give much prominence to the Mortara case, which by the late 20th century was remembered mostly by Jewish scholars, but a 1997 study by the American historian David Kertzer has marked the start of a wider re-examination.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) takes a {{pregnant}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{to the hospital}} when she doubles over in pain. There, Reyes phones him {{to ask about the}} case, but Mulder cedes to the authority of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), who is formally running the X-Files. However, Reyes says she can't call Doggett since it is about him. Meanwhile, Jeb is in a hotel room in Georgia trying to shoot himself in the head. Suddenly, he notices something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> his face; he claws at his face, peeling away the skin to reveal burning embers beneath the skin.|$|E

Belt, who now manages the shuttle program, dismisses the agents' concerns and states {{that nothing can}} possibly go <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the mission. He allows the agents to watch the launch from Mission Control. The launch is successful. As the agents are leaving however, Generoo informs them that contact is lost with the shuttle in orbit. While driving back to Mission Control, Generoo sees the face come at her through her windshield, causing her to crash her car.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E

She subsequently started taking further courses to advance her career. During this time the children lived with other families during the week, seeing their mother only on weekends. Concerned about her children and parenting skills, she sought help for the family from a psychiatrist at St. Justine's Hospital in 1976; the assessment concluded there was nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the shy and withdrawn Gamil, but recommended therapy for his sister Nadia, who was challenging her authority.|$|E

5|$|Shiraasan, {{also known}} as Shi-chan, is a female homunculus, or {{artificial}} human, created by a joint effort of Hibiki and Shirotsuki. Despite looking like a very young girl, Shiraasan has the maturity of an adult who finds nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> reading newspapers or smoking cigarettes. Since homunculi were originally created as weapons in Hibiki's Magic, Shiraasan can procure guns and other weapons to use as she pleases, such as taking care of stray flies. Shiraasan has a very independent personality and does {{not like to be}} told what she can and cannot do. After it is confirmed that she is a stable lifeform, Shiraasan warms up to Hibiki and loves her very much.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking {{for changes in the}} speed of light depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the null result indicated something was <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.|$|E
5|$|The {{defense of}} Machias {{consisted}} of local militia {{under the command}} of Colonel Jonathan Eddy, the leader of the 1776 attack on Fort Cumberland. He had been warned that the British were organizing an attack. The militia laid a log boom across the Machias River, and constructed several earthen redoubts further upriver, armed with cannons taken from local privateers. The defense was coincidentally reinforced by forty to fifty Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscots that Colonel Allan had called to Machias to explain what had gone <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> his expedition.|$|E

Then I actually caught him red-handed. It {{took me a while to}} get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) work desperately {{in an attempt to}} discover what is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> Mulder, who is imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity, but they are unaware of Agent Diana Fowley’s (Mimi Rogers) duplicity. In the meanwhile, Scully is hunting for an ancient artifact in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon for}} bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E

5|$|Cape {{sold the}} US {{rights to the}} {{recently}} formed publishing house of Pascal Covici and Donald Friede. Friede had heard gossip about The Well at a party at Theodore Dreiser's house and immediately decided to acquire it. He had previously sold a copy of Dreiser's An American Tragedy to a Boston police officer to create a censorship test case, which he had lost; he was awaiting an appeal, which he would also lose. He took out a $10,000 bank loan to outbid another publisher which had offered a $7,500 advance, and enlisted Morris Ernst, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, to defend the book against legal challenges. Friede invited John Saxton Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to buy a copy directly from him, to ensure that he, not a bookseller, {{would be the one}} prosecuted. He also travelled to Boston to give a copy to the Watch and Ward Society, hoping both to further challenge censorship of literature and to generate more publicity; he was disappointed when they told him they saw nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the book.|$|E

Charlie is partnered with Jack Holden when she starts {{her job as a}} Senior Constable at the Yabbie Creek Police Station and her sister, Ruby, arrives in the Bay. Charlie begins a {{relationship}} with Roman Harris and she eventually accepts Ross and Morag being together. Ross and Morag marry, but after they come back from their honeymoon, Charlie realises something is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> her father. Ross is diagnosed with Alzheimer's, devastating Charlie. He later moves into a home. Roman breaks up with Charlie and she begins drinking and refusing help. She rescues Annie Campbell from a storm drain and nearly dies. She is rescued by Roman, which makes her bitter. Charlie gets a promotion at work and she goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta. Charlie becomes a respected member of the community and she builds up strong friendships with Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) and Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart).|$|E
5|$|Former World Bank Chief Economist {{and former}} Chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Joseph E. Stiglitz {{referred}} {{in the late}} 1990s to a growing consensus that something is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> a system having the capacity to impose high costs on {{a great number of}} people who are hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies.|$|E
