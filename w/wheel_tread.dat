25|$|Before about 1960, most railway {{vehicles}} used {{brake shoes}} {{to stop the}} train by applying pressure on the wheel treads. Since then, disc brakes have increasingly been used, which means that cleaning the compressed leaf material from the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> by abrasion no longer occurs.|$|E
25|$|Steam trams {{relied upon}} their weight and {{adhesion}} for propulsion {{and as the}} town streets were badly paved, dirt, stones, manure and water got into the rail grooves. Water boys and track cleaners were employed {{to clean out the}} rail grooves with long iron bars, which they dragged along the rails, it being essential to ensure the wheel flanges ran fully in the grooves, to allow the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> to grip the track. The specification of performance was strict, the vehicle had to be silent, had to emit no smoke and was required to have no exposed parts which could provide a safety hazard to pedestrians and horses. In Nottingham, only one steam tram was operated and being considerably heavier than a horse-drawn car, it, no doubt, caused considerable damage to the track.|$|E

50|$|The {{benefit of}} linked wheels {{derives from the}} {{conicity}} of the <b>wheel</b> treads—the <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> are not cylindrical, but conical. On idealised straight track, a wheelset would run centrally, midway between the rails.|$|R
25|$|The force {{accelerating}} a pinewood derby car is gravity; {{the opposing}} forces are friction and air drag. Therefore, car modifications {{are aimed at}} maximizing the potential energy in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track guide rail. Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> can be sanded or turned on a lathe and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly {{so that it does}} not contact the track and add to the rolling resistance. Axles are filed or turned on a lathe to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area. Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.|$|E
2500|$|To {{illustrate}} that a wheelset trajectory follows a curved path, one may place a nail or screw {{on a flat}} table top {{and give it a}} push. [...] It will roll in a curved circle because the nail or screw is like a wheelset with extremely different diameter wheels. [...] The head is analogous to a large diameter wheel and the pointed end is like a small diameter wheel. [...] While the nail or screw will turn around in a full circle (and more) the railroad wheelset behaves differently because as soon at it starts to turn in a curve, the effective diameters change {{in such a way as}} to decrease the curvature of the path. [...] Note that [...] "radius" [...] and [...] "curvature" [...] refer to the curvature of the trajectory of the wheelset and not the curvature of the railway since this is perfectly straight track. [...] As the wheelset rolls on, the curvature decreases until the wheels reach the point where their effective diameters are equal and the path is no longer curving. [...] But the trajectory has a slope at this point (it is a straight line which crosses diagonally over the centerline of the track) so that it overshoots the centerline of the track and the effective diameters reverse (the formerly smaller diameter wheel becomes the larger diameter and conversely). [...] This results in the wheelset moving in a curve in the opposite direction. [...] Again it overshoots the centerline and this phenomenon continues indefinitely with the wheelset oscillating from side to side. [...] Note that the wheel flange never makes contact with the rail. [...] In this model, the rails are assumed to always contact the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> along the same line on the rail head which assumes that the rails are knife-edge and only make contact with the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> along a line (of zero width).|$|E

50|$|The {{guidance}} system of practical railway vehicles {{relies on the}} steering effect of the conicity of the <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> on moderate curves (down to a radius of about 500 m, or about 1,500 feet). On sharper curves flange contact takes place, and the guiding effect of the flange relies on a vertical force (the vehicle weight).|$|R

25|$|Locomotives {{have their}} own braking system, {{independent}} {{from the rest of}} the train. Locomotive brakes employ large shoes which press against the driving <b>wheel</b> <b>treads.</b> With the advent of air brakes, a separate system also allowed the driver to control the brakes on all cars. These systems require steam-powered compressors, which are mounted on the side of the boiler or on the smokebox front. Almost all of these compressors were of the Westinghouse single-stage or cross-compound variety. Such systems operated in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|R
2500|$|For {{nearly the}} whole of the 20th century, bipedal robots were very {{difficult}} to construct and robot locomotion involved only <b>wheels,</b> <b>treads,</b> or multiple legs. Recent cheap and compact computing power has made two-legged robots more feasible. Some notable biped robots are ASIMO, HUBO, MABEL and QRIO. [...] Recently, spurred by the success of creating a fully passive, un-powered bipedal walking robot, those working on such machines have begun using principles gleaned from the study of human and animal locomotion, which often relies on passive mechanisms to minimize power consumption.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle {{wheelsets}} become momentarily unloaded vertically so {{that the}} guidance required from the flanges or <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> contact is inadequate.|$|E
50|$|If, {{however, the}} {{wheelset}} is displaced to one side, the diameters of {{the regions of}} contact, and hence the tangential velocities of the wheels at the running surfaces are different and the wheelset tends to steer back towards the centre. Also, when the train encounters an unbanked turn, the wheelset displaces laterally slightly, so that the outer <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> speeds up linearly, and the inner <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> slows down, causing the train to turn the corner. Some railway systems employ a flat wheel and track profile, relying on cant alone to reduce or eliminate flange contact.|$|E
50|$|The wheel diameter(tread) reduces due {{to brake}} {{application}} as the brake blocks rub against the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread.</b> Over {{a period of}} time, the wheel diameter reduces up to 819 mm. 819mm is the condemnation diameter for the wheels. This diameter is also not sacrosanct and is changed depending upon the supply position of the wheels. The maximum variation in the wheels on the same axle is permitted up to 0.5 mm, between two wheels of the same bogie up to 5 mm and among the four wheel sets of the same coach up to 13 mm. The diameter of a new wheel is 915 mm. Hence maximum <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> wear allowed is (915 mm - 819mm) = 96 mm. In order to adjust for {{the difference in the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>tread,</b> a packing is placed under the flange of the lower spring seat. This packing ring is generally made up of NFTC(Natural Fiber Thermosetting COMPOSITE) or UHMWPE (Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) material. The thickness of the NFTC packing ring is equal to 50% of the difference between the dia of a new wheel and the wheel in question.|$|E

40|$|The {{equations}} {{that describe}} {{the development of}} corrugations on block braked <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> caused by thermoelastic instability are discretized using the finite element method. The perturbations of temperatures and distortions are described by an amplitude function, which is spatially fixed multiplied by a sinusoidal running wave term of fixed wavelength. The governing equations are such that the wave term cancels out. Only the amplitude functions are discretized in the finite element model. The intermittent nature of the contact is directly specified through the boundary conditions. Results are obtained for a simplified two-dimensional model of a train wheel. These results agree with analytical result...|$|R

5000|$|Wheel Flange: The inner {{section of}} a wheel that rides between the two rails.

5000|$|No. 3 {{had been}} unnamed on the Corris, but {{received}} the name Sir Haydn upon arrival on the Talyllyn Railway, after the former {{owner of the}} railway; it seems that at {{that time it was}} not appreciated the crucial role Haydn Jones had played in keeping the Corris line running in the 1930s, which had played an important part in ensuring the locomotive's survival. Along with No. 4, it kept its Corris number, giving both locos the unusual distinction of carrying the same number though the ownership of four different railway companies (the Corris, Great Western, British Railways and Talyllyn Railway). Because both railways were built to the unusual gauge of [...] it was relatively easy to adapt the Corris locomotives to work on the Talyllyn Railway. Sir Haydn became the first new locomotive to travel on the railway for over 90 years. Upon arriving Sir Haydn was the engine in better condition but frequently derailed however and could not be used safely. Upon inspection {{it turned out that the}} Talyllyn track was laid approximately 0.5 in wider than the official gauge, a deliberate policy by the old company to accommodate the long wheelbase of Talyllyn. The two original Talyllyn locomotives had unusually wide <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> that allowed them to stay on the wide-of-gauge track. This problem was eventually cured by the fitting of wider <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> and by a Territorial Army members' exercise in 1953 relaying the railway to its correct gauge making Sir Haydn usable. The original cab was replaced in the 1960s.|$|R
40|$|Railroad safety {{depends on}} many factors. The {{integrity}} of the wheels on rolling stock {{is one that is}} subject to nondestructive evaluation. For some years, ultrasonic testing has been applied to the detection of cracks in <b>wheel</b> <b>treads,</b> with particular attention to automatic, in-rail, roll-by methods. We have begun constructing a system aimed at using relatively low frequency Rayleigh waves generated by electromagnetic-acoustic transducers (EMATs). The current design uses a permanent magnet to maintain a compact structure and minimize the size of the pocket machined into the rail. Measurements thus far indicate a responsiveness, even to small flaws. With the development of a signal processing and analysis system, field tests should soon be possible...|$|R
50|$|At {{this early}} date this was remarkably far-sighted. It {{had to be}} altered for a plateway, to have plain <b>wheel</b> <b>treads.</b> Unfortunately the L-shaped cast iron plates were {{not strong enough to}} support the five-ton locomotive's axle loading. Smiles recorded:The first engine {{constructed}} by Mr Stephenson to order, after the Killingworth model, was made for the Duke of Portland in 1817, for use upon his tramroad, about ten miles long, extending from Kilmarnock to Troon, in Ayrshire. It was employed to haul the coals from the Duke's collieries along the line to Troon Harbour. Its use was however discontinued in view of the frequent breakages of the cast-iron rails, by which the working of the line was interrupted, and accordingly horses were again employed as before.|$|R
50|$|The sharper the curve, {{the greater}} the lateral {{displacement}} necessary to achieve the curving. On a very sharp curve (typically less than about 500 m or 1,500 feet radius) {{the width of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> is not enough to achieve the necessary steering effect, and the wheel flange contacts the face of the high rail.|$|E

5000|$|All {{wheel disc}} brakes - earlier TGVs (including Eurostar) used disc brakes only on {{unpowered}} axles. Weight gains on the Duplex power units allowed {{the installation of}} disc brakes directly on the wheels of powered axles (so-called [...] "cheek discs"), instead of using the traditional tread brakes. This does not greatly improve braking performance, but it leaves the <b>wheel</b> <b>tread</b> smooth and considerably reduces rolling noise.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main line}} had a {{generally}} falling gradient, {{and it was}} steep enough to require efficient braking. The wagon structure was founded on two main beams 9 feet (2.743 m) long, with the bed formed of 2½ inch (64 mm) planking armoured with longitudinal iron strips. The wheels were cast iron, 29 inches (737 mm) diameter with 4½ inch (114 mm) treads; the <b>wheel</b> <b>treads</b> were conical [...] "so that the diameter close to the flange is 29¾ inches" [...] (756 mm) [...] The axles were 41½ inches (1,054 mm) apart. The brakes were cast iron and fixed to a long wooden lever, acting on both wheels on the same side. The couplings were connecting links 15 inches (381 mm) long.|$|R
2500|$|The train {{stays on}} the track {{by virtue of the}} conical shape of the <b>wheel</b> <b>treads.</b> [...] If a {{wheelset}} is displaced to one side by an amount [...] "y" [...] (the tracking error), the radius of the tread in contact with the rail on one side is reduced, while on the other side it is increased. [...] The angular velocity is the same for both wheels (they are coupled via a rigid axle), so the larger diameter tread speeds up, while the smaller slows down. [...] The wheel set steers around a centre of curvature defined by the intersection of the generator of a cone passing through the points of contact with the wheels on the rails and the axis of the wheel set. Applying similar triangles, we have for the turn radius: ...|$|R
