5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the turuma carried 19 pairs (16 in {{the first}} two ships) of oars with four men per oar. Oarsmen rowed sitting on the <b>weather</b> <b>deck,</b> above the gun deck, with the oarports attached to a rectangular outrigger that was designed to improve the leverage. Despite this, turumas performed poorly under oars and were very difficult to move in any kind of contrary wind. In calm weather the average speed with oars was reported as low as half a knot.|$|E
5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the udema carried 14 to 18 {{pairs of}} oars. Rowers {{sat on the}} <b>weather</b> <b>deck</b> {{on either side of}} the main armament with the oar ports placed on a rectangular outrigger which improved their leverage. However, they were positioned {{on either side of the}} centerline battery and could not row under fire; in action, the udema had to rely on its sails for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|The hemmema's {{design was}} {{very similar to that}} of the turuma. The primary {{difference}} was that the turuma's oarsmen sat on the <b>weather</b> <b>deck</b> above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the gundeck. The later hemmemas were considerably larger, more heavily armed, and of a more robust construction. Glete has described them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs.|$|E

50|$|TSgt John A. Chapman carries Air Force munitions. She {{features}} climate-controlled cocoons on her <b>weather</b> <b>decks</b> which protect additional cargo {{from the}} marine environment. She is {{owned and operated}} by Sealift Incorporated and is under charter to MSC.|$|R
25|$|It {{took nearly}} 20 years until Tarmo was finally restored. In the 1970s and 1980s the Finnish Board of Navigation used its limited funding to {{maintain}} the ship in floating condition and the Maritime Historical Society of Finland tried to raise restoration funds, but despite the preservation efforts the wooden interior fittings and <b>weather</b> <b>decks</b> deteriorated over the years.|$|R
25|$|A closed {{weathertight}} door can seal out spray and periodic minor flow over weather decks, but may leak during immersion. These outward opening doors are useful at <b>weather</b> <b>deck</b> entrances to compartments above the main deck.|$|E
25|$|Calypso's masts were removed, as was {{the funnel}} from the boilers, and a drill hall was erected on her <b>weather</b> <b>deck.</b> Without sail or working boilers {{she could no longer}} go to sea, but was {{permanently}} moored wharfside at the western end of the St. John's harbour.|$|E
25|$|Barøy was {{delivered}} by Trondhjems mekaniske Værksted to Ofotens Dampskibsselskab on 19 August 1929. She {{was a typical}} North-Norwegian local transport, with an open <b>weather</b> <b>deck</b> and configured with two cargo holds, a First Class passenger section in the aft and a Third Class area in the bow. The First Class accommodation included 45 bunks, and the ship was certified to carry a total of 200 passengers.|$|E
25|$|When the Cabinet of Finland allotted {{two million}} Finnish markkas for the {{restoration}} of the old icebreaker, Tarmo was towed to Kotka in November 1990. After her interiors had been extensively documented and photographed, all fittings and furnishing were removed and stored ashore. When Tarmo was drydocked for inspection, her bottom plating was found out to be in surprisingly good condition. The deteriorated <b>weather</b> <b>decks</b> and aftship cabins were completely rebuilt.|$|R
50|$|Equipment {{mounted on}} deck, {{such as the}} ship's wheel, binnacle, fife rails, and so forth, may be collectively {{referred}} to as <b>deck</b> furniture. <b>Weather</b> <b>decks</b> in western designs evolved from having structures fore (forward or front) and aft (rear) of the ship mostly clear; in the 19th century, pilothouses/wheelhouses and deckhouses began to appear, eventually developing into the superstructure of modern ships. Eastern designs developed earlier, with efficient middle decks and minimalist fore and aft cabin structures {{across a range of}} designs.|$|R

25|$|The general {{arrangements}} of Yulius Fuchik were largely {{dictated by the}} cargo handling system. The superstructure, spanning across the <b>weather</b> <b>deck,</b> housed {{only part of the}} ship's accommodation space. The entire crew of 50 was housed in single cabins, most of them located within the narrow side compartments {{on both sides of the}} cargo decks. In addition to normal messes and saloons, the amenities of the ship also included sports and hobby rooms, library, sauna, photographic laboratory and even a swimming pool.|$|E
25|$|After {{rounding}} Cape Horn in January 1849, Niantic {{put into}} Paita (Payta), Peru on March 8, {{and received a}} letter there from the American consul in Panama requesting them to carry passengers from Panama to San Francisco. Large numbers of people (in some accounts referred to as Argonauts) had crossed the Isthmus of Panama and were waiting on the Pacific coast for transportation to California; the gold rush had begun. The vessel was immediately modified to carry passengers {{above and below the}} <b>weather</b> <b>deck.</b> They departed Paita for Panama on 25 March taking 150 mules, barrels of potatoes, a large amount of lumber, and other supplies.|$|E
25|$|Mock bombardments of {{imaginary}} shore {{positions were}} carried out by Prince David in Saanich Inlet, and equally imaginary shore batteries fired back, while movie raiders rowed the ship's boats ashore {{as hard as they}} could. A ship-handling problem peculiar to this operation was that in every scene where Prince David was to appear herself, she could present only her starboard side to the camera. It was calculated that cinema-goers would not likely accept the huge sound truck that had been hoisted aboard, and reposed on the <b>weather</b> <b>deck</b> port side, as a regular item in Combined Operations weaponry. The ship's company co-operated heartily, and kept up a high standard of discipline and war-readiness despite the distractions of this fling with film fame, and the glitter of hob-nobbing with the film famous.|$|E

25|$|In May 2008 SNMM {{revealed}} that some time between October 2007 and April 2008 the Dalarö wreck site had been disturbed. Some items {{had been removed}} while others had been disturbed or damaged. Among the objects that have disappeared so far is the wooden frame of a pistol that was located on the <b>weather</b> <b>deck.</b> The ship is monitored by the coast guard, and the residents of Dalarö have been notified {{to be wary of}} attempts to plunder the wreck. As of 2009, objects recorded by archaeologists have disappeared and the wreck has been disturbed and to some extent damaged. Known wreck sites in the Baltic are inevitably plundered, and there have been public appeals to somehow protect the Dalarö wreck. Though illegal, there is little preventing individuals from performing private covert diving operations in order to bring up objects from the ship in order to sell them on the black market.|$|E
500|$|The {{horizontal}} deck {{protection is}} made of three layers: a [...] STS <b>weather</b> <b>deck</b> (also called [...] "bomb deck"), a combined [...] Class B and STS second deck, and a [...] STS splinter deck over the machinery spaces. Over the magazines, the splinter deck is replaced with a [...] STS third deck.

40|$|Commingled {{recycled}} plastic lumber (RPL) decking {{was exposed to}} the environment for eleven years. The weathering effect is examined by performing mechanical property tests on the full size deck boards {{before and after the}} exposure. Flexural tests on the <b>weathered</b> <b>deck</b> boards were conducted with the exposed side and the unexposed side tested in tension. The flexural proper-ties after weathering are compared to the original flexural properties. These data show the effect of weathering on recycled high-density polyethylene based RPL. A life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) is also presented to compare the cost of a wood deck versus an all RPL deck. The pur-chase, maintenance, and disposal costs are included...|$|R
50|$|In the {{afternoon}} of Monday 22 October, the fore and mizzen masts were cut away {{in an effort to}} prevent the ship working herself to pieces. This was deemed insufficient, for Captain Cornewall had the ship scuttled. That evening the main mast was also cut away as it was feared the ship might overset. With water now filling the ship, the crew were crammed onto the <b>weather</b> <b>decks</b> and bowsprit; on Tuesday morning lots were drawn to decide who could use the ship's longboat to get to safety. In spite of this, the ship's surgeon and 30 others took the longboat whilst the crew were drawing their lots; the boat subsequently sank, drowning 13. Four others who had jumped for the boat but missed were also drowned.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of Eagle embodies centuries of development in the shipbuilder's art. Eagle is slightly larger than her sister ship Gorch Fock. Overall Eagle displaces 1,824 tons. The hull is riveted Krupp steel four-tenths of an inch thick (10 mm). There are two full-length steel decks with a platform deck below. The raised forecastle and quarterdeck are made of quarter inch steel overlaid with 3 in of teak, as are the <b>weather</b> <b>decks.</b> Her current auxiliary diesel engine, at , is also somewhat more powerful than that of Gorch Fock (though Eagles original diesel auxiliary engine managed only [...] ). There are two [...] Caterpillar generators that can be run by themselves or in parallel together. Eagle has a range of 5450 nmi km at her cruising speed of 7.5 kn under diesel power. She carries a reverse osmosis system that replenishes the ship's fresh water supply at sea.|$|R
500|$|The {{waterline}} {{main belt}} of the Kawachi-class ships consisted of Krupp cemented armor {{that had a}} maximum thickness of [...] amidships and tapered to a thickness of [...] inches {{at the ends of}} the ship. Approximately [...] of the belt was above the waterline and [...] below it. Above the belt was a strake of armor [...] thick that covered the side of the hull up to the height of the middle deck. Above that was a [...] strake that protected the casemates. The barbettes for the main guns were [...] thick above the <b>weather</b> <b>deck</b> and [...] below it. The armor of all the 12-inch gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 11 inches with a 3-inch roof. The deck armor was [...] thick and the conning tower was protected by [...] of armor.|$|E
500|$|The whole side of {{the ship}} was {{protected}} by [...] of steel armour, from the bottom edge of the protective deck [...] below the waterline {{to the edge of the}} <b>weather</b> <b>deck.</b> The curved protective deck had a total thickness of [...] and did not rise above the ship's waterline. Protecting the boiler rooms, engine rooms, and magazines below it was a splinter deck [...] thick. The space between the protective and splinter decks could be filled with coal to increase the effective thickness of the ship's armour. It was very cramped there and the coal was very difficult to access. A watertight internal cofferdam, filled with cellulose, ran the length of Dupuy de Lôme from the protective deck to a height of [...] above the waterline. Below the protective deck the ship was divided by 13 watertight transverse bulkheads with three more above the protective deck. The ship's conning tower was protected by [...] and her turrets by 100mm of armour.|$|E
500|$|Above the orlop lay {{the main}} deck which housed the {{heaviest}} guns. The {{side of the}} hull on the main deck level had seven gunports on each side fitted with heavy lids {{that would have been}} watertight when closed. This was also the highest deck that was caulked and waterproof. Along the sides of the main deck there were cabins under the forecastle and sterncastle which have been identified as belonging to the carpenter, barber-surgeon, pilot and possibly also the master gunner and some of the officers. The top deck in the hull structure was the upper deck (or <b>weather</b> <b>deck)</b> which was exposed to the elements in the waist. It was a dedicated fighting deck without any known partitions and a mix of heavy and light guns. Over the open waist the upper deck was entirely covered with a coarse netting as a defence measure against boarding. Though very little of the upper deck has survived, {{it has been suggested that}} it housed the main living quarters of the crew underneath the sterncastle. A drainage located in this area has been identified as a possible [...] "piss-dale", a general urinal to complement the regular toilets that would probably have been located in the bow.|$|E
5000|$|On 1945-08-29, Admiral Halsey {{arrived in}} Sagami Wan. Two POWs rescued earlier {{from the beach}} {{convinced}} him to start the POW rescue operations that day. [...] "That evening, {{for the first time}} since Pearl Harbor, the ships of the Third Fleet were illuminated. As General Metzger later remembered: 'Word was passed to illuminate ship, but owing to the long wartime habit of always darkening ship at night, no ship would take the initiative in turning their lights on. Finally, after the order had been repeated a couple of times lights went on. It was a wonderful picture with all the ships flying large battle flags both at the foretruck and the stern. In the background was snowcapped Mount Fuji.' Movies were shown on the <b>weather</b> <b>decks.</b> While the apprehension of some lessened, lookouts were still posted, radars continued to search, and the ships remained on alert." ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} weeks the ship proceeds through the Suez Canal, which is luckily open, and travels through treacherous seas in the Indian Ocean as nuclear winter {{begins to take}} full effect, with dramatic temperature drops and black snow at the equator. They notice a pattern where the amount of fallout increases {{with the size of}} nearby landmasses. Approaching Singapore, the fallout becomes so dense that the crew cannot go onto the <b>weather</b> <b>decks.</b> Luckily, the Nathan James was designed with cold weather and fallout in mind and Thomas orders the ship hermetically sealed and people stationed on the bridge in short rotations. Despite this, the crew suffers from mild radiation sickness and their passage through the dense fallout becomes so trying on them psychologically that many crew vanish overboard. Things get even more bleak when they lose contact with the Soviet submarine, assuming she, with the nuclear fuel, was lost while scouting the Soviet coastline.|$|R
500|$|The Cyclops-class {{ships and}} other ships of her type were {{described}} by Admiral George Alexander Ballard as being like [...] "full-armoured knights riding on donkeys, easy to avoid but bad to close with."

500|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Dresden began to sink at 13:50. Her wreck lies to this day on her port side {{at the bottom of}} Scapa Flow to the south east of the island of Cava, in a depth of [...] Her upper decks have been badly damaged; her <b>weather</b> <b>deck</b> has fallen off, exposing her internal structure. Her guns are buried in mud. In 2017, marine archaeologists from the Orkney Research Center for Archaeology conducted extensive surveys of Dresden and nine other wrecks in the area, including six other German and three British warships. The archaeologists mapped the wrecks with sonar and examined them with remotely operated underwater vehicles {{as part of an effort}} to determine how the wrecks are deteriorating.|$|E
500|$|Pennsylvania and Arizona {{were given}} {{extensive}} modernizations from 1929 through 1931; the expenditure {{came in the}} fiscal year 1930. As part of the rebuilding, Pennsylvania, which had been designed as a fleet flagship, had its conning tower expanded. Aside from that, Pennsylvania and Arizona received similar treatment: the elevation of the main batteries was increased to °, new fire control systems on tripod masts were added, the secondary armament and directors were replaced and overhauled, eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns (four per side) were mounted on the <b>weather</b> <b>deck</b> which was above the secondary anti-ship 5-inch gun battery, and their bridges were enlarged to hold elevated anti-aircraft directors. Armor additions were comparatively minimal beyond anti-torpedo bulges, which were standard additions on all major warships in this period: [...] of armor were added to the second armored deck, and a torpedo bulkhead was added to the engine room. The propulsion system of the two Pennsylvanias received perhaps the most attention. The boiler system was entirely replaced with six small-tube boilers and new turbines, the latter partially from the canceled [...] battleship [...] The new machinery allowed the ships to come close to their old design speed of , even with the added bulk of bulges: Pennsylvania made 20.89knots and Arizona 20.7knots on full-power trials.|$|E
500|$|As designed, the Montanas {{used the}} [...] "all or nothing" [...] armor philosophy, {{with most of}} the armor {{concentrated}} on the citadel that includes the machinery spaces, armament, magazines, and command and control facilities. Unlike the previous Iowa-class, the Montana-class design returned to an external armor belt due to the greater beam providing sufficient stability while having the required belt inclination; this arrangement would have made construction and damage repairs much easier. The belt armor would be [...] Class A face-hardened Krupp cemented (K.C.) armor mounted on [...] Special Treatment Steel (STS), inclined at 19 degrees.

500|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the absence of a perceived threat to the United States came drastic cuts in the defense budget. The high cost of maintaining and operating battleships as part of the United States Navy's active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, Wisconsin was decommissioned on 30 September 1991 after 14 total years of active service, and joined the Reserve Fleet at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. [...] She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register (NVR) on 12 January 1995, then on 15 October 1996, she was moved to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and on 12 February 1998, she was restored to the Naval Vessel Register.
