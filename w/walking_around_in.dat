500|$|Julian Jarrold's and Sam Mendes' {{producer}} approached Christopher Priest for {{an adaptation}} of his novel The Prestige. [...] Priest was impressed with Nolan's films Following and Memento, and subsequently, producer Valerie Dean brought the book to Nolan's attention. In October 2000, Nolan traveled to the United Kingdom to publicize Memento, as Newmarket Films was having difficulty finding a United States distributor. While in London, Nolan read Priest's book and shared the story with his brother while <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> <b>in</b> Highgate (a location later featured in the scene where Angier ransoms Borden's ingénieur in Highgate Cemetery). [...] The development process for The Prestige began as a reversal of their earlier collaboration: [...] Jonathan Nolan had pitched his initial story for Memento to his brother during a road trip.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's 2007–08 season {{finished}} trophyless but {{the opportunity}} to win honours awaited Alonso {{in the form of}} the Euro 2008 tournament. Alonso featured mainly as a substitute but, with key players resting, he captained Spain in the final group game against Greece, earning the man of the match award. Despite a strong performance, he could not attain a starting position in the team, highlighting Spain's strength in depth. Spain went on to win the tournament and he featured in four of Spain's six matches. Speaking to Spanish journalist Guillem Balagué, he said that Spain's victory was deserved and the players' teamwork had been crucial to the team's undefeated run in the tournament. The Basque was ecstatic at the achievement, declaring, [...] "Right now, we're all just living the moment. It's incredible and we're all <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> <b>in</b> a dream. It's fantastic." [...] Alonso's international success continued as he scored twice in a 3–0 win in a friendly against Denmark in August.|$|E

2500|$|Two Air Commando H-19 pilots {{received}} the Silver Star and Distinguished Flying Crosses from an attempted rescue mission described in their citations as [...] "the deepest helicopter {{penetration of the}} Korean War". [...] Taking off from Cho-do Island {{in the early morning}} hours, Captain Frank J.

[...] At first light, the helicopter was 16 miles south of the Chinese border and within ten minutes flying time of the Chinese MiG fighter base at Antung, the largest Chinese fighter base in North Korea. [...] Racing inland they discovered the valley the downed pilot was reported to be in, {{which turned out to be}} a massive camouflage supply and troop depot. The valley contained at least a regiment of troops, all armed and firing as fast as they could. [...] The hills looked like a large warehouse, piles of equipment and supplies under camouflage nets.

[...] Carlo Santos of Anime News Network, in reviewing the manga, noted Tsukune's character design as lazy: [...] "shove in any other male protagonist from a harem series and nobody would notice too much". He found the girls [...] "distinctive, if predictable (the beauty, the boobs, the jailbait)", but concluded in a later volume that [...] "The story's never going to go anywhere, the characters {{are never going to}} go anywhere, and the artwork is always going to have that same polished-but-flawed look." [...] Stig Høgset of THEM Anime Reviews found Moka to be ditzy and a [...] "pink-haired dolt"; he criticized her lack of vampire weaknesses such as <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> <b>in</b> broad daylight at a beach, but found her alternate personality as [...] "pretty damn badass", [...] "a great addition to the show, if a severely underutilized one", and wished that her character was developed better. Deb Aoki of About.com called Moka a magical ditz who loves the doofus but also kicks butt. Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk noted that Kokoa is not another character that has a massive crush on the same guy; however, Høgset noted that her anime role was reduced to obnoxious comedy acts.|$|E
