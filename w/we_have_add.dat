40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss our {{research}} into the use of optimistic methods for general purpose parallel computing. The optimistic execution of a program can allow code to be run in parallel which static program analysis might indicate was sequential. However, this also means that it may do some work which is later found to be wrong because of a causality violation. Optimistic methods use a detection and recovery approach: causality errors are detected, and a roll-back mechanism is invoked to recover. These techniques have been used very successfully in parallel discrete event simulation, but are not as yet widely used in general purpose computing. Our research involves {{the development of a}} compiler which converts a conventional objectoriented program into a form which has calls to an optimistic run time system. The generation of time-stamps which allow for loops with an unknown number of iterations is discussed. We also describe some of the portability issues which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>add</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Low energy {{electrons}} (often {{referred to}} as "electron clouds") in the beam chambers of high intensity accelerators and storage rings can limit their performance. They can limit intensity by causing instabilities, unacceptable pressure increases or increases in beam size. Thus, reliable simulations of electron cloud generation in the Los Alamos high intensity Proton Storage Ring (PSR) and similar machines would be a most valuable tool for improving our understanding of its origin, the parameters that affect it and {{how it might be}} controlled. Such tools would provide cost-effective methods for designing mitigation measures and evaluating them before going to the expense of fabrication and experimental testing in an operating accelerator facility. In this project we have developed and tested several significant improvements to a widely used electron cloud simulation code, POSINST. In our version, LANLPOSINST V 6, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>add</b> several important features including the capability to model a multi-element section of the ring consisting of two quadrupole magnets with 3 -dimensional magnetic fields, dipole magnet end fields, several drift spaces and various electron cloud diagnostics. Improvements were also added to the modeling of the initial primary or Ã¢ÂÂseedÃ¢ÂÂ electrons from proton beam losses. One important conclusion from benchmarking these improvements was the need to include Ã¢ÂÂseedÃ¢ÂÂ electrons produced from secondary particles resulting from the primary proton beam losses...|$|E
40|$|Máster Universitario en Sistemas Inteligentes y Aplicaciones Numéricas en Ingeniería (SIANI) [EN] The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work is to perform a system that uses optical flow for detecting and monitoring one or more objects in a sequence of images, including depth ones,to design an application that can differentiate between the moving objects in the sequence and that can follow their trajectories. In this sense, we uses an implementation of a well-known optical flow method that uses isotropic TV-L 1 regularization and two variants of this approximation. These variants arise to improve the rounded effects that typically produces this smoothing strategy. Thus, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>add,</b> in the original implementation, a decreasing function in the regularization term to inhibit the diffusion at high image gradients, where the flow discontinuities are located. This second approach presents a good contours definition that mitigate the rounded effects. However,it may produce some instabilities in the optical flow. To cope with this situation, a third implementation {{has been made to}} ameliorate this problem using a constant value in the decreasing function that assures a minimum isotropic diffusion to prevent these instabilities. On the other hand, once studied the displacement fields reached by depth images and seen their results, it has been developed a program that creates a new type of image that mixes the depth information and its corresponding mask. This creates a new image richer in details than the original. Thus, the optical flow calculation is favored. Building on the accuracy of these methods, it has been implemented different applications: (i) a system that generate videos matching the original sequence with its respective flow field (ii) a tracking system that follows an area selected by the user (iii) a more complex tracking system that follows different areas in the scene, (iv) a system to segment the moving objects in the scene (v) a system that mixes the depth images and their mask information...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Process and {{workflow}} {{technology have}} traditionally not al-lowed for the specication of, nor run-time enforcement of, real-time requirements, {{despite the fact}} that time-to-market and other real-time constraints are more stringent than ever. Without specication of timing constraints, process designers cannot eectively reason about real-time constraints on process programs and the ecacy of their process pro-grams in satisfying those constraints. Furthermore, without executable semantics for those timing specications, such reasoning might not be applicable to the process as actually executed. We seek to support rea-soning about the real-time requirements of software processes. In this paper, we describe work in which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>added</b> real-time specications to a process programming language, and in which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>added</b> dead-line timers and task scheduling to enforce the real-time requirements of processes. ...|$|R

50|$|One proves this {{condition}} {{by the following}} procedure: we may add to the theory a gauge field which couples to the current related with this symmetry, as well as chiral fermions which couple only to this gauge field, and cancel the anomaly (so that the gauge symmetry will remain non-anomalous, as needed for consistency).In the limit where the coupling constants <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>added</b> go to zero, one gets {{back to the original}} theory, plus the fermions <b>we</b> <b>have</b> added; the latter remain good degrees of freedom at every energy scale, as they are free fermions at this limit.
