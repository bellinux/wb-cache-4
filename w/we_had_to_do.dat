25|$|We {{did some}} rather audacious things. We shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there. And we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E
500|$|... {{was a fun}} song to do. Mariah {{brought me}} 'Genius of Love' and I laid some strings on {{it and put it}} into a groove I felt really fit and {{highlighted}} her voice. And that song didn't take us but a minute to do, because she really busted that out within two days. We did a rough copy and let Tommy Mottola hear it and he loved it, so all <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was bring it back in and mix it.|$|E
500|$|For most of Bullock's shots, she {{was placed}} inside a giant, {{mechanical}} rig. Getting into the rig took {{a significant amount}} of time, so Bullock chose to stay in it for up to 10 hours a day, communicating with others through a headset. Costume Designer Jany Temime said the spacesuits were fictitious – [...] "no space suit opens up at the front – but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that in order for her to get out. So I had to redesign it and readapt all the functions of the suit for front opening." ...|$|E

500|$|Aaron Douglas, who portrays Galen Tyrol, {{attempted}} an ad lib {{on one of}} his scenes. On {{that particular}} scene, Tyrol told the Viper pilots in the hangar, [...] "Let's go, nuggets! Your mommas aren't going to save ya today." [...] In one take, Douglas replaced this with [...] "drop your dicks and grab your sticks!" [...] According to Douglas, [...] "five seconds later Harvey [...] (producer) says from video village, 'you can't say dicks on TV'. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it again. [...] It's great to be back but it's sad to see it go." ...|$|E
500|$|Love Always was {{the first}} album K-Ci & JoJo {{produced}}. Referring to DeVante Swing, who produced many of Jodeci's songs, K-Ci told Billboard, [...] "We couldn't just say, 'Oh, DeVante's gonna make sure it's mixed right.' <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Other contributors to the album included Rory Bennett, James Mtume, Jorge Corante, Mike Smoov, Fred Rosser, Jeff Redd, Joey Wlias, Laney Stewart, Gerald Baillergeau, DeVante Swing, Derrick Garrett, Craig Brockman, Victor Merrit, Jon-John Robinson, Andrew Braxton, and Bradley Spalter. Mike Smoov, Jimi Randolph, Derrick Garrett, Thom Cadley, and Mikael Ifverson engineered the album.|$|E
500|$|Another VFX {{supervisor}} from Zoic Studios, Andrew Orloff, {{believed the}} episode's special effects were {{possibly the most}} difficult of the season. He wrote, [...] "Originally, {{it was supposed to be}} a practical effect but they couldn't get it to fall in a natural way, so what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we put them all together and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG. So we took a cyberscan of the guy's body, and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base, we had a matte painting, a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body, 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out, 3D particles of small ash bits floating down, residual dust flying off of it and, at one point, his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash. So <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a full-CG head and tumble it down the body. That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R there was 2D work in After Effects, tracking, retiming, we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya/mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software, and rendered in Maya/mental ray." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Scott {{made his}} first {{appearance}} as Jim Moriarty in [...] "The Great Game". Moffat said, [...] "We knew {{what we wanted to}} do with Moriarty from the very beginning. Moriarty is usually a rather dull, rather posh villain so we thought someone who was genuinely properly frightening. Someone who's an absolute psycho." [...] Moffat and Gatiss were originally not going to put a confrontation between Moriarty and Holmes into these three episodes, but realised that they [...] "just had to do a confrontation scene. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a version of the scene in 'The Final Problem' in which the two archenemies meet each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Cavallo {{was chosen}} as the main {{producer}} of the album, with Jerry Finn as the mixer. Green Day originally gave the first demo tape to Cavallo, and after listening to it during the car ride home he sensed that [...] " [...] had stumbled on something big." [...] The band's recording session lasted three weeks and the album was remixed twice. Armstrong claimed that the band wanted to create a dry sound, [...] "similar to the Sex Pistols' album or first Black Sabbath albums." [...] The band felt the original mix to be unsatisfactory. Cavallo agreed, and it was remixed at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California. Armstrong later said of their studio experience, [...] "Everything was already written, all <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was play it." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1999, Jimmy Eat World {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Clarity, through Capitol Records. The label started to shelve the album {{until a few}} key radio stations started playing the song [...] "Lucky Denver Mint." [...] After Capitol Records decided not to release their next major-label album, the band left the label. At that time, Jimmy Eat World distributed their albums independently while on tour in Europe. Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, {{that was sort of}} a good thing, because it let us take control of what we needed to do. We learned <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it ourselves, because no one else would do it for us." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's {{hard to see}} why we were cast as the first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something stupid and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't {{want to go back to}} playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} at Record Two Studio in Comptche, California. While recording the song, {{it began to}} develop differently from the original vision. Pike stated that the [...] "song was getting slower and slower and then it got weird. We started tripping out and second guessing ourselves." [...] Recording the album was difficult. Pike recalled that [...] "there was so much to memorize for that album, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it in like three different sections because a reel-to-reel only holds 22 minutes. It was really cool, {{but it was one}} of the hardest things I've ever done in in my life." [...] Sleep were in the studio for one month then went home to rehearse and returned for another month. Pike noted that they ended up with two or three different versions of the song.|$|E
500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could {{keep an eye out for}} her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Jam stated, [...] "We required that they put her in our hands. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it on our turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson's people hanging around making suggestions." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. [...] "There's a little radiator I used to sit on when we did the Control album," [...] Jackson recalled in 1993. John McClain served as the executive producer.|$|E

500|$|Completing {{the main}} cast, Patrick Wymark stars as Jason Webb, {{director}} of EUROSEC. Having selected {{him on the}} basis of his performance as John Wilder in the television series The Plane Makers (1963–65) and The Power Game (1965–70), Anderson stated that Wymark's acting impressed him as much as Hendry's, but also that his similar drinking habits resulted in slurred lines on set. During the filming of one scene, Wymark [...] "had to list these explanations... and on take after take he couldn't remember that 'two' followed 'one'. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it over and over again." [...] Archer and Hearn identify Wymark's portrayal of Webb, a character described as [...] "John Wilder (2069 model)" [...] in publicity material, as the dominant performance of the film. The draft script describes Webb as a former British Minister of Technology, who is now romantically involved with his secretary, Pam Kirby.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented {{students}} needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them {{in understanding the}} forms of composition; give them {{a year or two}} of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, [...] "I will speak, and you will listen. Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work." [...] Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. [...] "Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to do our work well." ...|$|E
500|$|Visual Effects Supervisor Tim Burke {{said that}} [...] "It {{was such a}} major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it in {{different}} stages of production. We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge {{at the end of}} 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "It's taken two years– getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas." ...|$|E

500|$|NBC Entertainment President Jeff Zucker {{announced}} at the annual Television Critics Association news tour in January 2003, that singer Madonna would be appearing in an episode of Will & Grace. On March 18, Madonna taped her appearance. While taping [...] "Dolls and Dolls", Madonna recalled {{the first time she}} made her way on the set, the studio audience [...] "cheered so hard" [...] that she had to make her entrance all over again. [...] "I had to wait too long to say my first line, so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it over." [...] Madonna's role in the show made it her episodic television series debut. Her decision to do the show was due to her being a [...] "big fan". In an interview with the entertainment news program Access Hollywood, the singer revealed that her manager gave her tapes of the show to watch. She liked the show and called it [...] "hysterical" [...] with [...] "really good writing". She most enjoyed actress Megan Mullally's character Karen, and said she would do the show if her scenes were with her.|$|E
500|$|On January 1, 2013, will.i.am {{said that}} he would release a club remix of [...] "Scream & Shout" [...] {{featuring}} American rapper Waka Flocka Flame and producer Hit-Boy. An early version of the remix was leaked on January 25, 2013. The remix features Waka Flocka Flame, Hit-Boy, and rappers Diddy and Lil Wayne. Following the leak, will.i.am uploaded the finished version to his YouTube account. It was released for digital download on January 29, 2013. Because it is significantly different from the original version, the remix was tracked separately on the Billboard charts. On the week ending February 16, 2013, it debuted at number 49 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs. An accompanying music video was filmed in Los Angeles, California on January 23, 2013, and will.i.am said that the remix is [...] "so freaking fresh that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a video for it." [...] The video was due to premiere on February 15, 2013 at BET's 106 & Park. However, the day before its planned release it was leaked online through Youku, and was therefore uploaded to VEVO the same day.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{director}} and choreographer Ortega {{stated that the}} rehearsal footage and concept of making a film to document {{the preparation of the}} concerts had come about as [...] "an accident". Ortega stated the film was pieced together from [...] "private footage", shot by documentarians Sandrine Orabona and Tim Patterson of Jackson, and that before Jackson's death, was never intended to be released to the public, or even in general. [...] "The recordings were made so we could use them, then the tapes were destined for Michael 's private library. They have a real unguarded honesty to them." [...] Ortega stated that he had gotten the idea to use the rehearsal footage from Jackson's fans after his death: [...] "At first I got so many messages from fans around the world asking to see the shows, asking to see the footage and eventually I realized the journey wasn't over and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this", and Ortega also stated that the film was made only for the Jackson fans: [...] " [...] is for the fans and the film will show the development and intentions of the show, and the concert as it moved closer to London." ...|$|E
