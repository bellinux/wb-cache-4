40|$|The {{abundance}} of 3 He {{in the present}} day local interstellar cloud (LIC) and in the sun {{has important implications for}} the study of galactic evolution and for estimating the production of light nuclei in the early universe. Data from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) on Ulysses is used to measure the isotopic ratio of helium (3 He/ 4 He = Γ) both in the solar wind and the local interstellar cloud. For the solar wind, the unique high-latitude orbit of Ulysses allows us to study this ratio in the slow and highly dynamic wind in the ecliptic plane as well as the steady high-latitude wind of the polar coronal holes. The 3 He+/ 4 He+ ratio in the local cloud is derived from the isotopic ratio of pickup helium measured in the high-speed solar wind. In the LIC the ratio is found to be (2. 48 - 0. 62 + 0. 68) × 10 - 4 with the 1 -σ uncertainty resulting almost entirely from statistical error. In the solar wind, Γ is determined with great statistical accuracy but shows systematic differences between fast and slow solar wind streams. The slow <b>wind</b> <b>ratio</b> is variable. Its weighted average value (4. 08 ± 0. 25) × 10 - 4 is, within uncertainties, in agreement with the Apollo SWC results. The high <b>wind</b> <b>ratio</b> is less variable but smaller.

However, there have only been a very limited number of studies on the effects of residential area building layout on the winter wind environments, which led to a lack of quantitative guidance for residential area planning in severely cold regions.

Four years of daily weather observations from Central Tunisia {{were available for}} testing {{the application of the}} Penman Equation to estimate reference evapotranspiration in the arid climate of Central Tunisia. The data included minimum and maximum temperature, minimum and maximum relative humidity, 24 -hour wind run, and lysimeter measurements of reference ET from Kasserine weather station. Solar radiation was extrapolated from a nearby weather station. Day/Night <b>wind</b> <b>ratio</b> had to be assumed. A computer program named PENMAN was developed to use these data with the Penman Equation including the Wright and Jensen, FAO and Wright wind functions to estimate reference ET. A diskette holding this program and data files accompanies this thesis. Statistical, graphical and relative error analyses were performed to compare measured and estimated values of ET. The results of this study indicated that all three versions of the Penman Equation overestimated low values and underestimated high values of ET in Central Tunisia. A five day average was found to considerably improve the relationship between measured and estimated ET. Calibration coefficients have been derived to adjust calculated ET in Central Tunisia. This calibration has been tested and showed unbiased results. Cumulative ET analysis showed that the Penman equation estimated ET fairly well. Of the three wind functions, the FAO wind function was selected "best" to estimate ET in Central Tunisia. The analysis of the validity of the wind function for high wind conditions showed that it did not significantly improve the model performance under high wind conditions, and limiting the wind speed at less than 200 Km/day may even reduce that accuracy...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{estimate}} the reference evapotranspiration of screenhouse-grown crops (ETo,in) from routine outside weather data and main screenhouse characteristics. To this aim, all the microclimatic variables required to calculate ETo,in by means of the standard FAO- 56 Penman-Monteith formula were measured under three cultivated (sweet-pepper, spring-summer cycle) screenhouses for a two months period observation (Aug-Sept 2012) in a Mediterranean climate (Eastern Central Greece). The screenhouses differed in transmittance to solar radiation (tau) and <b>wind</b> <b>ratio</b> (omega = ratio of inside-to-outside wind speed) : (i) a pearl insect-proof screen (IP- 1, tau approximate to 0. 76, omega approximate to 0. 19), (ii) a white insect proof screen (IP- 2, tau approximate to 0. 58, omega approximate to 0. 20), and (iii) a green shade-screen (GS, tau approximate to 0. 56 and omega approximate to 0. 43). We quantified and analysed at daily scale the evolution of the radiative (ETrad,in) and advective (ETadv,in) components of ETo,in, ETrad,in and ETadv,in were expressed {{as a function of the}} corresponding outside values (ETrad,out and ETadv,out) through two reduction ratios (zeta(rad) = ETrad,in/ETrad,out and zeta(adv) = ETadv,in/ETadv,out). zeta(rad) and zeta(adv) could be expressed as linear functions of tau and omega respectively. Based on this finding, we proposed an additive model of the form ETo,in = zeta(rad) ETrad,out + zeta(adv) ETadv,out. The predictive performance of the model was fair (RMSE = 0. 11 mm day(- 1)). The proposed model, based only on outside climate data and the knowledge of two screenhouse-related parameters, provides a straightforward way to estimate screenhouse ETo, a necessary step towards the determination of screenhouse-crops water requirements.

This invention uses additional transformers to achieve the needed gain. The prior art uses stronger drivers (which require an IC redesign and a higher power supply voltage), or the addition of another active component (which can decrease reliability, increase power consumption, reduce the beneficial effect of serializer/deserializer preemphasis or deemphasis, and/or interfere with fault containment mechanisms), or uses a different transformer <b>winding</b> <b>ratio</b> (which requires redesign of the transformer and may not be feasible with high-speed signals that require a 1 : 1 <b>winding</b> <b>ratio).</b> This invention achieves the required gain by connecting the secondaries of multiple transformers in series.

There is also a need to split a receive signal to multiple destinations with minimal signal loss. Additional transformers can achieve the split. The prior art uses impedance-matching series resistors that cause a loss of signal. Instead of causing a loss, most instantiations of this invention would actually provide gain. Multiple transformers are used instead of multiple windings on a single transformer because multiple windings on the same transformer would require a redesign of the transformer, and may not be feasible with high-speed transformers that usually require a bifilar winding with a 1 : 1 ratio.

40|$|D. Ing. The {{technique}} {{of using a}} live power cable to simultaneously transport a communication signal, has been practiced since the early 1900 ’s. In most cases, power-line communications has been implemented as a retrofit technology, with its main benefit being the utilization of a ‘free’ existing network. This driving force of power-line communications is typical for high-, medium-, and low-voltage distribution networks, as well as intra-building networks currently targeted for home automation and home networking. Researchers have thus focused on the optimum use of these existing power-line channels, often accepting the inherent drawbacks of this hostile communication channel. Apart from unpredictable noise sources, two main disadvantages of the low-voltage powerline network as a communication channel, are i) the unknown power cable characteristics and topology and ii) time-dependent fluctuation of the power-line impedance level as loads are unpredictable switched into, {{and out of the}} network. These two factors have obscured the requirements for proper coupling and impedance adaptation to the degree that most researchers and manufacturers have merely accepted this typical ≈ 20 -dB coupling loss as one of the inherited disadvantages of the power-line channel. Most researchers and manufacturers have thus defaulted to a guessed power-line impedance level, and have used one fixed coupler <b>winding</b> <b>ratio</b> under all circumstances, regardless of power-line conditions. This study has shown that proper coupling and impedance adaptation can yield significant transmission gains even with limited (qualitative) knowledge of a power-line channel and its topology. After formulating design steps for an impedance-adapting coupler that facilitates bidirectional transmission, the impact of the fluctuating power-line impedance on coupler bandwidth was investigated. Next, impedance adaptation strategies were considered and the tradeoff between series cable requirements and parallel load requirements was explored. A model of sufficient simplicity was developed to facilitate qualitative description and classification of power outlets – functioning as communication nodes. Very interesting simulation results were obtained and these were verified using a laboratory setup of characterized power cables and calibrated loads. Next, these simulation results were employed to improve power-line transmission over a live, uncharacterized 220 -V residential network by means of i) classifying typical residential rooms qualitatively in order to choose proper coupler <b>winding</b> <b>ratios</b> and ii) using an innovative dual coupler for dedicated on-off switching with harsh loads, thereby mitigating the fluctuating impact of said loads on low-voltage power-line communications...|$|R
