The thrush is literally spreading the seeds of his own destruction.|$|E
5|$|Mid-19th century Navajo rugs {{often used}} a three-ply yarn called Saxony, <b>which</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> high-quality, {{naturally}} dyed, silky yarns. Red tones in Navajo rugs {{of this period}} come either from Saxony or from a raveled cloth known in Spanish as bayeta, which was a woolen manufactured in England. With {{the arrival of the}} railroad in the early 1880s, another machine-produced yarn came into use in Navajo weaving: four-ply aniline dyed yarn known as Germantown because the yarn was manufactured in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|The {{locality}} where Batrachotomus lived was a swampy {{region and}} the name comes from the Greek batrachos/βάτραχος (frog) and tome/τομή (cutting, slicing), <b>which</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> its preying on the large amphibian Mastodonsaurus. In contrast with sprawling reptiles, like crocodiles, this large carnivore was very agile with locomotor superiority due to its erect stance. A remarkable feature seen on its back was a row of paired, flattened bony plates. Batrachotomus was possibly an early relative of Postosuchus, which lived during {{the dawn of the}} dinosaurs.|$|E

Chain 2 was written for Anne-Sophie Mutter (commissioned by Paul Sacher), and for Mutter he also orchestrated his slightly earlier Partita for violin and piano, providing a new linking Interlude, so that when played together the Partita, Interlude and Chain 2 form his longest work.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an impromptu}} {{performance}} together in Los Angeles, Hughes and Bonamassa started the side project in November 2009, recruiting Bonham and Sherinian {{on the advice}} of Shirley to finalise the lineup of the band. The name Black Country Communion is derived from the term Black Country, <b>which</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> the West Midlands area of England where Hughes and Bonham grew up. The group's sound is intentionally reminiscent of popular classic rock groups of the 1970s, reflecting the previous work of frontman Hughes (in bands such as Trapeze and Deep Purple) as well as the link between Bonham and his father John's band Led Zeppelin.|$|E
5|$|Fu: Fu were Chinese tally sticks made of bamboo, wood, metal (gold, silver, bronze) or jade {{and used}} as a proof of authorization. Most commonly, fu were made of wood or bamboo in sizes of wooden slips or bamboo chopsticks. Although fu {{have been made in}} various shapes (such as tiger, dragon, turtle, snake, fish or human), most of them come {{in the shape of a}} tiger. Classical {{description}} of tallies is found in the Zhou li, <b>which</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> the tallies of jade and horn, and mentions the shapes of tiger, human, dragon, seal, and banner.|$|E

5|$|Hananu's {{subordinate}} {{officers and}} rank-and-file fighters were all Sunni Muslims, but were ethnically heterogeneous. Hananu {{himself was a}} Kurd as were field commanders Najib Uwaid and Abdullah ibn Umar, while Umar al-Bitar was an Arab and field commander Sha'ban Agha was a Turk. The ′isabat led by al-Bitar and al-Qassam were dominated by Arabs. The localized nature of the revolt reflected the rebels' sense of defending their homeland and community. Despite the eventual organization of the revolt and coordination between rebel commanders for major military decisions, most political decisions and military operations were local initiatives. As such, al-Sa'dun referred to the revolt in the plural as thawrat al-Shimal (Northern revolts) rather than the singular thawra, and referred to {{the leadership of the}} revolt as the plural quwwad al-thawra rather than qiyadat al-thawra, <b>which</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> a central command.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, the {{nameplate}} {{capacity of a}} photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), <b>which</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> the solar array's DC power output. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in MWAC; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. A third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus mahafaliensis was {{described}} as a new species in the second 2009 paper by Goodman and colleagues. The specific name is derived from the Malagasy word Mahafaly, <b>which</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> the Mahafaly Plateau, where the specimen has been recorded, and to the Mahafaly ethnic group of the region. Analysis of sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene suggested that M.brachytragos is most closely related to another Malagasy species, M.sororculus. Although samples of M.mahafaliensis differed from each other by a maximum of 2.2% in their cytochrome b, Goodman and colleagues could not discern any phylogeographic structure within the species.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule, a {{detached}} fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Ploče Gate was built {{to the east of}} the city in 1462. The name Revelin derives from rivelino (ravelin), a term in military architecture <b>which</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> work built opposite the city gate in order to afford better protection from enemy attack. Danger of Venetian assault suddenly increased in the times of the First Holy League, and it was necessary to strengthen this vulnerable point of the city fortifications. The Senate hired Antonio Ferramolino, an experienced builder of fortresses {{in the service of the}} Spanish admiral Doria, a trusted friend of the Republic. In 1538 the Senate approved his drawings of the new, much stronger Revelin Fortress. It took 11 years to build it, and during that time all other construction work in the city had stopped in order to finish this fortress as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} fifty-nine {{different}} {{managers in the}} team's franchise history: four while it {{was known as the}} Cincinnati Red Stockings (1882–1889), four while it was known as the Cincinnati Redlegs (1953–1958) and the other fifty-one under the Cincinnati Reds (18821952, 1959–present). In baseball, the head coach of a team is called the manager, or more formally, the field manager. Pop Snyder was the first manager of the Reds and managed from 1882 to 1884. Sparky Anderson is the franchise's all-time leader in regular-season games managed (1,450) and regular-season game wins (863). He is followed by Bill McKechnie in both categories with 1,386 and 744, respectively. Anderson is the only Reds manager to have won the World Series twice, in 1975 and 1976. Pat Moran, Lou Piniella, and McKechnie have one World Series victory each; Moran was the manager during the Black Sox Scandal, <b>which</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> the events {{that took place in the}} 1919 World Series. McKechnie led the team to the championship in 1940, while Piniella led the team to it in 1990. Jack McKeon is the only manager to have won the Manager of the Year Award with the Reds, which he won in 1999. The most recent manager of the Reds is Bryan Price, and the current owner is Robert Castellini.|$|E
5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College <b>which</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E
