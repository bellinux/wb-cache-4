5|$|A Bosman {{transfer}} to Portsmouth followed after three successful seasons at the Berkshire-based club. Initially, Primus struggled {{to break into}} the team and had his progress hindered by injuries. But the 2002–03 season signaled a change in direction as Primus broke into the first team and won Portsmouth fan's player of the season as well as the PFA Fans' Player of the Year for his division. For the next three seasons Primus <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the first team and worked under three managers: Harry Redknapp, Velimir Zajec and Alain Perrin. The 2006–07 season was the last injury-free season for Primus as a career-threatening knee injury meant he would not make an appearance the following season. Primus went out on loan to former club Charlton and made 10 appearances and one further appearance for Portsmouth before retiring through injury in December 2009. The Milton End stand at Fratton Park was renamed the 'Linvoy Primus Community Stand' because of his outstanding services to the club.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, Ebsary gained {{selection}} to the Australian national team and made her One Day International (ODI) debut in the home series against India. She made 37 runs at 18.50, and after scoring 207 runs in the WNCL season, was retained in the national team. After making her ODI top-score of 86 in the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand, she was selected for the 2009 World Cup, but <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the team, making 106 runs at 35.33. In June 2009, she played in all of Australia's matches at the 2009 World Twenty20 and made her Test debut against England in a bilateral series after the World Twenty20. Ebsary scored 211 runs during the 2009–10 WNCL season to retain her position in the national squad for the Rose Bowl series, but after a series of poor performances, she spent {{the latter half of the}} campaign watching from the sidelines.|$|E
5|$|Barber {{was born}} on 18 April 1901 in Cleckheaton, Yorkshire. He did not appear for the Yorkshire Second XI until he was 25, in 1926, when he scored 600 runs, {{including}} a century, and averaged 40. The same season, he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Worcestershire without playing a single innings. He was scheduled to bat later in the innings and was not needed to bat as Yorkshire completed an easy victory. In the next season, he was chosen to play three matches, with a top score of 18. For the next few years, {{he was unable to}} attain a regular spot in the Yorkshire side as there were many batsmen competing for places. In the 1928 season, Barber played 16 matches, mainly when other batsmen were required in representative matches, passing fifty {{for the first time in}} an innings of 98 against the West Indians, and followed this with two other fifties. Next season, he scored his maiden first-class century against the South Africans in an innings of 108, out of a team total of 335, with no other batsman reaching fifty. In total, he played on 22 occasions and scored 857 runs at an average of 30.60, including a second century, against Glamorgan. However, Barber <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the side over the next two seasons. He did not play 20 matches or reach 500 runs in either season and passed fifty only four times in total.|$|E

5|$|Colpoys {{immediately}} {{ordered his}} squadron to give chase and at 12:00 the strange ships {{were identified as}} a squadron of French frigates. The French ships were the 36-gun Gloire, Gentille and Fraternité, led by Captain Beens of Gloire and on a three-month raiding cruise from Brest in the Bay of Biscay that had so-far been uneventful: the only prize taken had been a small Spanish merchant brig. Beens quickly discovered the danger his squadron <b>was</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> gave orders for them to sail westwards away from the British squadron. However, the wind favoured Colpoys and his vastly superior squadron rapidly gained on the French frigates. The first British ship to come within range was the 74-gun HMS Colossus under Captain John Monkton, which managed to exchange distant gunfire with the rearmost French ship before the gap widened once more.|$|E
5|$|Having left Mansfield, Boulding joined Division One side Grimsby Town on a free {{transfer}} in September 2001. His debut {{was as a}} second-half substitute in a 3–3 draw with Stockport County on 22 September 2001, before he scored his first Grimsby goal a week later away at Bradford City. Boulding was involved in Grimsby's League Cup upset, when they defeated cup holders Liverpool with a 2–1 extra-time victory, but they struggled in the league. Boulding <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the starting eleven, {{but when he was}} recalled to the side for the visit of Crystal Palace on 2 March 2002 in place of Martin Pringle, who had broken his leg, Boulding scored in a 5–2 victory to ease their relegation worries. He scored again three days later in a defeat, and followed it up with the first hat-trick of his career in a 6–2 victory later the same month against Wimbledon, which moved them out of the relegation zone. Grimsby's survival was ensured {{before the end of the}} season, when they defeated Burnley 3–1, with two goals from Boulding. Boulding finished Grimsby's leading scorer for the 2001–02 season with 11goals in 39appearances, and with his one-year contract due to expire in the summer, he was offered a new contract by the club. Boulding, however, turned down the offer and instead joined Aston Villa in July 2002 on a Bosman free transfer.|$|E

Higginbotham signed a {{contract}} extension in October 2010 for a further 12 months, keeping him at Stoke until the summer of 2013. He made his 200th top-flight appearance against Manchester United on 24 October 2010. He struggled with injury {{for the rest of}} the first half of the season, and <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the first team.|$|E

5|$|In 1951–52, Harvey <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of {{the team}} {{on a regular basis}} as the Test players were {{periodically}} available for Victorian duty between the international matches. With the Test players away for the first two Sheffield Shield matches, Harvey played in both fixtures. He made only 28 in the first match, an innings win over Western Australia. He also took two catches. In the next match against South Australia, he made 47 out of Victoria's 281 and took his first wickets at first-class level, dismissing century-maker Ernest England and tail-ender Geff Noblet and ending with 2/29 and two catches as Victoria conceded a 240-run first innings lead. He then made 18 as his team collapsed for 101 to lose by an innings. Harvey was then dropped for the next three matches, as the Test players, including his younger brother Neil, returned. With a Test match in progress at the same time, he was recalled for the home match against Queensland but made only 35 and 14 as Victoria collapsed in the second innings to be 9/147, holding on for a draw with one wicket in hand. Harvey bowled seven overs in the match and conceded 0/51. He was immediately dropped again when the Test players returned, before being recalled for the away match against Queensland when the national representatives were again unavailable. Harvey then made 31 and 1 in a narrow 18-run loss. Having made only 21 of Victoria's 647 in the next match against Tasmania, he was dropped for the final Shield match when the Test players returned. Harvey ended the season with 195 runs at 24.37; he reached 14 in all but one of his eight innings but was unable to convert his starts into large scores, with a highest innings of 47.|$|E
5|$|July 9, 1861 {{was a hot}} day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took a nap. Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as best he could, but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of consciousness throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough so that he was unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, and he wore a beard from then on that became his trademark.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{returned}} to England {{on a permanent}} basis by rejoining his former club Nottingham Forest in December 1983. It was not until 7 April 1984 that he made his second debut for Forest, when he started the 3–1 home win over West Bromwich Albion. He played in nine matches for Forest in 1983–84, including seven outings in their last nine league fixtures, with the team finishing third in the First Division. Mills' first goal in his second spell with Forest was the winning goal in a 3–2 home victory over Manchester United on 8 December 1984. He <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the starting line-up in 1984–85, ultimately making 31 appearances and scoring five goals. Forest ended in ninth place in the First Division this season.|$|E

5|$|On 3 August 2006, Horsfield {{signed for}} Championship club Leeds United on loan until Christmas {{with a view}} to a {{permanent}} move. He made his debut on the opening day of the season, against Norwich at Elland Road, and scored his first goal in a 2–2 draw away at Queens Park Rangers three days later. When Dennis Wise took over as Leeds manager, Horsfield <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the side and his loan was terminated in January 2007. At the end of the January 2007 transfer window, Leicester City took Horsfield on loan {{for the rest of the}} season. He made his debut for the club in their 1–1 draw with Luton Town on 3 February, and scored his first goals for them in their 3–0 victory over local rivals Coventry City two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three seasons, Koufax <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the Dodger {{starting}} rotation due to injuries. In 1958, he began 7–3, but sprained his ankle in a collision at first base, finishing the season at 11–11 and leading the NL in wild pitches. In June 1959, Koufax set the record for a night game with 16 strikeouts. On August 31, 1959, he surpassed his career high with 18 strikeouts, setting the NL record and tying Bob Feller's major league record for strikeouts in one game.|$|E
5|$|Poulton came to {{prominence}} in youth cricket by captaining New South Wales to the Under-17 national championships in 2000.

She found runs {{hard to come by}} in her first three seasons and <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the team frequently, aggregating only 24 runs in her second and third seasons combined. Despite this, she regularly captained Australia's Under-19 and Under-23 teams during this time, leading the latter on a successful tour of Sri Lanka in 2004. In 2005–06, made a substantial impact on the WNCL for the first time, scoring 325 runs, more than twice her previous best season's total, playing in the first of five consecutive WNCL triumphs for New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|Roberts {{stayed at}} Cambridge for the 201617 season, with the {{campaign}} following a similar pattern to the previous year as he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the starting line-up. He made his first start a month into the new season, helping Cambridge win their {{first game of the}} season as they won 21 away at Newport County on 24 September 2016. Three days later, he scored the only goal of the game when he turned the ball home from close range after 65 minutes in a 10 victory against Yeovil Town. The win moved Cambridge off the bottom of the table. Roberts' return to the first-team coincided with an upturn in form for the Cambridgeshire side and he remained a permanent fixture in the centre of defence for the following five months of the season. He scored his second goal of the season courtesy of a 92nd minute equaliser in an eventual 42 extra-time FA Cup win at Dover Athletic on 17 November 2016, with Roberts playing all four FA Cup games as Cambridge would progress to the Third Round and face Leeds United live on BBC. His third and final goal of the campaign was a notable 93rd minute winner in a 32 win over Newport County in February 2017, scoring from a rebound in a game Cambridge had trailed by two goals. Roberts did not make an appearance beyond March 2017, and played 31 games in total during the season, scoring three times. At the end of the season, in May 2017, Cambridge announced their released and retained list, stating that Roberts had been placed on the transfer-list with a year remaining on his contract.|$|E
5|$|Solo {{was born}} in Richland, Washington on July 30, 1981 to Judy Lynn (née Shaw) and Jeffrey Solo. Her father, an Italian-American Vietnam War veteran, who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> {{out of her life}} as a child and teenager, taught her how to play soccer at a young age. When Solo was seven, her father picked her and her brother Marcus up to go to a {{baseball}} game in the nearby city of Yakima, but ended up driving over three hours west to Seattle, where they stayed for several days at a hotel. Solo described how it seemed like a vacation at first, but soon realized it was not. Police later found them at a downtown bank and arrested Jeffrey for alleged kidnapping. Although her parents had divorced when she was six and she lived with her mother, Solo maintained a close relationship with her father after reconnecting with him during her college years at the University of Washington. He continued to be a major influence in her life until his death {{of a heart attack in}} June 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 24 June 1801 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars. A British ship of the line, HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell was passing westwards through the Southern Mediterranean near Cape Derna when it encountered a much larger French squadron under Contre-Amiral Honoré Ganteaume that was also returning westwards after a failed attempt to reinforce the besieged French garrison in Egypt. Although Hallowell immediately recognised the danger his vessel <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> turned to flee, the French ships were much faster and soon closed with his ship. At 14:00, three French vessels were within long gunshot and Hallowell decided that his only hope of escape lay in disabling the three ships {{before the rest of}} the French squadron could join the engagement. Turning towards the enemy, Hallowell found that his sluggish ship was unable to respond rapidly to French manoeuvres and within two hours Swiftsure was surrounded. Threatened with complete destruction and unable to escape, the British captain surrendered.|$|E

The flooding destroyed about 77squaremiles (200km²) of rice fields, and an additional 19square miles (50km²) of other crops. Strong winds damaged or destroyed around 83,000houses across the country, including 2,000houses destroyed in Kinnia and 6,600 in Trincomalee. The passage of the cyclone left up to 500,000temporarily homeless on the island, most of whom fled to churches, schools, temples, and shopping centers.
