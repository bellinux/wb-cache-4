5|$|Some {{birds and}} insects use {{defensive}} regurgitation {{to ward off}} predators. The northern fulmar vomits a bright orange, oily substance called stomach oil when threatened. The stomach oil is made from their aquatic diets. It causes the predator's feathers to mat, leading {{to the loss of}} flying ability and the loss of water repellency. This is especially dangerous for aquatic birds because their <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> feathers protect them from hypothermia when diving for food.|$|E
5|$|High {{rainfall}} {{can cause}} widespread flooding, {{which can lead}} to landslides and mudflows in mountainous areas. Such floods cause rivers to burst their banks and submerge homes. The Ghaggar-Hakra River, which only flows during India's monsoon season, can flood and severely damage local crops. Floods can be exacerbated by fires during the previous dry season, which cause soils which are sandy or composed of loam to become hydrophobic, or <b>water</b> <b>repellent.</b> In various ways governments may help people deal with wet season floods. Flood plain mapping identifies which areas are more prone to flooding. Instructions on controlling erosion through outreach are also provided by telephone or the internet.|$|E

50|$|Today's <b>water</b> <b>repellents</b> {{help create}} a vapor {{permeable}} barrier; liquid water, especially from wind driven rains, will {{stay out of the}} brick and masonry. Water vapor from the interior of the building, or from the underside of pavers can escape. This will reduce efflorescence, spalling and scaling that can occur from water being trapped inside the brick substrate and freezing during cold weather. Years ago, the <b>water</b> <b>repellents</b> trapped moisture in the masonry wall creating more problems than they solved. Condensation in areas that experienced the four seasons were much more problematic than their counterparts.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effectiveness of}} two strategies in preventing algal growth on aerated autoclaved concrete. A first strategy comprised the use of <b>water</b> <b>repellents</b> in order to affect the bioreceptivity of the material. In the second strategy, products inhibitory {{to the growth of}} algae were applied. For the evaluation of these strategies an accelerated growth test was developed. The experimental setup consisted of several units, which allowed for individual testing of several products at the same time. Qualitifaction of algal growth was obtained with image analysis and spectrometric measurements. Both <b>water</b> <b>repellents</b> and biocidal surface treatments resulted in a delayed fouling rate. Nevertheless, complete coverage of these specimens was also obtained after 1 or 2 additional weeks of accelerated tests...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine effects on retention and shrink levels of Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehn.) which treated with some commercial preservative types, borates, polyethylene glycol, and <b>water</b> <b>repellents.</b> In this study, four type impregnation chemicals were chosen: 1.

Polyethylene glycol such as Polyethylene glycol (PEG- 400) 4. <b>Water</b> <b>repellents</b> [Styrene, Methylmetacrylate. ]. As a result, retention % and shrink levels of Eucalyptus wood was lower treated with commercial preservative types and borates preservatives compare to other treatment chemicals.

500|$|The {{monument}} is {{endangered by}} the climate (which has caused damage by frost and rain) and by air pollution. Although in 1990 {{the area around}} the monument was pedestrianized, there are still three streets carrying traffic around it. High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide have been recorded near the monument, which in combination with water cause corrosion of the fabric of the monument. In addition, water has caused cracking of the reinforced concrete core and rusting of its steel reinforcements and the fastenings of the monument, which also have been worn out by constant vibrations caused by traffic. [...] The porous travertine has gradually crumbled over time and its pores have filled with soot and particles of sand, causing it to blacken and providing a habitat for small organisms, such as moss and lichens. Irregular maintenance and the unskillful performance of restoration work have also contributed to the weathering of the monument. To prevent its further decay some of the fastenings were replaced with polyurethane filler and <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> was applied to the monument during the restoration in 2001. It was also determined that maintenance should be carried out every 2 years.|$|E

40|$|Lime-based mortars {{modified}} with admixtures {{were prepared}} {{and subjected to}} different environments such as outdoor and indoor exposures, climatic chamber, SO 2 -chamber, and freezing-thawing cycles. The influence that the different admixtures (<b>water</b> <b>repellents,</b> <b>water</b> retainers, polypropylene fibre and a viscosity modifier) had on the pore size distribution of the hardened specimens was assessed and related to the water absorption capacity, and hence to the durability. Ageing resistance and mechanical strengths improved when additives reduced the water intake and increased the air-content. High dosages of <b>water</b> <b>repellents</b> were necessary to enhance the durability, sodium oleate being the most effective additive to endure freezing processes. Also the low tested dosage of fibre, a water retainer (guar gum derivative), and a starch proved to be useful. SO 2 deposition caused the formation of calcium sulphite hemihydrate as the main degradation product. A very small amount of calcium sulphate dihydrate was observed.

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of treatment of facades of historic buildings and {{especially those with}} the status of listed monument is often discussed. Surface treatments of facades comprise a range of treatments, from <b>water</b> <b>repellents</b> to consolidants and anti-Â­graffiti coatings. Even facade cleaning {{can be considered a}} facade treatment. Treatment of monuments and historical buildings is often subject to dispute for both ethical / aesthetical and for technical reasons. In fact, even though often advertised as reversible, surface treatments permanently alter the characteristics of the materials they are applied upon. Treatments of buildings can therefore be seen as a change of the original characteristics of the materials, thus leading to loss of information and affecting their historical value and their aesthetic appearance.

The amount of product absorbed and the amount of dry polymer remaining after treatment were compared. The results show that the presence of water and soluble salts in the stone significantly modifies the consumption of the products (in particular the <b>water</b> <b>repellents)</b> and also the level of dry polymer retained. The <b>water</b> <b>repellents</b> were found to be much less effective when the substrate contained salts, whereas the presence of water did not appear to influence their efficacy.

Se analiza la eficacia de dos consolidantes y dos hidrofugantes aplicados a rocas granÃ­ticas en condiciones Ã³ptimas comparativamente a la eficacia de los mismos productos aplicados sobre los mismos sustratos conteniendo cierta cantidad de sales solubles o de agua.

Los resultados indican que la presencia de agua y de sales solubles en la piedra modifica significativamente el consumo de los productos, sobre todo el de los hidrofugantes, asÃ­ como la cantidad de materia seca. Se observa, asimismo, un fuerte detrimento en la eficacia de los hidrofugantes cuando el sustrato contiene sales mientras que, al contrario, la presencia de agua no parece infiuir en dicha eficacia.
