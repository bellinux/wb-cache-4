40|$|Inspired {{by recent}} {{advances}} {{in the theory of}} modified differential equations, we propose a new methodology for constructing numerical integrators with high weak order for the time integration of stochastic differential equations. This approach is illustrated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> new high order weak methods, in particular, implicit integrators well suited for stiff stochastic problems, and integrators that exactly conserve all quadratic first integrals of a stochastic dynamical system. Numerical examples confirm the theoretical results and show the versatility of the methodology...|$|R
