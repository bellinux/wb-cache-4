At approximately 4:30am, Plath had placed her head in the oven, with the gas turned on. She was 30years old.|$|E
5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B flat major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated <b>with</b> <b>tape</b> echo.|$|E

40|$|Background: Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a painful}} condition caused by microtrauma to plantar fascia due to overuse. It {{is a most}} common cause of heel pain in runners. Various studies proved taping and Iontophoresis as effective in the treating plantar fasciitis. But there are no studies comparing the combined effect of iontophoresis <b>with</b> <b>taping</b> and taping alone in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Methods: 50 patients suffering from plantar fasciitis who met the inclusion criteria were selected. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups i. e. Group A and Group B. Group A received <b>taping,</b> iontophoresis <b>with</b> plantar fascia stretching. Group B received taping and plantar fascia stretching. A total of 6 treatment sessions were given on alternate days over a period of two weeks for both the groups. Results: VAS and FFI scores across baseline and post intervention showed a significant improvement statistically in their mean scores between Groups A and B (P< 0. 05). Between group comparison of VAS and FFI scores, it showed that subject treated with Iontophoresis in combination <b>with</b> <b>taping</b> and plantar fascia stretch (Group A) had significant improvement in VAS and functional ability when compared to subjects treated <b>with</b> <b>taping</b> and plantar fascia stretching alone (Group B). Conclusion: Iontophoresis along <b>with</b> <b>Taping</b> and plantar fascia stretching gave an additional benefit when compared <b>with</b> <b>Taping</b> and plantar fascia stretching alone in reducing pain and improving function in plantar fasciitis.

25|$|Many women, such as {{beauty pageant}} {{participants}} and transgender people, create cleavage by using tape underneath and across their breast, bending forward, tightly pulling {{them together and}} up. Types of tape used include surgical micropore tape and athletic tape. Some also use a strip of moleskin under the breasts <b>with</b> <b>tape</b> at the ends {{to hold it in}} place.

The gap between the turret and hull was sealed with an inflatable hose while the main gun mantlet, commander’s cupola and radio operator’s machine gun were given special rubber coverings. Once the tank reached the shore, all covers and seals could be blown off via explosive cables, enabling normal combat operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} <b>with</b> <b>tape</b> leaders {{was that}} the sound recording or playback did not {{start at the beginning}} of the tape, forcing the user to cue forward to the start of the magnetic section.

Home computers that made use of cassettes prior to the advent of floppy discs (i.e. Apple II, Commodore PET) were designed to not start writing or reading data until leaders had spooled past.|$|E

25|$|Boulez {{likened the}} {{experience}} of listening to pre-recorded electronic music in the concert hall to a crematorium ceremony. His real interest lay in the instantaneous transformation of live instrumental sounds but the technology did not become available until the late 1970s and the founding of IRCAM. Before then he composed two short pieces on tape (the Deux Etudes of 1951, withdrawn) and a large-scale piece for live orchestra <b>with</b> <b>tape,</b> Poésie pour pouvoir (1958), but he disliked {{the fact that the}} orchestra was straitjacketed by the need to follow the tape and never returned to the piece.|$|E
25|$|Delicate {{sounds and}} fine overtones were mostly lost, {{because it took}} a lot of sound energy to vibrate the {{recording}} horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism. There were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the recording and playback system. Some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped <b>with</b> <b>tape</b> to help mute these resonances. Even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment sounds like it was recorded through a horn, notwithstanding a reduction in distortion because of the modern playback. Toward the end of the acoustic era, there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns.|$|E
25|$|Initially Eno {{began to}} {{experiment}} <b>with</b> <b>tape</b> loops {{in the creation}} of these music systems. Later he created systems that incorporated the use of several CDs with material he had specifically created for random playback, in order to make music of indeterminate duration. Then in 1995 he began working with the company Intermorphic to create generative music with programmed algorithms. The cooperation with Intermorphic led Eno to release Generative Music 1 (requires the Intermorphic's Koan Player software for PC), so as to make it possible to offer his generative explorations to the public as intended - enabling generative playback. Eventually Eno also explored the Adobe Flash format to release 77 Million Paintings in 2006. For PC and Mac, again, this enabled Eno to offer his generative explorations to the public as intended. Essentially 77 Million Paintings returns to the methodology of random playback utilized in his earlier work <b>with</b> <b>tape</b> loops and CD (as in it does not incorporate programmed algorithms). More recent;y, sparked by possibilities presented to Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers while working together on the generative soundtrack for the video game Spore (2008) the two began to release generative music in the Apple App format starting with the release of Bloom (2008) on up to their last release: Reflection (Apple App generative version: 2016).|$|E
