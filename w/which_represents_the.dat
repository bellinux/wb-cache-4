5|$|The signs s1, s2 and s3 on the {{right-hand}} sides of the equations may be chosen in eight possible ways, and each choice of signs gives up to two solutions, since the equation for r's is quadratic. This might suggest (incorrectly) that there are up to sixteen solutions of Apollonius' problem. However, due to a symmetry of the equations, if (r's, x's, y's) is a solution, with signs s'i, then so is (−r's, x's, y's), with opposite signs −s'i, <b>which</b> <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> same solution circle. Therefore, Apollonius' problem has at most eight independent solutions (Figure2). One way to avoid this double-counting is to consider only solution circles with non-negative radius.|$|E
