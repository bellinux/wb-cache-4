5|$|In prior cases, {{the fear}} had been {{expressed}} that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background {{in which it}} was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what is said and done there.|$|E

Up until the shooting of the show's first season, Scorsese and Winter would meet every Sunday afternoon to review <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> during the week where Scorsese would have comments and suggestions. Scorsese continued to be creatively involved in the ongoing production, but did not direct any more episodes.|$|E

25|$|On screen {{there was}} no mention of <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> backstage, instead Michaels and Jannetty started to show signs of dissension. During a singles match between Michaels and Ric Flair, Jannetty rolled Shawn into the ring to get pinned. Michaels took this as Jannetty costing him the match instead of helping out (though this was a storyline). At the 1991 Survivor Series Jannetty caused Michaels to be {{eliminated}} by accidentally slamming one of the Nasty Boys into him after which The Rockers argued. After the buildup, The Rockers wrestled one last match on television, a title shot at The Legion of Doom which The Rockers lost after which Jannetty and Michaels argued over who was to blame.|$|E
500|$|The club {{finished}} third outside the promotion spots in Shankly's first part-season (1959/60). He released 24 players at the season's end. As well as Callaghan and Hunt he also retained Gerry Byrne. Shankly recognising {{the abilities of}} the existing coaching team of Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett retained all three. An Anfield boot storage room was adopted as a strategy discussion venue by him and his coaches. The Boot Room, as it became known, became integral to their success. Bob Paisley remarked, [...] "You got a more wide-ranging discussion in the Boot Room than the boardroom. <b>What</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> was kept within those four walls.

The finale and its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, did however help Fox tie for first place in that demographic with ABC and CBS. The rating for this episode almost doubled when DVR time shifted viewing was taken into account. Because of its comparatively low live ratings, SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall speculated that only [...] "the core of the core audience" [...] watched the episode, as [...] "no outsiders could have possibly fathomed <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> in that 45 minutes." ...|$|E

500|$|The War Within: A Secret White House History (2006–2008) is a non-fiction book by Washington Post {{reporter}} Bob Woodward {{that was}} released by publisher Simon & Schuster on September 8, 2008. It is the fifteenth book written by Woodward, the fourth {{in a series of}} books about President George W. Bush and his administration's foreign policy including Bush at War, Plan of Attack, and State of Denial. The book discusses the debate within the administration about the controversial Iraq [...] "surge" [...] strategy implemented in 2007. Simon & Schuster editor Alice Mayhew said in an official statement that “There has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the Nixon tapes and the Pentagon Papers. This is the declassification of <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> in secret, behind the scenes.” ...|$|E
500|$|Michigan's defense forced three turnovers, sacked the Illinois quarterback four times, {{and held}} Illinois' offense to 37 rushing yards on 33 {{attempts}} {{for an average}} of 1.1 yards per carry. Mike Martin led the defense with nine tackles. After the game, Michigan's defensive coordinator Greg Mattison became emotional as he told reporters: [...] "That was a Michigan defense. ... Nobody knows <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> inside of these guys and for them to stick together and to play like they played tonight, and like they have tried in every game, it says a lot about them." [...] Defensive end Ryan Van Bergen, who recorded 2.5 sacks, three tackles for loss and seven tackles overall, was named the Big Ten's Co-Defensive Player of the Week. Toussaint's 65-yard touchdown run and his total of 192 rushing yards were career highs.|$|E
500|$|Dan White's {{arrest and}} trial caused a sensation, and {{illustrated}} severe {{tensions between the}} liberal population and the city police. The San Francisco Police were mostly working-class Irish descendants who intensely disliked the growing gay immigration, {{as well as the}} liberal direction of the city government. After White turned himself in and confessed, he sat in his cell while his former colleagues on the police force told Harvey Milk jokes; police openly wore [...] "Free Dan White" [...] T-shirts {{in the days after the}} murder. An undersheriff for San Francisco later stated: [...] "The more I observed <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> at the jail, the more I began to stop seeing what Dan White did as the act of an individual and began to see it as a political act in a political movement." [...] White showed no remorse for his actions, and only exhibited vulnerability during an eight-minute call to his mother from jail.|$|E

500|$|Zack Handlen {{watched the}} episode for The A.V. Club in May 2010, and {{also found that}} the {{character}} of Jameson was [...] "thoroughly unlikable". He described Rohner as [...] "acting like a Muppet when he's supposed to be elderly and weak, then laying on the over-heated angst once his youth is restored". Overall he felt that the main characters were sidelined in the episode, and so it was difficult to be involved in <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on.</b> He gave the episode a grade of C+. Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation in June 2007. She said that the plot seen in [...] "Too Short a Season" [...] involving an [...] "Evil Admiral" [...] was one which had been more commonly seen on The Original Series such as Commodore Decker in [...] "". She too criticised the makeup used on Rohner, but said that his acting became more [...] "modulated, but then both Karnas and the actor playing him seem over-the-top by comparison".|$|E
500|$|Some {{members of}} the Tories' {{campaign}} committee had urged Diefenbaker not to build his campaign around the Pipeline Debate, contending that the episode was now {{a year in the}} past and forgotten by the voters, who did not particularly care <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> in Parliament anyway. Diefenbaker replied, [...] "That's the issue, and I'm making it." [...] Diefenbaker referred to the conduct of the government in the Pipeline Debate more frequently than he did any other issue during the campaign. St. Laurent initially dealt with the question flippantly, suggesting in his opening campaign address that the debate had been [...] "nearly as long as the pipeline itself and quite as full of another kind of natural gas". As the issue gained resonance with the voters, the Liberals devoted more time to it, and St. Laurent devoted a major part of his final English television address to the question. The Liberals defended their conduct, and contended that a minority {{should not be allowed to}} impose its will on an elected majority. St. Laurent suggested that the Tories had performed badly as an opposition in the debate, and suggested that the public give them more practice at being an opposition.|$|E
500|$|To this day, Reagan's {{role in the}} {{transactions}} is not definitively known; it is unclear exactly what Reagan knew and when, and whether the arms sales were motivated by his desire to save the U.S. hostages. Oliver North wrote that [...] "Ronald Reagan knew of and approved {{a great deal of}} <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> with both the Iranian initiative and private efforts on behalf of the contras and he received regular, detailed briefings on both...I have no doubt that he was told about the use of residuals for the Contras, and that he approved it. Enthusiastically." [...] Handwritten notes by Defense Secretary Weinberger indicate that the President was aware of potential hostages transfers with Iran, as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to what he was told were [...] "moderate elements" [...] within Iran. Notes taken on December 7, 1985, by Weinberger record that Reagan said that [...] "he could answer charges of illegality but he couldn't answer charge [...] that 'big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free hostages'". The Republican-written [...] "Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair" [...] concluded, that There is some question and dispute about precisely the level at which he chose to follow the operation details. There is no doubt, however, ... the President set the US policy towards Nicaragua, with few if any ambiguities, and then left subordinates more or less free to implement it.|$|E

500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of <b>what</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E
