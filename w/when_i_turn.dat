Amidst fierce fighting in Butig on November 30, 2016, Duterte, in a command briefing in Lanao del Sur, warned the Maute group: [...] "Ayaw ko makipag-away sa inyo. Ayaw ko makipag-patayan, (I {{do not want a}} fight with you. I don't want us killing each other) but please, do not force my hand. I cannot be forever traveling here every month para lang makipag-usap (just to talk), at pagtalikod ko patayan nanaman (and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> around, there's killing again). I do not want to mention anything, but please do not force my hand into it." [...] On December 2, 2016, as the military regained control of Butig, the retreating Maute fighters reportedly left a note threatening to behead Duterte.|$|E

60|$|Lord, my dear Cerjat, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> to that page of {{your letter}} where you write like an ancient sage in whom the fire has paled into a meek-eyed state of coolness and virtue, I half laugh and half cry! You old! You {{a sort of}} hermit? Boh! Get out.|$|E

'The foul fiend {{shall be}} clerk, and say amen, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> chaplain,' growled out the party addressed, in tones {{which might have}} become the {{condition}} of a dying bear; 'if the gentleman is a whig, he may please himself with his own mummery.

60|$|Here {{are a few}} incidents, out of a score or {{more that}} I have seen, or heard from {{reliable}} hunters, that indicate something more than native instinct among animals. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> to the birds the incidents are fewer but more remarkable; for the birds, being lower in the scale of life, are more subject to instinct than are the animals, and so are less easily taught by their mothers, and are slower to change their natural habits to meet changing conditions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ours {{was such}} a {{marriage}} of convenience," [...] she went on, [...] "and you were so very plain-spoken about it, Henry. I feel somehow as though I were breaking a compact <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> round and ask you whether {{it is not possible}} that we might be, perhaps, some day, a little more to one another. You know why I am almost afraid to say this. It has not been with you as it has been with me. I have always felt that she has been there--Pauline." ...|$|E

60|$|A subtle, sudden flame, By veering passion fann'd, About thee {{breaks and}} dances When I would kiss thy hand, The flush of anger'd shame O'erflows thy calmer glances, And o'er black brows drops down A sudden curved frown: But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> away, Thou, willing me to stay, Wooest not, nor vainly wranglest; But, looking fixedly the while, All my {{bounding}} heart entanglest In a golden-netted smile; Then in madness and in bliss, If my lips should dare to kiss Thy taper fingers amorously, [3] Again thou blushest angerly; And o'er black brows drops down A sudden-curved frown.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{understand}} the meaning of your words, Sir Gervaise, and appreciate the feeling that dictates them. You must have a perfect conviction that I will do nothing hastily, and that I will betray no trust. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> my back on King George, it will be loyalty, in one sense, whatever he may think of it in another; and when I join Prince Charles Edward, it will be with a conscience that he need not be ashamed to probe. What names he bears! They are the designations of ancient English sovereigns, and ought of themselves, to awaken the sensibilities of Englishmen." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Dedlock {{had taken}} {{shelter in the}} lodge before our arrival there and {{had come out of}} the gloom within. She stood behind my chair with her hand upon it. I saw her with her hand close to my {{shoulder}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my head.|$|R
