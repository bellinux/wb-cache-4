40|$|An {{automated}} {{high bay}} warehouse {{is commonly used}} for storing large number of material with a high throughput. In an automated <b>warehouse</b> <b>pallet</b> movements are mainly performed {{by a number of}} automated devices like conveyors systems, trolleys, and stacker cranes. From the introduction of the material to the automated warehouse system to its dispatch the system requires no operator input or intervention since all material movements are done automatically. This allows the automated warehouse to operate continuously with minimal manpower. The thesis focuses on a conveyor system within an automated warehouse. The conveyor system is responsible for the intake of material into the warehouse, internal use of material in the production, and dispatch of finished products. The material is stored on pallets, which are used to transport the material over different types of conveyors. The main contribution of the thesis is a software written for a programmable logic controller, which allows an arbitrary configuration of a conveyor system. The software is modular and consists of several so-called function blocks, where each function block represents the whole program logic for a single conveyor and uses a standard interface for information exchange with other function blocks. The software currently supports eight different types of conveyors, which can be freely linked with one another to create a conveyor system, of any size and complexity. The software allows for simple extension of existing project, and rapid development of new projects. To add a new type of conveyor only we need to create a new function block, which is following the now established standards for information exchange and supports all functionalities of the new conveyor type. The software is used on the conveyor system which consists of one hundred forty units. The software has proved to be reliable, since it has been operating without problems for more than one year. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how to create a pro-active, long term, network centric warehouse strategy. This thesis will present an inventory model built to understand the capacity needs of Amgen's warehouses over the time period of 2017 - 2023 to support this mission, along with recommendations based on scenario analysis from this model to analyze and quantify the impacts of multiple scenarios in support of an efficient, effective, nimble supply chain. With worldwide operations supporting a global customer base, Amgen's operational philosophy is to ensure serving "every patient, every time". Amgen's warehouses play a vital role with this mission, storing raw materials to ensure production with safety stock and various levels of Work in Progress (WIP) based not only on operational safety stock, but also strategic safety stock to ensure demand is always met, even with unforeseen risks. In order to understand the impacts of growth on warehouse utilization, a relational database inventory model was created and linked to the long range forecast of supply and demand. This inventory model linked the Bill of Materials (BOMs) to the product forecast in order to to understand the quantity of raw materials required to meet the supply. The database also calculates the WIP and finished product levels of Amgen's products. This model considers inefficiencies in the warehouses, as <b>warehouse</b> <b>pallet</b> spaces do not always store the maximum capacity of the material. This inventory model calculated the capacity required for each warehouse over the forecasted ranges of FY 2016 to FY 2023. The findings of this model were used to create Amgen's long term warehouse strategy. The model demonstrated a +- 10 % accuracy to 2017 planning. We developed a strategy that mimics Amgen's operational strategy. Amgen's operational strategy is to reduce fixed costs, and focus on flexibility with variable based costs. Based on this, we found the best strategy was to work with 3 rd party logistics providers (3 PLs) to mitigate the capacity gaps in a variable based manner. This option is preferred over investing in expanding capacity at warehouses already in use for all three scenarios of optimistic, baseline, and pessimistic demand profiles. The biggest lever to gain warehouse capacity is to improve inventory policies and the flow of communication. Inventory policies whose aim is to reduce inventory can be viewed as a sensitive topic at a company like Amgen. But, if done in a scientific manner, and moving from a Months on Hand (MOH) approach to a scientifically calculated inventory, then moving to a multi-echelon inventory optimization, inventory and risk can be reduced. The following are ways that can be used to reduce inventory and risks. [...] Track forecast error to understand variation of demand [...] Lead time reduction of raw materials and work in progress [...] Risk Pool Drug Product (DP) "nude" vials and decrease lead time from DP to customer [...] Re-order point frequency increases [...] Reduction of demand variability through: [...] [...] Better communication of demand forecasts between marketing, global supply chain and site supply chain teams. [...] [...] Reducing variability of manufacturing planning [...] Seek commonality of raw materials to lower safety stock levels [...] Multi-Echelon Inventory Optimization By accomplishing these activities, Amgen has a scope to reduce 3 PL storage requirements by 20 k pallet-year spaces over the same time period. This will lower the expense of 3 PL costs, and overall risks, over the same time period by $ 11 M. Considerable work will have to be accomplished, but the benefits will outweigh the costs. by Patrick Johnson. Thesis: S.

40|$|Abstract. Transportation and {{warehouse}} {{costs are}} the two major components of the total logistics cost. To increase the material handling efficiency both in transit and in the <b>warehouse,</b> <b>pallets</b> have been used widely in logistics systems. The manufacturer’s pallet loading problem (MPLP) is to pack identical smaller boxes onto a rectangle pallet to maximize the pallet utilization. In this research, we solve the MPLP based on a two-phase algorithm. In the first phase, {{the maximum number of}} items is found by solving a mathematical model. In the second phase, a tree search algorithm is proposed to obtain a feasible layout. The tree search algorithm is to move sets of boxes that may be in different orientations instead of moving individual boxes during the search process. The idea here is to reduce the possible loading combinations and only find a feasible pattern for given number of boxes. Different data sets from the literature are tested. The results show that the proposed tree search algorithm can find feasible layout efficiently...|$|R

40|$|A rather {{new area}} {{identified}} by managers {{as a potential}} for increasing returns has received great attention. Industry analysts predicts that approximately 450 million EPAL Euro pallets are in constant circulation in the world. Traditionally, pallets have been disregarded and perceived {{as a source of}} cost with the single mean to transport products to customers. Lately, actors in supply chains have started to perceive pallets in a total cost approach and, hence, as significant for the overall result of the supply chain. In parallel with an increased attention of the pallets importance on the supply chain performance, a shift towards an increased utilization of pallet pooling systems has been indicated. This is related to the constant increase in raw material prices as well as costs associated with repair, maintenance and recovery of pallets. This study aims to answer two issues. The first issue relates to investigating the pallet logistics process at SCA’s paper mill in Lilla Edet, which includes the mapping of flows to the Danish and Norwegian markets as well as reviewing the design of the <b>pallet</b> <b>warehouse.</b> The second issue concerns evaluating the current inspection control process related to inbound deliveries of pallets. Established standards and routines will be reviewed in order to clarify whether these are complied with. A case study approach has been selected as a method in order to fulfil the aim of this thesis. Since a mixed methods approach is considered useful, both qualitative and quantitative data is collected. Interviews, observations and access to internal documents are the major sources of information. Further, the empirical findings were analysed based on the theoretical framework in order to provide solutions that addressed the stated issues. Improvement suggestions can be grouped in two major measures that should be considered. Firstly, three errors associated with defective pallets are correlated with the temperature. Consequently, during winter months’ pallets should be stored in the <b>pallet</b> <b>warehouse</b> in order to avoid rising defect levels. Secondly, a redesign of the current <b>pallet</b> <b>warehouse</b> should be performed since the current design is not optimal from wooden pallet’s perspective. Further, {{it should be noted that}} an increased information sharing between pallet suppliers and the SCA Edet mill is a huge facilitator for improving the studied issues...|$|R

[...] The cost of making the change is estimated at $600 million over ten years, which includes not only the change to the pallets themselves, but also to storage racking and other equipment. Operating costs are estimated to increase by $100 million over the same ten years: the smaller pallet means more handling operations {{for the same amount}} of goods, and a less efficient usage of truck and <b>warehouse</b> space (larger <b>pallets</b> have a greater ratio of goods to pallet and packaging).|$|R

Some AGVs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms. They are able to operate in complex environments and perform non-repetitive and non-sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab, specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses.

In the paper, a coloured Petri net (CPN) model is proposed. It allows representing any sequence of elementary actions of AGVs (including pick-up and drop-off activities), and accurately models the interactions among AGVs, in order to guarantee the safety during the execution of activities. The CPN model can be used to analyse and implement deadlock prevention and deadlock recovery strategies, and it has been adopted in the building of a discrete-event simulator which is employed to analyse the system's performance and to evaluate scheduling policies for transportation tasks...|$|R
40|$|In this research, fast {{heuristics}} for {{a centralized}} multi-agent route planner are presented and computationally evaluated. We solve a sub-problem of warehouse scheduling involving the routing of intelligent agents as a preliminary step in optimizing the total schedule. The problem involves {{the generation of}} routes for automated agents tasked with the transfer of items within a <b>warehouse</b> from storage <b>pallets</b> to a common loading shed. The goal is to minimize the total distance of the routes {{and the number of}} routes generated. This constitutes a multiple-objective optimization problem which is NP-hard and hence can take a prohibitively long time to solve using existing search-based techniques. The approach adapted here is to model the system as a Split-Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (SDVRP) with grid distances and to solve it using heuristics based on tested operations research concepts. Twenty-two such heuristics are tested including the well-known greedy Nearest-Neighbor (NN) heuristic, and the established Savings heuristic of Clarke and Wright. Two SDVRP variations of the NN algorithm are introduced, namely the Nearest-Fill (NF) and Nearest-Fill Farthest-Start (NFFS) heuristics. Existing SDVRP improvement procedures are also considered and generalized to produce numerous heuristic variations. This novel approach of applying fast vehicle routing heuristics to multi-agent routing has the advantag...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFire safety {{engineering}} is nowadays {{an important way}} to improve safety in a large variety of buildings. Whatever the typology of building, {{one of the key}} points in order to evaluate the consequences of a fire consists in the ability in predicting the fire growth and total heat release rate inside the building. The beginning of such a modeling consists in evaluating the heat release rate of elementary component of the fire. In the specific case of <b>warehouse</b> storage, the <b>pallets</b> heat release rate is then crucial not only to predict fire growth inside the building and occupants' safety but to evaluate the total heat release rate for a generalized fire and consequences on the building environment too. A new model is then proposed to predict the heat release rate of a pallet in case of fire. This model consider the entire component located on this pallet, this means combustible that produce energy but also non combustible material that acts as a well. It also takes into account the arrangement of the combustible regarding that more ventilated is the fire, more important will be the power reached. Then, solving the global equilibrium between source and well enables to give a prediction of the heat release rate. This model was validated using a large number of fire tests achieved in the INERIS fire tunnel used as a large calorimeter. These tests include pallets that contain for example appliances, food products, toys, water bottle, clothes and some other. The comparison between the measured and computed heat release rate for those different products demonstrate the capability of the model...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{competitive}} environment has forced companies to rethink {{and come up}} with strategies for cost minimization. Logistics accounts for {{a significant part of the}} total costs in a manufacturing company, thus leaving room for major reductions through re-engineering of logistics processes. In logistics, packaging has become an important focus area where there are opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce costs associated with logistics. Furthermore, pallet configurations have always been an area of concern for various industries. Packing boxes onto pallets, i. e. palletization, consists of arranging different products that are packed in boxes onto pallets in the most efficient way. An efficient palletization system has many advantages such as cost reduction of transportation and inventory, reduced loading and unloading operation times, and facilitation of freight handling. A minor increase in the number of products loaded on the pallet may lead to significant savings. The purpose of this study has been to assess and evaluate McNeil AB’s packaging system focusing mainly on the pallet configurations and the impact these have on various logistical activities. McNeil AB, a Johnson & Johnson company, is a world leading organization in smoking cessation products, with the Nicorette brand recognized globally. The Nicorette products come in different forms, such as gums, inhalers, lozenges and nasal sprays. In order to achieve the objectives of the study, the boxes and the pallet configurations of the company have been reviewed and analyzed from a packaging logistics point of view. The analysis has resulted in a set of modified boxes and pallet reconfigurations to improve efficiency. In fact, eight boxes have been modified and given new dimensions based on the optimal pallet configuration. Also, of the total 52 pallet configurations that exist within the company, 36 have been modified with either new layers, modified boxes or modified pallet configuration. These new modified pallet configurations do not only result in an improved external filling rate but also in pallet loads that are more secure and stable. The reconfigurations have led to the fact that the external filling rate of the pallet loads has improved by 24, 5 %, going from an average external filling rate of 66, 5 % to 82, 8 %. To evaluate the impact of the changes that have been made, a cost analysis has been carried out to determine the savings of the proposed modifications. The cost analysis has been based on transportation, <b>warehousing</b> and <b>pallet</b> costs. With the proposed modified boxes and pallet reconfigurations, annual savings of approximately 1 MSEK can be achieved. Other benefits with the proposed boxes and pallet configurations are increased product safety, less pallets to handle and lower environmental impact, all of which lead to a more efficient logistics flow.
