40|$|OBJECTIVE:: Transfusion-related acute lung {{injury is}} the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality. A {{prospective}} study using electronic surveillance was conducted at two academic medical centers in the United States with the objective to define the clinical course and outcomes in transfusion-related acute lung injury cases. DESIGN:: Prospective case study with controls. SETTING:: University of California, San Francisco and Mayo Clinic, Rochester. PATIENTS:: We prospectively enrolled 89 patients <b>with</b> transfusion-related <b>acute</b> lung injury, 164 transfused controls, and 145 patients <b>with</b> possible transfusion-related <b>acute</b> lung injury. INTERVENTIONS:: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Patients <b>with</b> transfusion-related <b>acute</b> lung injury had fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and prolonged hypoxemia compared with controls. Of the patients <b>with</b> transfusion-related <b>acute</b> lung injury, 29 of 37 patients (78 %) required initiation of mechanical ventilation and 13 of 53 (25 %) required initiation of vasopressors. Patients <b>with</b> transfusion-related <b>acute</b> lung injury and possible transfusion-related acute lung injury had an increased duration of mechanical ventilation and increased days in the ICU and hospital compared with controls. There were 15 of 89 patients <b>with</b> transfusion-related <b>acute</b> lung injury (17 %) who died, whereas 61 of 145 patients <b>with</b> possible transfusion-related <b>acute</b> lung injury (42 %) died and 7 of 164 of controls (4 %) died. Patients <b>with</b> transfusion-related <b>acute</b> lung injury had evidence of more systemic inflammation with increases in circulating neutrophils and a decrease in platelets compared with controls. Patients <b>with</b> transfusion-related <b>acute</b> lung injury and possible transfusion-related acute lung injury also had a statistically significant increase in plasma interleukin- 8, interleukin- 10, and interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist posttransfusion compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS:: In conclusion, transfusion-related acute lung injury produced a condition resembling the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and was associated with substantial in-hospital morbidity and mortality in patients <b>with</b> transfusion-related <b>acute</b> lung injury compared with transfused controls. Patients <b>with</b> possible transfusion-related <b>acute</b> lung injury had even higher in-hospital morbidity and mortality, suggesting that clinical outcomes in this group are mainly influenced by the underlying acute lung injury risk factor(s). © 2014 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine...|$|R

5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those <b>with</b> <b>acute</b> or chronic liver disease. Episodes can be triggered by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte problems, or certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of ammonia in the blood, a substance that is normally removed by the liver. The diagnosis is typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported by blood ammonia levels, an electroencephalogram, or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E

2500|$|As for the Latin alphabet, {{there was}} no {{standardized}} orthography in use in the Middle Ages. A {{modified version of the}} letter wynn called vend was used briefly for the sounds , , and [...] Long vowels were sometimes marked <b>with</b> <b>acutes,</b> but also sometimes left unmarked or geminated. The standardized Old Norse spelling was created in the 19th century, and is for the most part phonemic. The most notable deviation is that the non-phonemic difference between the voiced and the voiceless dental fricative is marked—the oldest texts as well as runic inscriptions use þ exclusively. Long vowels are denoted <b>with</b> <b>acutes.</b> Most other letters are written with the same glyph as the IPA phoneme, except as shown in the table below.|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{assess whether}} {{pancreatic}} function is impaired in children <b>with</b> severe <b>acute</b> malnutrition, is different between edematous vs nonedematous malnutrition, and improves by nutritional rehabilitation. Study design We followed 89 children <b>with</b> severe <b>acute</b> malnutrition admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Stool and blood samples were taken on admission and 3 days after initial stabilization to determine exocrine pancreatic function via fecal elastase- 1 (FE- 1) and serum trypsinogen and amylase levels. Results A total of 33 children (37. 1 %) had nonedematous severe acute malnutrition, whereas 56 (62. 9 %) had edematous severe acute malnutrition. On admission, 92 % of patients showed evidence of pancreatic insufficiency {{as measured by}} FE- 1 57 ng/mL) in 28 % and amylase in 21 % (> 110 U/L) of children, suggesting pancreatic inflammation. Conclusion Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is prevalent in children <b>with</b> severe <b>acute</b> malnutrition and especially in children <b>with</b> edematous severe <b>acute</b> malnutrition. In addition, biochemical signs suggestive of pancreatitis are common in children <b>with</b> severe <b>acute</b> malnutrition. These results have implications for standard rehabilitation treatment of children <b>with</b> severe <b>acute</b> malnutrition who may benefit from pancreatic enzyme replacement therap...|$|R
