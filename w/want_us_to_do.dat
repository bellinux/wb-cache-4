500|$|The filmmakers {{reported}} receiving [...] "lots {{of cards}} and letters" [...] from the church, though {{in their case}} it had limited its response to [...] "loads of legal paperwork". HBO had earlier said that it had put [...] "probably 160 lawyers" [...] onto the task of reviewing the film in anticipation of challenges from the notoriously litigious church. Sheila Nevins of HBO commented {{that she could not}} believe how aggressive the church had been. Not only did it effectively provide free advertising for the film, but its hostility had made HBO Documentary Films even more determined to produce the film: [...] "I thought, 'They really don't <b>want</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.

500|$|In April 1998, {{three years}} after the game was released, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System came under {{criticism}} for owning 435,000 shares worth $9 million in Cendant, which by this point had purchased Sierra On-Line, due to the violence in the Phantasmagoria and other Sierra games. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, and Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, all asked the system to sell its stock. McConnell was particularly critical of the rape scene. They suggested a link existed between recent student slayings in West Paducah, Kentucky, and Jonesboro, Arkansas, and the [...] "increasingly violent world many American children enter when they sit down {{in front of a computer}} screen". Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: [...] "We're not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our children. We know that our membership would not <b>want</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that." [...] The same letter was also sent to heads of teachers' retirement systems in California, Ohio and Texas.|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Lewis was famously arrested outside Elvis Presley's Graceland {{home for}} {{allegedly}} intending to shoot him. [...] Lewis had already nearly killed his bass player, Butch Owens, on September 29 (Lewis's 41st birthday) when a [...]357 accidentally {{went off in}} his hand. In Rick Bragg's 2014 authorized biography, Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, Lewis explains that the reclusive Presley {{had been trying to}} reach him and finally did on November 23, imploring him to [...] "come out to the house." [...] Lewis replied that he would if he had time but that he was busy trying to get his father, Elmo, out of jail in Tunica, for driving under the influence. Later that night, Lewis was at a Memphis nightclub called Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. [...] "Charles Feron, he owned Vapors, he give it to me," [...] Lewis explained to Bragg. [...] "A [...]38 derringer. Me, pretty well drunk, with that derringer – it ain't somethin' 'strange'." [...] Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new Lincoln Continental with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates because [...] "the nose of that Lincoln was a mile long." [...] Presley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle through the car window, not realizing it was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but [...] "Elvis, watching on the closed-circuit television, told guards to call the police. The Memphis police found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening 'the', away in handcuffs." [...] Lewis said, [...] "The cops asked Elvis, 'What do you <b>want</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me – knowin' me the way he did – was ridiculous." [...] Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. [...] Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mug shot was wired around the world. Presley {{died of a heart attack}} at Graceland eight months later.|$|E
