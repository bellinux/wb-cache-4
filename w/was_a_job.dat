5|$|The King {{must have}} been {{impressed}} by Edington's performance, because in 1344 he made him treasurer of the realm, a position he held for the exceptionally long period of twelve years. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> fraught with problems, as the nation was in serious financial difficulties by the mid-1340s. The treasury was in great debt from the heavy demands of {{the early stages of}} the Hundred Years' War. By then reneging on his debts, the king had lost public confidence, and struggled to obtain new loans. Edington saw the need to bring all royal expenditure under the oversight of the exchequer. This did not entail controlling the King's use of his resources– a move Edward would have resented greatly– but simply attempting to budget all revenues and expenses. By the early 1360s this was largely achieved; a testimony to the capabilities and energy of Edington as an administrator. In 1356 he was named chancellor, a post he held until his retirement from the national scene in 1363, possibly for health reasons.|$|E

25|$|After World War II, LeMay {{was briefly}} {{transferred}} to The Pentagon as {{deputy chief of}} Air Staff for Research & Development. In 1947, he returned to Europe as commander of USAF Europe, heading operations for the Berlin Airlift in 1948 {{in the face of}} a blockade by the Soviet Union and its satellite states that threatened to starve the civilian population of the Western occupation zones of Berlin. Under LeMay's direction, Douglas C-54 Skymasters that could each carry 10 tons of cargo began supplying the city on July 1. By the fall, the airlift was bringing in an average of 5,000 tons of supplies a day with 500 daily flights. The airlift continued for 11 months, with 213,000 flights operated by six countries brought in 1.7 million tons of food and fuel to Berlin. Faced with the failure of its blockade, the Soviet Union relented and reopened land corridors to the West. Though LeMay is sometimes publicly credited with the success of the Berlin Airlift, it was, in fact, instigated by General Lucius D. Clay when General Clay called LeMay about the problem. LeMay initially started flying supplies into Berlin, but then decided that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> for a logistics expert and he found that person in Lt. General William H. Tunner, who took over the operational end of the Berlin Airlift.|$|E

2500|$|The Susquehanna Boom {{was placed}} {{in an area of}} the river that had a large bend that drew the logs to {{the south side of the}} river. It worked as a type of corral, a corral for logs.

Boys as young as 12 worked among the cribs. They had to identify one of over 1,700 marks found on the logs and send them along in a raft to the proper sawmill. Sorting these logs was the first job a boy could get on the Susquehanna Boom. The [...] "Boom Rats" [...] walked along long planks known as [...] "stretchers" [...] that connected the 352 cribs.
