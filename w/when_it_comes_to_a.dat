500|$|One {{of green}} marketing's {{challenges}} {{is the lack}} of standards or public consensus about what constitutes [...] "green," [...] according to Joel Makower, a writer on green marketing.

This lack of consensus—by consumers, marketers, activists, regulators, and influential people—has slowed the growth of green products, says Makower, because companies are often reluctant to promote their green attributes, and consumers are often skeptical about claims.|$|E
