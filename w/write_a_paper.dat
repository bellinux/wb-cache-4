25|$|De Zeeuw {{was born}} in 1936 in Banjoewangi Indonesia, in the former Dutch Indies in a middle-class family. Part of the Second World War {{he and his family}} were imprisoned in Japanese prison camps.

After class, Edna and Principal Skinner's apple picking date is cancelled when Skinner's mother, Agnes, interrupts. At the Simpson house, Bart is distracted from writing his paper, {{and at the end}} of the three weeks, he still has not started the assignment. The day before the date of submission, he asks Grampa for help. Edna rejects Bart's paper and tells him that he will have to do it correctly after school. As Bart finishes the assignment after school, supervised by Edna herself, he observes Skinner cancel a movie date with Edna when Agnes calls. Bart consoles Edna, and she reluctantly accepts his offer to accompany her to the movie.|$|E

25|$|For a period, Fromm {{was also}} active in U.S. politics. He joined the Socialist Party of America in the mid-1950s, and {{did his best}} to help them provide an {{alternative}} viewpoint to the prevailing McCarthyism of the time. This alternative viewpoint was best expressed in his 1961 paper May Man Prevail? An Inquiry into the Facts and Fictions of Foreign Policy. However, as a co-founder of SANE, Fromm's strongest political activism was in the international peace movement, fighting against the nuclear arms race and U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. After supporting Senator Eugene McCarthy's losing bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, Fromm more or less retreated from the American political scene, although he did <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> in 1974 entitled Remarks on the Policy of Détente for a hearing held by the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate cortex activity increases when errors {{occur and}} are being monitored as well as having behavioral conflicts with the self-concept {{as a form of}} higher-level thinking. A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity. University students had to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> depending on if they were assigned to a high-choice or low-choice condition. The low-choice condition required student to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. The point of this condition was to see how significant the counterchoice may affect a person's ability to cope. The high-choice condition asked students to write in favor of tuition increase as if it was their choice and that it was completely voluntary. EEG was used to analyze students before writing the essay as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants. Results have shown that the initial experience of dissonance can be apparent in the {{anterior cingulate cortex}}, then the left frontal cortex is activated, which also activates the approach motivational system to reduce anger.|$|E
25|$|The first mention {{related to}} the history of the {{religion}} known in South Carolina was in a newspaper article. It was published in June 1865 in The Daily Phoenix of Columbia, South Carolina, on the front page, reviewing events that occurred from 1844–1850 or so. The source of the extended quote is not named, and makes mistakes typical of the period. See also Josephus on Jesus. It was originally presented in an article in The Literary World of June 14, 1851, as a letter dated February 10, 1851, by Dr. Rev. Austin H. Wright to the American Oriental Society. It was subsequently also published in a newspaper June 26, 1851, and was published in a German newspaper in 1851 translated by his superior, Rev. Justin Perkins. Wright, father of Lucy Myers Wright Mitchell and John Henry Wright, was a medical missionary from New England, and gained his medical degree in Virginia. Wright {{was the first person to}} <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> giving an account on Bábism, and died in what was then called Urumiah, Persia, January 14, 1865. The Daily Phoenix itself began publication March 1865 after Sherman's March to the Sea that burned a third of the city or more and by April was being published as a daily paper. Julian A. Shelby, the newspaper publisher, lived to 1907.|$|E

2500|$|Although Wild wrote {{most of the}} papers, he was {{characteristically}} {{generous in}} giving credit to others, saying [...] "I did put other people's names on them because they'd made important contributions". One, for example, was technical assistant Bill Rowe. During a period when the solar cycle was at a minimum and nothing was happening, Rowe drove down to Dapto for an 11 am appointment. Wild remarked: Out of sheer conscientiousness he arrived at 8 am, switched on the gear and recorded the most magnificent outburst, {{which led to the}} discovery of first and second harmonics.

2500|$|After excelling {{in grade}} school and junior high, in 1923, Wright earned the {{position}} of class valedictorian of Smith Robertson junior high school. He was assigned to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> to be delivered at graduation in a public auditorium. Later, he was called to the principal's office, where the principal gave him a prepared speech to present in place of his own. Richard challenged the principal, saying [...] "...the people are coming to hear the students, and I won't make a speech that you've written." [...] The principal threatened him, suggesting that Richard might {{not be allowed to}} graduate if he persisted, despite having passed all the examinations. He also tried to entice Richard with an opportunity to become a teacher. Determined not to be called an Uncle Tom, Richard refused to deliver the principal's address, written to avoid offending the white school district officials. The principal put pressure on one of Richard's uncles to speak to the boy and get him to change his mind, but Richard continued to be adamant about presenting his own speech, and refused to let his uncle edit it. Despite pressure even from his classmates, Richard delivered his speech as he had planned.|$|E

Stella always vowed she never could write anything unless she threw each sheet down as she completed it. Anne, in her flannel blouse and serge skirt, with her hair rather blown from her windy walk home, was sitting squarely in the middle of the floor, teasing the Sarah-cat with a wishbone. Joseph and Rusty were both curled up in her lap. A warm plummy odor filled the whole house, for Priscilla was cooking in the kitchen. Presently she came in, enshrouded in a huge work-apron, with a smudge of flour on her nose, to show Aunt Jamesina the chocolate cake she had just iced.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stockton {{bestowed}} upon her {{the name of}} Pomona, which is now a household word in myriads of homes. This extraordinary girl, and some household experiences, induced Mr. Stockton to <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>paper</b> for Scribner's Monthly which he called Rudder Grange. This one paper was all he intended to write, but it attracted immediate attention, was extensively noticed, and much talked about. The editor of the magazine received so many letters asking for another paper that Mr. Stockton wrote the second one; and as {{there was still a}} clamor for more, he, after a little time, wrote others of the series. Some time later they were collected in a book. For those interested in Pomona I will add, that while the girl was an actual personage, with all the characteristics given to her by her chronicler, the woman Pomona was a development in Mr. Stockton's mind of the girl as he imagined she would become, for the original passed out of our lives while still a girl.|$|E
