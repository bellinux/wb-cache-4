5|$|In 2004, {{proposals}} {{to widen the}} highway to six lanes between Downingtown and Valley Forge were made. In 2007, the western terminus of the <b>widening</b> project was scaled back from Downingtown to the proposed PA 29 slip ramp. Plans for the <b>widening</b> were presented {{to the public in}} 2009. Later that year, the <b>widening</b> was put on hold because of engineering problems. The <b>widening</b> plans resumed in 2010. Work was due to begin in 2013, with completion in 2015. In October 2012, the project was postponed a year because of delays in the approval of permits.|$|E
5|$|Once <b>widening</b> is {{completed}} from Mid-County to Lansdale, a similar project will begin {{on the next}} segment of highway, from Lansdale to Quakertown. As done on the first project, the Lansdale-to-Quakertown segment will be rebuilt in two sections, with a southern half starting fall 2017, with <b>widening</b> to 6 lanes and full shoulders. Advance work began in spring 2013 with replacement of several bridges in this area north of Lansdale, with work on the actual <b>widening</b> to begin in fall 2017.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{nonlinear}} {{finite element}} method, the basic characters of <b>widened</b> road engineering are studied. It is {{found that the}} maximal lateral displacement of embankment achieved in the <b>widened</b> part, especially happened at the intersection between original part and <b>widened</b> part, which increased with the width of <b>widened</b> part increased. The maximal vertical settlement of embankment increased with width of <b>widened</b> part increased. The width of <b>widened</b> part has little influence on the failure surface and stability of embankment...|$|R

5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{is working}} on {{improvements}} to MD 404 {{in order to provide}} relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts, notably by <b>widening</b> the remainder of the route into a four-lane divided highway. The primary motive behind the <b>widening</b> is the high accident rate that plagues the two-lane road, brought on by beach traffic. The divided highway portion of MD 404 in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection east of where MD 16 joins the route. The section between south of Legion Road and Double Hills Road was widened in 2005 while the section between Double Hills Road and Sennett Road was widened in 2007. This project received $3 million from the federal government in 2001. As part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17, 2009, $7.7 million went to <b>widening</b> a portion of MD 404 east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County, creating 221 jobs. The <b>widening</b> of this section was completed in 2012. On May 21, 2014, groundbreaking took place to widen MD 404 between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road. The project to widen this section of will cost a total of $39 million. On June 25, 2015, Governor Larry Hogan announced that state funding would be allocated to finish <b>widening</b> MD 404 between US 50 and Denton, among other projects across the state. A total of $160 million in funds would go to <b>widening</b> MD 404. The work on this is nearing completion in early 2017. <b>Widening</b> of the section between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road is expected to be completed by summer 2017 while <b>widening</b> of the remaining sections of MD 404 between US 50 and Denton is planned to be completed by late 2017.|$|E

5|$|Since MD 404 is {{the main}} route for {{travelers}} between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches, the road has a high accident rate. To improve on this situation, the Maryland State Highway Administration is planning to widen the two-lane portions of the route into a four-lane divided highway.

5|$|The {{original}} idea for constructing {{a replacement for}} Mission Avenue dates from 1950. By 1961, there were plans to make SR76 a freeway from Oceanside to Fallbrook Road, and an expressway from there to US395. The following year, the new Highway 76 Association formed a committee to promote the upgrade of the road into Pauma Valley. In 1963, more specific plans were proposed by the Highway Development Association initiative, including making the portions from Foussat Road and the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia and from Vista Way to Mission Road an expressway, and making {{the part of the}} highway in Oceanside wider. In 1964, the state allocated funds for the <b>widening</b> of SR76 to four lanes in Oceanside, and in October1965, the first portion of the <b>widening</b> from Carey Road to Frontier Drive entered the bidding phase. The next part of the <b>widening</b> entered the bidding phase in December 1968, and extended from Frontier Drive to near the Mission.|$|E

The chairman of the Ramona Planning Group suggested calming traffic by using a roundabout instead of <b>widening</b> the highway.|$|E
50|$|The first WiDEN-compatible {{device to}} be {{released}} was the Motorola iM240 PC card which allows raw data speeds up to 60 kbit/s. The first WiDEN-compatible telephones are the Motorola i850 and i760, which were released mid-summer 2005. The recent i850/i760 Software Upgrade enables <b>WiDEN</b> on both of these phones. The commercial launch of <b>WiDEN</b> came {{with the release of}} the Motorola i870 on 31 October 2005, however, most people never got to experience the <b>WiDEN</b> capability in their handsets. <b>WiDEN</b> is also offered in the i930/i920 Smartphone, however, Sprint shipped these units with <b>WiDEN</b> service disabled. Many in the cellular forum communities have found ways using Motorola's own RSS software to activate it. <b>WiDEN</b> was available in most places on Nextel's National Network. As stated above, it no longer is enabled on the Sprint-controlled towers. Since the Sprint Nextel merger the company determined that because Sprint's CDMA network was already 3G and going to EVDO (broadband speeds), and then EVDO Rev A, it would be redundant to keep upgrading the iDEN data network. <b>WiDEN</b> is considered a 2.5G technology.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Let n be a nonnegative integer. We call <b>widened</b> permuta- tion a {{bijection}} {{between two}} (n+ 1) -sets having n elements in common. A <b>widened</b> derangement is a <b>widened</b> permutation without xed points. In this paper we determine combinatorial interpretations of these func- tions {{in the context}} of the theory of species of Joyal. In particular, we prove that the species of the <b>widened</b> permutations is isomorphic to the derivative of the species of permutations. Looking at the generating series we obtain enumerative results, which are also obtained in a di- rect way. Finally, we prove that the sequence of <b>widened</b> derangement numbers turns out to coincide with the integer sequence A 000255 of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences...|$|R
