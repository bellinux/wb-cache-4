25|$|The reader may <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> a {{competent}} scientist does not publish a detailed refutation of Reich's absurd biological speculations. The {{answer is that}} the informed scientist doesn't care, and would, in fact, damage his reputation by taking the time to undertake such a thankless task.|$|E
25|$|I'll always regret what I've put {{my family}} through. There's {{a lot of}} shame and regret. People <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> I haven't broken down or shed a tear (in public). My tears are {{something}} that I hold close to me; they're {{for me and my}} family.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Australian {{portrait}} photographer Michel Lawrence published All of Us, a book containing photographs of people born in 200 other countries, but who were {{now living in}} Australia. Lawrence said the All of Us project was wholly inspired by the Cronulla riots. “You watch this stuff on TV and you <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> people are doing this - this is no way for a multicultural society to behave,” said Lawrence.|$|E

25|$|The fairies <b>wonder</b> <b>why,</b> if {{the mortal}} world is so miserable, its {{inhabitants}} {{do not take}} their own lives. Selene explains that mortals have one great gift that makes life worth living – the gift of Love. The fairies are in wonder at Selene's description, as they have never experienced Love. Selene explains that Love is unnecessary. Moreover, {{it is impossible for}} them to experience it, as only a mortal can inspire love, and mortals cannot set foot in Fairyland.|$|E
25|$|Filippo Maria Visconti, the Duke of Milan, has {{attended}} a ball, but he leaves early and encounters his assembled courtiers. He is bored with everyone; {{all seem to}} be paying obeisance to his wife because they regard her as the more powerful, his title and power having come only from his marriage to her: “Such torment and such martyrdom I cannot bear much longer”. His sycophantic courtiers tell him how much they sympathize but <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> he does not break free given his position as Duke. Also, they warn {{him that if he}} does not act, Beatrice's servants may well begin plotting against him.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of gaming, the idea of love and romance was used {{as little more than a}} plot point to urge the hero to {{complete}} the set of tasks put before him. Mario, hero of the Super Mario series of games, has Princess Peach to rescue from the main villain. Link and Princess Zelda from The Legend of Zelda series made gamers <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> the two were not romantically together while rooting for the couple. Double Dragon features the protagonist Billy Lee, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend (Maria) from his evil twin brother (Jimmy), leader of a sinister street gang. This era of game-playing was not well known for equal opportunity in gender roles.|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} (or respondent) conditioning, {{behavior is}} understood as responses triggered by certain environmental or physical stimuli. They can be unconditioned, such as in-born reflexes, or learned through the pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a different stimulus, which then becomes a conditioned stimulus. In relation to motivation, classical conditioning {{might be seen as}} one explanation as to why an individual performs certain responses and behaviors in certain situations. For instance, a dentist might <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> a patient does not seem motivated to show up for an appointment, with the explanation being that the patient has associated the dentist (conditioned stimulus) with the pain (unconditioned stimulus) that elicits a fear response (conditioned response), leading to the patient being reluctant to visit the dentist.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{engaging}} in observable compulsions, {{the person with}} this subtype might perform more covert, mental rituals, or might feel driven to avoid the situations in which particular thoughts seem likely to intrude. As {{a result of this}} avoidance, people can struggle to fulfill both public and private roles, even if they place great value on these roles and even if they had fulfilled the roles successfully in the past. Moreover, the individual's avoidance can confuse others who do not know its origin or intended purpose, {{as it did in the}} case of a man whose wife began to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> he would not hold their infant child. The covert mental rituals can take up a great deal of a person's time during the day.|$|E
25|$|West Palm Beach Fire Rescue {{responded to}} the call and found 53-year-old Jorge Barahona {{on the ground and}} 10-year-old Victor Barahona in the cab of the truck. Both were {{conscious}} by the time rescuers arrived, but Victor was convulsing with seizures. One fireman was overcome by a strong smell when approaching the truck, and decontamination procedures were started. The bed of the truck was full of plastic containers of chemicals; some unlabeled. The truck was branded with the name of Jorge's pest extermination business, CJ Pest Control, causing investigators to believe the chemicals were pesticides. One unlabeled container held some form of acid, causing firefighters to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> an exterminator would have such a chemical. State Troopers were sent to the address of CJ Pest Control, but were unable to contact anyone.|$|E

25|$|When Henry is {{pronounced}} dead, Emma and Regina {{return to the}} Hospital {{to say goodbye to}} his body. Emma kisses him on the forehead, causing a pulse of energy to engulf the entire town and restore everyone's true memories while freeing Henry from the effects of the poisoned apple. Snow and Charming reunite with each other and Regina returns to her mansion alone as Emma begins to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> no one is returning to the Other World since the curse is broken. Rumplestiltskin reunites with his true love Belle (Emilie de Ravin) and takes her to a Wishing Well {{deep in the heart of}} the forest, a well with the power to restore that which one had lost. He takes the potion and drops it into the well, causing a purple cloud to emerge and consume Storybrooke as the Clock Tower strikes 8:15.|$|E
25|$|Tension builds as {{business}} associates <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> Bartleby is always there. Sensing {{the threat to}} his reputation but emotionally unable to evict Bartleby, the narrator moves his business out. Soon the new tenants come {{to ask for help}} in removing Bartleby, who now sits on the stairs all day and sleeps in the building's doorway at night. The narrator visits him and attempts to reason with him, and surprises even himself by inviting Bartleby to come live with him, but Bartleby declines the offer. Later the narrator returns to find that Bartleby has been forcibly removed and imprisoned in the Tombs. Finding Bartleby glummer than usual during a visit, the narrator bribes a turnkey to make sure he gets enough food. When the narrator returns a few days later to check on Bartleby, he has died of starvation, having preferred not to eat.|$|E
25|$|Cinderpaw {{falls from}} the Sky Oak, {{breaking}} her back leg. As Leafpool's determination to heal her begins to border on an obsession, Jaypaw begins to <b>wonder</b> <b>why.</b> One night, he falls asleep by Cinderpaw and wakes up in a strange forest. There he meets Cinderpaw, unhurt, who leads him to a camp filled with familiar smells; ThunderClan's previous home in the forest. Cinderpaw describes how she once lived there before the Great Journey and asks Jaypaw to tell Leafpool that she is proud of her, and that she has learned far more than she could have ever taught her. By then Jaypaw is confused, but upon looking into Cinderpaw's eyes, he sees a series of flashbacks from her previous life. Jaypaw realizes that when Cinderpelt, the former ThunderClan medicine cat, died in Twilight she was reincarnated as Cinderpaw, without Cinderpaw herself knowing it. However, when Cinderpaw wakes she does not remember the dream, only that Jaypaw {{had been able to}} see in it.|$|E

25|$|Critics of {{the drought}} theory <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> the {{southern}} and central lowland cities were abandoned {{and the northern}} cities like Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and Coba continued to thrive. One critic argued that Chichen Itza revamped its political, military, religious, and economic institutions away from powerful lords or kings. Inhabitants of the northern Yucatán also had access to seafood, which might have explained the survival of Chichen Itza and Mayapan, cities away from the coast but within reach of coastal food supplies. Critics of the drought theory also point to current weather patterns: much heavier rainfall in the southern lowlands compared to the lighter amount of rain in the northern Yucatán. Drought theory supporters state that the entire regional climate changed, including the amount of rainfall, so that modern rainfall patterns are not indicative of rainfall from 800 to 900. LSU archaeologist Heather McKillop found a significant rise in sea level along the coast nearest the southern Maya lowlands, coinciding {{with the end of}} the Classic period, and indicating climate change.|$|E
25|$|In {{the title}} sequence, Arthur is shown meeting Terry {{at the prison}} gates {{following}} his release. He drives a white Ford Capri, although it is never made clear whether Terry had bought the vehicle from Arthur, hence their meeting, or if Arthur had given to Terry this car {{as part of their}} ensuing working deal, {{in the same manner as}} the flat that Arthur houses Terry in. (Terry drives a copper coloured Capri in some mid-run episodes, and a silver Capri in several others, and the exact model is seen to vary between different episodes). Terry enjoys a drink but usually responsibly, does not smoke and has an eye for the ladies. Despite his incarceration, he is honest, trustworthy and loyal, particularly to Arthur, although the scrapes that Arthur lands him in make him <b>wonder</b> <b>why.</b> He is intelligent and streetwise enough to disperse situations that his role as minder often lands himself - and Arthur or those around him - in, although at the same time is seen not to be strong willed enough to break free of Arthur's often devious ways of keeping their working relationship in place.|$|E
500|$|With {{objections}} dismissed, Huxley {{remarks that}} [...] "Dr. Cott {{is a true}} follower of Darwin in driving his conclusions home by sheer weight of example," [...] observing that [...] "Faced with his long lists of demonstrative cases, the reader is tempted to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> adaptive theories of coloration have been singled out for attack by anti-selectionists." [...] Huxley also noted Cott's [...] "constant cross-reference to human affairs", {{and that it was}} good to know that Cott was applying his principles [...] "to the practice of camouflage in war".|$|E
