5|$|Different {{societies}} and cultures have used family symbols in advertising to varying extents of success. Because family life stresses in-group benefits, preferences, and successes over {{those of the}} individual, collectivist societies tend to use more family symbols in advertising than individualist societies. For example, Korea, which is reputably collectivistic, has more success <b>with</b> <b>family</b> advertisements than the United States, which is reputably individualistic.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis note {{is about}} work in {{progress}} {{on the topic of}} “internal type theory” where we investigate the internal formalization of the categorical metatheory of constructive type theory in (an extension of) itself. The basic notion is that of a category <b>with</b> <b>families,</b> a categorical notion of model of dependent type theory. We discuss how to formalize the notion of category <b>with</b> <b>families</b> inside type theory and how to build initial categories <b>with</b> <b>families.</b> Initial categories <b>with</b> <b>families</b> will be term models which play the role of canonical syntax for dependent type theory. We also discuss the formalization of the result that categories with finite limits give rise to categories <b>with</b> <b>families.</b> This yields a type-theoretic perspective on Curien's work on “substitution up to isomorphism”. Our formalization is being carried out in the proof assistant Agda 2 developed at Chalmers...|$|R

5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting <b>with</b> <b>family</b> and friends at his house in Canton, being kept up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E

5|$|Constructed by the Ruthvens {{after they}} {{acquired}} the castle around 1515, the Ruthven Lodging represents {{the final stage}} of building at Dirleton. In the later part of the 16th century, it served as the main residence of Lady Dorothea, wife of the first Earl of Gowrie, and their 15 children. The three-storey building is constructed, like the Haliburton range, from undressed stone, although the Ruthven Lodging is decorated with string courses, horizontal mouldings running around the walls. The large windows were protected by iron grilles and small gun holes. The rectangular Lodging is immediately {{to the north of the}} de Vaux building, separated by a narrow irregular courtyard, which is accessed via a passage in the ground floor of the Lodging. The remainder of the ground floor was occupied by cellars, <b>with</b> <b>family</b> rooms and bedrooms on the upper floors. The first-floor dining room was paved with patterned floor tiles, and may once have had a painted timber ceiling.|$|E
5|$|Elephants have a fission–fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact <b>with</b> <b>family</b> groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Following the European tour, Butthole Surfers {{experienced}} more upheaval when Nervosa left around Christmas 1985, {{as she was}} tired of the living conditions associated with constant touring and had a desire to be <b>with</b> <b>family.</b> She was replaced by another female drummer, Kytha Gernatt, who was dubbed Cabbage Gomez, Jr. in the press soon after joining the band. Cabbage had previously performed with Kathleen Lynch (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da the Shit Lady) in the band Easturn Stars; Lynch gained fame as Butthole Surfers' infamous naked dancer from 1986 to 1989. Kramer also left during this period and was replaced by Jeff Pinkus, who gave the band's bass position its longest period of stability by staying until 1994.|$|E

40|$|Aims and objectives. To {{describe}} {{the process that}} nurses experienced in engaging <b>with</b> <b>families</b> in Malaysian palliative care settings and the challenges they faced. Background. In palliative care settings, nurses and the terminally ill person's family members interact very closely with each other. It is important for nurses to work <b>with</b> <b>families</b> {{to ensure that the}} care of the terminally ill person is optimised. Research design. A qualitative design using grounded theory methods was used to describe how nurses engaged <b>with</b> <b>families</b> and the challenges they faced. Methods. Twenty-two nurses from home care and inpatient palliative care settings across Malaysia participated in this study. Data were collected through seven interviews and eight focus group discussions conducted between 2007 - 2009. Results. The main problem identified by nurses was the different expectations to patient care <b>with</b> <b>families.</b> The participants used the core process of Engaging <b>with</b> <b>families</b> to resolve these differences and implemented strategies described as Prepar- ing families for palliative care, Modifying care and Staying engaged to promote greater consistency and quality of care. When participants were able to resolve their different expectations <b>with</b> <b>families,</b> these resulted in positive outcomes, described as Harmony. However, negative outcomes of participants not being able to resolve their different expectations <b>with</b> <b>families</b> were Disharmony. Conclusions. This study highlights the importance of engaging and supporting families of the terminally ill as well as provid- ing a guide that may be used by nurses and carers to better respond to families' needs and concerns. Relevance to clinical practice. The study draws attention to the need for formal palliative care education, inclusive of family care, to enable nurses to provide the terminally ill person and their family effective and appropriate care...|$|R

5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases.

Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on the}} decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E

Tjakra Amidjaja consoles her, and tells her that they will leave the village in two days. In the meantime, the volcano grows increasingly violent and Tjakra Amidjaja and Sadidjah stay behind to manage the evacuation. They send their children, Hasan and Soerijati, to stay <b>with</b> <b>family</b> in Rangkas Gombong. Krakatoa erupts several hours later. The village is wiped out in the resulting tsunami, and Soerijati is lost after she falls out of the carriage she is in; Hasan, however, arrives safely in Rangkas Gombong.|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, {{slightly}} over 228,000 residents were evacuated from low-lying areas before the storm.

Included in the evacuation total were 6,000 tourists and over 1,000 residents in rickety houses. Workers protected tobacco leaves by moving them to sealed warehouses, and transported cattle and livestock to higher ground. The hurricane forced the closure of schools and the cancellation of some flights. The Cuban government issued a Hurricane Watch for Pinar del Río Province, Havana, Havana Province, and Isla de la Juventud 21hours before Irene hit. These areas, along with Matanzas Province, were upgraded to a Hurricane Warning 15hours before Irene hit the area.|$|E
