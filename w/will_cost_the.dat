The FDA estimates the ban <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>the</b> food industry $6.2 billion over 20 years as the industry reformulates products and substitutes new ingredients for trans fat. The benefits are estimated at $140 billion over 20 years mainly from lower health care spending. Food companies can petition the FDA for approval of specific uses of partially hydrogenated oils if the companies submit data proving the oils' use is safe.|$|E
25|$|At random times {{throughout}} the game, though commonly in colonizing new planets, the player is presented with ethical {{choices in the}} form of events where a wide-ranging decision needs to be made. Typically the good choice <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>the</b> player something (either directly or indirectly). Conversely, the evil choice can bring benefits, albeit {{at the expense of other}} civilizations or the player's own population. A neutral choice is also presented as a compromise. To keep the game's ethics uncontroversial, the choices are made very clear-cut.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} the 421-a tax {{abatement}} program unfairly drains city tax revenue. The current tax breaks cost the city about $1.4 billion in lost tax revenue annually. The city government estimated that the new program signed into law <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>the</b> city an extra $82 {{million a year in}} uncollected property taxes, compared to the program proposal made in 2015. An analysis by the IBO found that a 35-year tax abatement program would cost $8.4 billion over the next ten years, although developers claim that this figure assumes that qualifying projects would have been built without the exemption anyway.|$|E

Since that flood, the passage has been closed to the public and a safety boom ahead of the rapids re-installed. Returning flood-ravaged Harvie Passage to its {{short-lived}} status as a world-class water playground <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>the</b> province millions and keep it closed until at least 2018. It is estimated that rebuilding the Harvie Passage to the original intent of the project (completed in 2012) would cost an estimated $23.4 million.|$|E

[...] Since almost all skills {{are based on}} Dexterity or Intelligence, those attributes are twice as expensive (or yield twice the points, if purchased below 10).

In figures released at the end of January 2011, the Insurance Council of Australia calculated that 38,460 individual claims were lodged with insurers which were worth A$1.51 billion.

2500|$|In October 2014, the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned Wonga {{from using}} a TV advert that it said {{breached}} its code {{because of a}} claim that customers would save money. The authority said this {{was likely to be}} interpreted as a statement that Wonga’s loans were cheaper than those of other lenders and was therefore a price comparison. It ruled that Wonga should consequently have informed consumers of its 5,853% annual interest rate. The ruling was in response to a complaint from the charity Citizens Advice, whose chief executive Gillian Guy, said: [...] "Adverts must be clear about what taking out a loan means and how much it <b>will</b> <b>cost.</b> <b>The</b> consequences are really serious when payday lending goes wrong. High interest rates and fees can mean that a small loan balloons into a huge debt… both the advertising and payday loan industries need to look at why so many adverts are not meeting the grade and change their ways". It was the third Wonga advert to be banned by the ASA in 2014.|$|E

[...] Wearing a white bandana in his hat {{to notify}} the Texians {{that he was one}} of them, he spurred his horse and rode, unmolested, through the Alamo gate as the ring of Mexican {{soldiers}} looked on in surprise. [...] Bonham's news, that Fannin was not coming after all, reportedly demoralized the Alamo garrison. [...] Travis sent a courier that evening to the Convention with news that the Texians had thus far survived the siege with no losses. [...] He warned, however, that: [...] "I look to the colonies alone for aid; unless it arrives soon, I shall have to fight the enemy on his own terms. I will, however, do the best I can under the circumstances, and I feel confident that the determined valour and desperate courage, heretofore evinced by my men, will not fail them in the last struggle, and although they may be sacrificed to the vengeance of a Gothic enemy, the victory <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>the</b> enemy so dear, that it will be worse for him than a defeat." [...] Travis ended his letter with news that despite the dearth of ammunition, his men would fire the 18-lb cannon three times each day as proof that they still held the fort. [...] Travis then wrote several private letters and entrusted all of the communications to John W. Smith, who volunteered to sneak through the enemy lines.|$|E
2500|$|When {{it turned}} to the environment, the Carbon Tax {{proposal}} came up repeatedly, with both Dion and May supporting it, although May to more ambitious figures than Dion, pointing out {{it was the most}} recommended and proven way to deal with carbon emissions by countries and organizations around the world, noting the growth that Sweden and Germany have had with this system. Harper criticized the plan, saying would increase taxpayers' burden and that Dion should be [...] "honest with the people" [...] that some environmental measures <b>will</b> <b>cost</b> <b>the</b> economy and said the plan includes $40 billion in carbon taxes and $26 billion in tax cuts. Dion defended the Liberal's Green Shift, saying that [...] " [...] not true at all", and that [...] "for every dollar that we will raise, you will have a tax cut, and these tax cuts will be on your income". Duceppe commented that he would like targets to be applied to individual provinces, thereby allowing Quebec to financially benefit due to already-implemented greenhouse gas reductions. Layton, who favours a cap-and-trade system, said that it is a [...] "figment of Mr. Harper's imagination" [...] that emissions will fall under his plan. When Harper sought to outline his government's record on other environmental fronts, giving examples of his minority government supported the preservation {{of hundreds of thousands of}} hectares of environmentally sensitive land through the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and that the government declared a protected marine area by Lake Superior and created a whale sanctuary by Baffin Island, May responded by saying [...] "The only word he said that's true is on national parks".|$|E
