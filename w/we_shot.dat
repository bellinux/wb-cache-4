5|$|<b>We</b> <b>shot</b> {{the clip}} in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we {{have done in the past}}... I wanted to try and take everything we have done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E
25|$|We {{did some}} rather audacious things. <b>We</b> <b>shot</b> {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All we had to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there. And we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E
25|$|In October 1960, Gaggi {{committed}} {{his first}} murder for the Gambino family. He {{served on a}} hit squad that murdered mobster Vincent Squillante, who is suspected of killing Scalise. According to Montiglio, Gaggi described the murder: “We surprised him (Squillante) in the Bronx. <b>We</b> <b>shot</b> him in the head, stuffed him in the trunk, then dumped him for good.” In this case, “dumped him for good” meant that they hauled the body to {{the basement of a}} building, loaded it into a trash incinerator, and cremated it. After the Squillante murder, Gaggi was inducted into the Gambino family.|$|E
50|$|Over the end credits, <b>we</b> see <b>shots</b> of Bret, Jemaine and Sinjay {{the fruit}} vendor {{flipping}} the bird {{to the guard}} at the Australian consulate.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, sir?" [...] Bob Grimstone gasped. [...] "We were a {{long way}} in the woods when we thought <b>we</b> heard three <b>shots.</b> <b>We</b> were not quite sure about it, but we started back as fast as we could come. There is nothing wrong, I hope?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “We killed six {{and wounded}} {{eight or ten}} in the first attack upon us, and <b>we</b> have <b>shot</b> five more now. All the rest are battened down below.” ...|$|R
25|$|I {{am proud}} of what I did and would do it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If <b>we</b> <b>shot</b> people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E
500|$|Carice van Houten, who portrays Melisandre, {{spoke about}} the resurrection, {{and how it was}} directed, {{mentioning}} [...] "It was such an important scene, <b>we</b> <b>shot</b> it from so many angles. I think I washed his body 50 times." ...|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{described}} the Cuban Revolution as [...] "the last analog revolution. I loved that <b>we</b> <b>shot</b> a period {{film about a}} type of war that can't be fought anymore". Soderbergh {{has said that he}} is open to making another film about Guevara's experiences in the Congo but only if Che makes $100 million at the box office.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{anything}} can drive away sentiment," [...] I replied, taking {{up one of}} the birds which <b>we</b> had <b>shot</b> that day, [...] "the plucking and cleaning of this will do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Not until <b>we</b> hear <b>shots</b> from them," [...] Charlie replied. [...] "We {{have but}} four charges left, {{and if the}} wolves made a sudden rush, {{we might want to}} use them." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, {{glancing up}} at the dim cloud of sails above, I saw that we were aback and making sternway. We might have tossed a biscuit aboard the big Serapis as she glided ahead of us. The broadsides thundered, and great ragged {{scantlings}} brake from our bulwarks and flew {{as high as the}} mizzen-top; and the shrieks and groans redoubled. Involuntarily my eyes sought the poop, and I gave a sigh of relief {{at the sight of the}} commanding figure in the midst of the whirling smoke. <b>We</b> <b>shotted</b> our guns with double-headed, manned our lee braces, and gathered headway.|$|R
500|$|Pilou Asbæk, who {{was cast}} to play Euron Greyjoy, spoke in an {{interview}} about the filming of the Kingsmoot saying [...] "We spent two days on the Kingsmoot itself, and then two days on the montage. <b>We</b> <b>shot</b> it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. <b>We</b> <b>shot</b> the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|The animators {{cited the}} classic {{television}} specials Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town by Rankin/Bass Productions as inspirations for the episode's animation styles. Caballero said, [...] "Well, we are heavily immersed {{in that particular}} Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass style. They are big heroes of ours ... So we tapped into that knowledge for sure. We definitely use modern tricks, though. <b>We</b> <b>shot</b> everything with digital cameras directly to the hard drives of our iMacs." ...|$|E
500|$|When, in September 1943, Joseph Goebbels was {{informed}} that the German army had {{to withdraw from the}} Katyn area, he wrote a prediction in his diary. His entry for 29 September 1943 reads: [...] "Unfortunately we have had to give up Katyn. The Bolsheviks undoubtedly will soon 'find' that <b>we</b> <b>shot</b> 12,000 Polish officers. That episode is one that is going to cause us quite a little trouble in the future. The Soviets are undoubtedly going to make it their business to discover as many mass graves as possible and then blame it on us".|$|E
60|$|We {{might have}} been {{a mile and a half}} from the camp, when in the quiet night air we heard the sound of the howl of a dog. We both stopped as if <b>we</b> were <b>shot.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Quash, I won't shoot. <b>We</b> have <b>shot</b> {{enough of}} fat ducks to feed us all {{for one or}} two days at least. Besides, I can't bear to kill monkeys. It feels so like {{committing}} murder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{be thankful}} {{that it was}} no worse," [...] {{answered}} the doctor's son. [...] "Supposing we had not found this shelter, or supposing that match had gone out, or supposing <b>we</b> hadn't <b>shot</b> the deer--" ...|$|R
500|$|Clark {{recalls that}} [...] "Paul Fox {{gave us a}} tiny budget ... and {{we set out to}} do a full-blooded drama on location. Budgets were really tiny, and <b>we</b> <b>shot</b> for ten days and brought the film in for about 8,000 pounds." [...] Unusually for a BBC {{television}} drama of the 1970s, each instalment was filmed entirely on location using 16 mm film. As a result, the cameraman John McGlashan, who filmed the first five adaptations, was able to make use of night shoots and dark, shadowy interiors, which {{would not have been possible}} with the then-standard video-based studio interiors.|$|E
500|$|While {{the bulk}} of the film was shot on 4:4:4 HDCAM, {{according}} to director Guggenheim, a vast array of different film formats were used: [...] "There’s 35mm and 16mm. A lot of the stuff on the farm I just shot myself on 8mm film. We used four Sony F950 HDCAMs for the presentation. <b>We</b> <b>shot</b> three different kinds of prosumer HD, both 30 and 24. There’s MiniDV, there’s 3200 black-and-white stills, there’s digital stills, some of them emailed on the day they were taken from as far off as Greenland. There was three or four different types of animation. One of the animators is from New Zealand and emailed me his work. There’s JPEG stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Guggenheim {{says while}} it would've {{been a lot}} easier to use one format, it would not have had the same impact. [...] "Each format has its own feel and texture and touch. For the {{storytelling}} of what Gore’s memory was like of growing up on the farm, some of this 8mm stuff that I shot is very impressionistic. And for some of his memories of his son’s accident, these grainy black-and-white stills... have a feel that contrasted very beautifully with the crisp hi-def HD that <b>we</b> <b>shot.</b> Every format was used to its best potential. Some of the footage of Katrina has this blown-out video, where the [...] is just blasted, and it looks real muddy, but that too has its own kind of powerful, impactful feeling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Bob," [...] cried Dick, [...] "you don't mean to {{say that}} after <b>we</b> have <b>shot</b> the well that you're goin' to pay them more than it's worth for doin' it no better than any of them can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Time {{for us to}} be on the move," [...] says Captain Purnall, and <b>we</b> are <b>shot</b> up by the passenger-lift {{to the top of the}} despatch-towers. [...] "Our coach will lock on when it {{is filled}} and the clerks are aboard." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>We</b> report <b>shot</b> noise {{spectroscopy}} on a semiconductor {{quantum dot}} in a cotunneling regime. The DC conductance measurements show clear signatures of both elastic and inelastic cotunneling transport inside a Coulomb diamond. <b>We</b> observed Poissonian <b>shot</b> noise with the Fano factor F≈ 1 in the elastic cotunneling regime, and super-Poissonian Fano factor 1 <F< 3 in the inelastic cotunneling regime. The {{differences in the}} value of the Fano factor between elastic and inelastic processes reveal the microscopic mechanisms involved in the cotunneling transport. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
500|$|Actors Jon Hamm, Jason Sudeikis, and Dean Winters reprised their roles, respectively, as Drew Baird, Floyd DeBarber, and Dennis Duffy; former boyfriends of Liz Lemon (Fey). In {{the final}} scene of [...] "Anna Howard Shaw Day", in which she is still under the after effects of anesthesia, Liz [...] "sees" [...] Drew, Floyd, and Dennis speak in Jamaican accents, however, the three men are really three Jamaican dental assistants. In regards to the accent, Hamm said in an {{interview}} [...] "That was given to me literally the day before <b>we</b> <b>shot</b> it. They were like, 'We wrote some more stuff, so we'll see you tomorrow.' I was like, 'Okay, how much more can it be? Oh great, it's a completely different take, awesome.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{farm and}} lake scenes were filmed in Campbell River and Okanagan Lake respectively, {{though it is}} {{depicted}} in Greenwood Lake, New York. [...] "We shot part {{of it at the}} lake where it was 37° cold, which is beyond an ice cream headache. And the second stuff <b>we</b> <b>shot</b> in a big huge tank where we filmed all the underwater sequence, that was in a 93° pool," [...] Landes clarified. Cook and Landes performed their own stunts in both sequences. [...] "My biggest fear is being trapped in a car underwater. So it was kind of cool to face my fear and all that," [...] Cook divulged. [...] "We took a couple of lessons with a scuba guide to be comfortable being underwater and breathing off the regulator," [...] Landes enunciated.|$|E
500|$|Tillman {{told the}} Senate, [...] "as {{governor}} of South Carolina, I proclaimed that, although I {{had taken the}} oath of office to support the law and enforce it, I would lead a mob to lynch any man, black or white, who ravished a woman, black or white." [...] He told his colleagues, [...] "I have three daughters, but, so help me God, I had rather find either one of them killed by a tiger or a bear [...] than to have her crawl to me and tell me the horrid story that she had been robbed of the jewel of her womanhood by a black fiend." [...] In 1907, he told the senators about the Ellenton riot of 1876, [...] "it was then that <b>we</b> <b>shot</b> them; it was then that we killed them; it was then that we stuffed the ballot-boxes." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>We</b> analyze <b>shot</b> noise {{under the}} {{influence}} of dephasing in an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, of the type that was realized recently [Yang Ji et al., Nature (London) 422, 415 (2003) ]. Using a model of dephasing by a fluctuating classical field, we show how the usual partition noise expression T(1 -T) is modified. We study the dependence on the power spectrum of the field, which is impossible in simpler approaches such as the dephasing terminal, against which we compare. <b>We</b> remark on <b>shot</b> noise as a tool to distinguish thermal smearing from genuine dephasing...|$|R
2500|$|Star Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio {{publicly}} expressed regret {{about some}} of the scenes selected for removal from the film's theatrical cut: [...] "There were some beautiful scenes that were taken out. I just wish <b>we</b> hadn't <b>shot</b> so much that isn't in the film." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>We</b> study <b>shot</b> noise for {{entangled}} {{electrons in}} a 4 -lead beam-splitter with one incoming lead driven by adiabatically {{rotating magnetic field}}s. We propose a setup of an adiabatically rotating magnetic field therefor, which is appropriate for an electron beam to transport through. Using the scattering matrix approach, <b>we</b> find that <b>shot</b> noise for the singlet and that for the entangled triplet oscillates between bunching and antibunching due {{to the influence of}} the Berry phase. It provides us a new approach for testing the Berry phase in electron transport on the basis of entanglement. Comment: Revtex, 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Sapochnik was also asked {{about how he}} went about {{creating}} a sense of emotion in the 'King in the North' scene, saying [...] "It wasn't hard. I think as fans we'd been waiting for it for so long. That said, {{it was a very}} difficult scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days <b>we</b> <b>shot</b> it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When we finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew." ...|$|E
500|$|For a fight scene {{taking place}} {{on top of a}} {{speeding}} bullet train, the actors and stunt performers filmed on wires above a set piece surrounded by a greenscreen. The moving background, filmed on an elevated freeway in Tokyo, was added later. Weta Digital visual effects supervisor Martin Hill said the team adopted a [...] "Google Street View method", explaining [...] "But instead of having a big panoramic cam on top of a van, we built a rig that had eight 45 degree angle Red Epic [...] that gave us massive resolution driving down all the massive lanes of the freeway. We let a bit of air out of the tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour. So if <b>we</b> <b>shot</b> at 48 fps we just needed to speed up the footage by 10 times to give us the 300 kilometers an hour required." ...|$|E
500|$|Sapochnik {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} what the most difficult shot was to direct, responding [...] "The final sequence of seeing the armada {{on its way to}} Westeros was complicated because it involved so many different ships, and we only had one that we had to redress and shoot again and again. It was also raining and freezing when <b>we</b> <b>shot</b> it, and {{it was meant to be}} a Mediterranean climate. Emilia Clarke got so cold, her jaw started shaking uncontrollably and she totally lost her thread as far as what she was meant to be thinking in that moment, the cold will do that. She asked me to help, so I suggested that she just hum the theme to Game of Thrones in her head while we were rolling the cameras, and apparently that worked because it's the take we used in the final cut!" ...|$|E
500|$|Visual Effects Supervisor Tim Burke {{said that}} [...] "It {{was such a}} major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, {{and we had to}} do it in {{different}} stages of production. <b>We</b> had <b>shots</b> with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "It's taken two years– getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. <b>We</b> can design <b>shots</b> with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, <b>we</b> would have <b>shot</b> it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas." ...|$|R
6000|$|IF!--ay, {{there was}} the rub--IF <b>we</b> had <b>SHOT,</b> as well as powder for our guns; IF we had not only MEN but MEAT. Of the former {{commodity}} we had only three rounds for each piece. Of the latter, upon my sacred honor, to feed 126 souls, we had but ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was before}} we ever {{got to the}} {{intended}} songs, as <b>we</b> never <b>shot</b> those. It was originally planned as promotion for Addams Family Values.
