6000|$|... "Well, I didn't do much," [...] replied Leif. [...] "I {{only took}} possession, and didn't keep it. This {{was the way}} of it. Fourteen years after this voyage of Biarne, [about the year A.D. 1000] I was seized {{with a desire to}} see these new lands. I bought Biarne's ship from him, set sail with a good crew, and found the lands, just as Biarne had {{described}} them, far away to the south of Greenland. I landed and gave names to some places. At the farthest south point we built huts and spent the winter, but returned home in spring. I called this part Vinland, and this is the reason why: We had a German with us named Tyrker, who is with me here still. One day Tyrker was lost; I was very anxious about him, fearing that he had been killed by wild beasts or Skraelingers, [Esquimaux or savages, probably Indians,] so I sent out parties to search. In the evening we found him coming home in a state of great excitement, having found fruit which, he said, was grapes. The sight and taste of the fruit, to which he was used in his own land, had excited him {{to such an extent that}} we thought he was drunk, and for some time he would do nothing but laugh and devour grapes, and talk German, which none of us understood. At last he spoke Norse, and told us that he had found vines and grapes in great abundance. We found that this was true--at least we found a berry which was quite new to us. We went off next day, and, gathering enough to load our boat, brought them away with us. From this circumstance I called it Vinland. Two years after that my brother Thorwald went to Vinland, wintered three years there, was killed by the Skraelingers, and his men returned to Greenland. Then my youngest brother, Thorstein, who was Gudrid's husband, went off to Vinland to fetch home the body of our brother Thorwald, but was driven back by stress of weather. He was taken ill soon after that, and died. Since then Gudrid has dwelt with my household, and glad we are to have her. This is the whole story of Vinland; so if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> it you must e'en go on a voyage of discovery for yourself." ...|$|E
