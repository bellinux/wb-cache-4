25|$|In English law, {{high treason}} was {{punishable}} by being hanged, drawn and quartered (men) or burnt {{at the stake}} (women), although beheading could be substituted by royal command (usually for royalty and nobility). Those penalties were abolished in 1814, 1790 and 1973 respectively. The penalty was used by later monarchs against people who could reasonably be called traitors, although most modern jurists <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> excessive. Many of them would now just be considered dissidents.|$|E
25|$|Ricky Ponting was {{the first}} to go, beaten by one pushed quicker through the air. Gilchrist was adjudged lbw of a similar {{delivery}} but had cause to be aggrieved; replays showed the ball pitched well outside legstump and he had some bat on the ball. With Harbhajan on a hattrick, Shane Warne was surrounded by men around the bat, with Sadagopan Ramesh at short leg the man who would eventually claim the catch from a tentative prod. The on field umpires referred it to the third umpire, who took a long time making the tough decision before finally declaring Warne out. An emotional Harbhajan later remembered his father in the post match interview; his captain Sourav Ganguly <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a performance that brought India back into the match.|$|E
500|$|After the film's 2009 sequel {{was titled}} , screenwriter Orci {{was asked if}} this film would be retitled, just as Star Wars was titled [...] when re-released.

500|$|At the 1934 party, Tesla {{told reporters}} he had {{designed}} a superweapon he claimed would end all war. He <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> [...] "teleforce", but was usually {{referred to as}} his death ray. Tesla {{described it as a}} defensive weapon that would be put up along the border of a country to be used against attacking ground-based infantry or aircraft. Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during his lifetime but in 1984, they surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. The treatise, The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing them in streams (through electrostatic repulsion). Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.|$|E
500|$|In The Speaker, A.B.Walkley {{admired the}} play {{and was one of}} few to see it as the {{culmination}} of Wilde's dramatic career. He denied the term [...] "farce" [...] was derogatory, or even lacking in seriousness, and said [...] "It is of nonsense all compact, and better nonsense, I think, our stage has not seen." [...] H.G.Wells, in an unsigned review for the Pall Mall Gazette, called Earnest one of the freshest comedies of the year, saying [...] "More humorous dealing with theatrical conventions {{it would be difficult to}} imagine." [...] He also questioned whether people would fully see its message, [...] "...how Serious People will take this Trivial Comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen. No doubt seriously." [...] The play was so light-hearted that many reviewers compared it to comic opera rather than drama. W. H. Auden later called it [...] "a pure verbal opera", and The Times commented, [...] "The story is almost too preposterous to go without music." [...] Mary McCarthy, in Sights and Spectacles (1959), however, and despite thinking the play extremely funny, <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> [...] "a ferocious idyll"; [...] "depravity is the hero and the only character." ...|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April 2010. He {{said that the}} aliens in the episode were [...] "one note", and overall [...] "Code of Honor" [...] didn't generate any emotional investment. He gave the episode a score of C−, summing it up as [...] "I'm not sure I'd believe a great show {{could come out of}} TNG after watching 'Code', but I could at least say it had promise without sounding like a complete tool." [...] Keith DeCandido watched [...] "Code of Honor" [...] for Tor.com in May 2011. He thought the episode was riddled with clichés, and says that the episode only seems racist because of the casting even though the script didn't call for it. [...] "If the Ligonians had been played by white people, none of the dialogue would change, and nobody <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> racist", he said and gave it a score of two out of ten. Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation thought the episode was very slowly paced, and that the fight scene at the end was [...] "clunky and awkward", suggesting that this {{had something to do with}} the opposition of the cast and crew to the episode overall. She thought there were several plot holes, including why sickbay couldn't replicate the vaccine, and that the only redeeming quality of the episode was the beginning of the friendship between Data and La Forge.|$|E

500|$|I. Q. Hunter {{identifies}} a prefabricated cult film style {{which includes}} [...] "deliberately, insulting bad films", [...] "slick exercises in dysfunction and alienation", and mainstream films [...] "that sell themselves as worth obsessing over". [...] Writing for NPR, Scott Tobias states that Don Coscarelli, whose previous films effortlessly attracted cult followings, has drifted into this realm. [...] Tobias criticizes Coscarelli as {{trying too hard}} to appeal to cult audiences and sacrificing internal consistency for calculated quirkiness. [...] Influenced by the successful online hype of The Blair Witch Project (1999), other films have attempted to draw online cult fandom {{with the use of}} prefabricated cult appeal. [...] Snakes on a Plane (2006) is an example that attracted massive attention from curious fans. [...] Uniquely, its cult following preceded the film's release and included speculative parodies of what fans imagined the film might be. [...] This reached the point of convergence culture when fan speculation began to impact on the film's production. [...] Although it was proclaimed a cult film and major game-changer before it was released, it failed to win either mainstream audiences or maintain its cult following. [...] In retrospect, critic Spencer Kornhaber <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a serendipitous novelty and a footnote to a [...] "more naive era of the Internet". [...] However, it became influential in both marketing and titling. [...] This trend of [...] "instant cult classics" [...] which are hailed yet fail to attain a lasting following is described by Matt Singer, who states that the phrase is an oxymoron.|$|E

2500|$|Word of Barber’s {{achievements}} {{spread and}} attracted {{a number of}} new young climbers to Arapiles. This group was later given the name [...] "The New Wave" [...] and {{throughout the rest of the}} 70s and early 80s they were responsible for scores of routes in the grade 20–25 range. The likes of Kim Carrigan, Mike Law and Mark Moorhead helped introduce a number of 26+ climbs, though the latter two did not often grade their climbs accurately (choosing to 'undergrade' them instead). This purposeful undergrading is known as [...] "sandbagging" [...] and is still common in Australian climbing (some <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> tradition), though not as much as it once was.|$|E
2500|$|The {{court found}} that [...] "oppose" [...] is not defined by the statute, so a normal {{definition}} of it may be used, per Perrin v. United States. [...] "Thus, a person can 'oppose' by responding to someone else’s questions {{just as surely as}} by provoking the discussion," [...] further [...] "we <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> 'opposition' if an employee took a stand against an employer’s discriminatory practices not by 'instigating' action, but by standing pat, say, by refusing to follow a supervisor’s order to fire a junior worker for discriminatory reasons." [...] The court supposes there could be a hypothetical case in which an employee describes a [...] "supervisor's racist joke as hilarious," [...] but finds that these [...] "will be eccentric cases, and this is not one of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In fact, Johnson {{was very}} {{concerned}} about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the MFDP and the segregationist delegation, and he assigned Humphrey the job of managing the problem. The convention's Credentials Committee declared that two MFDP delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to [...] "bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived {{of the right to}} vote by reason of their race or color." [...] The MFDP rejected the committee's ruling. The convention became the apparent personal triumph that Johnson craved, but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the MFDP would trigger disaffection with Johnson and the Democratic Party from the left; SNCC chairman John Lewis <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a [...] "turning point in the civil rights movement." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of eight days {{stranded}} in the desert, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the little prince recounts {{the story of his}} life, an account that is often triggered by his preoccupation with the sheep. The prince begins by describing life on his tiny home planet: in effect, an asteroid the size of a house (the asteroid was [...] "named" [...] B-612 by people on Earth, but the Prince called it [...] "asteroid 325"; a real asteroid was named after the fictional asteroid). The asteroid's most prominent features are three minuscule volcanoes (two active, and one dormant or extinct) as well as a variety of plants. The prince describes spending his earlier days cleaning the volcanoes and weeding unwanted seeds and sprigs that infest his planet's soil; in particular, pulling out baobab trees that are constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. [...] "Catastrophe" [...] the little prince <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> The prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but is warned by the narrator that a sheep might also eat roses with thorns. Upon hearing this, the prince tells of his love for a mysterious rose that began growing on the asteroid's surface some time ago. The prince says he nourished the rose and listened to her when she told him to make a screen or glass globe to protect her from the cold wind. Although the prince {{fell in love with the}} rose, he also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him, and he resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Although the rose finally apologized for her vanity and the two reconciled, she encouraged him to go ahead with his journey. The prince misses his rose and claims that he only needs to look at the millions of stars to be reminded of his rose, since his rose is on one of them.|$|E

50|$|The banks {{also were}} rather secretive about their tariff {{structures}} which were never published.
