25|$|Accepting {{that the}} {{conflicting}} {{data in the}} typed report's flight times indeed require both northward and southward ground speeds greater than the flight's eighty-five mph airspeed, a Byrd defender posits a westerly-moving anti-cyclone that tailwind-boosted Byrd's ground speed on both outward and inward legs, allowing the distance claimed to be covered in the time claimed (the theory is based on rejecting handwritten sextant data in favor of typewritten alleged dead-reckoning data). This suggestion has been challenged by Dennis Rawlins <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> the sextant data in the long unavailable original official typewritten report are all expressed to 1", a precision not possible on Navy sextants of 1926 and not the precision of the sextant data in Byrd's diary for 1925 or the 1926 flight, which was normal (half or quarter of a minute of arc).|$|E
500|$|Hathaway {{prepared}} for the part by volunteering for a week as an assistant at an auction house where she was [...] "put through the wringer" [...] according to Weisberger, <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> Hathaway supplemented that by asking her many questions about working for Wintour. Frankel recalls that she was nervous {{through most of the}} shooting, particularly when working late, since Raffaello Follieri, her boyfriend at that time, preferred strongly that she not do so; she was also having health issues due to a cyst. The director said she was [...] "terrified" [...] before starting her first scene with Streep, who had begun her working relationship with Hathaway by saying first [...] "I think you're perfect for the role and I'm so happy we're going to be working on this together" [...] then warning her that was the last nice thing she would say. Streep applied this philosophy to everyone else on set as well, keeping her distance from the cast and crew members unless it was necessary to discuss something with them.|$|E

The [...] "Huston look" [...] was also noted by screenwriter James Agee, <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> this [...] "look proceeds from Huston's {{sense of what is}} natural to the eye and his delicate, simple feeling for space relationships." [...] In any case, notes Flint, Huston took [...] "uncommon care to preserve the writer's styles and values... and sought repeatedly to transpose the interior essence of literature to film with dramatic and visual tension", as he did in Red Badge of Courage, Moby Dick, and Under the Volcano.|$|E
6000|$|... [1] The titles to the Psalms have puzzled all the commentators. Bunyan follows Luther; <b>who</b> <b>adds,</b> <b>that</b> {{the title}} to the Psalms of Degrees does not pertain to any doctrine, but only to the {{ceremony}} of the singers. Ainsworth applies it to the place or tone of voice of the singers, or to a special excellency of the Psalm. Calmet and Bishop Horsley consider that the title refers to {{the progress of the}} soul towards eternal felicity, ascending by degrees. Watford imagines that these Psalms were written or selected to be sung on the ascent of the Jews from the captivity in Babylon. Luther wisely concludes that the Christian has only to do with the brief and very notable doctrine contained in these fifteen steps or degrees.--Ed.|$|E

6000|$|Saint Fillan was a Scotch abbot of {{the seventh}} century who became famous as a saint. He had two springs, which appear to be confounded by some editors of the poem. One was at {{the eastern end of}} Loch Earn, where the pretty modern village of St. Fillans now stands, under the shadow of Dun Fillan, or St. Fillan's Hills, six hundred feet high, on the top of which the saint used to say his prayers, as the marks of his knees in the rock still testify to the credulous. The other spring is at another village called St. Fillans, nearly thirty miles to the westward, just outside the limits of our map, on the road to Tyndrum. In this Holy Pool, as it is called, insane folk were dipped with certain ceremonies, and then left bound all night in the open air. If they were found loose the next morning, they were {{supposed}} to have been cured. This treatment was practised as late as 1790, according to Pennant, <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> the patients were generally found in the morning relieved of their troubles--by death. Another writer, in 1843, says that the pool is still visited, not by people of the vicinity, who have no faith in its virtue, but by those from distant places.

5000|$|It {{has been}} speculated in the {{subsequent}} years that Houk {{had more to do}} with Berra's firing than anyone above him, and that his reasons were more personal.

Also, Yogi had not been Houk's choice", said Jim Bouton, <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> Houk's biggest mistake was listening to the players who went to his office to complain, something that neither of his predecessors as manager nor general manager would have tolerated.

5000|$|Meanwhile, {{according}} to Amnesty International, [...] "Survivors {{say that as}} the massacre took place, armed forces units with armoured vehicles were stationed outside the village and stopped some of those trying to flee from {{getting out of the}} village."

The police arrive just as Bob is brandishing his belt in readiness. Bob lets them in, and they ask who he is.

5000|$|The New Forest {{was first}} {{recorded}} as Nova Foresta in Domesday Book in 1086, where a section devoted {{to it is}} interpolated between lands of the king's thegns {{and the town of}} Southampton; it is the only forest that the book describes in detail. [...] "Probably no action of the early Norman kings is more notorious than their creation of the New Forest", observes H. R. Loyn, <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> the picture of evicted peasants and houses burned is uncritical. Twelfth-century chroniclers alleged that William had created the forest by evicting the inhabitants of 36 parishes, reducing a flourishing district to a wasteland; however, this account is thought dubious by most historians, as the poor soil in much of the area {{is believed to have been}} incapable of supporting large-scale agriculture, and significant areas appear to have always been uninhabited.|$|E
5000|$|Eskender's most {{significant}} military accomplishment was sacking Dakkar, {{the capital of}} the Adal Sultanate, in 1478; despite this achievement, as he led his army back home, the larger Adal army under amir Muhammad ibn Azhar ad-Din overtook them, killing many of his men and taking many prisoners. Eskender was said to have escaped capture only through the assistance of angels, and afterwards he built a church named Debere Meshwa'e, [...] "Place of Sacrifice". There is some disagreement over the context of this campaign. One view is presented by James Bruce, <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> Zasillus, governor of Amhara, had been commanded to mobilize the forces in the south while Eskender himself raised levies from Angot and Tigray; according to Bruce, Eskender was responding to the predations of Mahfuz of Zeila. More recent scholars, such as Richard Pankhurst, hold that Eskender's sack of Dakkar led to Amir Muhammad to seek peace with the Ethiopians, but he was outmaneuvered by Mahfuz.|$|E
