5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Owumi was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, and he would suffer from its effects {{in the years that}} followed. He sometimes has had anxiety attacks before games, struggled to sleep, and considered suicide. Owumi received an offer to play another season with El-Olympi. The contract, two times that from his first year in Egypt, would have been the biggest contract of his career and would have made him the best-paid player to ever play in the Middle East. Initially accepting the deal, he later decided against it because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> break from his basketball career. Instead, he began working at a community center in his hometown in Atlanta for seven months, making $9.25 per hour.|$|E

For this reason, they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at the theme parks in case a WALL-E trod on a child's foot.

5|$|Victoria Climbié {{was born}} on 2 November 1991 in Abobo near Abidjan, Ivory Coast, the fifth of seven children. Her parents were Francis Climbié and his wife Berthe Amoissi. Marie-Thérèse Kouao, Francis' aunt, {{was born on}} 17 July 1956 in Bonoua, Ivory Coast, and lived in France with her three sons, {{claiming}} welfare benefits. She divorced her former husband in 1978 and he died in 1995. Kouao was attending her brother's funeral in the Ivory Coast when she visited the Climbié family in October 1998. She informed them that she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> child back to France with her and arrange for their education; this sort of informal fosterage is common in the family's society. Victoria Climbié was apparently happy to be chosen, and although her parents had met Kouao only a few times, they {{were satisfied with the}} arrangements.|$|E

25|$|Once, while Parvati <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> bath, {{there were}} no attendants around to guard her and stop anyone from accidentally {{entering}} the house. Hence she created {{an image of a}} boy out of turmeric paste which she prepared to cleanse her body, and infused life into it, and thus Ganesha was born. Parvati ordered Ganesha not to allow anyone to enter the house, and Ganesha obediently followed his mother's orders. After a while Shiva returned and tried to enter the house, Ganesha stopped him. Shiva was infuriated, lost his temper and severed the boy's head with his trident. When Parvati came out and saw her son's lifeless body, she was very angry. She demanded that Shiva restore Ganesha's life at once. Shiva did so by attaching an elephant's head to Ganesha's body, thus giving rise to the elephant headed deity.|$|E
25|$|In his book, Labaree (1948) {{identified}} the main {{characteristics of the}} Loyalists that contributed to their conservative opposition to independence. Loyalists were generally older than Patriots, better established in society, resisted innovation, believed resistance to the Crown—the legitimate government—was morally wrong, and were further alienated from the Patriot cause when it resorted to violent means of opposition, such as burning houses and tarring and feathering royal officials. Loyalists <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> middle-of-the road position and were angry when forced by the Patriots to declare their opposition. They had a long-standing sentimental attachment to Britain (often with business and family ties) and were procrastinators who realized that while independence might be inevitable, they would rather postpone it {{for as long as}} possible. Many loyalists were also highly cautious and afraid of the potential anarchy or tyranny that could arise out of mob rule. Finally, Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the Patriots' confidence in the future of an independent United States.|$|E

25|$|Bottled beers were commonplace by the 17th {{century for}} the well off {{who wished to}} drink outside of public inns, or who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> beer with them when fishing. There is a famous story of Alexander Nowell, the Dean of St Paul's, who, in 1568, left his bottled beer by the river bank, and upon {{returning}} {{a few days later}} discovered the bottle opened with a bang and that the contents were very tasty. But while the middle and upper classes could indulge themselves with such expensive luxuries, the ordinary folk continued to drink their beer served direct from the cask. India Pale Ale (IPA), the famous ale that was shipped to India, was delivered in casks, and only transferred to the bottle for the civilian middle classes; the troops drank their beer the same way they drank it back home, from flagons filled direct from the cask. But as beer developed and became paler and lower in alcohol, so it became more difficult to keep it fresh tasting in the cask, especially in countries with warmer climates. By the late 19th century commercial refrigeration and Louis Pasteur's flash heating method of sterilisation prolonged the life of beer. In Britain's cooler climate these methods did not catch on at this time.|$|E
25|$|When Cicero {{returned}} to Rome, he reconciled with Pompey. Food shortages caused popular unrest. The people {{threatened to kill}} the senators. Cicero persuaded them pass a law to elect Pompey as praefectus annonae (prefect of the provisions) in Italy and beyond for five years. This post was instituted at times of severe grain shortage to supervise the grain supply. Clodius alleged that the scarcity of rain had been engineered to propose a law that boosted Pompey’s power, which had been decreasing. Plutarch noted that others {{said that it was}} a device by Lentulus Spinther to confine Pompey to an office so that he himself would be sent to Egypt to help king Ptolemy XII of Egypt with a rebellion he was facing instead of Pompey. A plebeian tribune had proposed a law to send Pompey to Egypt as a mediator without an army. The senate rejected it on the ground of fears about his safety. As praefectus annonae Pompey sent agents and fiends to various places and sailed to Sardinia, Sicily and the Roman province of Africa (the breadbaskets of the Roman empire) to collect grain. He collected it in such abundance that the markets were filled and there was also enough to supply foreign peoples. Both Plutarch and Cassius Dio thought that the law made Pompey ‘the master of all the land and sea under Roman possession’. Appian wrote that this success gave Pompey great reputation and power. Cassius Dio also wrote that Pompey faced some delays in the distribution of grain because many slaves had been freed prior to the distribution and Pompey <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> census to ensure they received it in an orderly way.|$|E
