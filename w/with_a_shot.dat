5|$|He {{signed for}} Conference Premier club Stevenage Borough on a one-year {{contract}} on 27 May 2009, reuniting him with manager Graham Westley, who had previously signed Beardsley for Rushden. He made a scoring debut in Stevenage's 3–0 home victory over Ebbsfleet United on 18 August 2009, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> from 12yards in the eighth-minute. Beardsley featured regularly {{in the first half}} of 2009–10, but scored only three goals before the Christmas period, in which he scored twice in two matches against Cambridge. In the first match on 26 December 2009, he scored <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> from Ronnie Henry's cross in the 85th-minute of a 3–1 away win, and in the second match on 1 January 2010, his goal was assisted Yemi Odubade, as Stevenage won 4–1 at home. The latter result saw Stevenage move to the top of the Conference Premier table. Beardsley's goal tally reached double figures when he scored twice in a 5–1 away win over Kidderminster in the FA Trophy semi-final first leg on 13 March 2010. He started in the final at Wembley Stadium on 8 May 2010, being substituted on 66 minutes, as Stevenage were beaten 2–1 after extra-time by Barrow. His 2009–10 season was successful, with Beardsley scoring 10 times from 45 appearances as Stevenage won promotion to League Two after winning the Conference Premier championship. This was the first time in the club's history that Stevenage had been promoted to the Football League.|$|E
5|$|Heskey {{signed for}} Aston Villa on 23 January 2009 for a £3.5million fee on a three-and-a-half-year contract. He made his debut {{four days later}} against Portsmouth and scored <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> from 20yards, {{the first time he}} had scored on a club debut. He scored one more goal before the end of the season, with the opening goal in a 1–1 draw with West Ham United. He {{finished}} 2008–09 with 14 appearances and 2 goals for Villa.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{said the}} murders were a targeted, execution-style attack and not {{associated}} with a robbery; Clemmons did not aim at any other customers or the two baristas working at the time.

5|$|Lampard {{then put}} Chelsea 3–2 ahead, but Hargreaves {{levelled}} things up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> {{into the top}} corner. Ashley Cole was the next up, and Van der Sar got a strong hand to the ball but could not keep it out. Nani then {{knew he had to}} score to keep United in it, and he did, leaving it up to John Terry to win the cup for Chelsea; however, Terry lost his footing when planting his standing foot by the ball, and, even though Van der Sar was sent the wrong way, Terry's mis-hit effort struck the outside of the right post and went wide.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{pressure}} {{paid off}} in the 68th minute as McManaman scored a second goal. From {{the left side of}} the pitch, McManaman went past Green, then McAteer, before he got in front of Seagraves and scored <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> into the Bolton goal. Bolton replied immediately. Liverpool defender Neil Ruddock's clearance was played back into the Liverpool penalty area by Guðni Bergsson who had replaced Green. Paatelainen headed the ball onto Thompson, whose shot went into the Liverpool goal. Bolton continued to pressure Liverpool in search of the equaliser but were unable to score and Liverpool won the match 2–1 to claim their fifth League Cup victory.|$|E
5|$|MacInnis {{was most}} famous {{for having the}} hardest shot in the league. He tied Bobby Orr's Ontario Hockey League (OHL) record for goals by a defenceman, and won two OHL championships and a Memorial Cup with the Kitchener Rangers as a junior. He famously split goaltender Mike Liut's mask <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot,</b> and became only the fourth defenceman in NHL history to score 100points in a season. Internationally, he was an all-star on defence as Canada won the 1991 Canada Cup and twice participated in the Winter Olympics. He {{was a member of}} the 2002 team that won Canada's first gold medal in 50years.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, {{and he had been}} talking to various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling that he might {{be on the verge of}} transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E
5|$|The video opens <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of {{a little}} girl {{sleeping}} in her bed. As the music starts, rays of light emanate from the bedside radio with cartoon violins playing the music. The sun rises inside a picture on the wall and the girl wakes and starts playing with her doll. A fairy goes around tapping all her toys on the floor and a large, golden teapot comes alive and shoots a rainbow from its spout. A cartoon version of the girl then slides along the rainbow and, interpreting the lyrics of the song, catches a falling star and rides over the moon.|$|E
5|$|Although sceptical, Harry sends Lucas to Kachimov {{to learn}} which cable the {{submarine}} will attack so Malcolm can launch a counterattack. Lucas {{is able to}} turn Kachimov by forging evidence {{that he is an}} MI5 mole. They both go to the Russian embassy and find the submarine's location, after which Malcolm launches the counterattack with seconds to spare. Kachimov is later arrested. Lucas visits Elizabeta at her home, which was also their married home and he asks her to become an asset to MI5 to save her from arrest because of her association with Kachimov. In the end, Kachimov is with Harry and Ros in a field. Kachimov states his admiration for Adam's sacrifice, but then callously says he was a replaceable resource. In the final moments, Ros hands Harry a gun and Harry kills Kachimov <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> to the chest.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal kicked-off {{the match}} and {{did their best}} to {{restrict}} Liverpool's passing game in the opening 45 minutes through tackling and quick counter-attacking with the long ball; with the game's flow interrupted and the two teams cancelling each other out, neither side built any momentum in the first half with few clear-cut chances. The first notable action came for Arsenal when a cross from Michael Thomas on the right which was met by Steve Bould, but Steve Nicol cleared it over the bar for a corner. Liverpool responded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> from outside the box from Rush after being teed up by Aldridge. However, soon after Rush was forced to go off with a groin strain and had to be replaced by Peter Beardsley in the 32nd minute. The score was 0–0 at half time.|$|E
5|$|At age 76, Librescu {{was among}} the 32 people who were murdered in the Virginia Tech shooting. On April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho entered the Norris Hall Engineering Building and opened fire on classrooms. Librescu, who taught a solid {{mechanics}} class in Room 204 in the Norris Hall during April 2007, held {{the door of his}} classroom shut while the gunman attempted to enter it. Although he was shot through the door, Librescu managed to prevent the gunman from entering the classroom until most of his students had escaped through the windows. He was struck by five bullets, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> to the head proving to be fatal. Of the 23 registered students in his class, only one, Minal Panchal, died.|$|E
5|$|Courtney {{signed a}} new two-year {{contract}} with Tamworth on 22 June 2011, keeping {{him at the}} club until the summer of 2013. On 1 January 2012, he scored his first goal for the club <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> into the bottom corner in a 2–2 draw with Alfreton Town. Courtney made 44 appearances and scored 1 goal in 2012–13 and won the club's Players' Player of the Year, Manager's Player of the Year and Supporter's Player of the Year awards.

5|$|He scored {{his first}} goals of 2007–08 with a hat-trick in a 4–0 victory over Exeter City on 1 September 2007. After two matches without scoring, he scored a second hat-trick for Kidderminster in a 5–4 defeat to Ebbsfleet United. He was {{substituted}} at half-time in Kidderminster's 2–1 defeat to Histon in October 2007, after {{picking up a}} hamstring injury. He made his return in a 2–0 victory over Ware in the FA Cup in November 2007, scoring the first goal <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> from 18yards. He was sent off in a 2–0 defeat against Oxford United on 24 November 2007 for elbowing James Clarke, and after having an appeal rejected, was given a three-match suspension. He made his return in a 2–1 away win over Hinckley United in the Conference League Cup on 22 December 2007.|$|E
5|$|Hunter's {{direction}} in some scenes {{was inspired by}} Otto Preminger's work on the 1945 film noir Fallen Angel. That film featured several scenes shot in tight spaces with a very small mise en scène; Hunter found himself using several of Preminger's techniques {{to make the most}} out of several of the episode's smaller sets such as the RR Diner. Several scenes in the episode were also shot using a split diopter lens, allowing for a greater depth of field. For example, a scene featuring Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Beymer talking had the actors at either side of a room; the split diopter lens allowed for both of them to still be in sharp focus. The episode ends <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> featuring a Dutch angle; Hunter was the only director on the series who Frost and Lynch allowed to use this shot, which was otherwise forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Ingham {{made several}} {{important}} saves as York drew 0–0 away to Ebbsfleet. The {{first leg of}} the FA Trophy semi-final tie against A.F.C. Telford United ended in a 2–0 away win, with goals in each half from Rusk and Purkiss. A late goal from Sodje <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> {{from the edge of}} the penalty area earned the team a 1–1 draw away to Forest Green Rovers, after Kaid Mohamed had given the home team a first-half lead. A 2–1 home win over A.F.C. Telford in the second leg of the FA Trophy semi-final, with goals in each half from Brodie and McBreen, saw York progress into 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium with 4–1 aggregate victory. This was followed by a 0–0 home draw with Kettering in the league. Wilkinson joined divisional rivals Altrincham on loan until the end of the season, having failed to feature in the team since January 2009. York drew 0–0 with play-off contenders Kidderminster at home, which was followed by a 2–0 home defeat to Stevenage.|$|E
