5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation {{of all types of}} salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides <b>works</b> <b>very</b> cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{hydroelectricity}} <b>works</b> <b>very</b> well {{in conjunction}} with solar power, water can be held back or released from a reservoir behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again. However, this cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} has a {{well-developed}} sense of smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling <b>works</b> <b>very</b> differently {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialised organs called s on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as coconut crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects. While insects and the coconut crab originate from different paths, the same need to detect smells in the air {{led to the development of}} remarkably similar organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. The smells of rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially. Research has shown that the olfactory system in the coconut crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain.|$|E

25|$|A {{hypervelocity}} railgun <b>works</b> <b>very</b> {{much like}} a particle accelerator insofar as it converts electrical potential energy into kinetic energy imparted to the projectile. A conductive pellet (the projectile) is attracted down the rails by electric current flowing through a rail. Through the magnetic forces that this system achieves, a force is exerted on the projectile moving it down the rail. Railguns can generate muzzle-velocities in excess of 2.4 kilometers per second.|$|E

25|$|Another {{suggestion}} for simplifying {{the proof is}} to make greater use of representation theory.

For groups of small rank one has such control and representation theory <b>works</b> <b>very</b> well, but for groups of larger rank no-one has succeeded in using it to simplify the classification. In {{the early days of the}} classification there was considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.|$|E
25|$|The Cumbre Tajín {{has been}} criticized for its {{emphasis}} on modern shows rather than on cultural events. One criticism is the illumination of pyramids at night without any kind of cultural historical instruction. The criticism is that it disrespects the site and the Totonac people. There are also fears that large numbers of visitors to the site for events such as concerts by names such as Alejandra Guzmán damage the site. However, the Centro de Artes Indígenas de Veracruz states that it <b>works</b> <b>very</b> hard to preserve and promote Totonac culture through the event, sponsoring events such as traditional cooking, painting and the ritual of the Voladores.|$|E

After making his debut for York in February 2007, Dave Flett of The Press said Brodie [...] "looks a potent package of pace and power with a competitive streak that should strike fear into countless Conference defenders". Foyle's guidance while manager at York was credited as benefiting Brodie. He stated [...] "I've worked hard trying to improve my game and I'm starting to score different types of goals" [...] in December 2009. He {{was described}} by the Huddersfield Daily Examiner as [...] "one of non-league football's hottest properties" [...] in January 2010.

500|$|Based on Bethe's {{intuition and}} {{fundamental}} {{papers on the}} subject by Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman and Freeman Dyson, it was finally possible to get fully covariant formulations that were finite at any order in a perturbation series of quantum electrodynamics. Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman were jointly awarded with a Nobel prize in physics in 1965 for their work in this area. Their contributions, and those of Freeman Dyson, were about covariant and gauge invariant formulations of quantum electrodynamics that allow computations of observables at any order of perturbation theory. Feynman's mathematical technique, based on his diagrams, initially seemed {{very different from the}} field-theoretic, operator-based approach of Schwinger and Tomonaga, but Freeman Dyson later showed that the two approaches were equivalent. Renormalization, the need to attach a physical meaning at certain divergences appearing in the theory through integrals, has subsequently become one of the fundamental aspects of quantum field theory and has come {{to be seen as a}} criterion for a theory's general acceptability. Even though renormalization <b>works</b> <b>very</b> well in practice, Feynman was never entirely comfortable with its mathematical validity, even referring to renormalization as a [...] "shell game" [...] and [...] "hocus pocus".|$|E
500|$|For the B-plot, Tom (Aziz Ansari) {{attempts}} {{to move out}} of his home after his divorce from Wendy (Jama Williamson). Tom again hesitates to reveal his feelings for his ex-wife, whom he married to protect from deportation. Mark (Paul Schneider) reluctantly helps Tom through the moving process as he is a truck owner and could not think of a [...] "valid excuse". Donna (Retta), April (Aubrey Plaza), [...] Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Andy (Chris Pratt) join to assist Tom move his many boxes to his new home, while Tom himself <b>works</b> <b>very</b> little. At the end of the episode, Tom learns that his new home has a gas leak and that he is unable to move into his new home until Monday. Tom asks the department members to take the boxes into their own homes, but they ultimately bring his possessions and leave them in the Parks and Recreation Department office. Throughout the move, April continues to develop romantic feelings for Andy, who remains oblivious to her affections. When April's boyfriend Derek (Blake Lee) and his gay boyfriend Ben (Josh Duvendeck) arrive at Wendy's house, they mock Andy, which prompts April to refer to their behavior as [...] "really gay for a gay couple." [...] In their final appearance in the episode, Andy asks April to watch him roller-blade after work, but April declines his offer, implying that the comments of her boyfriend and his boyfriend may have confounded her feelings towards Andy.|$|E
