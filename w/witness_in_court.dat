5|$|In {{the island}} village of Mandwa, the school teacher Dinanath Chauhan (Chetan Pandit) is highly {{respected}} by the villagers. The {{chief of the}} village, extremely jealous of Dinanath's popularity {{in the eyes of}} citizens, summons his evil son Kancha to destroy Dinanath's image in citizen's eyes. Kancha also has plans to start a drug cartel from Mandwa, knowing that the soil of Mandwa is rich for cultivation of cocaine. When Kancha requests the people to lend their lands to him under the pretext of expanding the salt industry of Mandwa, Dinanath dissuades the villagers from doing so. Knowing this, Kancha decides {{to get rid of the}} school teacher. He ambushes and murders a young girl inside the school, framing Chauhan for the murder. With the support of the villagers, Kancha then kills Chauhan by hanging him to death from a tree which is witnessed by young Vijay Chauhan (Arish Bhiwandiwala), the son of the teacher. Vijay Chauhan along with his pregnant mother Suhasini Chauhan (Zarina Wahab) leaves the village. Destitute, they find shelter in the city of Dongri,Mumbai but Vijay harbours intentions to go back to Mandwa and kill Kancha. While in Mumbai, Vijay's mother delivers a baby girl named Shiksha. Vijay is attracted to Rauf Lala (Rishi Kapoor), a local girl-trafficker and importantly an enemy of Kancha and wants to get into his company. He earns his favour by refusing to stand as a <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> to a crime committed by Lala and joins his gang. Meanwhile, his mother along with his baby sister leave Vijay's side as he kills a corrupt cop at a young age and resorts to violence.|$|E

His association with the university in Manchester began in 1884 and eventually included governing roles {{as well as his}} professorial chair. His career also included acting as an expert <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> cases, as a co-publisher of a medical magazine and as a member of various committees and a hospital reform organisation.

The governor called out the state militia to assist removing those fortified in city hall. The military brought with them two cannons and two Gatling guns. Soapy joined the corrupt officeholders and police at the hall and found himself commissioned as a deputy sheriff. He {{and several of his}} men {{climbed to the top of}} the city hall's central tower with rifles and dynamite to fend off any attackers. Cooler heads prevailed, however, and the struggle over corruption was fought in the courts, not on the streets. Soapy Smith was an important <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> <b>court.</b>|$|E

25|$|Beyond his {{scientific}} research into {{areas such as}} chemistry, electricity, and magnetism at the Royal Institution, Faraday undertook numerous, and often time-consuming, service projects for private enterprise and the British government. This work included investigations of explosions in coal mines, being an expert <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> <b>court,</b> and along with two engineers from Chance Brothers c.1853, the preparation of high-quality optical glass, which was required by Chance for its lighthouses. In 1846, together with Charles Lyell, he produced a lengthy and detailed report on a serious explosion in the colliery at Haswell County Durham, which killed 95 miners. Their report was a meticulous forensic investigation and indicated that coal dust contributed to {{the severity of the}} explosion. The report should have warned coal owners of the hazard of coal dust explosions, but the risk was ignored for over 60 years until the Senghenydd Colliery Disaster of 1913.|$|E
25|$|Singh's {{attention}} now {{turned to his}} trial, where he was to face a Crown prosecution team comprising C. H.

Prem Dutt Verma, the youngest amongst the 27 accused, threw his slipper at Gopal when he turned and became a prosecution <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> <b>court.</b> As a result, the magistrate ordered that all the accused should be handcuffed. Singh and others refused to be handcuffed and were subjected to brutal beating. The revolutionaries refused to attend the court and Singh {{wrote a letter to}} the magistrate citing various reasons for their refusal. The magistrate ordered the trial to proceed without the accused or members of the HSRA. This was a setback for Singh as he could no longer use the trial as a forum to publicise his views.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reasoning}} {{behind the}} hearsay rule {{can be seen}} by comparing the acceptance of direct evidence and hearsay.

[...] In adducing direct evidence (that is, recollection of a <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> <b>court)</b> the court considers how the witness would have perceived the event at the time, potential ambiguities, and the witness's sincerity. These can be tested in cross-examination.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his institutional appointments, Whitehead was sometimes called upon {{to be an expert}} <b>witness</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> cases relating to medicine, examples of which include an action in 1896 against a known quack who claimed specialism in the treatment of hernias, and Thomas vs. Barker (an action for damages against Herbert Atkinson Barker, the bonesetter, in 1911). In 1911, Whitehead referred again to this latter case in an article published in The English Review. In this he appealed for an investigation by the medical profession into the potential for adoption of some of the methods used by bonesetters. He said that these people had traditionally been viewed by the profession, including himself, as [...] "anathema" [...] and [...] "technically unqualified" [...] but that Barker's case had demonstrated that there was good cause to investigate their methods and successes rather than be [...] "blinded by professional prejudices".|$|E

A portion of this testimony, dealing with the potential meanings of the term tolmêma in Plato's work, was the subject of controversy, and was called misleading and even perjurious by critics. She responded to these charges in a lengthy article called [...] "Platonic Love and Colorado Law". Nussbaum used multiple references from Plato's Symposium and his interactions with Socrates as evidence for her argument. The debate continued with a reply by one of her sternest critics, Robert P. George. [...] Nussbaum has criticized Noam Chomsky as being among the leftist intellectuals who hold the belief that [...] "one should not criticize one’s friends, that solidarity is more important than ethical correctness". She suggests that one can [...] "trace this line to an old Marxist contempt for bourgeois ethics, but it is loathsome whatever its provenance". [...] Among the people whose books she has reviewed critically are Allan Bloom, Harvey Mansfield, and Judith Butler. [...] Her more serious and academic debates have been with figures such as John Rawls, Richard Posner, and Susan Moller Okin.|$|E
