5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll of happy animals free to roam in attractive countryside, which is completely at odds <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> the impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{characteristic}} traits of Kim's mature style, first seen {{in these three}} films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions and sexuality. Although {{in stark contrast to}} the realism, harmony, balance and sentimentality typical of Korean cinema of the time, Kim's films, in an eccentric and metaphorical way, deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology. After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began to wane in his films of the later 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Some experts {{argue that}} exposing {{children}} to television {{at such an}} early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost touch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming {{is intended to be}} watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against exposing {{children under the age of}} two to television, while a 2003 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV. According to The Washington Post, very little is known about whether young children watching television has a negative or positive effect on them.|$|E

5|$|Van Gogh's stylistic {{developments}} are usually {{linked to the}} periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and {{he was aware of}} his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> his then current situation.|$|E
25|$|While James was recuperating, {{the father}} of his friend Rowland Hazard (an {{ancestor}} of the same Rowland Hazard who {{was instrumental in the}} formation of Alcoholics Anonymous) suggested that James accompany his son on an upcoming winter tour of the South, designed to alleviate Rowland's own lung ailment. The trip, which began on October 5, 1850, took Angell and Hazard throughout much of the South, including the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Lasting about seven and a half months, Angell details in his autobiography how it acquainted him <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> slavery.|$|E

For $28 million, Toyohiro Akiyama was flown in 1990 to Mir with the eighth crew and returned a week later with the seventh crew. Akiyama gave a daily TV broadcast from orbit and also performed scientific experiments for Russian and Japanese companies. However, since {{the cost of the}} flight was paid by his employer, Akiyama could be considered a business traveler rather than a tourist.|$|E

25|$|Prince Bolo: A {{possible}} {{parody of}} the archetypal awe-inspiring hero or Prince Charming, Bolo is a reckless, slightly stupid, melodramatic figure, nominally {{the leader of the}} charge to rescue Princess Batcheat from Chup, but holding little authority; prone to becoming excited at the least provocation; obsessed with rescuing Batcheat, so that all other things appear to him of little significance. He frequently draws his sword when it is unwise to fight; once extends diplomatic immunity to an assassin bent on killing him; and often gives the impression to readers of being somewhat out of harmony <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> his situations.|$|E
25|$|Tsui's third film, Dangerous Encounter of the First Kind (1980), put him {{beyond the}} pale. The thriller about delinquent youths on a bombing spree was nihilistic, grisly and {{pregnant}} with angry political subtext. Heavily censored by the British colonial government, {{it was released}} in 1981 in a drastically altered version titled Dangerous Encounter – 1st Kind (or alternatively, Don't Play with Fire). Unsurprisingly, {{it was not a}} financial success. However, it helped to make Tsui a darling of film critics who had coined the New Wave label and were hopeful for a more aesthetically daring cinema, more engaged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> contemporary Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|Lange {{was called}} to the Wannsee Conference by Heydrich in January 1942. Lange (an SS major) was the lowest-ranking officer present. Heydrich viewed Lange's {{first-hand}} experience in conducting the mass murder of deported Jews as valuable for the conference. Instead of Lange, Heydrich could have invited either Karl Jäger or Erich Ehrlinger, who commanded the SiPo and SD in Lithuania and Belarus respectively, and were responsible for similar massacres. He chose Lange because Riga was the main deportation destination, and because Lange's doctorate made him seem more intellectual {{than the other two}} men. Lange's superior, Franz Walter Stahlecker, was not invited, as he was not familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> the Jewish deportations and was not located in Riga.|$|E

25|$|Veterans of {{the heavy}} bomber {{campaign}} frequently cite Twelve O'Clock High as the only Hollywood film that accurately captured their combat experiences. Along with the 1948 film Command Decision, it marked a {{turning away from the}} optimistic, morale-boosting style of wartime films and toward a grittier realism that deals more directly with the human costs of war. Both films deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> daylight precision bombing without fighter escort, the basic Army Air Forces doctrine at the start of World War II (prior to the arrival of long range Allied fighter aircraft like the P-51 Mustang). As producers, writers Lay and Bartlett re-used major plot elements of Twelve O'Clock High in later films featuring the U.S. Air Force, the 1950s-era Toward the Unknown and the early 1960s Cold War-era A Gathering of Eagles, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The League of Prizren {{was among}} the most obvious Albanian {{reactions}} to the dramatic withdrawal of the Albanians' imperial patrons, the Ottoman Empire, after almost four centuries of dominance in the Balkans. The aftermath of the Russo-Turkish war of 1878 produced the Treaty of San Stefano, which recognised the independence and/or territorial claims of Bulgaria, Montenegro and Serbia. After the Russo-Turkish war of 18771878. Albanian leaders from Peć, Gjakova, Gusinje, Luma, and from Debar and Tetovo met in Vardar Macedonia to discuss the development of what would only later be regarded as a national platform. The group of proto-nationalists received all manner of material and financial support from the Ottoman Empire, which was faced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> having to withdraw yet again from its occupied territories in the Balkans. The League of Prizren received funding, the highest quality weaponry, and diplomatic support from the Porte, which established the Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights in Constantinople in 1877.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} consequences of the First World War {{was the number of}} lives lost, missing, and wounded throughout the entirety of the battles. The Allied and Central powers felt immense casualties and losses with 22,447,500 and 16,403,000 (MIA, KIA, WIA), respectively. Nurses faced this reality throughout the war and even on rare instances, Canadian nurses lost their lives while on duty. The most prominent cases of this was the death of four nursing sisters on May 19, 1918, during the bombing raid on No. 1 Canadian General Hospital at Étaples, France, and the death of 14 nursing sisters and over 200 other service personnel on June 27, 1918, when the HMHS Llandovery Castle was sunk by the U-86 The HMHS Llandovery Castle was one of five Canadian hospital ships that served in the First World War. In total, 234 lives were lost with only 24 survivors. The sinking of the HMHS Llandovery Castle {{was one of the most}} significant Canadian naval disasters of the First World War, in terms of the overall death toll. By the end of the war, 47 Canadian nurses lost their lives while on active duty, victims of enemy attack or disease contracted from patients Overall, Canadian nurses dealt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> <b>of</b> war and were key assets to the Canadian military and Allied forces.|$|E

Annie finds romance with a college student, Charlie, who {{turns out to be}} Liam's half-brother. Charlie and Annie {{have a lot in common}} and both are theater kids. Liam has a tumultuous relationship with Charlie due to their rocky past. Teddy and Silver are happy to be together, but in the earthquake Teddy injures his leg, which could possibly end his tennis career. Teddy is also struggling with his sexuality, after realizing that he drunkenly slept with another guy, Ian. After some discouraging behavior from Teddy, Silver breaks up with him. This discouraging behavior was a result of Teddy being so insecure with himself being gay. With all that going on in school, Adrianna is driving back from a summer of touring with the pop star, Javier. The two become a couple until Navid reveals to Adrianna that he has never stopped loving her, and she dumps Javier for Navid. Although he initially resolves to get her back, Javier becomes angered by this. He tells her that her singing career is over, before dying in a car crash, which Adrianna survives. She steals Javier's song book and performs one of his songs at his memorial service, which becomes a hit. She is then blackmailed by Javier's uncle, Victor, who becomes her manager and takes a huge portion of her earnings and forces her to do some things she finds uncomfortable, such as taking half naked photos and forming a snobby famous image that did not exist before. Navid, realizing the blackmail, asks Adrianna not to give in to the threats of Victor. Adrianna decides to take control of her career from Victor after seeing herself on the cover of a magazine. She begins to treat Victor badly and starts alienating Navid and her friends. Navid, however, begins to have family problems when he and Silver discover that his father has been employing underage girls to be in his porn films. Adrianna is oblivious to his problems, causing him and Silver to become closer.|$|E
