[...] In June, in a move made by the company to ‘get its consumer base back,’ but attributed by the media as a marketing gimmick, each store was closed for 37 hours so that they could be thoroughly cleaned; when the stores reopened, employees debuted with new uniforms and the loyalty card and weekly sales were discontinued in favor of everyday low pricing. Additionally, a new marketing program titled “We’re Thinking Fresh” promoting ‘it’s fresh or it’s free - guaranteed’ was launched. [...] An analysis by the Detroit Free Press among a basket of commonly purchased items concluded that Farmer Jack's price had indeed went from most expensive to least expensive among its peers; however, the paper also noted that [...] "in spite of the surface shine, some areas of the store (where the paper shopped) needed a scrubbing. The coolers looked old, a frozen food area had bent and crooked shelves, and some inner <b>cooler</b> <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> were dusty and dotted with bits of paper." [...] The paper speculated that competitors would match Farmer Jack's prices and it would suffer from the same problems it had before the makeover. In early 2004, ten Farmer Jack locations were converted into A&P's Food Basics format in an attempt to compete with discount chains such as Save-A-Lot. [...] Less than a year later, nine were closed while the other—a new-build store in Dearborn Heights—was converted into a Farmer Jack. Simultaneously, the closure of 15 Farmer Jacks was announced; four more closures were announced later in the year.|$|R
40|$|The {{publication}} „Using straw {{for high}} efficiency heating in farming” contains of theoretical and research parts. In the theoretical {{part of the}} publication straw {{is viewed as a}} fuel for producing heating energy, types of straw boilers and ways for using straw as fuel for heating is collected. At the beginning the objectives are determinated, the vitality of the theme is researched and positive and negative aspects for using straw as fuel for energy production are being gathered. In the research part of the thesis main parameters of real package-type straw boiler are collected and analyzed when two different types of straw are burned. After research author of the thesis concludes that no matter which kind of straw is being burned, the classical assembly connection of straw boiler isn’t energy effective and a new assembly connection is given. All package type straw boilers contain of a huge accumulation tank to equate temperature fluctuations. All the water circulation is being organized through the tank which has great heat yield area so great amount of heat is given away. Author has given solution for this problem. All package type boilers have <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> firebox <b>door.</b> When a new bale of straw is put into the firebox, the circulation is organized through the heat exchanger, at the same time flue-gas economizer and <b>door</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> is heating up a small accumulation tank. When the temperature falls under given boarder, 3 -way valves changes circulation from heat exchanger-consumer to accumulation tank-consumer. After putting a new bale, temperature rises and system work usual way. So there’s no need for as huge amount of water to be heated and kept on high temperature all the time...|$|R

Flat glass is adhesively bonded onto the curved <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> and due to the elastic {{deformation}} the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> bends backwards. Hence the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> must be bend with reserve so that the elastic deformation is covered. Finite element analysis of currently manufactured door with constant curvatere has been carried out, with this analysis it has been checked that the chosen problem approach is suitable. Design of <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> curvature is then made for <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> with combined curvature (different for lower and upper part of <b>door</b> <b>frame).</b> The aim of this thesis was to design the curvature so that after glass is bonded onto it, the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> will have the right dimensions...|$|R

40|$|There was {{a thermal}} anomaly of the Landsat- 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) {{radiative}} cooler cold stage during the cooler outgas phase in flight. With the <b>cooler</b> <b>door</b> in the outgas {{position and the}} outgas heaters enabled, the cold stage temperature increased {{to a maximum of}} 323 K when the spacecraft was in the sunlight, which was warmer than the 316. 3 K upper set point of the outgas heater controller on the cold stage. Also, the outgas heater cycled off when the cold stage was warming up to 323 K. A corrective action was taken before the attitude of the spacecraft was changed during the first week in flight. One orbit before the attitude was changed, the outgas heaters were disabled to cool off the cold stage. The cold stage temperature increase was strongly dependent on the spacecraft roll and yaw. It provided evidence that direct solar radiation entered the gap between the <b>cooler</b> <b>door</b> and <b>cooler</b> shroud. There was a concern that the direct solar radiation could cause polymerization of hydrocarbons, which could contaminate the cooler and lead to a thermal short. After outgas with the <b>cooler</b> <b>door</b> in the outgas position for seven days, the <b>cooler</b> <b>door</b> was changed to the fully open position. With the <b>cooler</b> <b>door</b> fully open, the maximum cold stage temperature was 316. 3 K when the spacecraft was in the sunlight, and the duty cycle of the outgas heater in the eclipse was the same as that in the sunlight. It provided more evidence that direct solar radiation had entered the gap between the <b>cooler</b> <b>door</b> and <b>cooler</b> shroud. Cooler outgas continued for seven more days, with the <b>cooler</b> <b>door</b> fully open. The corrective actions had prevented overheating of the cold stage and cold focal plane array (CFPA), which could damage these two components. They also minimized the risk of contamination on the cold stage, which could lead to a thermal short...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} a specific problem met in woodworking practice by the company K that manufactures <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> made of MDF boards (medium density fi breboards). Visible side surfaces of MDF <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> were lacquered with white polyurethane lacquer. Thirty days after installation, longitudinal surface cracks appeared in the lacquer fi lm on side planes of the <b>door</b> <b>frame.</b> Within the research of the said appearance of cracks, testing was carried out of technical properties and free formaldehyde concentration of the original <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> made of MDF boards by the manufacturer K, MDF boards of the same manufacturer from <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> plant, MDF boards made by the manufacturer H and lacquered experimental MDF boards of both manufacturers. The lacquered surface structure was tested by applying 97 % sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) on 5 mm thick lattices that were cut out from side planes of experimental and original <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> samples. The action of acid destructed the lacquer final layer, and pigmented base with other additives was scraped off the surface. It was noticed that the lacquer film on the original <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> made of MDF panels by the manufacturer K had no two-component polyurethane clear base, or that it was applied {{in a very small}} quantity. Lacquer film cracking on side planes is the consequence of in-depth cracks in the structure of MDF panels that occur thirty days after lacquering. Experimental boards designated KE, produced by MDF manufacturer K, have an optimum layer of two-component polyurethane clear base, two-component polyurethane white base and two-component polyurethane semi gloss enamel paint. On side planes of these boards no distinctive cracks were observed. In lacquering MDF boards, it is necessary to apply two-component polyurethane clear base on side planes, and to fully protect the <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> with polyurethane films, and not only the visible planes. The use of load bearing MDF boards is necessary in dry conditions - MDF. LA type, and in increased relative humidity, fibreboards are required for general use in humid conditions - MDF. H type or load bearing boards for use in humid conditions - MDF. HLS type. Thin MDF board, glued to a thick MDF board, must be resistant to water or be an HDF fibreboard...|$|R

The <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> is fastened to the tin can wall by hammering nails partially {{into the side of the}} frame that will touch the tin can wall and allowing the concrete to harden around the nails. Short strips of metal lath are also attached to the frame and folded out (perpendicular to the frame) and allowed to set in the can/concrete matrix.|$|R
