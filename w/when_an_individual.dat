5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 the Hungarian {{newspaper}} Life and Literature {{revealed that}} Szabó {{had been an}} informant of the Communist regime's secret police. Between 1957 and 1961, he submitted forty-eight reports on seventy-two people, mostly classmates and teachers at the Academy of Theatrical and Cinematic Arts. According to historian Istvan Deak, only in one case did Szabó's informing cause significant damage, <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> was denied a passport.|$|E
5|$|Impression Management {{is defined}} as <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> {{attempts}} to present an acceptable image to those around him or her verbally or nonverbally (480). This definition is based on Goffman’s idea that individuals see themselves as others view them, so in essence they attempt {{to see themselves as}} if they are outside looking in (480). Goffman also dedicating this work to discover the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation. For instance, concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls which society as a whole may see as abnormal.|$|E

50|$|Richard E. Petty and John Cacioppo {{proposed}} a dual process theory focused {{in the field}} of social psychology in 1986. Their theory is called the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion. In their theory, there are two different routes to persuasion in making decisions. The first route is known as the central route and this takes place <b>when</b> <b>a</b> person is thinking carefully about a situation, elaborating on the information they are given, and creating an argument. This route occurs <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> motivation and ability are high. The second route is known as the peripheral route and this takes place <b>when</b> <b>a</b> person is not thinking carefully about a situation and uses shortcuts to make judgments. This route occurs <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> motivation or ability are low.|$|R
5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E
5|$|Protandry is <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> {{starts out}} male and becomes female while the reverse {{condition}} {{is known as}} protogyny, the latter being more common. Changing sex can occur in various contexts. In the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, where males have harems of up to ten females, if the male is removed {{the largest and most}} dominant female develops male-like behaviour and eventually testes. If she is removed, the next ranking female takes her place. In the species Anthias squamipinnis, where individuals gather into large groups and females greatly outnumber males, if a certain number of males are removed from a group, the same number of females change sex and replace them. In clownfish, individuals live in groups and only the two largest in a group breed: the largest female and the largest male. If the female dies, the male switches sexes and the next largest male takes his place.|$|E
5000|$|... (ii) Evocative (or reactive) gene-environment {{correlation}} happens <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> (heritable) behavior evokes {{an environmental}} response. For example, {{the association between}} marital conflict and depression may reflect the tensions that arise <b>when</b> engaging with <b>a</b> depressed spouse rather than a causal effect of marital conflict on risk for depression.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual's</b> {{abnormality}} is {{labelled as}} a pathology, {{it is possible}} for that person to take on both elements of the sick role or the stigmatization that follows some illnesses. Mental illness, in particular, is largely misunderstood by the population and often overwhelms others' impression of the patient.|$|R
50|$|Complicated {{grief is}} {{considered}} <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> ability to resume normal activities and responsibilities is continually disrupted beyond {{six months of}} bereavement.

5|$|Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, are an {{effective}} treatment for DPB when taken regularly {{over an extended}} period of time. Clarithromycin or roxithromycin are also commonly used. The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response), which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses. Treatment consists of daily oral administration of erythromycin for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and blood gas (an arterial blood test that measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range. Allowing a temporary break from erythromycin therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa. However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, erythromycin may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure is occurring.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 January, the Avon and Somerset Constabulary arrested 32-year-old Dutch {{engineer}} Vincent Tabak, who lived with his girlfriend in the flat next door to Yeates. However, authorities declined to reveal additional details while the suspect was being interrogated due to concerns over controversial media coverage of Jefferies' arrest, which had breached the rules governing what can be reported <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> is arrested. The Tabak arrest followed an anonymous tip from a female caller, shortly after a televised appeal by Yeates' parents on Crimewatch. Canynge Road was closed by police while scaffolding was constructed around Yeates' home; and officers sealed off Tabak's adjacent flat. Investigators also searched the nearby townhouse of a friend, where Tabak was {{believed to have been}} staying, about a mile away. Tabak had previously been ruled out as a suspect during an earlier stage of the investigation, and had returned to Britain from a holiday visit to his family in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{broke out}} in the factory at around 2:30 IST, as workers slept. Once they became aware of the blaze, the {{employees}} found they were unable to break through the factory's locked doors. Five fire tenders were sent to the scene, but by the time they arrived, local residents had broken down two locked gates and already rescued the surviving workers. These impromptu Rescue efforts were delayed however, <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> carrying keys to open the door nervously dropped them while attempting to open the gate. At least 10 people were dead by the time rescuers reached the factory's interior, with a further eighteen injured. The survivors, many suffering from burns over 70 percent of their bodies, were taken to the National Medical College and Hospital, where victims had to be left on the floor due to a shortage of beds. The hospital did not have a burns unit, and the only treatments available at the hospital were ointments and saline drips. The patients were eventually moved to other hospitals. Local MLA Javed Khan later said that the death toll is actually at least twelve, but there has been no official confirmation of this. The Rapid Action Force was also deployed to maintain calm.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory has}} {{implications}} for understanding {{the different types of}} litter reduction interventions that will most effectively reduce littering in a given environment. The theory states that, all things being equal, passive littering will be more resistant to change because of two psychological processes: 1. diffusion of responsibility that increases as the latency between <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory, and 2. forgetting, which is also more likely to occur at longer delays between <b>when</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory.|$|E
