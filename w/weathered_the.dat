Roads connecting the north and south of the island were quickly cleared. LUCELEC, the nation's only electricity provider, worked around the clock to repair dozens of downed electrical poles and restored electricity by August 21.

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{from the}} typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at Camp Fuji, a training facility for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp <b>weathered</b> <b>the</b> storm inside huts {{situated at the}} base of a hill which housed a fuel farm. The breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders, releasing large quantities of fuel. The fuel flowed down the hill and was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts. The resultant fire killed 13 Marines, injured 68, and caused moderate damage to the facility. The facility's barracks were destroyed, along with fifteen huts and several other structures. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was established for those who lost their lives in the fire.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Puerto Cabezas, {{population}} 60,000, meteorologists expected a direct hit. Local authorities announced a curfew to prevent looting. The government also cut off electricity throughout the small coastal city to prevent injuries. Evacuations were limited, and the most vulnerable of the population <b>weathered</b> <b>the</b> storm in poorly constructed shelters. To {{be able to respond}} to an emergency following Beta, the government of Nicaragua requested relief supplies for 41,866 families which would last 15 days. These supplies consisted of 98,000lb (44,452kg) of cereals, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of beans, 628,600lb (285,128kg) of corn, 125,7200lb (57,025kg) of rice, 44,500lb (20,184kg) of sugar, 171,600lb (77,836kg) of salt, 4,929gal (18,658L) of cooking oil, 324,900lb (147,372kg) of milk and 21,264 blankets.|$|E

5|$|The former private chapel of Edward Reynolds, Bishop of Norwich, {{was built}} in 1662 almost entirely at his own expense. It {{replaced}} an earlier chapel which had been severely damaged by a mob during Bishop Hall's episcopate (1641–1656). Constructed from stone with a plain tile roof, it annexes the Bishop's Palace. There is a coat of arms above the doorway but it is badly <b>weathered.</b> <b>The</b> Grade II* listed building was previously used by the dean and chapter for the storage of records and came {{to be used as}} a library by the school under S. M. Andrews' headship (1967–75) following renovations funded by the Dyers.|$|E
5|$|At Caimito and Rosario, warehouses, their contents, piers, and wharves {{were all}} driven {{out into the}} {{neighboring}} ocean, and both towns were entirely flattened. The hurricane destroyed all the piers and nearly every building in Cabañas, and of the 23houses built in Cojimar, only seven <b>weathered</b> <b>the</b> storm. A majority of ships at Matanzas were destroyed, with numerous ships capsized or washed aground. Massive waves crashed ashore, crushing buildings and inundating low-lying areas in the city. Many wooden and stone buildings, already impaired by an earlier hurricane in 1844, were immediately destroyed by the surge's impact. Structures along the shoreline, in addition to towns along the courses of the Yumurí and San Juan rivers, were driven out to sea. More than forty deaths occurred {{in the first round}} of flooding brought by the storm. At Güines, the tempest wrecked all of the town's residences, public buildings, and businesses, and over a hundred individuals died. Among the losses were two distilleries, a packing plant, a lumbermill, and a warehouse, and countless other buildings, while at Pinar del Río, flooding along mountainsides and nearby rivers swamped the city and other nearby communities.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Danes Island in {{the summer}} of 1897, the {{expedition}} found that the balloon hangar built the year before had <b>weathered</b> <b>the</b> winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andrée had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Frænkel. On July 11, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andrée dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper Aftonbladet, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes round, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andrée had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam {{throughout}} the region. The region was ruled by dynasties of the Bengal Sultanate and feudal lords under the Delhi Sultanate {{for the next}} few hundred years. The Bengal Sultanate was interrupted for a period of twenty years by a Hindu uprising under Raja Ganesha. In the 16thcentury, Mughal general Islam Khan conquered Bengal. Administration by governors appointed by the court of the Mughal Empire gave way to semi-independence under the Nawabs of Murshidabad, who nominally respected the sovereignty of the Mughals in Delhi. Several independent Hindu states were established in Bengal during the Mughal period, including those of Pratapaditya of Jessore District and Raja Sitaram Ray of Bardhaman. The Koch dynasty in northern Bengal flourished during the 16th and 17thcenturies; it <b>weathered</b> <b>the</b> Mughals and survived until the advent of the British colonial era.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdists in the trenches, {{equipped}} with outdated rifles and makeshift ammunition, designed {{to wait until}} Hunter's forces were well within range to open fire. The entrenched Mahdists <b>weathered</b> <b>the</b> continual barrage of the advancing forces until the distance shrunk to one hundred yards. Together, the Mahdist line erupted in rifle fire, hammering the advancing battalions and, in particular, the stationary 10th Sudanese. Two British officers, Brevet-Major Henry Sidney and Lieutenant Edward Fitzclarence, three Egyptian officers, and a dozen regular soldiers {{were killed in the}} volleys. Over fifty were wounded across the brigade. Following this exchange, the battalions abandoned their orderly approach and charged the trenches with their bayonets. A furious melee ensued, wherein soldiers of MacDonald's brigade poured into the trenches and through the town, engaging in vicious hand-to-hand combat with Mahdists wherever they were {{to be found in the}} winding alleyways and narrow houses of Abu Hamed. In several places artillery was used to dislodge particularly stalwart defenders, while the Mahdist cavalry, looking on as Hunter's battalions swept through the town, turned to flee south towards Berber.|$|E
5|$|The {{strong winds}} left {{considerable}} tree and powerline damage. At {{the worst of}} the storm, 23,000 of the island's 30,000power subscribers were without electricity. Damage to power lines totaled to $385,000 (2001USD, $468,700 2008USD). The strong winds also caused considerable damage to vegetation. Three cruise ships <b>weathered</b> <b>the</b> storm at Saint George Harbour, where the powerful winds ripped out a post and snapped a mooring line, leaving a ship drifting in the harbor. One crew member was minorly injured. Over a dozen boats broke free from their moorings, resulting in them running aground or sinking. In all, 87boats were affected to some degree, with marine damage totaling to about $665,000 (2001USD, $809,600 2008USD). The winds also caused minor damage to 175properties on the island, primarily to houses. Damage to houses amounted to about $425,000 (2001USD, $517,400 2008USD). Overall damage was moderate, totaling to about $1.4million (2001USD, $1.7million 2008USD). No fatalities were reported, though a few storm-related injuries occurred.|$|E
