50|$|The last {{entry in}} the class is the UGST heavy {{deepwater}} torpedo {{with a range of}} up to 60 km (export versions are limited to 40 km). It differs from the most previous Soviet and Russian torpedoes in that unlike the previously dominant electric or peroxide propulsion, it uses the Otto fuel axial engine, which allows it to have much extended range while keeping the speeds of up to 65 knots. It also features an updated homing system, which, in addition to the traditional passive wake homing, features a phased array active sonar and an improved wire guidance system: previous Soviet torpedoes had the guidance wire spool in the torpedo body, with the wire released through the hollow propeller shaft, which had the disadvantage of the wire being prone to breakage, while the UGST has the <b>wire</b> <b>release</b> port on the side. Together with the towed extender spool, kept in the calmer portion of the wake, this makes the wire much more durable than before. It was supposed to enter service in the 1990s, but the teething problems and the lack of funding during that period made the deployment sluggish, and it entered the widespread service only in the 2015 by the Fizik name, being quickly replaced by the new-generation Futlyar (Fizik-2). Sources refer to them as heat-seeking torpedoes.|$|E

40|$|With the {{continued}} push for smaller, faster, and cheaper spacecraft comes {{a new era}} in mechanism design. The desire to develop “Micro Satellites”, along with advances in the processing and selection of materials, have created an abundance of opportunities to miniaturize mechanisms. Simple designs with direct applications of developing technologies are ideal for these miniature mechanisms. This paper will focus on the design and development of a miniature satellite “tool kit”. Six mechanisms were developed by Starsys Research and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at John Hopkins University (JHU) under a NASA Advanced Technology Development (ATD) Program. The mechanisms developed included a Micro and Mini Separation Nut, a Mini Rotary Actuator, a Micro Burn <b>Wire</b> <b>Release,</b> a SMA Linear Actuator, and a SMA Redundant Release Mechanism. The paper will discuss the concepts evaluated, designs chosen for fabrications, problems encountered during development, achieved performance characteristics, and recommendations for future development...|$|E
40|$|Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Göttingen, Germany {{planned to}} build a {{scientific}} payload Sub-Millimeter Wave Instrument (SWI) that will be on-board the Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) Spacecraft. The launch is expected in 2022. The main blocks of the instrument include Telescope and Receiver Unit (TRU), Radiator Unit (RU) and Electronics Unit (EU). The TRU consists of two main scanning mechanisms namely Cross-Track (CT) and Along-Track (AT) scanning mechanisms. This thesis describes {{the design of a}} conceptual Launch Lock (LL) that locks the scanning mechanisms. It also discusses the Quasi Static Load (QSL) and vibration simulations of Breadboard TRU. The main purpose of the LL is to lock the moving parts of a payload in a suitable position and release it after launch. Initial design of the LL was already developed at MPS but later due to design iterations it was completely changed considering mass and function. Topology Optimization Technique was implemented to check the Element Strain Energy Density Distribution in the parts which were later incorporated into the design. Two LL’s were developed with same operating principle one for CT and other for AT scanning mechanisms. Simulations were performed applying QSL on both LL’s and results were evaluated. Breadboard model of Burn <b>Wire</b> <b>Release</b> Mechanism (BWRM) and Tensioning Mechanism (TM) were designed to check the applicability of Dyneema and Vectran strings that keeps the LL in the locked position. The LL was designed successfully and integrated with the Breadboard TRU. The second main work discussed are the dynamic simulations of the Breadboard TRU. Launch loads that include sine and random loads are studied from the Experiment Interface Document Part-A (EID-A) drafted by European Space Agency (ESA). These loads were converted to a suitable form which could be directly used as an input for vibration simulations using Siemens NX Software with NX Nastran Solver. Normal Mode Analysis was performed to check the natural frequencies of the TRU. Acceleration and Von-mises stress plots are generated under sine and QSL/random loads respectively. The results are discussed further. From the simulation predicted results it is confirmed that TRU qualifies for a real time shaker test.

30|$|An {{interaction}} was recorded between the nickel-titanium alloy {{and the surrounding}} environment (i.e., the artificial saliva) and both new superelastic and heat-activated NiTi <b>wires</b> <b>released</b> nickel ions. This is a support {{to the notion that}} this alloy is not an inert one [19]. Only tiny amounts of Ni ions were detected when evaluating unused superelastic and heat-activated NiTi wires (8.36 and 7.92 ppb, respectively). This may be because of the redundant Ni ions on the wires’ surfaces [19], those Ni ions unlinked to Ti in both types of wires (“used” and “unused”) could be easily released in artificial saliva. Kuhta et al. [36] found that superelastic NiTi <b>wires</b> <b>released</b> more Ni than heat-activated NiTi wires, but they studied wires from different manufacturers and immersed them in a different artificial saliva than that used in the current study.|$|R

40|$|Nickel (Ni) is {{a potent}} {{sensitizer}} and may induce innate and adaptive immune responses. Ni {{is an important component}} of orthodontic appliances (8 - 50 wt%). Due to chemical and mechanical factors in the oral environment, Ni is released from these appliances. Retention wires are in situ {{for a long period of}} time. Objectives To quantitatively evaluate the influence of mechanical loading and pH on the nickel release from orthodontic retention wires. Methods Five different types of multi-stranded wires (Original Wildcat, Noninium, Lingual retainer, Dentaflex 3 -s, Dentaflex 6 -s), were submersed for 24 h in either 10 ml of distilled water or lactic acid, both submitted to cyclic loading in a 3 -point bending test (0 ×, 1000 ×, 10, 000 ×). The solutions were analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and the data was statistically analyzed (ANOVA, p < 0. 05). Results Mechanical loading has a strong effect on the Ni release from orthodontic retention wires, especially in distilled water. Acidity has more impact on Ni release when compared to mechanical loading. Manganese-steel "Ni-free" <b>wires</b> <b>released</b> quantifiable amounts of Ni due to trace elements of Ni within the wire. Significance All investigated <b>wires</b> <b>release</b> considerable amounts of Ni to which exposure may have biological implications...|$|R
