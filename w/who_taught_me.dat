She wrote later that he, [...] "whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring". Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of tuberculosis, he wrote to her, saying {{that he would like}} to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw. Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862—"When a little Girl, I had a friend, <b>who</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> Immortality– but venturing too near, himself– he never returned"—refers to Newton.|$|E
500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is what a person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person you are with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "{{somebody}} <b>who</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> how to fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust in somebody who can give you faith {{and the belief that}} you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the affirmation of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency". Adams explained further; [...] "It's a sort of new love affair with an old story, devouring our celebrities and leaving them when we are done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gackt's musical {{education}} {{began at}} age three {{when his parents}} initiated his classical piano education. He grew tired of the piano at age seven when he entered elementary school, and because of moving had to change teachers. It would take another four years until his parents allowed him to quit lessons. Since his father played the trumpet, Gackt was also familiar with brass instruments. He has credited the classical pianist and composer Frédéric Chopin with being [...] "the one <b>who</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> the beauty, depth, fun, sadness, the kindness of music; that music could grant people courage, {{and the meaning of}} the layers of sound. It isn't an exaggeration to say Chopin is the foundation of my music". Having only listened to classical music and enka while growing up, he did not become interested in rock music until he was a young adult. He cited Led Zeppelin's [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] as being particularly inspiring, and went on to master modern percussion and electric guitar.|$|E

2500|$|Recording artist Prince {{played the}} guitar on three {{songs from the}} album, [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Keep It Together", and [...] "Act of Contrition", though he {{remained}} uncredited. [...] Prince and Madonna also worked together on the track [...] "Love Song". The song was recorded at Prince's Studio on Paisley Park; [...] "We were friends and talked about working together, so I went to Minneapolis to write some stuff with him, {{but the only thing}} I really dug was 'Love Song' [...] We ended up writing it long-distance, because I had to be in L.A. and he couldn't leave Minneapolis, and quite frankly I couldn't stand Minneapolis. When I went there, it was like 20 degrees below zero, and it was really desolate. I was miserable and I couldn't write or work under those circumstances", Madonna recalled. [...] For the artwork, the singer chose to work with photographer Herb Ritts. Initially, photos from the session with Ritts were also to be used for the lead single's packaging. For the photoshoot, she decided to dye her blonde hair brown; she commented [...] "I love blonde hair, but it really does something different to you. I feel more grounded when I have dark hair. It's unexplainable. I also feel more Italian when my hair is dark". The cover art features a close-up of the singer's jean-clad midsection and bare midriff. The cover has been seen as a reference to Sticky Fingers by The Rolling Stones. The packaging on the first pressings of the CD, cassette, and LP were scented with patchouli oils to simulate church incense. [...] A publicist for Warner Bros. Records revealed this had been the singer's idea; [...] "She wanted to create a flavor of the 60's and the church. She wanted to create a sensual feeling you could hear and smell". Initial pressings also included an insert with safe sex guidelines and a warning about the dangers of AIDS, to which Madonna had lost friends. Its inclusion was decided after Warner Bros. had agreed to release an album by stand-up comedian Sam Kinison the year before, although he had stated that AIDS came from gay men involved in bestiality. Madonna dedicated the album to [...] "My mother, <b>who</b> <b>taught</b> <b>me</b> how to pray".|$|E
