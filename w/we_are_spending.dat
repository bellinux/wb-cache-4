500|$|By 2003, only 18people at 3D Realms {{were working}} on the game. One former {{employee}} said that Broussard and Miller were still operating on a [...] "1995 mentality", before games became large-team, big budget development affairs. Because they were financing the project themselves, the developers could also ignore pressure from their publisher; their standard reply to when Duke Nukem Forever would ship was [...] "when it's done". In 2003, Take-Two CEO Jeffrey Lapin reported that the game would not be out that year. He further said the company was writing off $5.5million from its earnings due to Duke Nukem Forevers lengthy development time. Broussard shot back that [...] "Take-Two needs to ... We don’t want Take-Two saying stupid-ass things in public for the sole purposes of helping their stock. It's our time and our money <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>spending</b> on the game. So either we're absolutely stupid and clueless, or we believe in what we are working on." [...] Later that year, Lapin said 3D Realms had told him that Duke Nukem Forever was expected to be finished by the end of 2004, or the beginning of 2005.|$|E

2500|$|...We are {{slightly}} disappointed with this season, as we increased the playing budget," [...] he said. [...] "The highlight {{was getting to}} Wembley but we froze {{a little in the}} final.

[...] He wrote to Senator Mark Hatfield, [...] "And I began to get mad, Senator. I had finally found where the blame must be laid: that the money <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>spending</b> for national defense is not defending us from the villains real and near, the awful villains of ignorance, and cancer, and heart disease and highway death.

2500|$|Emanuel's {{previous}} {{statements on}} rationing {{were about the}} [...] "allocation of very scarce medical interventions such as organs and vaccines" [...] such as who should get a [...] "liver for transplantation". Ezekiel said that McCaughey's euthanasia claims were a [...] "willful distortion of my record". Jim Rutennberg said that Emanuel's critics oversimplified complex issues, such as who should get a kidney. Such rationing {{was said to be}} unavoidable because of scarcity, and because a scarce resource such as a liver is [...] "indivisible". Emanuel said that McCaughey took words out of context, omitting qualifiers such as [...] "Without overstating it (and without fully defending it) ... Clearly, {{more needs to be done}} ..." [...] Emanuel once compared the word [...] "rationing" [...] to George Carlin’s seven words you can't say on television. In 1994 Emanuel said in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, [...] "Just because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>spending</b> a lot of money on patients who die does not mean that we can save a lot of money on end of life care." ...|$|E

25|$|We {{would often}} cross the broad avenue with the martial {{sounding}} name... The one that separated Courbevoie from Puteaux.

60|$|And it {{is because}} I feel so keenly the want of such a service, and the want of great sums of money for it, that I deplore the {{disposition}} to waste millions upon the hasty creation of a universal service army and upon excessive Dreadnoughting.

60|$|I want {{to suggest}} that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>spending</b> too much money in the former and not enough in the latter {{direction}} We are buying enormous quantities of stuff that will be old iron in twenty years' time, and we are starving ourselves of that which cannot be bought or made in a hurry, and upon which the strength of nations ultimately rests altogether; we are failing to get and maintain a sufficiency of highly educated and developed men inspired by a tradition of service and efficiency.|$|E

60|$|In {{the popular}} {{imagination}} the Dreadnought is still the one instrument of naval war. We count our strength in Dreadnoughts and Super-Dreadnoughts, and so long as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>spending</b> our national resources upon them faster than any other country, if we sink at least £160 for every £100 sunk in these obsolescent monsters by Germany, we have a reassuring sense of keeping ahead and being thoroughly safe. This confidence in big, very expensive battleships is, I believe and hope, shared by the German Government and by Europe generally, but it is, nevertheless, a very unreasonable confidence, and it may easily lead us into the most tragic of national disillusionments.|$|E

There, Bourguiba found, with great pleasure, his old Sadiki friend, Tahar Sfar, who studied in another classe de première. Two or three weeks later, he was summoned by Tahar Zouiten who announced the decision to downgrade him to classe de seconde. Bourguiba stated years later: [...] "Despite the chagrin caused by this downgrade, I executed the decision.
