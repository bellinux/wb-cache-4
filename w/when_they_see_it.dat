2500|$|In {{spite of}} updated sets and {{production}} changes, Coronation Street still received criticism. In 1992, {{chairman of the}} Broadcasting Standards Council, Lord Rees-Mogg, criticised the low-representation of ethnic minorities, and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as [...] "Coronation Street shuts out blacks" [...] (The Times), and [...] "'Put colour in t'Street" [...] (Daily Mirror). Patrick Stoddart of The Times wrote: [...] "The millions who watch Coronation Street– and who {{will continue to do}} so despite Lord Rees-Mogg– know real life <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it...</b> in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen". Black and Asian characters had appeared, but it was not until 1999 that the show featured its first regular non-white family, the Desai family.|$|E

5000|$|It's a shame people write so {{many things}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> haven't <b>seen</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> you <b>see</b> the film, <b>it</b> makes more sense. It's an art film. It should be playing in museums. It's like an Andy Warhol movie.|$|R
2500|$|In {{consumer}} markets, {{another key}} strategic level decision {{is whether to}} use a push or pull strategy. In a push strategy, the marketer uses intensive advertising and incentives aimed at distributors, especially retailers and wholesalers, {{with the expectation that}} they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in stores. In contrast, in a pull strategy, the marketer promotes the product directly to consumers hoping that they will pressure retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel. [...] The choice of a push or pull strategy has important implications for advertising and promotion. In a push strategy the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use of consumer-oriented media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio.|$|E

"There {{is another}} sort of courage, that which {{supports}} men under long continued strain, and enables them, patiently and steadfastly, to face death <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> approaching step by step.

"One is shy {{of asking}} men under {{sentence}} {{what they have}} been sentenced for; and in the same way it is awkward to ask very rich people what they want so much money for, why they make such a poor use of their wealth, why they don't give <b>it</b> up, even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> in <b>it</b> their unhappiness; and if they begin a conversation about it themselves, it is usually embarrassing, awkward, and long.'How is one to say it?'

60|$|And now, if {{any people}} should be {{disposed}} to think my history immoral (for I have heard some assert that I {{was a man who}} never deserved that so much prosperity should fall to my share), I will beg those cavillers to do me the favour to read the conclusion of my adventures; <b>when</b> <b>they</b> will <b>see</b> <b>it</b> was no such great prize that I had won, and that wealth, splendour, thirty thousand per annum, and a seat in Parliament, are often purchased at too dear a rate, when one has to buy those enjoyments at the price of personal liberty, and saddled with the charge of a troublesome wife.|$|R
50|$|It is {{said that}} when he had made the figure in clay, all who saw the {{arrangement}} of the armatures, and the moulds laid upon them, held it to be a beautiful piece of work, recognizing the rare ingenuity of Baccio in such an enterprise; and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> cast with the utmost facility, they gave Baccio credit for having shown supreme mastery, and having made a solid and beautiful casting.

5000|$|The Mountain Meadows Massacre was {{the first}} work to fully {{document}} Mormon involvement in the massacre.

They have succeeded in isolating the bacillus leprae and studying it. They know it now <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> All they do is to snip a bit of skin from the suspect and subject it to the bacteriological test.

500|$|In 2012, The Devil Inside, a low-budget {{found footage}} horror film {{following}} in the steps of Cloverfield, opened the weekend after New Year's Day. Critics, for whom {{it had not been}} screened, reviewed it harshly if and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> did <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> and audiences reacted angrily to the film's abrupt ending, which directed them to a website for more information. Yet, as Cargill notes, its success was proof that even on that low-potential weekend, a disengaged audience will [...] "throw money at a terrible movie if it looks like it's good." [...] The film's opening weekend take of $33.7 million ranks in the top ten for January. The Devil Inside went on to make over $50 million domestically and almost that much abroad to break $100 million in total receipts.|$|R
