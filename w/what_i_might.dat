Once in the job, he grew increasingly dissatisfied with a posting that he {{considered to be a}} [...] "non-job", later commenting that [...] "I don't understand why, after everything I had done for the program... I was only one that was removed. That's {{the end of the program}} for me." [...] Only six months after the fire, and some two months after taking his new position, Shea left NASA in order to become a Vice President at the Polaroid Corporation in Waltham, Massachusetts. He had not been called to testify before the congressional inquiry into the fire.|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{interpretations of}} global {{citizenship}} are positive. For example, Parekh advocates {{what he calls}} globally oriented citizenship, and states, [...] "If global citizenship means being {{a citizen of the}} world, it is neither practicable nor desirable." [...] He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community. He also notes that such a world state would inevitably be [...] "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland." [...] Parekh presents his alternate option with the statement: [...] "Since the conditions of life of our fellow human beings in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> call a globally oriented citizen." [...] Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} help being amused, though I heard the old lady out with {{feelings}} of real concern. It was difficult to doubt her with {{the father and son}} before me. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have thought of them without the old lady's account, or <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have thought of the old lady's account without them, I cannot say. There was a fitness of things in the whole that carried conviction with it.|$|E
