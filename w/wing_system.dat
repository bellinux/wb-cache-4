2500|$|The UH-60 can be {{equipped}} with stub wings {{at the top of}} fuselage to carry fuel tanks or various armaments. The initial stub <b>wing</b> <b>system</b> is called External Stores Support System (ESSS). It has two pylons on each wing to carry two [...] and two [...] tanks in total. The four fuel tanks and associated lines and valves form the external extended range fuel system (ERFS). U.S. Army UH-60s have had their ESSS modified into the crashworthy external fuel system (CEFS) configuration, replacing the older tanks with up to four total [...] crashworthy tanks along with self-sealing fuel lines. The ESSS can also carry [...] of armament such as rockets, missiles and gun pods. The ESSS entered service in 1986. However, {{it was found that the}} four fuel tanks obstruct the field of fire for the door guns; thus, the external tank system (ETS), carrying two fuel tanks on the stub wings, was developed.|$|E

40|$|This work {{relates to}} fluid-structure {{interactions}} {{in the context}} of flapping <b>wing</b> <b>systems.</b> System models of flapping flight are explored by using a coupling scheme to provide communication between a fluid model and a structural model describing a flexible wing. The constructed computational models serve as a tool for investigating complex fluid-structure interactions and characterizing them. Primary goals of this work are construction of models to understand nonlinear phenomena associated with the flexible flapping <b>wing</b> <b>systems,</b> and explore means and methods to enhance their performance characteristics. Several system analysis tools are employed to characterize the coupled fluid-structure system dynamics, including proper orthogonal decomposition, dimension calculations, time histories, and frequency spectra. Results obtained from two-dimensional simulations conducted for a combination of a two-link structural system and a fluid system are presented and discussed. Comparisons are made between the use of direct numerical simulation and the unsteady vortex lattice method as the fluid model in this coupled dynamical system. To enable three-dimensional studies, a novel solid model is formulated from continuum mechanics for geometrically exact finite elements. A new partitioned fluid-structure interaction algorithm based on the Generalized-α method is formulated and implemented in a large scale fluids solver inside the FLASH framework. Consistent boundary conditions are also formulated by using Lagrangian particles. Several examples demonstrating the effectiveness of the methods and implementation are shown, in particular, for flapping flight at low Reynolds numbers. Unique experiments have also been undertaken to determine the first few natural frequencies and mode shapes associated with hawkmoth wings. The computational framework developed in this dissertation and the research findings {{can be used as a}} basis to understand the role of flexibility in flapping <b>wing</b> <b>systems,</b> further explore the complex dynamics of flapping <b>wing</b> <b>systems,</b> and also develop design schemes that might make use of nonlinear phenomena for performance enhancement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Wing rock is {{a highly}} {{nonlinear}} phenomenon in which an aircraft undergoes limit cycle roll oscillations at high angles of attack. In this paper, a supervisory recurrent fuzzy neural network control (SRFNNC) system is developed to control the <b>wing</b> rock <b>system.</b> This SRFNNC system is comprised of a recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) controller and a supervisory controller. The RFNN controller is investigated to mimic an ideal controller and the supervisory controller is designed {{to compensate for the}} approximation error between the RFNN controller and the ideal controller. The RFNN is inherently a recurrent multilayered neural network for realizing fuzzy inference using dynamic fuzzy rules. Moreover, an on-line parameter training methodology, using the gradient descent method and the Lyapunov stability theorem, is proposed to increase the learning capability. Finally, a compar-ison between the sliding-mode control, the fuzzy sliding control and the proposed SRFNNC of a <b>wing</b> rock <b>system</b> is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the SRFNNC system. Simulation re-sults demonstrate that the proposed design method can achieve fa-vorable control performance for the <b>wing</b> rock <b>system</b> without the knowledge of system dynamic functions.

40|$|Induced drag is {{commonly}} {{regarded as the}} undesired side effect of the lift generation in finite aspect ratio wings, which {{may lead to the}} erroneous conclusion that infinite wings and non-lifting finite wings are definitely induced drag free. In this work <b>wing</b> <b>systems</b> are investigated which, in spite of being non lifting, generate induced drag. The investigation includes corrugated wings with infinite and finite aspect ratios, the incompressible and the compressible subsonic ranges, steady and oscillatory motions. Also a non planar system is considered, namely the corrugated annular wing. The analysis is performed by means of classical linear analytical tools by extending Prandtl's lifting line theory and reformulating it in term of a dipole line distribution instead of a vortex line. Several stimulating conclusions are found, apart from the evidence that non lifting <b>wing</b> <b>systems</b> exist, which are able to generate a large induced drag. The most interesting among these conclusions are: i) the induced drag has a maximum in correspondence of certain wavelengths of the wing corrugation (so that a "worst wing system" can be identified); ii) the characteristic singular behaviour displayed by the linear compressible theories when transonic conditions are approached may be offset by the effect of the wing corrugation; iii) in the unsteady oscillatory case the induced drag may evolve to an induced propulsion depending on the phase relation between the instantaneous values of the lift and of the angle of attac...|$|R

5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect <b>wing</b> <b>systems</b> in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera.
