5|$|When You Reach Me is a Newbery Medal-winning {{science fiction}} and mystery novel by Rebecca Stead, {{published}} in 2009. It {{takes place in}} the Upper West Side in New York during 1978 and 1979 and follows the protagonist, Miranda Sinclair. She receives a strange note asking her to record future events and write down the location of her spare key. As the novel progresses, Miranda receives three more notes with requests. The novel contains three story lines— the appearance of Miranda's mom on the game show, The $20,000 Pyramid, Miranda's best friend Sal suddenly not talking with Miranda, and the appearance of a laughing man. Central themes in the novel include independence, redemption and friendship. Stead also wanted to demonstrate the possibilities that she saw in time travel. The author hoped to show her children what New York <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> her childhood, and demonstrate how in an earlier time children were more independent.|$|E
25|$|On October 17, 1987, Lamar High School and its {{students}} celebrated its 50th anniversary {{by creating a}} time capsule to teach {{the students in the}} future how high school life <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s. The time capsule was buried in front of Lamar's main entrance where it lies today. The plaque that marks where the time capsule lies is made from marble donated by the community of River Oaks and fund raising events held at Lamar at the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} Shayataun (devils/satans) in Islam {{parallels}} the Christian concept of demons and was probably introduced together with angels to Arabian lore by Islam. They are hold {{to be the}} servants of Iblis, who <b>was,</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> Christian thought, banished from heaven. If Iblis himself was originally an Angel or a Jinni is controversial in Islamic belief, yet after his fall, he turned into a Shaitan and then fathered the Shayateen. The Shayateen do not die until the last day and can not become believers, therefore they are always evil, seeking for leading humans astray from God, by whispering to the hearts. Furthermore, the term Shaitan and Jinn may overlap, since an evil Jinni is also called Shaitan, like evil humans may also be called Shaitan if they {{are considered to be}} purely evil.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the resort}} homes and {{buildings}} from the Neptune beach era still exist in present-day Alameda. The Croll Building, {{on the corner of}} Webster Street and Central Avenue, was the site of Croll's Gardens and Hotel, famous as training quarters for some of the greatest fighters in boxing history from 1883 to 1914. James J. Corbett, Bob Fitzsimmons, Jim Jefferies, Jack Johnson, and many other champions all stayed and trained here. Today this beautifully preserved building is home to Croll's Pizza and the 1400 Bar & Grill Restaurant. Neptune Court, just a block away on the corner of Central Ave. and McKay Ave., provides another glimpse of what resort life <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> Alameda in the 1920s. A short walk near Crab Cove will reveal many more historic gems.|$|E

He's kind of today's equivalent of Peter Sellers." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{museums in}} Odense are mainly {{governed by the}} Odense City Museums, a {{department}} of the municipal government. Funen's Art Museum (Fyns Kunstmuseum), formerly The Museum of Funen's Abbey, is one of Denmark's oldest art museums, dating to 1885. It contains the principal works by Jens Juel, Dankvart Dreyer, P.S. Krøyer and H. A. Brendekilde. The open-air The Funen Village museum (Den Fynske Landsby) [...] tries to emulate what country life <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> Denmark {{at the time of}} Andersen's life and contains houses of historical Odense.|$|E

In {{addition}} to the cast and crew, the premiere was attended by various politicians, ambassadors and political reporters. At the premiere, United States Senator Ted Kennedy voiced his support of the film, stating, [...] "This movie will educate millions of Americans too young to recall the sad events of that summer about what life <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> this country before {{the enactment of the}} civil rights laws." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I <b>was,</b> <b>like,</b> <b>in</b> heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E
500|$|When the {{legislation}} that would become Medicare was introduced in 1961, he created a recording for the American Medical Association (AMA) warning that such legislation would {{mean the end of}} freedom in America. Reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it, [...] "we will awake to find that we have socialism. And if you don't do this, and if I don't do it, one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> America when men were free."

500|$|The New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani wrote a more {{critical}} review, describing the opening as [...] "heavy-handed" [...] and early {{events in the}} novel as [...] "soap-opera-ish". Despite these objections, she concluded, [...] "Gradually, however, Mr. Hosseini's instinctive storytelling skills take over, mowing down the reader's objections through sheer momentum and will. He succeeds in making the emotional reality of Mariam and Laila's lives tangible to us, and by conjuring their day-to-day routines, {{he is able to}} {{give us a sense of}} what daily life <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> Kabul — both before and during the harsh reign of the Taliban." [...] Similarly, Yvonne Zipp of The Christian Science Monitor concluded that A Thousand Splendid Suns was ultimately [...] "a little shaky as a work of literature".|$|E
500|$|Several critics praised {{this episode}} for its {{character}} development, {{something that they}} said was missing in the previous episodes. Robert Canning of IGN said that although there was still {{plenty of room for}} growth, the episode gave a better understanding of Liz and Jenna's friendship. He felt that prior to the episode, nothing was known about Liz and Jenna's longtime friendship, {{and that there was no}} depth to it. Canning said that Liz's admission of being somewhat jealous of Jenna's success was a much needed storyline for the show, and one that gave the audience something deeper to latch onto. However, Canning pointed out that small hints of what their friendship <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> the past were played for laughs as opposed to establishing any sort of history. Canning found that their verbal sparring really [...] "solidified their bond", and that by the end of the episode the audience had seen their [...] "human side" [...] and the [...] "characters had become people".|$|E
500|$|One Day in History was {{launched}} {{as a part}} of History Matters, a campaign led by several heritage organisations such as the National Trust, English Heritage and the Historic Houses Association, in order to draw attention towards the importance of history in everyday life. Its aim was to record for posterity what day-to-day life <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> the UK during 2006. British people were invited to write a blog of what they did on 17 October 2006, and to submit it {{to become a part of}} a large online diary. The project was open to all UK citizens and individuals of British origin, and was inspired by Mass Observation, a similar social research project founded in 1937. The date was chosen to be 17 October by History Matters in the hope that it would be [...] "an ordinary day much like any other of no particular national significance", and would therefore reflect the everyday life of its participants. Historian Dan Snow explained that the project was intended to be [...] "a detailed account of people's normal lives when they're doing nothing out of the ordinary. ... It's those mundane details, those boring details that will seem extraordinary to people hundreds of years in the future." [...] The organisers hoped that the contributors could also discuss the impact of history or heritage on their lives that day in their submissions.|$|E

500|$|AJ {{brings out}} a {{different}} side to Masood, which Ganatra said could [...] "upset the status quo". He said that AJ {{was brought in}} [...] "to stir up Masood's life, and that has exciting prospects", and they would [...] "get up {{to all sorts of}} shenanigans." [...] Presenter Kate Thornton, when interviewing Ganatra, said AJ was a [...] "playmate" [...] for Masood, while Wadia said that AJ brings the comedy back to Masood. Inside Soap Kate White called AJ [...] "a world away from family man Masood", while Soaplife said AJ is [...] "not a good influence but he sure puts a smile on [...] face and a new spring in his step." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said that AJ's influence on Masood is [...] "infectious". AJ's arrival allows people to see what Masood was like before he married Zainab, as all that was known about him to that point was his life with her. Ganatra stated: [...] "So by opening this door, you get to see what Masood <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> his childhood and as a teenager. Masood did have a naughty streak—he was in a band with his brother, and they got up to mischief. Masood [...] has been put on the straight and narrow [...] But prior to that, he was a teenager like any other—getting into trouble, and that was in cahoots with his brother AJ!" [...] Ganatra said that, as British Asians, Masood and AJ grew up going to clubs and getting into trouble with girls. Now, Masood sees AJ as somebody with [...] "no responsibilities, no children and no stress of having to provide for a family" [...] and as AJ suffers marrital problems, is feeling lonely and has no children, Ganatra said [...] "they want each other's lives, which is quite a nice dynamic to play." [...] He added that [...] "AJ would love the stability of a family life like Masood's, while Masood would love to pack his bags, get drunk and perhaps end up in a stranger's bed. I'm interested to see him bring out Masood's naughty streak—and where that could take them..." [...] AJ is accepting of Syed's homosexuality and his relationship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge).|$|E
2500|$|After {{purchasing}} the Buckner property, the National Park Service incorporated {{it into the}} Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. [...] The Buckner homestead and farm has been preserved, and {{is used by the}} National Park Service as an interpretive center to show visitors what pioneer life <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> the Stehekin Valley. [...] Although it is no longer a commercial farm, horses still graze in the Buckner’s pasture, water still flows through the irrigation ditches, and apples are still harvested from the orchard in the fall. [...] While some changes have been made to the building in order to preserve them, many of the structures are still in use for their intended purpose, including the main house which is now home for a National Park Service employee.|$|E
2500|$|The theater stopped showing {{movies in}} 1986, and in 1987 the Vega Building was damaged in the Whittier Narrows earthquake. [...] From 1986-1988, a non-denominational Christian church named Praise Chapel Christian Fellowship {{occupied}} {{the building and}} held regular services with over 1,000 people. In 1987 the pastors, Mike and Donna Neville were forced to move their church because, according to the owner, the building was condemned following the Whittier earthquake. The Vega Building was demolished in 1992 after officials determined {{it to be a}} hazard. The remaining theater building was left sitting vacant {{in the middle of an}} otherwise empty lot.

2500|$|To {{coincide}} with Stephanie Scully's (Carla Bonner) return to Neighbours in April 2013, the serial released six webisodes on their YouTube channel that featured Steph {{talking to a}} psychiatrist (Trudy Hellier) before her release from jail. Steph talks {{through a variety of}} issues and explains that she is returning to Erinsborough for someone. The webisodes also provide an insight into Steph's actions upon her return. The webisodes were directed by former Neighbours actor Scott Major. He explained that being part of Steph's original exit storyline did not influence his approach to directing the webisodes. He decided to film the webisodes in a different style to show viewers what it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> Steph's head. He said [...] "I wanted viewers to be a little uncomfortable, make them feel they were intruding on these private conversations." ...|$|E
2500|$|The poem {{was also}} {{frequently}} parodied. The poem [...] "Three Aces", signed [...] "Carl Byng", {{was published in}} the Buffalo Express in December 1870, not long after [...] "Plain Language from Truthful James" [...] first appeared. The poem was widely attributed to Mark Twain and labeled a [...] "feeble imitation" [...] of Harte. Twain angrily denied the charge and demanded a retraction, writing to the editor Thomas Bailey Aldrich, [...] "I am not in the imitation business". Harte, in turn, targeted Twain years later in his 1893 story [...] "Ingénue of the Sierras" [...] by creating an unsavory character named [...] "Charley Bing", modeled after Twain. The incident was one of several in a long rivalry between the two authors. In 1898, The Overland Monthly ran a poem making fun of Harte himself, who had moved to Europe in 1871 and never returned, for forgetting what life <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> the west.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Book of Song, a Chinese emperor {{appointed}} five {{kings of}} Wa {{to the position}} of ruler of Silla in 421, but what is confusing is that Japan wielded influence over {{the southern part of the}} Korean peninsula through the remote region according to the Nihon Shoki. In addition, the book of Song and the book of Sui can not be possible because many of the states considered to be Japan's vassal such as Chinhan and Mahan did not exist in the same time period as the vassal king of Yamato. In addition, the Book of Song was incomplete with missing volumes and filled in centuries later in a biased manner for political reasons.　Also, Silla did not have official contact with the Song/Sui until the 6th century making this 4th to 5th century statement impossible. [...] "As Egami (1964) notes, it may look very strange that the names of six or seven states listed in the self-claimed titles included Chin-han and Ma-han which had preceded, respectively, the states of Silla and Paekche. Perhaps the King of Wa had included the names of six or seven south Korean states in his title merely to boast of the extent of his rule. But Wa Kings could not have included the names of nonexistent states." [...] Other historians also dispute Japan's theory, claiming there is no evidence of Japanese rule in Gaya or any other part of Korea. Another problem with the book of Song and book of Sui is that many of the volumes of the books were missing and re-written later in a biased manner. It is difficult to make any sense of what the relationship <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> the past.|$|E
