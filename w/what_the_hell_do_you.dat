In a Morning Consult national poll in August 2016, only five percent of black voters said they intend to vote for Trump. However, Trump ended up receiving 8% of the African-American vote (about half a million more votes than Mitt Romney received in 2012). Starting in July and August, {{in an effort to}} improve his appeal to black Americans and make a direct appeal for their votes, Trump was vocal in expressing concern for their situations.

The episode's abrupt and downbeat ending provoked media coverage following its broadcast, with some critics believing it to be a comment on the show's long run and its creators exhaustion with producing episodes. They wrote the episode without a conclusion in mind, resolving to figure it out upon their return to producing episodes in the fall.
