Already <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> American comics, Thomas Volney Boardman, Sr., made an arrangement with Everett Arnold of Quality Comics to produce British editions of two titles, Feature Comics (#29–33) and Smash Comics (#7–11) all appearing in 1940–1941. Because Boardman needed low priced titles to please his primary outlet, WWoolworths Group's Department Stores, the British editions reprinted {{only about half the}} content of the American originals. To use the rest of the pages, Boardman created two additional corresponding titles in the American style, Super Funnies (#29–33) and Mystery Comics (#7–11).|$|E

However, Christian {{was incapable of}} a consistent diplomatic policy. He would neither conciliate Sweden, henceforth his most dangerous enemy, nor guard himself against her by a definite system of counter-alliances. Christian contacted the Roman Catholic part of the Thirty Years' War, and offered to broker a deal with Sweden. However, his mediating was highly skewed in favour of the Holy Roman Emperor, and was a transparent attempt of minimising the influence Swedish influence in the Baltics. His Scandinavian policy was so irritating and vexatious that Swedish statesmen advocated for a war with Denmark, to keep Christian from interfering in the peace negotiations with the Holy Roman Emperor, and in May 1643, Christian faced another war against Sweden. The increased Sound Dues had alienated the Dutch, who turned to support Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Throughout much of {{his adult}} life, Peckinpah was {{affected}} by alcoholism, and, later, other forms of drug addiction. According to some accounts, he also suffered from mental illness, possibly manic depression or paranoia. It is believed his drinking problems began during his service in the military while stationed in China, when he frequented the saloons of Tianjin and Beijing. After divorcing Selland, {{the mother of his}} first four children, in 1960, he married the Mexican actress Begoña Palacios in 1965. A stormy relationship developed, and over the years they married on three separate occasions. They had one daughter together. His personality reportedly often swung between a sweet, softly-spoken, artistic disposition, and bouts of rage and violence during which he verbally and physically abused himself and others. An experienced hunter, Peckinpah was fascinated with firearms and was known to shoot the mirrors in his house while abusing alcohol, an image which occurs several times in his films. Peckinpah's reputation as a hard-living brute <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> violence, inspired by the content in his most popular films and in many ways perpetuated by himself, affected his artistic legacy. His friends and family have claimed this does a disservice to a man who was actually more complex than generally credited. Throughout his career, Peckinpah seems to have inspired extraordinary loyalty in certain friends and employees. He used the same actors (Warren Oates, L. Q. Jones, R. G. Armstrong, James Coburn, Ben Johnson, and Kris Kristofferson), and collaborators (Jerry Fielding, Lucien Ballard, Gordon Dawson, and Martin Baum) in many of his films, and several of his friends and assistants stuck by him {{to the end of his}} life.|$|E

James Chapman commented on the realism and violence in the film noting that Bond is seen to seriously bleed {{for the first time in}} the series; Chapman also identified a number of violent scenes which make Casino Royale notable in the series. In 2012 Skyfall was released: it was Craig's third outing as 007.

500|$|Proun was {{essentially}} Lissitzky's {{exploration of the}} visual language of suprematism with spatial elements, utilizing shifting axes and multiple perspectives; both uncommon ideas in suprematism. Suprematism {{at the time was}} conducted almost exclusively in flat, 2D forms and shapes, and Lissitzky, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> architecture and other 3D concepts, tried to expand suprematism beyond this. His Proun works (known as Pro-oon) spanned over a half a decade and evolved from straightforward paintings and lithographs into fully three-dimensional installations. They would also lay the foundation for his later experiments in architecture and exhibition design. While the paintings were artistic in their own right, their use as a staging ground for his early architectonic ideas was significant. In these works, the basic elements of architecture– volume, mass, color, space and rhythm– were subjected to a fresh formulation in relation to the new suprematist ideals. Through his Prouns, utopian models for a new and better world were developed. This approach, in which the artist creates art with socially defined purpose, could aptly be summarized with his edict [...] "das zielbewußte Schaffen"– [...] "task oriented creation." ...|$|E

Petterson wrote [...] "Genocide was not a term that in the vogue then, as it came to be later, but {{it is fair to say}} that in parts of Zanzibar, the killing of Arabs was genocide, pure and simple". Okello, an eccentric, power-crazed man <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> cruelty frequently went on the radio to urge his followers in thunderous Old Testament language to kill as many Arabs as possible, with the maximum of brutality.

It was only discontent with the Arabs that gave Okello any sort of mass support, and once the government was overthrown, most of the Muslim Africans gave their loyalty to the mainstream black politicians, and shunned the bloodthirsty Okello who presented himself as a messianic figure ordered by the voices in his head (which Okello said were messages from God) to liberate Africa for Jesus Christ.
