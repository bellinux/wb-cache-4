5|$|The acute rice {{shortage}} prevailing in {{the state}} became an election issue with the DMK promising to supply three padis (approx. 4.5kg) of rice for 1 Rupee in its election manifesto. The DMK capitalised on the rice shortage as well as widespread discontent with the Bhaktavatsalam administration. Slogans like Kamarajar Annachi kadalaiparuppu vilai ennachu (Elder Brother (Annachi is a title historically been {{used to refer to}} a person of Kamaraj's caste) Kamaraj, <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> price of chana dal?), Bhaktavatsalam annachi arisi vilai ennachu (lit. Brother Bhatavatsalam, <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> price of rice?) were used effectively by the DMK to stir public anger against the Congress.|$|E

5|$|During the Second and Third Age, {{they held}} some {{protected}} realms {{with the aid}} of the Rings of Power, but after the War of the Ring they waned further, and most Elves left Middle-earth for Valinor.

5|$|In the 1920s, Wyatt gave Sadie signed legal {{papers and}} filing fees to {{a claim for}} an oil lease in Kern County, California.

5|$|The German Instrument of Surrender was {{delivered}} on 8 May to General Franz Böhme, {{the commander of}} all German forces stationed in Norway; the 1st Airborne Division landed near Oslo and Stavanger between 9 and 11 May. Most of the transport aircraft carrying the division landed safely, but one crash caused several fatalities. The division encountered little of the expected German resistance. Operational duties included welcoming back King Haakon, looking after Allied ex-prisoners of war, arresting war criminals and supervising the clearing of minefields. While in Norway, the division was also able to investigate <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airborne troops that had taken part in Operation Freshman.

5|$|The barony of Aberdour was {{acquired}} in 1126, by Sir Alan de Mortimer, on {{his marriage to}} Anicea, daughter of Sir John de Vipont. Sir Alan built St Fillan's Church, which still stands, next to the castle, in around 1140, and his family probably built the original hall house in around 1200, or possibly even earlier. In 1216, another Alan de Mortimer is recorded granting land to the monks of Inchcolm Abbey. There is no record of <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> de Mortimers, {{but in the early}} 14th century, King Robert the Bruce granted Aberdour to his kinsman, Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray (d. 1332). Moray's grandson granted the barony in turn to Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale (c. 1300-1353), in 1342.|$|E
5|$|The {{fate of the}} {{original}} letter given to Bixby is unknown. William A.

A few days later, William's sister, Mrs. Towers told the Boston Herald that she also did not know the letter's fate but speculated Bixby may have torn it up, resenting that it incorrectly said five of her sons had been killed. William's son, Arthur March Bixby, told the New York Sun in 1949 that he recalled his father telling him that she had angrily destroyed the letter after receiving it.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong {{first saw}} {{action in the}} Korean War on August 29, 1951, as an escort for a photo {{reconnaissance}} plane over Songjin. Five days later on September 3, he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon-ni, west of Wonsan. While making a low bombing run at about , Armstrong's F9F Panther was hit by anti-aircraft fire. While trying to regain control, he collided with a pole at a height of about , which sliced off about three feet (1 m) of the Panther's right wing. Armstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory, but due {{to the loss of}} the aileron, ejection was his only safe option. He planned to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters, and therefore flew to an airfield near Pohang, but his ejection seat was blown back over land.

5|$|Islands is an American {{animated}} miniseries {{based on}} the show Adventure Time by Pendleton Ward. It aired {{as part of the}} show's eighth season on Cartoon Network from January 30, 2017, to February 2, 2017. Adventure Time follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape, grow and shrink at will. In this limited event series, Finn, Jake, BMO (voiced by Niki Yang) and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) leave Ooo and travel across the ocean to solve the mystery of Finn's past. During their trip, they encounter various creatures, new friends, and a variety of mysterious islands. The trip culminates with a visit to Founder's Island, where Finn meets his biological mother, Minerva Campbell (voiced by Sharon Horgan), and discovers <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the human race.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island's Christians after the Muslim conquest; the {{traditional}} {{view is that}} most were either converted or expelled. There is evidence from Muslim sources, however, for the continued survival of Christians on Crete, as a subject class, as in other Muslim conquests, although according to the same sources the Muslims, whether descendants of the Andalusians, more recent migrants, or converts (or any combination of these) formed the majority. There is also evidence of rival classes on the island as when Theodosius the Deacon reports that the rural Cretans, not rulers of the land but inhabitants of crags and caves, descended from the mountains under their leader Karamountes during the siege of Chandax by Nikephoros Phokas to assist the besieged. It seems that the Byzantine Christian population of the countryside was left relatively alone, while the Muslim element (including native converts) predominated in the cities.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the bones}} in Turku were still in place in 1720 when they were catalogued for a {{transfer}} to Saint Petersburg during the Russian occupation of Finland in the Great Northern War. The man behind the idea was the infamous Swedish Count Gustaf Otto Douglas who had defected to the Russian side {{during the war and}} {{was in charge of the}} grim occupation of Finland. <b>What</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bones after that, remains unknown. According to some sources, the Russian vessel transporting the relics sank on the way. However, it is generally acknowledged that a piece of Henry's ulna had been placed in Bishop Hemming's reliquarium that was built in 1514 and treasured in the cathedral. Also enclosed was a piece of parchment stating the bone belonged to Henry. During the restoration work of the cathedral, the relic was relocated to the National Board of Antiquities.|$|E
