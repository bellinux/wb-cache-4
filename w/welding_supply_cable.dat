40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} design of <b>welding</b> power <b>supply</b> for MIG / MAG and MMA {{technique}} with continuous output current 120 A. The first, theoretical part {{is devoted to}} welding process technology, physical characteristics of electric arc and description of individual welding methods. The thesis also deals {{with the concept of}} power converter. The design of the switched-mode power supply is based on a full bridge topology. In order to implement advanced controls of <b>welding</b> power <b>supply,</b> the ARM Cortex M 4 microprocessor was selected. Due to the large power consumption of the stepper motor for drive the welding wire, an auxiliary switched-mode power supply was also implemented. The documentation describing the realization of the <b>welding</b> power <b>supply</b> and the results of the measurements are in {{the last part of the}} thesis. The <b>welding</b> power <b>supply</b> was successfully revived and reached nominal parameters.

40|$|One of the {{limiting}} factors {{for improving the}} sensitivity towards single spin detection using Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy is the working temperature. A component limiting this working temperature is the radio frequent (RF) source. The use of a superconducting NbTiN instead of a copper RF-source improves this working temperature and theory suggests that the dissipation of such a NbTiN RF-source is geometry dependent. The dissipation of 9 NbTiN RF-sources with different geometries was measured using two different methods. First a four-point measurement was used that returned inductive effects obscuring the dissipation of the RF-source. Secondly a calorimetric measurement was tried that returned dissipation originating in the <b>supply</b> <b>cables</b> overshadowing the dissipation of the RF-source. The dissipation of these <b>supply</b> <b>cables</b> corresponds very well with the dissipation attributed to the RF-source by our predecessors. The dissipation of the RF-source is thus found to be much lower than previously thought...|$|R
