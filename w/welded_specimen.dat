40|$|Abstract. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) {{is getting}} its {{popularity}} {{because it is}} considered as an environmentally friendly manufacturing. Homemade FSW tool to be attached to a conventional milling machine was designed and fabricated. Experimental investigation of FSW process of the Aluminum alloy work piece to observe its heat generation was performed. Since heat generation is the main objective in a FSW process, the importance of identification of heat generation performance in a <b>welded</b> <b>specimen</b> is paramount. Heat generation of a <b>welded</b> <b>specimen</b> during FSW was measured using infra red thermal camera. The limitation of the measurement is it only captured the heat generation at surrounding area and surface of the <b>welded</b> <b>specimen.</b> Therefore, the heat generation inside contact area could not be identified. To overcome this problem, a finite-element model of the FSW process was developed. A model consists of a solid model of half the <b>welded</b> <b>specimen</b> since the symmetrical behavior of the geometry and boundary condition was assumed. Heat transfer analysis of a solid body model of a work piece was computed. It was observed that FSW parameters which involved dominantly in the heat generation were spindle speed, feeding rate and normal force. The heat generation model of FSW process was validated with the one from the experimental investigation. Good agreement between the numerical and the experimental investigation result has been made...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} has been {{performed on the}} strain ageing of welded and non-welded specimen of low carbon steel. It was determined that the low carbon steel were susceptible to strain ageing in interstitial solutes. The increase in yield strength, tensile strength and elongation because of strain ageing has been compared between welded and non-welded specimen. At high level of prestrain, the percentage loss in ductility was observed. Increase in the strain-ageing temperature the value of ΔY increased, increase the time of ageing has also got influence on value of ΔY. However the influence of temperature of ageing is much more pronounced than the affect of time of ageing. The change in yield stress due to strain ageing in <b>welded</b> <b>specimen</b> was observed less than the non <b>welded</b> <b>specimen.</b> this increase in yield stress is attributed {{to the fact that}} the dislocation density of welded sample is higher than non-welded sample...|$|E

To study the mechanical properties of butt {{weld connection}}s after being exposed to high temperatures, Q 235 and Q 345 butt <b>weld</b> <b>specimens</b> were designed, heated to various high temperatures between 400 °C and 800 °C, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. Tensile tests were conducted on these butt <b>weld</b> <b>specimens</b> to obtain the force–displacement curves and relevant mechanical properties (yield and ultimate strengths) at various temperatures. The following conclusions were obtained from the test results: (1) The post-fire mechanical properties of the butt <b>weld</b> <b>specimens</b> were affected by material grade and heating temperature; (2) when the temperature exceeded 600 °C, the yield and ultimate strengths of the Q 235 and Q 345 butt <b>weld</b> <b>specimens</b> began to decrease; the strength reduction of the latter was greater than that of the former; (3) when the temperature was 800 °C, the yield strength and ultimate strength of Q 235 decreased to 87 % and 91 % of the ambient-temperature yield and ultimate strengths, respectively; and (4) the yield and ultimate strengths of Q 345 decreased to 83 % and 87 % of those at room temperature.

40|$|AbstractMost {{structures}} and components are fabricated using welded joints. A very {{high percentage of}} all fatigue failures locally occur at welded locations due to high tensile residual stresses and stress concentrations resulting from the weld process. High frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) treatment has been increasingly used as an effective post-weld treatment technique to improve fatigue strength of welded structures.

40|$|Highlights of Test Results: • Residual stress {{measurements}} by the RC method on cold-worked specimens showed tensile {{residual stresses}} in austenitic stainless steel. However, compressive residual stresses {{were observed in}} martensitic stainless steel. This difference {{may be attributed to}} the difference in metallurgical phases and microstructures resulting from different thermal treatments imparted to them. • Residual stress measurements by both ND and RC techniques on <b>welded</b> <b>specimens</b> showed similar patterns. <b>Welded</b> <b>specimens</b> consisting of similar material showed tensile residual stresses {{in the vicinity of the}} fusion line (FL). However, <b>welded</b> <b>specimens</b> consisting of dissimilar materials (austenitic and martensitic stainless steel on opposite side) showed a different pattern, in that residual stresses were compressive near the FL on the martensitic stainless steel side as opposed to tensile residual stresses on austenitic stainless steel side of the same specimen. • The measurements of residual stresses by the PAS technique revealed a reduction in Tparameter with the increased plastic deformation for both austenitic and martensitic stainless steels. A reduced T-parameter indicates enhanced residual stresses in either Alloy. Other Accomplishments: • One graduate student performed PAS measurements on <b>welded</b> <b>specimens</b> consisting of both similar and dissimilar materials at Idaho State University (ISU) during the summer of 2004.

A series of experimental techniques has been conducted to evaluate the corrosion and mechanical properties of the alloy. The corrosion media used was 3. 5 % (wt) NaCl. Polarization and open circuit potential tests were conducted by exposing various zones independently; therefore the reported corrosion results correspond to uncoupled condition. Different mechanical tests including tensile, torsion, and hardness were carried out; the same tests were also used for the un-welded specimens. The results show that the heat affected zone (HAZ) exhibited poor corrosion properties compared to the base metal (BM). The corrosion on both HAZ and BM was of pitting nature. More corrosion was observed on HAZ due to the thermal effects of the welding. Corrosion potential of HAZ was largely fluctuated comparing to BM with more negative peaks. The corrosion potential of the BM remained relatively steady over the whole immersion time. <b>Welded</b> <b>specimens</b> show lower mechanical properties comparing to non-welded specimens. The location of failure for <b>welded</b> and un-welded <b>specimens</b> after tensile test was found to be across the centre of the <b>specimens.</b> <b>Welded</b> tensile <b>specimens</b> have shown lower tensile strength. The location of the failure for <b>welded</b> <b>specimens</b> after torsion test was found predominantly along the HAZ which was attributed to the microstructural alteration that caused by the generation of heat during the welding process.

30|$|The {{knowledge}} about the heat effects of welding {{is the basis for}} an optimal design of components made of high-strength steels. In this context structural thermo-mechanical welding simulation is a tool that offers the detailed analyses of the evolution of the temperature field as well as the resulting thermo-mechanical response of the structure. Regarding a good description of engineering weld applications more and more complex models for welding simulation are necessary (Lindgren 2001). A bottle neck of welding simulation is the availability of temperature dependent material data (Lindgren 2001). Whereas the thermo-physical values like heat conductivity, density and specific heat do not differ much between alloys of a similar chemical composition. But the thermo-mechanical properties like stress–strain curves and transformation behavior are strongly dependent of the fabrication process of the steel. Regarding the transformation behavior the onset and finish temperature of solid state transformation will heavily influence the qualitative and quantitative evolution of residual stress for a <b>welded</b> <b>specimen</b> (Liu et al. 2008). Furthermore, the transformation induced plasticity (TRIP), a concomitant phenomenon of the solid state transformation, must be considered (Bhadeshia et al. 2007).|$|E

In the present study, dissimilar Aluminum alloy (AA 6262 -T 6 and AA 7075 -T 6) plates were FS welded by varying the weld parameters such as Tool rotational speed, weld speed and axial force with square tool pin profile. The mechanical properties (hardness and tensile strength) of the Dissimilar Friction Stir <b>welded</b> (DFS <b>welded)</b> <b>specimens</b> were tested and compared with the base materials. The observations have been elaborated in detail along with microstructures of parent and <b>welded</b> <b>specimens</b> through Optical Microscopy and {{it is observed that}} the weld parameters {{have a significant effect on}} mechanical and micro structural properties of the welds...|$|R
