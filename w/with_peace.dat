5|$|Georgia began proposing the {{placement}} of international peacekeeping forces in the separatist regions when Russia began to apply more pressure on Georgia after April 2008. The West launched new initiatives for peace settlement, <b>with</b> <b>peace</b> plans being offered and conferences being organised by the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Germany. Georgia accepted the German project for Abkhazia, but the separatists dismissed it. Russia and the separatists did not attend an EU-funded peace conference on Abkhazia. They also dismissed an OSCE offer to renew talks regarding South Ossetia.|$|E

Marth leads his army to an ancient temple where Gharnef holds the ceremony. After killing Gharnef, retrieving Falchion, and rescuing the clerics, Marth confronts Medeus, who has taken {{the form of an}} enormous dark dragon. Using the Falchion and Shield of Seals, Marth slays Medeus. <b>With</b> <b>peace</b> restored to the land, Marth and Caeda, now married, become the rulers of all Archanea.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan, Ivan and his cavalry approached Constantinople while Michael Shishman waited in Yambol with his army. The plot was uncovered by the spies of Andronikos III. Fearing for his own imperial ambitions, {{he wrote to his}} rival and grandfather not to accept the Bulgarians into the capital. While Ivan stuck to the plan and signed an oath that he had come <b>with</b> <b>peace</b> to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.|$|E
50|$|Israel has {{consistently}} thwarted Fatah-Hamas reconciliation. In 2009, for example, Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel {{would never make}} <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Hamas and ″cannot accept Hamas as a negotiating partner″. Following the April 2011 Cairo agreement, he ruled out a peace agreement, if Fatah and Hamas would reconcile. He said: ″The PA must choose either <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Israel or <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Hamas. There is no possibility for <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> both″ and ″How can you {{talk to us about}} peace when you're talking about <b>peace</b> <b>with</b> Hamas.

5|$|Egypt's {{commitment}} to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the Six-Day War of June 1967, after which Nasser found {{it increasingly difficult to}} maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen. The surprising removal of Sallal on November 5 by Yemeni dissidents, supported by republican tribesmen, resulted in an internal shift of power in the capital, while the royalists approached it from the north. The new republic government was headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman, all of which shortly either resigned or fled the country, leaving the disarrayed capital under the control of Prime Minister Hassan Amri. The 1967 siege of Sana'a became the turning point of the war. The remaining republican Prime Minister succeeded in keeping control of Sana'a and by February 1968, the royalists lifted the siege. Clashes continued in parallel <b>with</b> <b>peace</b> talks until 1970, when Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic, and a ceasefire came into effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1762, Boone, {{his wife}} and four {{children}} {{moved back to the}} Yadkin River Valley from Culpeper. By the mid-1760s, <b>with</b> <b>peace</b> made with the Cherokee, colonial immigration into the area increased. The competition of new settlers decreased the amount of game available. Boone had difficulty making ends meet; he was often taken to court for nonpayment of debts. He sold his land to pay off creditors. After his father's death in 1765, Boone traveled with his brother Squire and a group of men to Florida, which had become British territory {{after the end of the}} war, to look into the possibility of settling there. According to a family story, Boone purchased land near Pensacola, but Rebecca refused to move so far away from her friends and family. The Boones moved to a more remote area of the Yadkin River Valley, and Boone began to hunt westward into the Blue Ridge Mountains.|$|E
5|$|In June 1951, <b>with</b> <b>peace</b> talks {{underway}} in Panmunjom, the Ranger company was employed aggressively in offensive roles {{as a means}} to secure a better position for the UN at the bargaining table. After a number of operations north of the 38th parallel with the 7th Division, on 8 June the Rangers were moved to attack Hill 772, an operation crafted by Allen to win a strategically advantageous high ground position along the front line. That morning, the company, with support from 7th Division artillery, advanced on the hill, which was first blanketed with napalm strikes from U.S. Air Force P-51 Mustangs. Chinese forces resisted sporadically but withdrew {{at the end of the}} day having lost eight men killed and another thirty wounded. Against this the Rangers had lost only seven wounded. On 11 July, the Rangers continued the attack, backed by the 31st RCT who seized high ground near Sanying-ni and forced Chinese troops to retreat further. In this attack, one Ranger was killed and eight were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Justinian now had his pretext, and <b>with</b> <b>peace</b> {{restored}} on his eastern frontier with Sassanid Persia in 532, {{he started}} assembling an invasion force. According to Procopius (The Vandalic War, I.10), {{the news of}} Justinian's {{decision to go to}} war with the Vandals caused great consternation among the capital's elites, in whose minds the disaster of 468 was still fresh. The financial officials resented the expenditure involved, while the military was weary from the Persian war and feared the Vandals' sea-power. The emperor's scheme received support mostly from the Church, reinforced by the arrival of victims of renewed persecutions from Africa. Only the powerful minister John the Cappadocian dared to openly voice his opposition to the expedition, however, and Justinian disregarded it and pressed on with his preparations.|$|E

5|$|In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable {{communication}} {{that if the}} British were to pass the Rowlatt Act, he will appeal Indians to start civil disobedience. The British government ignored him, passed the law stating it will not yield to threats. The satyagraha civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in satyagraha in Delhi. People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, he asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but express their frustration <b>with</b> <b>peace,</b> to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they own. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side uses violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him to not enter Delhi. Gandhi defied the order. On 9 April, Gandhi was arrested. People rioted. On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and a British officer named Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered his troops to fire on them. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent, but was cheered by some Britons {{and parts of the}} British media as an appropriate response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using love to deal with the hate of the British government. Gandhi demanded that people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.|$|E

5|$|When Henry V died in 1422, Northumberland was {{appointed}} {{member of the}} council appointed to govern during the minority of Henry VI. He might {{have been involved in}} an embassy to the Council of Siena in 1423, but still his main area of responsibility lay in the border region. In the council, he seems to have belonged to the circle around Bishop Henry Beaufort, and he followed Beaufortnow cardinalto peace negotiations at Berwick in 1429. As Warden of the East March, he was constantly occupied <b>with</b> <b>peace</b> negotiations and defence of northern England, but his efforts were constantly frustrated, and in 1434 he resigned his commission. The next year, Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, equally exasperated by the lack of royal support, gave up his commission as Warden of the West March. Northumberland {{was appointed}} joint warden with the earl of Huntingdon of both marches for one year, during which time, although suffering defeat by the Earl of Angus at the Battle of Piperdean, he was able to repel a siege on Roxburgh by James I of Scotland. In 1440 he was once more appointed Warden of the West March, and this time held the position until his death.|$|E

His solicitor, William Clegg, tried to prove that Mrs. Dyson had been on more intimate terms <b>with</b> <b>Peace</b> than {{she was ready to}} admit, and that Dyson had been the aggressor in a struggle in which Peace had reacted in self-defence. A number of pencilled notes had been found near the scene, which appeared to have been written by Mrs. Dyson, indicating a close relationship <b>with</b> <b>Peace,</b> though she denied having written them. (At the Coroner's inquest after the murder, she said her husband had seen them and declared them to be forgeries, possibly by Peace himself.)
