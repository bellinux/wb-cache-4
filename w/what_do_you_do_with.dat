The third season finale, he explained, ended with the two universes healing themselves {{with the help of}} a [...] "bridge". He remarked, [...] "What happens if that bridge now begins to be used as a conduit for evil? That’s the issue we’re facing. What do you do? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> this wonderful discovery? Do you keep it? What do you lose if you lose it? For example, if we didn’t have that , we... wouldn’t have all these wonderful characters that we’ve grown to love. What would happen? I think we have to face that issue. We have to face the issue of 'How long can you keep this alive, this link between interlacing the two universes?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Who is {{homosexual}}? My {{answer is}} that a homosexual is somebody who is abnormal because the normal person was created to be attracted to the opposite sex ... to procreate and perpetuate the human race. ... y bishop of North Ankole, Rt. Rev. Muhanguzi ... asked the following question: ... How can God contradict himself by saying in the Book of Genesis that Adam {{should be given a}} wife, Eve, and then also create homosexuals? ... However, now that I have been forced to concentrate my mind on this issue by the actions {{of a small group of}} our MPs led by the Rt. Hon. Kadaga, I can see the fallacy of Bishop Muhanguzi's position. ... Do Albinos create themselves? No. Simply, nature goes wrong in a minority of cases. ... The question at the core of the debate of the homosexuals is: [...] "What do we do with an abnormal person? Do we kill him/her? Do we imprison him/her? Or do we contain him/her?" ... Apart from the people who are born abnormal, it seems there is a larger group of those that become homosexual for mercenary reasons - they get recruited on account of financial inducements. ... How about the women lesbians? Apart from the ones who are born abnormal and the ones that may become lesbian for mercenary reasons, there may be those that go into that practice because of sexual starvation when they fail to get married. Women are normally more [...] than men.... In the past, this imbalance could have been addressed by polygamy. ... The groups that can be rescued ... are those who are homosexual or lesbian for mercenary reasons or on account of ... failure to get legal partners. The rescue for these mercenary deviants is, first and foremost, economic - rapidly industrialize Uganda, modernize agriculture, etc. ... In addition ... we should legislate harshly against those people with money, from within and without, who take advantange of the desperation of our youth to lure them into these abnormal and deviant behaviors. I would support a life sentence.... On this one I would agree with the Bill passed by Parliament. The unanswered question, however, is: <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the really abnormal people? ... Only the other day, I saw on television that Dr. Allan Turing, the genius mathematician that cracked the German Enigma code for the anti-Hitler alliance ... was a homosexual. This man ... enabled them to win the war. Yet, the British chemically castrated him in 1952, where-upon he committed suicide, apparently. Were the British correct in handling that issue like that? The British no longer think so. Only the other day, the Queen had to apologize to this ... person ... much more useful to society than the millions of sexually normal people. ... he challenge is how to correctly handle the sexually abnormal on the one hand and those who use money or any other influence to recruit sexually normal people into this abnormal and disgusting behaviour. When we meet in the NRM caucus, we shall, I am sure, find a scientifically correct position.|$|E

I have large sums lodged in various safe investments, and employ an agent to collect my rents and settle with my tenants." [...] And so I am forced to exclaim, [...] "What! you who are persuaded that usury, and theft, and adultery, are all of equal blackness, if you find that one sin is unavoidable, what about the other two? Would you then invite the robber and the licentious to sin with impunity, as you practise your own convenient iniquity, with the applause of the world and your own acquiescence?" ...|$|E
