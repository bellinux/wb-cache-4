500|$|Bell and Zbyszewski worked {{together}} on the characters' storyline for the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., preparing them to move over to the spin-off, with Bell explaining that it would set up Most Wanted by defining exactly who the characters are, such as Hunter and his lack of loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. and to ideologies—"nothing specific about the show, it's just who Hunter is." [...] In March 2016, Bell stated that while Hunter and Morse are [...] "on S.H.I.E.L.D., <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of who they are, and give the audience as much of their relationship with one another, and with other people, as possible. We are aware {{that there is a}} potential imminent end, and so they won't be neglected." ...|$|E
500|$|However, a {{pilot for}} the spinoff was ordered in August 2015, with the series titled Marvel's Most Wanted. Bell and fellow Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. {{executive}} producer Paul Zbyszewski developed the series, {{while working on}} Hunter and Morse's storyline for season three, preparing them to move over to the spin-off.

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by French duo Jonas & François in London, England. It featured choreography by Jamie King, who worked on Madonna's Confessions, Re-Invention and Drowned World tours {{as well as her}} video for the single [...] "Sorry" [...] (2006). Japanese hip hop dancing duo Hamutsun Serve also made an appearance in the video. Before its release, Rolling Stone said that in the video Madonna and Timberlake act as if they were [...] "superheroes" [...] while they evade multiple obstacles. In the video, Madonna wore a cream colored corset, glistening black boots and styled her hair in platinum blond waves while Timberlake wore mainly denims and a scarf around his neck. Regarding the idea behind the music video, Madonna said that [...] "it was conceptualistic". She explained that the video was shot like a march past; [...] "It's a movement, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> everybody with us." [...] About the idea of a black screen devouring everything, Madonna said, ...|$|E

5000|$|Gentling {{said of the}} experience, [...] "We knew <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a {{long time}} on this album. <b>We</b> {{specifically}} <b>wanted</b> not <b>to</b> do tracks {{over and over and}} over again, but more to work on tone and get all of our instruments down right. We took over a day (just) to get the drums sounding right." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rygg commented in an {{interview}} with Modern Fix, “A Quick Fix of Melancholy was our way of trying to get back into writing songs—or something resembling songs—and also find out where <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> things. I think after all our work with film, which is very kind of aesthetically fixed, you know. We ended up making Blood Inside.” ...|$|R
500|$|On April 25, 2007, the duo {{announced}} that they would embark {{on a tour of}} Canada performing in all 10 provinces, plus Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories. In the words of Jack: [...] "Having never done a tour of Canada, Meg and I thought it was high time to go whole hog. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> this tour to {{the far reaches of the}} Canadian landscape. From the ocean to the permafrost. The best way for us to do that is ensure that we perform in every province and territory in the country, from the Yukon to Prince Edward Island. Another special moment of this tour is the show which will occur in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia on July 14, The White Stripes' Tenth Anniversary." [...] Canadian fiddler Ashley MacIsaac opened for the band at the Glace Bay show; earlier in 2007, MacIsaac and Jack had discovered that they were distantly related. It was also at this time that White learned he was related to Canadian fiddle player Natalie MacMaster.|$|E

5000|$|Already as Art Lord & the Self-Portraits, {{the band}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> change their image and <b>took</b> this {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> do so. William Cashion stated: [...] "Me and Gerrit {{had been talking}} for a while about how <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{get rid of the}} gimmick. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be <b>taken</b> seriously. Our songs had outgrown the gimmick that the band was made on. The songs were starting to deal with bigger, personal, universal themes. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be <b>taken</b> seriously." ...|$|R

Our love for Japanese anime, Hong Kong action and kung fu cinema, yoga, and Eastern philosophies led us to the initial inspiration for Avatar: The Last Airbender." ...|$|R
2500|$|Facing {{increased}} {{political pressure}} to reach a settlement, President Zardari signed the regulation into law on April 13, 2009 after a National Assembly resolution approved of the measure. [...] Although the Constitution of Pakistan allowed the president to enact laws for the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas without the approval of Parliament, Zardari used the non-binding resolution for moral support. [...] Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani stated, [...] "We want consensus of the whole nation. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the house into confidence. We don't want to bypass the parliament." [...] The resolution was supported by Zardari's Pakistan Peoples Party, the Awami National Party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N, the Pakistan Muslim League-Q, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam and generally pro-government Fata officials. The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) opposed the motion but abstained from the vote.|$|E
2500|$|Another strong {{theme from}} {{the album is}} peer pressure, {{particularly}} due to the band's part-Christian-part-mainstream status. The song [...] "Gravity" [...] refers to the opposing influences of Heaven and the secular world pulling the band in opposite directions, whilst [...] "Metamorphis" [...] further explores [...] "the fact that out in the world, although {{everybody wants to be}} their own selves, we're pulled this way and that. Everyone you meet wants you to be something or another. The song asks God to help us to be our own true selves, as God sees us, not the way folk pressure us to be what they want us to be." [...] "Bliss" [...] deals with accusations of selling out; in the words of Stu G, [...] "we know exactly where we want to go, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> our music to the world and have it recognized as being as good as anything that's out there. But we're not going to compromise or back away from our integrity as Christians." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1891 to 1900, Everhard {{served as}} {{president}} of the Ohio Suffrage Association. In 1894, she led the successful effort to secure school suffrage for Ohio women. She also gained for Ohio women the right to vote in municipal elections. She was among the suffrage activists who spoke at a hearing of the House judiciary committee in Washington D. C. in 1896, led by Susan B. Anthony. Everhard's remarks gave her reasons for activism:You probably wonder, even if you have not asked, why we are not at home looking after our families instead of coming to Washington to pester you. It is just because <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> better care of our homes that we have come. I for one pay enough in taxes every year to buy a farm and yet I have no right to say how they shall be collected or how expended. It is a mistake to say that women do not want the ballot, for in Ohio, where we have been given school suffrage, interest has grown rapidly, and now women who at first did not even want school suffrage have been educated into being full-fledged suffragists." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Republicans in the Minnesota House {{dismissed}} {{the idea of}} speech being an ethics violation, maintaining “Lindner's comments were offensive, but Lindner {{has the right to}} say them.” Republican House Speaker Steve Sviggum pointed out that [...] "House Republicans didn't complain when Rep. Tom Rukavina, DFL-Virginia, called State Auditor Pat Awada, 'Osama Bin Awada'" [...] when Awada proposed to curb local government aid. Sviggum said [...] "everyone is entitled to First Amendment rights. 'At some point or another people have freedom of speech even though that speech may not be appropriate, politically correct or even the most wise speech.'" [...] Sviggum said [...] "I don't think that <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> this to the ultimate end and put that chilling effect upon speech, upon feeling, upon values and principals that one has or doesn't have in this entire process." [...] Lindner also invoked freedom of speech, saying [...] "I still believe in the First Amendment -- that we're allowed to express our views and so forth -- and it's getting close to maybe not being able to do that, but while we can, I'm doing it." [...] In their rebuttal the House Republicans also played a recording of Ellison’s interview with a radio station. In the interview Ellison had said “People should feel free to express themselves as long as they don’t violate the law. ...I would never invoke the powers of the state to restrict Arlon Lindner from expressing himself.” ...|$|E
