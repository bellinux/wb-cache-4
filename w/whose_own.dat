5|$|The reentry {{phenomenology}} was {{of interest}} {{both to the}} Army, as it might allow long-range decluttering to be carried out, and to the Air Force, <b>whose</b> <b>own</b> ICBMs might be at risk of long-range interception if the Soviets exploited a similar concept.

5|$|Apart from Pringle, {{who played}} in the First and Second Tests, none of the six new {{selections}} had played in the series so far, but the match followed the old pattern, as the England batting again failed twice against the hostile West Indies pace attack, only Lamb and Smith in the first innings and Gooch in the second offering much resistance.

Curtly Ambrose secured his first man-of-the-match award for taking seven wickets {{at a cost of}} 98 runs - despite being hampered early on in the match, when a blocked drain resulted in the bowler's run-up area being waterlogged and in some places flooded with overflow rainwater, Ambrose being hapless bowler who was forced to bring the situation {{to the attention of the}} umpires so that play could be suspended and the playing area dried out.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{cooperation}} between the Mongols and their Christian subjects in Antioch, other Christians in the Levant regarded the Mongol approach with unease.

In Sidon, Julian Grenier, Lord of Sidon and Beaufort, described by his contemporaries as irresponsible and light-headed, took an opportunity to raid and plunder the area of the Beqaa Valley in Mongol territory.
