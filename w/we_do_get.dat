The book closes with Hazel stating that she is happy with her choice.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{gave the}} episode a [...] "Good" [...] rating of 7.8 out of 10 and {{summarized}} the episode as being [...] "a much more focused story than 'Because You Left' {{but in the}} shadow of the season premiere's revelations and grandeur it is ultimately the weaker of the two. The comedic moments that string together Hurley's journey only go so far and the rest feels a bit too much like filler... If the conclusion of 'The Lie' is any indication though, the outside world may prove to be just as strange as the island." [...] IGN later ranked [...] "The Lie" [...] 84th out of the 115 Lost episodes, writing [...] "this isn't a terrible episode, but it feels like a bit of a stop-gap, in the midst of a very cool run of episodes. On the Island, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> to see a pretty cool looking Flaming Arrow attack, that kills the uber-annoying Frogurt, but the encounter the group has at the end with some men dressed as soldiers is just set up for the awesome [...] "Jughead." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reuben Wu {{said about}} the process of making a new Ladytron album: [...] "We start writing individually. We've never really lived in the same city before. We've always been {{geographically}} apart. [...] It's always been first as individuals, and then reviewing everything together, and then working on each other's songs. That's how we've always worked. And it goes well with how we make music. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> together down the line and in the studio when we start fleshing out the tracks".|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect of}} Myrick's {{statement}} on Little Crow {{and his band}} was clear however.

Galbrait [...] we made a treaty with the Government a big for what little <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> and then cant get it till our children was dieing with hunger – it is with the traders that commence Mr A J Myrick told the Indians that they would eat grass or their own dung." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nathan Lee of The Village Voice {{said the}} film [...] "works despite feeling both over-familiar and over-ambitious. It crescendos with a {{legitimate}} {{sense of wonder}} (if not profundity) {{thanks in large part}} to the luminous and uncanny score by electro legends Underworld." [...] Writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis viewed director Boyle as a [...] "first-rate, seemingly sweat-free entertainer" [...] who always [...] "sells the goods smoothly, along with the chills, the laughs and, somewhat less often, the tears." [...] She went on to say, [...] "He's wickedly good at making you jump and squirm in your seat, which he does often in [...] "Sunshine," [...] but he tends to avoid tapping into deep wells of emotion." [...] Wesley Morris in The Boston Globe mused that if the film didn't [...] "float your boat as a work of science-fiction, action, philosophy, heliocentrism, or staggering visual spectacle (although, it really should), then it certainly succeeds as a parable for cinematic ambition." [...] He emphatically added, [...] "The surface of this movie is plenty enthralling on its own." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post commented that for the film, [...] "The voyage works, beautifully. While we don't get the ticklish conceit of Scottish profanities in the celestial outer realm, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> something surprisingly consoling: a deep sense of the humanity that we always carry with us, no matter how far we venture from home." ...|$|E
