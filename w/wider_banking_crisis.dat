In the early 1980s the bank {{expanded}} its activities outside the bullion business and started making high-risk loans. Bank assets more than doubled between 1980 and 1984, and loans became concentrated to a few borrowers, including Mahmoud Sipra and his El Saeed group, Rajendra Sethia and ESAL Commodities, and Abdul Shamji. The quality {{of some of these}} loans turned out to be worse than expected, such as the £21 million lent to Abdul Shamji of Gomba Holdings (the then owner of Puddle Dock and the Mermaid Theatre in London). The size of the loans grew to exceed the level of the bank's capital. (Shamji was sentenced to 15 months in prison for lying about his assets during a High Court inquiry into the bank's collapse.) Because JMB was one of five members of the London Gold Fixing, Bank of England officials were worried that if it became insolvent confidence in the other bullion banks would be undermined, and panic could spread {{to the rest of the}} British banking system. To prevent a <b>wider</b> <b>banking</b> <b>crisis</b> the Bank of England organized a rescue package on the evening of 30 September 1984, purchasing JMB for £1.

50|$|The {{introduction}} {{takes the}} story in the prologue two weeks forward to 8 October, the day when the bank recapitalisation plan was announced. Brown describes how the crises evolved to become much <b>wider</b> than a <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> - it became what he calls the first crises of globalisation, which if not overcome will threaten a decade or more of low growth, with millions left jobless and millions more in poverty. Brown recalls that {{in the last years of}} the 20th century, Europe and America had between them a majority share of the world's production, exports and investment. While after 2000 Europe and American had a minority share in all those areas, while still retaining a large majority of the world's consumption, financed by borrowing from the rest of the world. Brown states that this recently developed situation has become unsustainable. He says it's essential for emerging economic giants like China to further boost their consumption if global growth is to be optimised and the crises is to be fully overcome. The introduction also discusses the need for morality to inform the conduct of market participants.|$|R

40|$|While {{financial}} liberalisation {{is considered}} to be good for economic growth in that it promotes the development of the financial sector, <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> on the other hand tend to be inimical for economic growth.

40|$|Many {{empirical}} studies of <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> have employed "banking crisis" (BC) indicators constructedusing primarily information on government actions undertaken {{in response to}} bank distress. Weformulate a simple theoretical model of a banking industry which we use to identify and constructtheory-based measures of systemic bank shocks (SBS). Using both country-level and firm-level samples, we show that SBS indicators consistently predict BC indicators based on four major BCseries that {{have appeared in the}} literature. Therefore, BC indicatorsactually measure lagged government responses to systemic bank shocks, rather than the occurrence of crises per se. We re-examine the separate impact of macroeconomic factors, bank market structure, deposit insurance, andexternal shocks on the probability of a systemic bank shocks and on the probability of governmentresponses to bank distress. The impact of these variables on the likelihood of a government responseto bank distress is totally different from that on the likelihood of a systemic bank shock. Disentangling the effects of systemic bank shocks and government responses turns out to be crucial inunderstanding the roots of bank fragility.

Public finance rigidities limited the government''s capacity to correct existing imbalances and the deteriorating fiscal stance associated with the costs of the financial crisis.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an empirical analysis of aggregate banking system ratios during systemic <b>banking</b> <b>crises.</b> Drawing upon a wide cross-country dataset, we utilize parametric and nonparametric tests {{to assess the}} power of these ratios to discriminate between sound and unsound banking systems. We also estimate a duration model to investigate whether the ratios help determine the timing of a <b>banking</b> <b>crisis.</b> Despite some weaknesses in the available data, our findings offer initial evidence that some indicators are precursors for the likelihood and timing of systemic banking problems. Nevertheless, we caution against sole reliance on these indicators and advocate supplementing them with other tools and techniques.

We argue that household credit growth raises debt levels without much effect on long-term income. Rapid household credit expansions generate vulnerabilities that can precipitate a <b>banking</b> <b>crisis.</b> Enterprise credit expansions can have the same effects but it is tempered by the associated increase in income. Our estimates show that household credit expansions have been a statistically and economically significant predictor of <b>banking</b> <b>crises.</b> Enterprise credit expansions are also associated with <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> but their effect is weaker and less robust. <b>Banking</b> <b>crisis</b> Household and business credit growth...|$|R
40|$|When a country''s {{banking system}} becomes more {{linked to the}} global banking network, does that system get more or less prone to a <b>banking</b> <b>crisis?</b> Using model {{simulations}} and econometric estimates based on a world-wide dataset, we find an M-shaped relationship between financial stability of a country''s banking sector and its interconnectedness. In particular, for banking sectors that are not very connected to the global banking network, increases in interconnectedness {{are associated with a}} reduced probability of a <b>banking</b> <b>crisis.</b> Once interconnectedness reaches a certain value, further increases in interconnectedness can increase the probability of a <b>banking</b> <b>crisis.</b> Our findings suggest that it may be beneficial for policies to support greater interlinkages for less connected banking systems, but after a certain point the advantages of increased interconnectedness become less clear.

40|$|Purpose: The {{recurrence}} of <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> throughout the 1980 s and 1990 s, {{and in the}} more recent 2008 - 09 global financial crisis, {{has led to an}} expanding empirical literature on crisis explanation and prediction. This paper provides an analytical review of proxies for and important determinants of <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> −credit growth, financial liberalization, bank regulation and supervision. Design/methodology/approach: The study surveys the <b>banking</b> <b>crisis</b> literature by comparing proxies for and measures of <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> and policy-related variables in the literature. Advantages and disadvantages of different proxies are discussed. Findings: Disagreements about determinants of <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> are in part explained by the difference in the chosen proxies used in empirical models. The usefulness of different proxies depend partly on constraints in terms of time and country coverage but also on what particular policy question is asked. Originality: The study offers a comprehensive analysis of measurements of <b>banking</b> <b>crises,</b> credit growth, financial liberalization and banking regulations and concludes with an assessment of existing proxies and databases. Since the review points to the choice of proxies that best fit specific research objectives, it should serve as a reference point for empirical researchers in the <b>banking</b> <b>crisis</b> area...|$|R
40|$|A common {{legacy of}} <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> {{is a large}} {{increase}} in government debt, as fiscal resources are used {{to shore up the}} <b>banking</b> system. Do <b>crisis</b> response strategies that commit more fiscal resources lower the economic costs of crises? Based on evidence from a sample of 40 <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> we find that the answer is negative. In fact, policies that are riskier for the government budget are associated with worse, not better, post-crisis performance. We also show that parliamentary political systems are more prone to adopt bank rescue measures that are costly for the government budget. We take advantage of this relationship to instrument the policy response, thereby addressing concerns of joint endogeneity. We find no evidence that endogeneity is a source of bias.

40|$|Weak {{economic}} growth is a contributing factor behind many <b>banking</b> <b>crises.</b> In this paper, we test whether <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> cause long-term institutional change aimed at improving macroeconomic performance and thus indirectly {{reduce the risk of}} future crises. Our dataset consists of 22 developed and 34 developing countries covering the period from 1985 to 2009. The results show that <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> cause institutional change if GDP growth is below potential growth during the crisis. Approximately 40 % of the change in institutional quality during the considered period occurred after a <b>banking</b> <b>crisis.</b> These results hold for both developed and developing countries...|$|R

We then consider whether leading indicators can help predict <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> and recessions and if these variables can explain the previously observed interdependence. Inclusion of exogenous variables means that the observed interdependence between <b>banking</b> <b>crises</b> and recessions disappears - indicating that the observed interdependence is a result of easily observable common causes rather than unobserved links...|$|R
