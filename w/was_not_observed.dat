5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> before World War II, {{but with}} the availability of supplemental oxygen in the decade following, it rapidly {{became one of the}} principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries. By 1960 the use of oxygen had become identified as a risk factor and its administration restricted. The resulting fall in retinopathy of prematurity was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and hypoxia-related complications. Since then, more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between hypoxic conditions and problems of retinopathy of prematurity.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Florence {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved through the Lesser Antilles into the eastern Caribbean on September21. The wave tracked generally westward, and spawned a tropical storm on September23 about 100mi (160km) southeast of Jamaica. Given the name Florence, the storm steadily intensified after developing, although a well-defined circulation <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> until September24. That day, Florence attained hurricane status in the Yucatán Channel between the Yucatán Peninsula and the western tip of Cuba.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} {{generally}} resident across its range, but sightings of solitary and silent birds {{have suggested that}} the species may be migratory in Bolivia and Brazil. A study published in 2005 suggested it was migratory in Santa Fe, Argentina, as the species <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> in the area between March and September (the austral winter). In 2006 the species was reported {{for the first time in}} Peru, but it was unclear if this represented a vagrant escaping cold weather or a migrant, as the species is mostly uncommon across its range and that area is poorly studied ornithologically.|$|E
5|$|Both {{women are}} {{reported}} to have had many paranormal experiences before and after their adventure. In one of them, Moberly claimed to {{have seen in the}} Louvre in 1914 an apparition of the Roman emperor Constantine, a man of unusual height wearing a gold crown and a toga; he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> by anybody else. During the First World War, Jourdain, the dominant personality of the pair who had succeeded as Principal of St. Hugh's, became convinced that a German spy was hiding in the college. After developing increasingly autocratic behaviour, she died suddenly in 1924 {{in the middle of an}} academic scandal over her leadership of the college, her conduct having provoked mass resignations of academic staff. Moberly died in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Due to a weak mid-level {{anticyclone}} {{over the}} Gulf of Mexico that <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> operationally, Mitch began a slow southerly motion on October27, passing very near Guanaja. The NHC had anticipated {{the movement to}} be part of a small loop in the Gulf of Honduras, although the agency noted continued uncertainty. Steadily deteriorating, Mitch weakened below major hurricane intensity late on October28, due to land interaction, upwelling, and possibly an eyewall replacement cycle. On October29, the hurricane made landfall in Honduras, east of La Ceiba, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Despite being over land, the NHC continued to predict a turn to the north, which would allow for restrengthening.|$|E

5|$|In 1986 Voyager 2 {{detected}} {{a broad and}} faint sheet of material inward of ring 6. This ring was given the temporary designation 1986U2R. It had a normal optical depth of 10−3 or less and was extremely faint. It was visible only in a single Voyager 2 image. The ring was located between 37,000 and 39,500km from the centre of Uranus, or only about 12,000km above the clouds. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> again until 2003–2004, when the Keck telescope found a broad and faint sheet of material just inside ring 6. This ring was dubbed the ζ ring. However, {{the position of the}} recovered ζ ring differs significantly from that observed in 1986. Now it is situated between 37,850 and 41,350km from the centre of the planet. There is an inward gradually fading extension reaching to at least 32,600km, or possibly even to 27,000km—to the atmosphere of Uranus. These extensions are labelled as the ζc and ζcc rings respectively.|$|E
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E
5|$|At peak intensity, Mitch {{maintained}} maximum sustained {{winds of}} 180mph (285km/h) while off the northern coast of Honduras. Hurricane Hunters reported a minimum barometric pressure of , {{which at the}} time was the lowest in the month of October and tied for the fourth lowest for any Atlantic hurricane. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north, threatening the Yucatán Peninsula. Instead, Mitch turned to the south due to a ridge that <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> while the storm was active. Land interaction imparted weakening, and the hurricane made landfall on Honduras on October29 with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Turning westward, Mitch slowly weakened over land and maintained deep convection over adjacent waters. After moving across mountainous terrain in Central America, the surface circulation of Mitch dissipated on November1. The next day, the remnants reached the Gulf of Mexico and reorganized into a tropical storm on November3. Mitch accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front, moving across the Yucatán Peninsula before striking southwestern Florida on November5. Shortly thereafter, the storm became an extratropical cyclone, which was tracked by the NHC until November9.|$|E

5|$|The {{locomotives}} received transformers in 1947, {{which were}} installed in Oslo, and 2064 was delivered on 24 May. The {{cost of the}} three locomotives was 1,297,905 million Norwegian krone. At first, only one unit was transferred to Flåm. The other two remained in Eastern Norway; one was stationed as a shunter at Oslo West Station, the other in Skien. The units operating in Oslo and Skien had problems with the rheostatic brake operating differently depending on the direction the train was running, something which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>observed</b> in Flåm. The issue was fixed by marginally changing the excitation voltage. The unit stationed in Flåm was periodically sent for service in Oslo, and when this happened, a new unit would be stationed in Flåm. From 21 January 1949, 2064 was returned to Flåm without the other unit being sent back. From 17 February 1955, all three were stationed in Flåm. During the late 1950s, one of the units was stationed as Voss Station for shunting duty. Starting in the late 1950s, the class was also used on the Hardanger Line.|$|E
