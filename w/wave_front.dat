Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development, but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into living longer life cycles that can then produce severe weather. The thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed with height are dependent on horizontal temperature differences, and explains {{the existence of the}} jet stream.|$|E

If the transverse coherence length in the vertical direction is higher than in horizontal, the laser beam divergence will be lower in the vertical direction than in the horizontal.|$|E

The mechanisms by which these reentrant <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> terminate are unknown. We per-formed computerized mapping studies in six open-chest dogs before and after right ventricular subendocardial ablation with Lugol's solution.

Somatically, they form a morphologically similar mycelial <b>wave</b> <b>front</b> that continues to grow and explore.

The speed of sound decreases with decreasing temperature, so this also creates a negative sound speed gradient. The sound <b>wave</b> <b>front</b> travels faster near the ground, so the sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at {{some distance from the}} source. The radius of curvature of the sound path is inversely proportional to the velocity gradient.|$|E

Notice that the exponential asymptotic behavior of traveling <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> for kinds of equations with quasimonotone conditions is widely investigated (see [2, 11, 35, 39, 41]). For a nonquasimonotone equation, Pan [28] obtained the exponential asymptotic behavior at negative infinity of traveling <b>wave</b> <b>fronts.</b> However, for nonquasimonotone systems, the exponential asymptotic behavior of traveling <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> is still open.

By using exponential order, upper–lower solutions and Schauder's fixed point theorem, we reduce the existence of monotone traveling <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> to the existence of upper–lower solutions without the requirement of monotonicity. To illustrate our results, we establish the existence of traveling <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> for two examples which are the delayed non-local diffusion version of the Nicholson's blowflies equation and the Belousov–Zhabotinskii model. These results imply that the traveling <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> of the delayed non-local diffusion systems without quasimonotonicity are persistent if the delay is small...|$|R

Prior to wave reflection, {{they both}} {{are characterized by}} a steep <b>wave</b> <b>front</b> followed by a nearly exponential decay at close distances. They have similarities in how they cause neural effects in the brain. In tissue, both types of pressure waves have similar magnitudes, duration, and frequency characteristics.

25|$|In {{a slab of}} {{conventional}} material with an ordinary refractive index – a right-handed material (RHM) – the <b>wave</b> <b>front</b> is transmitted away from the source. In a NIM the wavefront travels toward the source. However, the magnitude {{and direction of the}} flow of energy essentially remains the same in both the ordinary material and the NIM. Since the flow of energy remains the same in both materials (media), the impedance of the NIM matches the RHM. Hence, the sign of the intrinsic impedance is still positive in a NIM.|$|E
25|$|The way {{in which}} the beam profile of a laser beam changes as it propagates is {{determined}} by diffraction. When the entire emitted beam has a planar, spatially coherent <b>wave</b> <b>front,</b> it approximates Gaussian beam profile and has the lowest divergence for a given diameter. The smaller the output beam, the quicker it diverges. It is possible to reduce the divergence of a laser beam by first expanding it with one convex lens, and then collimating it with a second convex lens whose focal point is coincident with that of the first lens. The resulting beam has a larger diameter, and hence a lower divergence.|$|E

40|$|In this {{investigation}} a characteristic analysis of stress wave propagation in anisotropic fluid-saturated porous media is performed based on generalized characteristic theory. This method {{enables us to}} carry out a complete basic analysis of wave propagation characteristic in fluid-saturated porous media, and immediately determine the <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> through the normal velocity surfaces. First, the characteristic differential equations and compatibility relations along bicharacteri sties are deduced. Then the analytical expressions for the normal velocity surfaces and <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> are presented. Based on these equations, the characteristic of the normal velocity surfaces and the <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> for all components of the stress waves in an orthotropic fluid-saturated porous media as well as its special cases in three-dimensional space is computed and discussed. The results show that the <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> of fast and slow waves remain regular along with the increase of anisotropy of the media, but great anisotropy may lead to more than one triple angle on the <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> of quasi-transverse or transverse waves.

25|$|A basic {{principle}} of Huygens {{is that the}} speed of light is finite, a point which had been the subject of an experimental demonstration by Olaus Roemer (1679 at the Paris Observatory), but which Huygens is presumed to have believed already. The theory is kinematic and its scope largely restricted to geometric optics. It covers little of what would now be termed physical optics. It deals with wave fronts and their normal rays, with propagation conceived by means of spherical waves emitted along the <b>wave</b> <b>front</b> (see also Huygens–Fresnel principle). It was justified as an ether theory, involving transmission via perfectly elastic particles, a revision of the view of Descartes. The nature of light was therefore a longitudinal wave.|$|E
25|$|Huygens had experimented in 1672 {{with double}} {{refraction}} (birefringence) in Icelandic spar (calcite), a phenomenon discovered in 1669 by Rasmus Bartholin. At first {{he could not}} elucidate what he found. He later explained it with his <b>wave</b> <b>front</b> theory and concept of evolutes. He also developed ideas on caustics. Newton in his Opticks of 1704 proposed instead a corpuscular theory of light. The theory of Huygens was not accepted, by some, because longitudinal waves cannot show birefringence. The interference experiments of Thomas Young vindicated a wave theory in 1801: the results could not be explained with light particles. The {{solution to the problem}} Huygens had faced was then resolved by a transverse wave theory. For a view from modern physics see wave–particle duality.|$|E
25|$|A {{tidal bore}} is a {{hydraulic}} jump which {{occurs when the}} incoming tide forms a wave (or waves) of water that travel up a river or narrow bay against {{the direction of the}} current. As is true for hydraulic jumps in general, bores take on various forms depending upon the difference in the waterlevel upstream and down, ranging from an undular wavefront to a shock-wave-like wall of water. Figure 3 shows a tidal bore with the characteristics common to shallow upstream water – a large elevation difference is observed. Figure 4 shows a tidal bore with the characteristics common to deep upstream water – a small elevation difference is observed and the wavefront undulates. In both cases the tidal wave moves at the speed characteristic of waves in water of the depth found immediately behind the <b>wave</b> <b>front.</b> A key feature of tidal bores and positive surges is the intense turbulent mixing induced by the passage of the bore front and by the following wave motion.|$|E

500|$|A tsunami is {{an unusual}} form of wave caused by a sudden and {{powerful}} event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide, a meteorite impact, a volcanic eruption, or a collapse of land into the sea. These events can temporarily lift or lower {{the surface of the}} sea in the affected area, usually by a few feet. The potential energy of the displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy, creating a shallow wave radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to the square root of the depth of the water. Tsunamis, therefore, travel much faster in the open ocean than on a continental shelf. Despite traveling at speeds of over , tsunamis in deep seas have wavelengths from [...] and an amplitude of less than three feet. Standard surface waves in the same region may only have wavelengths of a few hundred feet and speeds up to [...] but, when compared to their possible amplitudes of up to , tsunamis at this stage are often able to pass unnoticed. Tsunami warning systems rely on the fact that seismic waves caused by earthquakes travel around the world at around [...] per hour, allowing threatened regions to be alerted to the possibility of a tsunami. Measurements from a network of sea-level measuring stations make it possible to confirm or cancel a tsunami warning. A trigger event on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean. The energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually but is spread out over the <b>wave</b> <b>front.</b> As the wave radiates away from the source, the front gets longer and the average energy reduces, so distant shores will generally be hit by weaker waves. However, as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth, it does not travel at the same speed in all directions and this affects the direction of the <b>wave</b> <b>front.</b> This effect, known as refraction, can focus the strength of an advancing tsunami on some areas while weakening it in others, according to the undersea topography along its path.|$|E

Our approach is to use monotone iterations and a nonstandard ordering for the set of profiles of the corresponding wave system. New iterative techniques are established for a class of integral operators when the reaction term satisfies different monotonicity conditions. Following this, the existence of travelling <b>wave</b> <b>fronts</b> for reaction–diffusion systems with spatio-temporal delays is established.
