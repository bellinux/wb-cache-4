5|$|In the <b>weeks</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the Independence Bowl, {{the game}} {{received}} {{as much or}} more coverage than the incipient national championship game due to the controversial status of Tech star Bruce Smith, who was embroiled in a legal battle with the NCAA about his participation in the game. Spread bettors favored Air Force to win the game by four points. Ticket sales were slow in the <b>weeks</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the bowl, and Virginia Tech was faulted for failing to sell its entire allotment of 12,000 tickets. Tech representatives said they might have to return as many as 8,000 tickets due to the difficulty of selling tickets for a game more than 20 hours away by car.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>weeks</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the game, media {{coverage}} of the game focused on Auburn's exclusion from the national championship game, a controversial point for Auburn fans and other observers in the <b>weeks</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the game. In addition, both teams boasted high-ranked defenses that had performed well during the year. Much was made of that fact and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, each of whom were considered among the best players at their position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall performed well for the Hokies during the regular season and was predicted to continue his success in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Attendance was low, in {{part due}} to Tech fans' {{reluctance}} to travel across the country and pay high prices for the chance to do so. Travel agents indicated low business in the <b>weeks</b> <b>leading</b> <b>up</b> to the game, and Tech sold approximately 5,000tickets—a far lower total than the Hokies' two previous bowl games, when 25,000tickets each were sold to games in Florida and Louisiana.|$|E
