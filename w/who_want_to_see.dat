While stopping near Gil'ead, Eragon is captured and imprisoned in the same jail that holds a woman he has been having dreams about. As she is being dragged past she is revealed as an elf when her pointed ears are uncovered. Murtagh and Saphira stage a rescue, and Eragon escapes with the unconscious elf. During the escape, Eragon and Murtagh battle with Durza. Murtagh shoots Durza between the eyes with an arrow, and the Shade disappears in a cloud of mist. Having escaped, they run off. Eragon succeeds in communicating with the elf, whose name is revealed as Arya, and learns the location of the Varden. After some arguing, Murtagh decides to still travel with Eragon to the Varden but is still wary of them.|$|E

We can speak to America and the world because we speak in names of a whole nation.” In this 1960 speech, Castro also criticized many Latin American liberal democracies, describing them as a “Pretense of democracy”, as, he claimed, they did not allow such gatherings.|$|E

25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E

Bloc Party followed the album's release with a short European promotional tour in early March 2005. Between 17 March and 9 April, the band undertook a first headlining US tour to coincide with the American release of Silent Alarm through Vice Records on 22 March. The US marketing was geared to establish a long-term fan base among [...] "tastemakers and early-adopter rock enthusiasts", rather than a short-term emphasis on radio play.

2500|$|Following the Labour Party's {{defeat at}} the general {{election}} on 7 May 2015, Ed Miliband resigned as its party leader, triggering a leadership election. On 2 June, it was reported in media sources that Corbyn was considering standing as a candidate, having been disillusioned {{by the lack of}} a left-wing voice. The next day, Corbyn confirmed to his local newspaper, The Islington Tribune, that he would stand in the election on a [...] "clear anti-austerity platform". He added: [...] "This decision is in response to an overwhelming call by Labour Party members <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a broader range of candidates and a thorough debate {{about the future of the}} party. I am standing to give Labour Party members a voice in this debate". The other candidates were Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham and Shadow Care Minister Liz Kendall. Corbyn had the lowest number of nominations from fellow MPs of any Labour Party Leader, and several who nominated him later claimed to have cleared him to run more to widen the political debate within the party than because of a desire or expectation that he would win. Nonetheless, he rapidly became the frontrunner among the candidates.|$|E
2500|$|Whether or not Lexa {{should be}} paired with Clarke was also debated, {{especially}} by {{fans of the}} Bellamy and Clarke relationship ("Bellarke"), which is canon in the books.

[...] Rothenberg told Bucksbaum that he was not dismissing the pairing; rather the Bellamy and Clarke romance was not yet the focus. He said the show gives indications that Bellamy and Clarke care deeply for each other, and those wanting a romance at the time should read the books. [...] "We played with the Lexa/Clarke storyline [...] and that [...] still ongoing because both characters [...] still breathing," [...] stated Rothenberg. [...] "The journey is long, and eventually we'll be able to tell that story in all its glory." [...] He said when it came to whether or not the series would end with Clarke and Lexa as a couple, he would not comment on the matter and knew where he wanted the series to go, but he was always open to better ideas. Eliza Taylor also weighed in on the matter, stating that she loves that bisexuality on the show is portrayed as normal, and that she also likes the chemistry between Bellamy and Clarke.|$|E

He's just a big, big character and bringing him into the Vic is going to change a lot of the dynamics of EastEnders". Shane Richie, who plays previous landlord Alfie Moon, said Mick and the rest of the Carters would [...] "change the dynamics of the Queen Vic", confirming that their arrival was [...] "the big Christmas storyline".|$|E
