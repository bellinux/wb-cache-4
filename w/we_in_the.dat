2500|$|Donald Brake from The Washington Times, {{as well as}} pastors Andy Langford and Ann G. L. Duncan, {{wrote that}} the film has Christian themes, {{such as that of}} self-sacrifice, which is found in Katniss' {{substitution}} for her younger sister, analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus as a substitute for the atonement of sins. Brake, as well as another reviewer, Amy Simpson, both find that the film also revolves around the theme of hope, which is exemplified in the [...] "incorruptible goodness of Katniss' sister, Primrose". She also describes that Peeta Mellark is [...] "a Christ figure" [...] in the film. Similar to the events in the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus, in the Games, Peeta is stabbed and left for dead after saving Katniss' life—taking the wound that was initially meant for her—and is then buried in the ground and placed in a cave for three days before emerging with a new lease on life. Moreover, the Christian image of the Bread of Life is used throughout The Hunger Games; in the film, Peeta shows up [...] "bearing a warm loaf of bread", and Katniss slowly comes [...] "back to life". A news video starring Jonathan Morris aired on Fox News discussed the religious themes in the film further. One reviewer, Fr. Robert Barron, interpreted the film as [...] "disturbingly prophetic" [...] that [...] "the instinct for human sacrifice is never far from the surface...as <b>we</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West enter increasingly into a secular, post-Christian cultural space." [...] In addition, many pastors have written Bible studies discussing the Christian allegories in the film.|$|E
