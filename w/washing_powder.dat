50|$|The task {{of doing}} laundry {{had begun to}} change with the {{introduction}} of <b>washing</b> <b>powders</b> in the 1880s. Until that time, laundry was done using hard bar soap, washboards, and the repeated beating and wringing of the clothing items. The success of several of the new <b>washing</b> <b>powders</b> had proven that there was a ready market for what the consumer believed to be better and more economical cleaning agents. Most of these new products, however, were simply pulverized soap and fell short of having any significant improvement in doing the laundry.|$|R

Throughout their vacation, Collins had been temporarily residing in the Leik family's Ypsilanti home, having been granted sole access to the house in order that he could feed their German shepherd. Upon their return from their vacation, Leik's wife, Sandra, had noted numerous paint marks covering the floor of the family basement, and that several items including a bottle of ammonia, some <b>washing</b> <b>powder,</b> and a canister of black spray paint were missing from the household. The same day, Leik was advised by investigators of his nephew's suspect status, and the level of circumstantial evidence unfolding against him. Leik acknowledged that the evidence thus far gathered against his nephew was compelling, although in this first interview, he did not advise officers of the items missing from his household, or the paint marks {{he and his wife had}} found upon the floor of the family basement; however, the following morning, Leik scraped away some of the black paint which had been sprayed in his basement to reveal a stain which looked ominously like human blood and immediately returned to the police station to report his findings.|$|E

These phosphonic acids are commonly added to <b>washing</b> <b>powders</b> as polyphosphate substitutes and are here {{studied in the}} presence of another detergent compound: tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED), a bleaching activator. Product concentrations were chosen in order to correspond to component concentration ratios encountered in <b>washing</b> <b>powders.</b> Potentiometric titrations were carried out to determine the possible TAED interferences; they indicate that TAED and its by-products have no action on phosphonic acid complexing behaviour. Under our experimental conditions, the action of TAED was modelled with acetic acid and ethylenediamine, the final by-products of TAED hydrolysis. If we take into account both phosphonic and acetic acids, speciation diagrams corresponding to representative fresh water systems showed that the acetic acid does not influence cation speciation...|$|R
2500|$|The team {{spent eight}} {{seasons in the}} top flight, the most {{successful}} period in the club's short history. After finishing 8th in their first season, they came 7th in 1997–98, [...] 5th {{in each of the}} following three seasons, 6th twice, before relegation back to the Northern Division with a 10th-placed finish in 2003–04. The team were also successful in the cup competitions during this period; they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1998–99, losing 2–1 to Southampton Saints. They repeated this feat in 2001–02, but lost 3–1 to Doncaster Belles. In 1999, Tranmere won the Reebok Women's Football Festival in Mansfield, then the traditional curtain-raiser to the season, beating local rivals Everton 1–0 in the final.

2500|$|Hence, in {{the general}} law of contract, {{negotiating}} parties {{have a duty to}} not make false statements of fact or law, or misrepresent themselves through conduct. Statements of opinion, [...] "mere puff" [...] or vague [...] "sales talk" [...] (e.g. [...] "this <b>washing</b> <b>powder</b> will make your clothes whiter than white!"), are generally not considered factual. However representations of people who profess special skill or knowledge {{are more likely to be}} actionable, as they warrant their opinions are based on concrete facts. So in Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon Lord Denning MR held that Esso's expert opinion that a petrol station would have 200,000 gallons worth of business was an actionable misrepresentation. If someone is induced to enter a contract by any misrepresentation, whether fraudulent, negligent or innocent, they are entitled to rescind the contract and get back the property they have conveyed. As a remedy originating in the courts of equity, this right to rescind could be lost, in four situations that courts regard as unfair to allow a claim. First, if a claimant takes too long to claim, the lapse of time (or [...] "laches") will create a bar to rescission. Second, if a claimant affirms a contract by expressly showing they still consent to a deal even though they are aware of a misrepresentation, rescission is barred. Third, if a third party's rights have intervened, when that third party is a bona fide purchaser rescission will be barred to the extent that property cannot be recovered from the third party (although a claim in damages can still exist against the misrepresentor). Fourth, and important in practice to prevent unjust enrichment is that counter-restitution must be possible. There is confusion over whether in cases at law, rather than in equity, counter-restitution must be precise (i.e. a thing received must be given back [...] ) or whether, as in Erlanger, substantial counter-restitution may be in money.|$|E

40|$|Surface-active {{compounds}} are {{an integral}} part of <b>washing</b> agents (<b>powders)</b> and are designed to used in water. One of the hazardous chemical classes for environment and human health are persistent organic pollutants (POPs).

Surface-active compounds (SAC) are very active even in the low concentration range of 0. 005 - 1 %. Therefore, from a scientific viewpoint, the listed range of their concentration in washing agents is so broad (e. g. < 5 %; - 15 %; - 30 %) that meaningful results based on the concentration of these SAC cannot be obtained in laboratory experiments. Particular attention needs to be paid to the development of national policies for the control of surface-active chemicals in polluted washing waters and wastewaters. The first step would be an initiative to ensure that Latvian regulations and legislation are backed up with effective control systems for not only for “surface-active substances” as a whole, but also specifically for nonionic and cationic substances...|$|R

50|$|Control of {{moisture}} in products {{can be a}} vital part of the process of the product. There is a substantial amount {{of moisture}} in what seems to be dry matter. Ranging in products from cornflake cereals to <b>washing</b> <b>powders,</b> moisture can play an important role in the final quality of the product. There are two main aspects of concern in moisture control in products: allowing too much moisture or too little of it. For example, adding some water to cornflake cereal, which is sold by weight, reduces costs and prevents it from tasting too dry, but adding too much water can affect the crunchiness of the cereal and the freshness because water content contributes to bacteria growth. Water content of some foods is also manipulated to reduce the number of calories.|$|R
