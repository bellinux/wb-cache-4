40|$|Hydrolyzed <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> (HWP) can induce {{immediate}} hypersensitivity through skin contact and/or food ingestion. Such patients develop IgE against unmodified <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> without allergy to wheat. Our {{objective was}} to study the IgE-reacting content of HWP. We compared the reactivity of HWP and unmodified <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> with IgE from patients suffering from immediate hypersensitivity to HWP. We studied the cross-reactivity between one HWP preparation and <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> using immunoblot inhibition experiments. This showed that the tested HWP carried mainly unmodified epitopes originating from <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins.</b> The size distribution of polypeptides from two HWP preparations was analyzed by size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC), and their reactivity with IgE was studied. This showed that they contained highly IgE-reacting high molecular weight entities, likely resulting in a rearrangement of peptides issued from gluten processes. These multiepitopic entities could explain the high immunogenicity of HWP for sensitized people...|$|R

25|$|In genetically {{susceptible}} people, gluten – a {{major part}} of <b>wheat</b> <b>protein</b> – can trigger coeliac disease. Coeliac disease affects about 1% of the general population in developed countries. There is evidence that most cases remain undiagnosed and untreated.

25|$|The {{quality of}} the <b>wheat</b> <b>protein</b> gluten. This protein can {{determine}} the suitability of a wheat to a particular dish. A strong and elastic gluten present in bread wheats enables dough to trap carbon dioxide during leavening, but elastic gluten interferes with the rolling of pasta into thin sheets. The gluten protein in durum wheats used for pasta is strong but not elastic.|$|E
25|$|When {{proteins}} are {{cut into}} polypeptides, buried regions {{are exposed to}} the surface, and these buried regions may possibly be antigenic. Such hydrolyzed <b>wheat</b> <b>protein</b> is used as an additive in foods and cosmetics. The peptides are often 1 kD in size (9 amino acid residues in length) and may increase the allergic response. These wheat polypeptides can cause immediate contact urticaria in susceptible people.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> have a {{low quality}} for human nutrition, {{according}} to the new protein quality method (DIAAS) promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization. <b>Wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> are deficient in the essential amino acid, lysine, and contain adequate amounts of the other essential amino acids, at least for adults. Because the proteins present in the <b>wheat</b> endosperm (gluten <b>proteins)</b> are particularly poor in lysine, white flours are more deficient in lysine compared with whole grains. Significant efforts in plant breeding are being made to develop lysine-rich wheat varieties, without success as of 2017. Supplementation with proteins from other food sources (mainly legumes) is commonly used to compensate for this deficiency, since the limitation of a single essential amino acid causes the others to break down and become excreted, which is especially important during the period of growth.|$|R
40|$|A {{wheat gluten}} (WG) diet {{promotes}} {{the development of}} type 1 diabetes (TID) in diabetes prone BioBreeding (BBdp) rats. Our aim was to examine whether oral exposure of neonates to WG proteins prior to weaning would modify the disease process and to identify candidate <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> that {{may be related to}} development of TID. Feeding diabetes-promoting WG proteins {{during the first week of}} life protected a proportion (∼ 1 / 2) of animals from developing diabetes as adults. Twenty-four hours after exposure to a cereal-based diet there was a downregulation of the Th 1 cytokine gene IFN-gamma in the small intestine. A cross-sectional analysis of 1 D-Western blots of WG proteins showed that 70 d BBdp rats have higher IgG reactivity to 33 and 36 kDa WG proteins than diabetes resistant BB rats. Similarly, prospective analysis of pre-diabetic and asymptomatic BBdp rats showed that increased reactivity to 33 and 38 kDa WG proteins was associated with progression to disease. We detected increased IgG reactivity to 33 and 38 kDa WG proteins in Finnish children newly diagnosed with diabetes compared with age, sex and HLA-DQ matched children without diabetes. 2 D-Western blots showed that 11 <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> were antigenic in the majority of BBdp rats. These 11 proteins were analysed by mass spectrometry and searches of amino acid sequences in public databases suggested that two candidate <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> were alanine aminotransferase 2 transaminase 2 (GPT- 2, TC# 8197) and wheat storage globulin (WSG, Acc. No. AAA 3469). GPT- 2 and WSG have similar amino acid sequences as human heat shock protein 60 (HSP 60), an autoantigen in TID. Moreover, WSG shares sequence homology with the insulin receptor precursor, interleukin-I (IL- 1) receptor and IL- 1 beta. These structural homologies to diabetes related antigens suggest that <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> may be involved in the autoimmune process that destroys beta-cells. As part of a strategy to develop assays of food protein "diabetogenicity", we showed a major down regulation in protein expression in gut epithelial cells exposed to chymotrypsin digested WG proteins.

40|$|Acid-hydrolyzed <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> (acid-HWPs) {{have been}} shown to provoke severe {{allergic}} reactions in Europe and Japan that are distinct from classical wheat allergies. Acid-HWPs were shown to contain neo-epitopes induced by the deamidation of gluten proteins. However, products with variable rates of deamidation can be found. In this work, we studied the effect of the extent of <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> deamidation on its allergenicity. A recombinant chimeric IgE was produced and compared to patients' IgE for its capacity to assess the IgE-mediated triggering potential of acid-HWPs. Sera from acid-HWP allergic patients were analyzed via ELISA and a functional basophil assay for their IgE reactivity to <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> with different deamidation levels. A chimeric mouse/human IgE (chIgE-DG 1) specific for the main neo-epitope, QPEEPFPE, involved in allergy to acid-HWPs was characterized with respect to its functionality and its reactivity compared to that of patients' IgE. Acid-HWPs with medium (30 %) and high (50 - 60 %) deamidation levels displayed a markedly stronger IgE binding and capacity to activate basophils than those of samples with weak (15 %) deamidation levels. The monoclonal chIgE-DG 1 allowed basophil degranulation in the presence of deamidated <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins.</b> ChIgE-DG 1 was found to mimic patients' IgE reactivity and displayed the same ability to rank acid-HWP products in a degranulation assay. Increasing the deamidation level of products from 15 % to 60 % resulted in an approximately 2 -fold increase in their antigenicity and a 100 -fold increase in their eliciting potential. The chimeric ChIgE-DG 1 may be a useful tool to evaluate functionalized glutens for their allergenic potential. By mimicking patient sera reactivity, chIgE-DG 1 also provided data on the patients' IgE repertoire and on the functionality of certain repeated epitopes in gluten proteins...|$|R

40|$|Wheat {{is uniquely}} {{suited to the}} baking of leavened bread mainly because of its protein composition. The flour-forming {{endosperm}} contains storage proteins that form the gluten complex after grinding and mixing with water. Essential to the unique dough structure are the glutenin polypeptides that are disulfide cross-linked into polymers {{with a wide range}} of molecular weights. Their contribution to dough strength is balanced by the smaller gliadin proteins. Our knowledge of composition–function relationships permits the prediction of dough quality. The bran and germ tissues contain a further range of proteins. The important attributes of grain hardness and milling quality are explained by variations in protein composition, especially for the puroindolines. Specific amino acid sequences of <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> have been shown to be responsible for wheat-related health issues, including celiac disease. Proteomic studies of the <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> are bringing new insights into their composition and functional properties...|$|R
40|$|IgE-mediated allergy to <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> can {{be caused}} by {{exposure}} through ingestion, inhalation, or skin/mucosal contact, and can affect various populations and age groups. Respiratory allergy to <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> is commonly observed in adult patients occupationally exposed to flour, whereas wheat food allergy is more common in children. Wheat allergy is of growing importance for patients with recurrent anaphylaxis, especially when exercise related. The diagnosis of wheat allergy relies on a consistent clinical history, skin prick testing with well-characterized extracts and specific IgE tests. The accuracy of wheat allergy diagnosis may be improved by measuring IgE responses to several wheat components. However, a high degree of heterogeneity has been found in the recognition pattern of allergens among patient groups with different clinical profiles, as well as within each group. Thus, oral provocation with wheat or the implicated cereal is the reference test for the definitive diagnosis of ingested wheat/cereal allergy...|$|R

This project compared textured <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> and soy proteins at 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, and 40 % in both emulsified and non-emulsified chicken nuggets. A total of 6, 048 chicken nuggets were evaluated in replications for batter breader pickup (%), par fry yield (%), cook loss (%), L*, a*, b* color value, texture profile analysis, and sensory analysis. Analysis was conducted for all four concentrations of wheat and soy treatments then compared to each other and an all-white meat chicken nugget control. All data was analyzed with a ? < 0. 05 using SAS with PROC GLM and Duncan?s MRT, except for sensory data which was analyzed as a complete randomized block design using analysis of variance with a ? < 0. 05, and was analyzed using SAS with PROC GLM. Results indicated that no notable trends were apparent in the quality testing. A trained sensory panel determined that Soy flavor was more detectable at 20 % and 30 % than wheat flavor was at similar levels. The results indicate that <b>wheat</b> <b>proteins</b> can replace soy proteins for functional properties in both emulsified and non-emulsified chicken nuggets at all concentrations evaluated.
