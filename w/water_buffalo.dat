5|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered wild <b>water</b> <b>buffalo</b> is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic <b>water</b> <b>buffalo.</b> Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridization threatens the existence of rare species.|$|E

In a more complex situation, in which one Toraja family could not handle their problems alone, several villages formed a group; sometimes, villages would unite against other villages. Relationship between families was expressed through blood, marriage, and shared ancestral houses (tongkonan), practically signed by the exchange of <b>water</b> <b>buffalo</b> and pigs on ritual occasions. Such exchanges not only built political and cultural ties between families but defined each person's place in a social hierarchy: who poured palm wine, who wrapped a corpse and prepared offerings, where each person could or could not sit, what dishes should be used or avoided, and even what piece of meat constituted one's share.|$|E

Hunting and raising livestock such as <b>water</b> <b>buffalo</b> and cattle is a necessary adjunct to the agriculture. The Tamil-inhabited Vanni consists of the Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, and eastern Mannar districts.

Major changes {{took place in the}} Columbian Exchange when Old World livestock were brought to the New World, and then in the British Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century, when livestock breeds like the Dishley Longhorn cattle and Lincoln Longwool sheep were rapidly improved by agriculturalists such as Robert Bakewell to yield more meat, milk, and wool. A wide range of other species such as horse, <b>water</b> <b>buffalo,</b> llama, rabbit and guinea pig are used as livestock {{in some parts of the}} world.

40|$|Schistosomiasis japonica is an endemic, {{zoonotic}} disease of major public health importance in China where <b>water</b> <b>buffaloes</b> account for approximately 75 % of disease transmission. Interventions that reduce schistosome infection in <b>water</b> <b>buffaloes</b> will enhance their health simultaneously reducing disease transmission to humans. While chemotherapy has proved successful, it requires continued time consuming and expensive mass treatments. A more sustainable option would be development of vaccines that reduce transmission of S. japonicum from bovines to replace bovine chemotherapy. We performed two randomized double blind trials in <b>water</b> <b>buffaloes</b> {{to determine if}} DNA vaccines encoding triose-phosphate isomerase (SjCTPI), or the tetraspanin 23 kDa integral membrane protein (SjC 23), alone or fused to bovine heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) could induce a level of immunity conducive to long-term sustainable control. Groups of <b>water</b> <b>buffaloes</b> (15 /group) received three intramuscular injections, 4 weeks apart. Booster immunizations were co-administered with a plasmid DNA encoding IL- 12. Four weeks after the last injection, <b>water</b> <b>buffaloes</b> were challenged with 1000 cercariae, and vaccine efficacy analyzed 8 weeks later. <b>Water</b> <b>buffaloes</b> vaccinated with SjCTPI-Hsp 70 or SjCTPI plasmids had worm burdens reduced by 51. 2 % and 41. 5 %, respectively. Importantly, fecal miracidial hatching was reduced by 52. 1 % and 33. 2 % respectively compared to control vaccinated <b>water</b> <b>buffaloes.</b> Vaccination with SjC 23 -Hsp 70 and SjC 23 plasmids reduced worm burdens by 50. 9 % and 45. 5 %, respectively, and fecal miracidial hatching by 52. 0 % and 47. 4 %. A mathematical model of schistosome transmission predicts that schistosome vaccines capable of reducing water buffaloes' fecal egg output by 45 %, alone or in conjunction with praziquantel treatment, {{will lead to a}} significant reduction in transmission of schistosomiasis. Both DNA vaccines tested here exceed this hypothetical level. Indeed, mathematical modeling of SjCTPI-Hsp 70 and SjC 23 -Hsp 70 alone and in conjunction with human chemotherapy showed a significant reduction in transmission {{almost to the point of}} elimination.
