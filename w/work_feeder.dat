5000|$|Alaska Airlines also faced {{increased}} competition from low-cost carriers. One carrier that competed with Alaska was MarkAir. Since it began operating in 1984, competition {{had been reduced}} because it had <b>worked</b> out <b>feeder</b> agreements with Alaska Airlines. However, after Alaska Air declined to buy the airline {{in the fall of}} 1991, it intensified competition with Alaska. The airline offered low-cost service on the Anchorage-Seattle route and other routes in Alaska, where Alaska Airlines earned almost one-third of its revenues. This hurt Alaska Airlines; {{for the first time in}} 20 years, it posted a loss of [...] million. To save money, the airline canceled two proposed maintenance facilities and deferred a large aircraft purchase worth [...] billion. It was able to increase utilization on its existing planes, though. The airline also cut labor costs, but this ended up making relations with unions tense.|$|R
