5|$|After initial aliveness {{testing that}} showed no issues, STIS {{was taken into}} {{functional}} testing, and issues were seen when the telescope put itself into safe mode due to a low thermal limit sensor.

5|$|Against his will, Gygax <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> charge again; he {{immediately}} {{looked for a}} quick product to get NIPI off the ground. He had retained the rights to Gord the Rogue {{as part of his}} severance agreement with TSR, so he licensed Greyhawk from TSR and started writing new novels beginning with Sea of Death (1987); sales were brisk, and Gygax's Gord the Rogue novels ended up keeping New Infinities in business.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{operation}} may have commenced under Septimius Zabbai, Zabdas' second-in-command, {{the invasion of}} Asia Minor did not fully begin until Zabdas' arrival {{in the spring of}} 271. The Palmyrenes annexed Galatia and, according to Zosimus, reached Ancyra. Bithynia and the Cyzicus mint remained beyond Zenobia's control, and her attempts to subdue Chalcedon failed. The Asia Minor campaign is poorly documented, but {{the western part of the}} region did not become part of the queen's authority; no coins with Zenobia or Vaballathus' portraits were minted in Asia Minor, and no royal Palmyrene inscriptions have been found. By August 271 Zabdas <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Palmyra, with the Palmyrene empire at its zenith.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the French Revolutionary War, Gibraltar served in the Channel Fleet, {{fighting}} at the Glorious First of June in 1794 before being sent to the Mediterranean in May 1795.

5|$|Between 1926 and 1927, Cooper {{discussed}} {{the plans for}} Pan American Airways with John Hambleton, which was formed during 1927.

While he was on the board, Cooper did not devote his full attention to the organization; he took time in 1929 and 1930 to work on the script for King Kong. By 1931, he <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Hollywood. He resigned from the board of directors in 1935, following health complications.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th century, English <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> fashion {{among all}} classes, though much changed; the Middle English form showed many signs of French influence, both in {{vocabulary}} and spelling. During the English Renaissance, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. Modern English has extended this custom of flexibility, {{when it comes}} to incorporating words from different languages. Thanks {{in large part to the}} British Empire, the English language is the world's unofficial lingua franca.|$|E
5|$|England beat Scotland 7–2 in April 1955, {{and this}} time Matthews linked up much better with Revie, and 40-year-old Matthews was largely {{credited}} for the outstanding margin of victory. In this game Duncan Edwards was making his England debut; when Matthews made his, Edwards had not even been born. Matthews went on England's unsuccessful tour of the continent in 1955, as the selectors erratic choices helped to ensure a 1–0 defeat to France, a 1–1 draw with Spain, and a 3–1 defeat to Portugal. Left out against Denmark, he <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the team in October for a 1–1 draw with Wales.|$|E

5|$|In 1827, the Unitarians were {{challenged}} by Federalist forces. After {{the resignation of}} Rivadavia, Manuel Dorrego was installed as governor of Buenos Aires province. He quickly made peace with Brazil but, on returning to Argentina, was overthrown and executed by the Unitarian general Juan Lavalle, who took Dorrego's place. However, Lavalle did not spend long as governor either: he was soon overthrown by militias composed largely of gauchos led by Rosas and Estanislao López. By the end of 1829 the old legislature that Lavalle had disbanded <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> place and had appointed Rosas as governor of Buenos Aires.|$|E
