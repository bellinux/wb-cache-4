5|$|Like other {{forensic}} fields, forensic anthropologists {{are held}} to {{a high level of}} ethical standards due to their work in the legal system. Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or any piece of evidence can be sanctioned, fined, or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> to disclose any conflict of interests or <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> to report all of their findings, regardless of what they may be, can face disciplinary actions. It is important that forensic anthropologists remain impartial during the course of an investigation. Any perceived bias during an investigation could hamper efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{transplantation}} is {{an effective}} cure for Wilson's disease but is used only in particular scenarios because of the risks and complications associated with the procedure. It is used mainly in people with fulminant liver failure <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> to respond to medical treatment or in those with advanced chronic liver disease. Liver transplantation is avoided in severe neuropsychiatric illness, in which its benefit has not been demonstrated.|$|E

5|$|After initial resistance, Gibbs also {{successfully}} pushed {{legislation in}} 2007 to increase penalties for truck drivers <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> {{to comply with}} Colorado's law requiring snow chain on roads in winter, a move designed to improve accessibility and safety on I-70, which bisected Gibbs' house district. In later years, Gibbs and state officials attributed decreases in accidents and tickets issued for violating the chain law {{to the passage of}} the bill.

5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E
5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} {{to stave off}} the advances of voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight {{as to whether or not}} he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in Yder), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in The Knight of the Sword the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> their tests.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] PU vir CHO, 1989 The {{purpose of}} the {{investigation}} was to obtain a psychological evaluation of coloured pupils <b>who</b> <b>failed.</b> Chapter One stipulates {{the goals of the}} investigation and explores the literature concerning failure and aspects dealing with pupils <b>who</b> <b>failed.</b> A review of the conceptions and extent of failure among the different population groups in South Africa are given. The experience of failure by die pupil <b>who</b> <b>failed,</b> teachers, friends and parents, and the characteristics and aspects {{to be found in the}} pupil <b>who</b> <b>failed,</b> are then discussed. The aspects covered are interpersonal and family relations, socio-economical and cultural aspects, and personality characteristics. This is followed by a discussion of the causes of failure, as well as preventive and reductive measures. The methods of investigation are discussed in Chapter Two. The structure of the experiment, the subjects, the psychometrical instruments and the statistical methods used are covered. Twenty coloured pupils <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> are compared with twenty-three coloured pupils who passed. The investigation consisted of the following: a. The Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes (SSHA) to determine the study habits and -attitudes of the coloured pupils <b>who</b> <b>failed.</b> b. The High School Personality Questionnaire (HSPQ) and Group Personality Projective Test (GPPT) to determine a possible personality structure of the coloured pupils <b>who</b> <b>failed.</b> c. The High School Interest Questionnaire to determine a possible interest profile of the coloured pupils <b>who</b> <b>failed.</b> d. The Cattell Culture Fair Intelligence Test (Scale 3) for measuring the intellectual capability of the coloured pupils <b>who</b> passed and <b>failed.</b> The results are then discussed in Chapter Three. No significant differences were found between the coloured pupils who passed with respect to study habits and attitudes and interest. However, on the whole the coloured pupils <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> seem to tend to have bad study habits and attitudes, as well as a lack of interest. Significant differences were found in the personality evaluation, as well as in the verbal intellectual capability of the coloured pupil <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> and those <b>who</b> passed. No significant differences were found in the non-verbal intellectual capabilities.. The investigation and conclusions are summarized in Chapter Four. The most important conclusions are the following: * Although differences were found, these are not significant enough to establish a personality structure of the coloured pupil <b>who</b> <b>failed.</b> No clear profile can be attributed to the personality of the coloured pupil <b>who</b> have <b>failed.</b> * The poor socio-economical conditions and cultural and educational backwardness of the coloured population group, are factors that must be taken into consideration. These aspects of the coloured population group still demand urgent and close attention. * The coloured educational system justifies more financial support as well as educational and extra-mural facilities.

5|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and cumulative fatigue effects describe how individuals <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> {{to have an}} adequate period of sleep (78hours in 24hours) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 1617hours will suffer sleep deprivation. A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue {{may be caused by}} breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods in place of a single unbroken period of sleep. A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance.|$|E

Further up the course, a third official will be positioned so as to arrest those <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> to notice the two initial flags.

5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{can lead}} to social stigmatization and {{disadvantages}} in employment. When compared to their normal weight counterparts, obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> to make improvements in their health after one year.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndicated}} version's potential contestants, {{depending on}} tryouts, {{are required to}} pass an electronically scored test comprising a set of thirty questions which must be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> the test are eliminated, while those who pass are interviewed for an audition by the production staff, and those who impress the staff the most are then notified by postal mail {{that they have been}} placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool are selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants are given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they meet all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they are given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show. Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version does not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants are instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.|$|E

5|$|There {{are eight}} public and one private {{universities}} in Hong Kong, the oldest being the University of Hong Kong (HKU), established in 1910–1912. The Chinese University of Hong Kong {{was founded in}} 1963 to fulfill {{the need for a}} university with a medium of instruction of Chinese. Competition among students to receive an offer for an undergraduate programme is fierce as the annual number of intakes is limited, especially when some disciplines are offered by select tertiary institutions, like medicine which is provided by merely two medical schools in the territory, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong and the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In addition to the public post-secondary institutions there are also a number of private higher institutions which offer higher diplomas and associate degree courses for those <b>who</b> <b>fail</b> to enter a college for a degree study so as to boost their qualification of education, some of whom can have a second chance of getting into a university if they have a good performance in these sub-degree courses.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} student teacher failure {{literature}} and describes {{a study on the}} causes of failure, noting implications for teacher education institutions. The study involved a systematic analysis of the files of student teachers <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> at one university from 1994 - 97. Failure of student teaching was defined as either choosing to quit student teaching or being removed from the experience. Results were coded as personal characteristics, performance indicators, or contextual factors. Results identified age, gender, number of previous institutions attended, and lower grades in methods classes as demographic characteristics of students <b>who</b> <b>failed.</b> The single biggest reason for students to withdraw from student teaching was the decision that teaching was not for them. Personal circumstances were another primary reason for failure. Regarding performance indicators, students <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> displayed multiple skill deficiencies. Students <b>who</b> <b>failed</b> for contextual reasons usually did so because of conflic...|$|R
