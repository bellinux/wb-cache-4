Claire is packing up her father's files, when her boyfriend West Rosen arrives to try and stop her from revealing his secret. Angered, she gives him his file and breaks up with him. Noah returns home and tells Claire not to expose The Company, informing her {{that he has made}} a deal. He will work for them and in exchange his family will be left alone to lead normal lives.|$|E
5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady a chance to recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, she <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to paint a picture for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E

They won the tournament winning all of their matches against the Cook Islands and Japan, {{qualifying}} them for Division Three of the World Cricket League in Darwin, Australia. They warmed up for the tournament with a three match series at home against Vanuatu, winning all three matches, but were unsuccessful in the tournament itself, losing all five games they played, thus meaning they <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in Division Four in 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{descriptions of}} diffraction {{are those in}} which the situation {{can be reduced to}} a two-dimensional problem. For water waves, this is already the case, as water waves propagate only {{on the surface of the}} water. For light, we can often neglect one dimension if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength. In the case of light shining through small circular holes we <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account the full three-dimensional nature of the problem.|$|E
25|$|Osbourne {{experienced}} tremors {{for some}} years and linked them to his continuous drug abuse. In May 2005, he {{found out it was}} actually Parkin syndrome, a genetic condition, the symptoms of which are similar to Parkinson's disease. Osbourne <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> daily medication {{for the rest of his}} life to combat the involuntary shudders associated with the condition. Osbourne has also shown symptoms of mild hearing loss, as depicted in the television show, The Osbournes, where he often asks his family to repeat what they say. At the TEDMED Conference in October 2010, scientists from Knome joined Osbourne on stage to discuss their analysis of Osbourne's whole genome, which shed light on how the famously hard-living rocker has survived decades of drug abuse.|$|E

25|$|Jake {{constantly}} {{worries about}} Vickie having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent {{in his next}} fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro {{in front of the}} local Mob boss, Tommy Como, and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against Marcel Cerdan.|$|E
500|$|By September Verdi {{had agreed}} {{in a letter}} to his {{publisher}} Casa Ricordi that La Scala could present the premiere during the 1892–93 season, but that he would retain control over every aspect of the production. An early February date was mentioned along with the demand that the house would be available exclusively after 2 January 1893 and that, even after the dress rehearsal, he could withdraw the opera: [...] "I will leave the theatre, and [...] <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the score away". The public learned of the new opera towards the end of 1892, and intense interest was aroused, increased rather than diminished by the secrecy with which Verdi surrounded the preparations; rehearsals were in private, and the press was kept at arm's length. Apart from Verdi's outrage at the way that La Scala announced the season's programme on 7 December – [...] "either a revival of Tannhäuser or Falstaff" [...] – things went smoothly in January 1893 up to the premiere performance on 9 February.|$|E

2500|$|The {{race was}} one of the costliest {{legislative}} races in the state. Migden came into the race with $647,000 in the bank from past races, but according to the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC), she did not properly transfer campaign funds. The FPPC investigators found 89 violations in campaign finance reporting. The FPPC originally prevented her from using the $647,000 from previous races. On March 6, Migden filed a legal challenge against the FPPC, claiming the FPPC ruling had violated her right to free speech. The FPPC settled the dispute with Migden for a record $350,000 fine. Richie Ross, Migden's campaign consultant, called the issues in the complaint legitimate, saying, [...] "There's no excuse, and she <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her legitimate lumps.
