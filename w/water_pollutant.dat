50|$|Less common are {{line source}} {{applications}} {{in the field of}} <b>water</b> <b>pollutant</b> dispersal. This phenomenon generally arises when surface runoff scours soil contaminants from upper soil layers and transports these pollutants to a linear receiving water, such as a river. The underlying land management practices which lead to such sources of water pollution are logging, pesticide application, construction grading, slash-and-burn activity and urban stormwater runoff.|$|E
50|$|When use of one {{function}} {{is at the}} expense of another or the same function or threatens to be so in the future, there is competition of functions. As an illustration, once <b>water</b> <b>pollutant</b> thresholds have been exceeded, use of the function ‘dumping ground for waste’ may come to compete with the function ‘drinking water’. Competing functions are by definition scarce and consequently economic goods. Today most of the functions of our physical surroundings, which once were free goods, have become scarce goods.|$|E

50|$|Horton {{detailed}} {{his theory}} in a landmark paper published in 1945, {{only a month}} before his death, in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. He summarized his conclusions with four laws: the law of stream numbers, the law of stream lengths, the limits of infiltration capacity, and the runoff-detention-storage relation. His results demonstrate that the salient factor in aqueous soil erosion is the minimum length of overland flow necessary to produce enough runoff to effect erosion. This seminal work may be considered the founding of modern stream chemistry modeling, since {{it was the first}} comprehensive set of mathematical models to link basin hydrology with a <b>water</b> <b>pollutant,</b> namely sediment. The term Horton overland flow is named after his accomplishments in hydrology.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to construct a comprehensive dynamic optimization model on forecasts for the net load of <b>water</b> <b>pollutant</b> and economic growth of Beijing. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation modeling was conducted using software LINGO to perform the linear optimization model, based on tow sub-models (socio-economic model and an environmental model) and one objective (Min TQ P). The socio-economic model is based on input-output table and represents the relationship between socio-economic activities and <b>water</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions. The environmental model represents the changes in the amount of water pollutants generated. Our results propose an optimal policy for helping Beijing City to achieve the goal of sustainable development...|$|E

40|$|An {{integrated}} optimization {{simulation model}} has been developed based on an input-output approach to mitigate water pollution and water scarcity through embedding environmental economic policies and applicable technologies into a complex environ-economic system to obtain an optimal set of policies and technologies that promotes the maximization of the regional economy under the constraints of <b>water</b> <b>pollutant</b> discharge and water availability. An empirical study is undertaken with the Source Region of Liao River as the target area to verify {{the performance of the}} model. The relationships between the water environment and socio-economic systems are presented by clarifying the trends in economic development, <b>water</b> <b>pollutant</b> discharge and water supply and demand during a time horizon from 2011 to 2020. The endogenously-formed optimal set of policies and industrial restructuring simultaneously facilitate the reduction of <b>water</b> <b>pollutant</b> discharge and water consumption and increase the water supply. The extent of the mitigation of water pollution and water scarcity via applied policies and technologies promoted by the subsidies provided by the government are specified, and the mechanism of the policy application and subsidization distribution is explained. This model has applicability for other regions in terms of giving an optimal solution via comprehensive assessment of all of the proposed sustainability-related policies with sufficient data accessibility to achieve regional sustainable development...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between per capita income and environmental degradation in selected African counties, using longitudinal data spread generally between 1975 and 2002. The specific objective was to estimate environmental Kuznets curves for five indicators of environmental quality, namely: suspended particulate matter, carbon dioxide emissions, access to sanitation, access to safe water, and emissions of organic <b>water</b> <b>pollutants,</b> and to establish whether the estimated relationships conform to the inverted U-shape hypothesis. The results of the empirical investigation generally suggest the existence of environmental Kuznets curves for suspended particulate matter, carbon dioxide, organic <b>water</b> <b>pollutants</b> and access to sanitation. Other factors such as population density, education as well as policy regimes were also found to affect environmental quality. Specifically, population density has {{a positive effect on}} environmental degradation, particularly for suspended particulate matter, while education tends to reduce environmental pollution from the same source. An N-shaped pollution – income curve was also indicated for organic <b>water</b> <b>pollutants</b> – an indication that more stringent policy measures may be required to stem pollution from this source, as incomes ris...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of {{methods of analysis}} for trace organics in water was severely hampered until the introduction, in 1950, by Braus, Middleton and Walton l of 'a large scale sampling system which allowed systematic separation and identification of organic <b>water</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The sampling and concentration techniques available prior to this development restricted the analyst {{to the use of}} crude collective parameters, such as biological oxygen demand and total organic carbon or a few methods for specific organic substances such as oil, grease, phenol and furfural, for the measurement of organic <b>water</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The methods and instruments available for organic analysis became useful in the analysis of organic <b>water</b> <b>pollutants</b> with the introduction of this method.

40|$|Environmental {{non-profit}} {{organizations in}} the United States (U. S.) are {{in the early stages}} of reacting to a revolutionary water pollution control policy. In January 2003, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with the support of the U. S.

In doing so, the federal government, in essence, created a mechanism for environmental non-profit organizations to reduce water pollution by paying directly for wastewater treatment plant upgrades and runoff best management practices. In addition to providing a review of the history of water quality trading in the U. S. and an analytical trading model, this paper presents the results of a survey that evaluates how conventional environmental advocacy groups throughout the nation perceive the Policy.
