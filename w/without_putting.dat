5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence <b>without</b> <b>putting</b> the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain of}} the castle, Major Hannibal Bonithon, was invited by Colonel John Arundell to retreat to the {{stronger}} fortress of Pendennis, but Bonithon and his men surrendered immediately <b>without</b> <b>putting</b> up resistance. This decision has been put down to a result of war-weariness, {{the large numbers of}} Parliamentary troops facing them and the generous surrender terms on offer, although the 19th-century historian Samuel Oliver also suspected that Bonithon might have had Parliamentarian sympathies. 160 small arms and 13 artillery pieces were captured: the castle's guns were removed and redeployed in the siege of Pendennis, which fell that August.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{south-west}} {{sided with}} the King; Device Forts such as St Catherine's were held by the Royalists {{from the beginning of}} the conflict. The Royalists invaded Parliamentary-controlled Dorset in 1643, taking Portland and Sandsfoot. The flow of the war turned against the King, and the Dorset forts were besieged in 1644 and 1645, with Sandsfoot falling to Parliament. By March 1646, Thomas Fairfax had entered Cornwall with a substantial army. The captain of the castle was invited to retreat to the stronger fortress of Pendennis, but he surrendered immediately <b>without</b> <b>putting</b> up resistance. Pendennis was bombarded from the land and blockaded by a flotilla of ships. The captain, Sir John Arundell, agreed to an honourable surrender on 15 August, and around 900 survivors left the fort, some terminally ill from malnutrition. Pendennis was the penultimate Royalist fortification to hold out in the war, followed by Portland Castle which finally surrendered in April 1646.|$|E

This allows them to make potentially risky capital and infrastructure investments <b>without</b> <b>putting</b> {{so much of the}} credit of New York on the line. However, it also allows them to avoid many of the oversight and reporting regulations that apply to state government.|$|E
