5|$|During early December 1944, the American's {{defensive}} {{line in the}} Ardennes had a gap south of Losheimergraben. General Leonard T. Gerow, in command of V Corps, recognized this area as a possible avenue of attack by the Germans. This area, which lay between V Corps and Troy H. Middleton's VIII Corps, was undefended; just patrolled by jeep. The patrols {{in the northern part}} of the area <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> the 99th Infantry Division's 394th Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon, whereas those in the south <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> the 18th Cavalry Squadron, 14th Cavalry Group, which was attached to the 106th Infantry Division.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1967, the North Vietnamese instigated a series of actions in the border regions of South Vietnam. All of these attacks <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> regimental-size NVA/NLF units, but unlike the usual {{hit-and-run}} tactics used by the People's Army forces, these were sustained and bloody affairs.|$|E

5|$|No {{military}} operations <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> NATO during the Cold War.

5|$|Eleven of {{the twelve}} USAF {{personnel}} lost {{on the day of}} the battle were listed first as missing in action (MIA), then later as KIA/body not recovered. Between 1994 and 2004, 11 investigations <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> both Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) and unilaterally by Lao and Vietnamese investigators on both sides of the border. In 2002 two of the former VPA soldiers who had taken part in the attack told investigators that they threw the bodies of the Americans off the mountain after the attack as they were unable to bury them on the rocky surface.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> a European and American science {{team at the}} 1.2m Leonhard Euler Telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, {{which further}} {{raised the possibility of}} the existence of a planet in WASP-15's orbit; use of the CORALIE spectrograph on the Euler Telescope between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 revealed that the variations in radial velocity measurements were not because of an eclipsing binary star system.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> {{a team of}} British, Spanish, French, Swiss and American astronomers {{using the}} photometer on the James Gregory Telescope in Scotland; using visual comparisons to the nearby bright star HD 80408, the star's light curve was better defined. In combination with measurements of WASP-13's spectrum measured using the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France, the star's radial velocity was also discovered. The Fibre-Fed Echelle Spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope gathered additional measurements of WASP-13's spectrum, allowing astronomers to determine WASP-13's characteristics. Use of SOPHIE's data led {{to the discovery of}} the planet WASP-13b in 2008; the planet was reported in 2009.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, the Petitcodiac Tidal Power Company {{proposed}} a tidal power project. This {{called for a}} dam to be built between Hopewell Cape and Fort Folly Point. The company sold shares {{to raise funds for}} the project and a series of on-site and airborne studies <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> the federal government, but the project fell through by 1928. As rail transport became more common, it displaced river transportation around the Great Depression. In addition, the Greater Moncton International Airport offered an airmail service from Moncton to Montreal by 29 December 1929. These factors further marginalised the Petitcodiac.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Arthur's widow {{was awarded}} £1m damages in the High Court. The {{families}} {{of the other three}} fatal casualties received damages out of court. A memorial service was held for the victims on the 10th anniversary of the crash in 2010 at St Etheldreda's Church, Hatfield. A second service was held near the crash site afterwards.

5|$|In 2012, Air Combat Command {{requested}} {{the testing of}} a 600-gallon external fuel tank which would extend the A-10's loitering time by 45–60 minutes; flight testing of such a tank had been conducted in 1997, but did not involve combat evaluation. Over 30 flight tests <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> the 40th Flight Test Squadron to gather data on the aircraft's handling characteristics and performance across different load configurations. It was reported that the tank slightly reduced stability in the yaw axis, {{but there was no}} decrease in aircraft tracking performance.|$|E
