5|$|In 446BC, quaestors, administrators <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> {{terms of}} reference, were first elected; {{and the office}} of censor was created to {{administer}} the census in 443BC. However, the creation of the censors also was concurrent with the practice of electing military tribunes with consular authority, which, while open to the plebs, stalled efforts to reform the consulate itself.|$|E

5|$|Tunnelling {{began in}} September 1903. Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> semi-circular windows on the upper floor. Each station was provided with two or four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft.|$|E
5|$|After an {{incomplete}} pass from quarterback Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies {{got their first}} big offensive break {{of the second half}}. On a designed play, Taylor scrambled for 31yards, the largest play in the game for the Hokies. Two successful runs by running back Branden Ore followed, earning the Hokies 23more yards and pushing the offense deep into Boston College territory. A false-start penalty set the Hokie offense back, but on the next play, quarterback Sean Glennon connected <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Eddie Royal on a 24-yard strike for a touchdown. The touchdown and extra point were the first points of the second half and gave Virginia Tech a 2316 lead with 6:30 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|After the show, {{the song}} {{went on to}} chart in several European countries, {{reaching}} number one in Belgium, Iceland and the Netherlands, as well as reaching the top ten in several other countries. The group's self-titled début album, released in May 2014, was also a success in the Netherlands and in other countries. The success of The Common Linnets in the contest was met <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> praise, with many commenting that their triumph was a boost to the musicality and credibility of the contest.|$|E

5|$|After {{the third}} Louisville punt, Virginia Tech took over at its 46-yard line. Unlike the {{previous}} second-quarter possessions, which saw the Tech offense struggle {{to move the}} ball effectively, Tech began its drive with a five-yard rush. After losing seven yards on the next play, Marcus Vick completed a 19-yard pass to tight end Jeff King, driving the Hokies into Louisville territory {{for the first time}} in the quarter. Two plays later, Vick connected <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Justin Harper on a 33-yard pass that resulted in the Hokies' first touchdown of the game. With 4:56 remaining in the first half of the game, Tech trimmed Louisville's lead to 14–10.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using {{polonium}} provided by his colleague Marie Curie, showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in liver, kidney, and testes. More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues. Polonium is indeed an element naturally present in all humans, contributing appreciably to natural background dose, <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech had {{received}} the opening kickoff, Georgia received the ball to open the second half. Stafford was able to connect <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Mario Raley for a 24-yard gain, taking Georgia to the 50-yard line, but Virginia Tech's defense stiffened and Georgia was forced to punt. Pinned at their ten-yard line by the Georgia punt, Virginia Tech went three-and-out and was itself forced to punt.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{at their}} own 20-yard line, the Virginia Tech offense marched down the field. Running back Branden Ore ran 11yards for a first down, and two long passes from Sean Glennon to wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal put the Hokies into scoring position. After failing to gain first downs with short runs, Virginia Tech was forced to use its timeouts to stop the clock and the first half from ending before {{they had a chance}} to score. On a 3rd-and-7 from the Boston College 13-yard line, Glennon finally connected <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> receiver Josh Hyman, who crossed into the end zone for a touchdown. The extra point tied the game, 1616.|$|E
5|$|Buena Vista {{features}} an early architectural style that {{differs from that}} at Motul de San José, consisting of platforms built from unworked stone, <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> front stairways and probably without superstructures. They {{were built in the}} Middle to Late Preclassic periods and then reused in the Late Classic. The differences in style between Buena Vista and Motul probably results from differing epochs of construction.|$|E

The Hearst Corporation, which owns and operates the Houston Chronicle, bought {{the assets of the}} Houston Post—its long-time rival and main competition—when Houston Post ceased operations in 1995. The Houston Post was owned by the family of former Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby of Houston. The only other major publication to serve the city is the Houston Press—a free alternative weekly with a weekly readership of more than 300,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 1st century, ancient tracks across the hills were {{superseded}} by the Roman Fosse Way, from Bath to Ilchester, a branch of which served the Charterhouse lead mines. Stratton-on-the-Fosse and Lydford-on-Fosse, two villages of the Mendips, reflect the arrival of this new road. Much of the high plateau, however, remained uncultivated and unenclosed until the 18th century, resulting in many roads remaining as narrow winding lanes between high banks and hedges or stone walls. Where the tracks had their origins as drovers roads, they typically become open roads <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> verges. The roads tend to follow the line of gorges and valleys, as at Cheddar Gorge.|$|E

5|$|Norwegian army {{units were}} skiing for sport (and prizes) in the 18th century. Starting {{in the latter}} part of the 20th century, {{technique}} evolved from the striding in-track classic technique to include skate-skiing, which occurs on courses that have been groomed <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> lanes for those using the technique. At the same time, equipment evolved from skis and poles that were made of wood and other natural materials to comprising such man-made materials as fiberglass, carbon fiber, and polyethylene plastics.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1738, {{towns in}} New Jersey began issuing liquor {{licenses}} to tavern keepers. Before federal Prohibition in 1919, despite many state liquor statutes, {{the regulation of}} alcoholic beverages in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> variations among municipalities. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the states were again permitted to regulate alcoholic beverages. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which established and granted rulemaking powers to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. The law also established a three-tier alcohol distribution system whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers, who may only sell to retailers, who may only sell to customers.|$|E
5|$|Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, <b>with</b> <b>wide</b> semi-circular windows on the upper floor. They were designed with flat roofs to enable additional storeys to be constructed for commercial occupants, maximising the air rights of the property. Except for Embankment, which had a sloping passageway down to the platforms, each station was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E
