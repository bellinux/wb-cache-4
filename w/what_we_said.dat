25|$|But if we admit, goddesses, then, in {{addition}} to Nerthus, Ostara has the strongest claim to consideration. To <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> on p. 290 I can add some significant facts. The heathen Easter had {{much in common with}} May-feast and the reception of spring, particularly in matter of bonfires. Then, through long ages there seem to have lingered among the people Easter-games so-called, which the church itself had to tolerate : I allude especially to the custom of Easter eggs, and to the Easter tale which preachers told from the pulpit for the people's amusement, connecting it with Christian reminiscences.|$|E

"What {{was said}} in court was a defense {{argument}} made that we put a cloud over the White House, as if, one, we were inventing something or, two, making something up, in order to convince the jury {{that they ought to}} convict. And I think in any case where you feel that someone's making an argument that you are inventing something or improperly casting a cloud on someone, you respond. And we responded fairly and honestly by saying there was a cloud there caused by – not caused by us. And by Mr. Libby obstructing justice and lying about what happened, he had failed to remove the cloud. And sometimes when people tell the truth, clouds disappear. And sometimes they don't. But when you don't know what's happening, that's a problem. And so {{the fact that there was}} a cloud over anyone was not our doing. It was the facts of the case. It was the facts of the case. It was aggravated by Mr. Libby telling falsehoods. And that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>said.</b> We're not going to add to that or subtract to that. That's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> in court, and that's the context in which we said it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice" [...] {{and second}} single [...] "Everybody Knows" [...] were largely ignored by U.S. country radio {{and failed to}} {{penetrate}} the top 35 of the Hot Country Songs chart. [...] In June 2006, Emily Robison noted {{the lack of support}} from other country music performers: [...] "A lot of artists cashed in on being against <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> or what we stood for because that was promoting their career, which was a horrible thing to do. ... A lot of pandering started going on, and you'd see soldiers and the American flag in every video. It became a sickening display of ultra-patriotism." [...] Maines commented, [...] "The entire country may disagree with me, but I don't understand the necessity for patriotism. Why {{do you have to be}} a patriot? About what? This land is our land? Why? You can like where you live and like your life, but as for loving the whole country ... I don't see why people care about patriotism." [...] In Europe, however, the two singles were well received by country radio, peaking at Nos. 13 and 11 respectively and remaining on the European Country Charts for more than 20 weeks each.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 February 2009 (the {{second day}} of the trial) half of the charges against The Pirate Bay were dropped. According to defense lawyer Per Samuelson, [...] "This is a sensation. It is very rare to win half the case in just one and a half days and it is clear the {{prosecutor}} took strong note of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> yesterday". Peter Danowsky, legal counsel for the music companies, stated [...] "It's a largely technical issue that changes nothing in terms of our compensation claims and has no bearing whatsoever on the main case against The Pirate Bay. In fact it simplifies the prosecutor’s case by allowing him to focus on the main issue which is the making available of copyrighted works." [...] The prosecutor was unable to prove that the [...]torrent files brought as evidence were actually using The Pirate Bay's tracker. Furthermore, prosecutor Håkan Roswall did not adequately explain the function of DHT which allows for so-called [...] "trackerless" [...] torrents. These shortcomings in the evidence resulted in prosecutor Håkan Roswall having to drop all charges relating to [...] "assisting copyright infringement", leaving [...] "assisting making available" [...] as the remaining charge. Roswall stated that [...] "everything related to reproduction will be removed from the claim". Sanna Wolk, a doctor in law and researcher at Stockholm University observed that [...] "this is not surprising, at least for those who follow the matter. We knew that The Pirate Bay wasn't making any copies directly".|$|E
