5|$|He {{pulled me}} in {{and pointed to}} the bed. His whole body <b>was</b> <b>trembling</b> violently. He was {{screaming}} there were two Mexicans hiding under his bed with long daggers. To humor him, I looked under the bed and when I rose to assure him there was no one hiding there, he staggered and fell, a dead weight, in my arms. I ran across the hall and called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E
2500|$|Gloria Foster died on September 29, 2001, at age 67. The {{cause of}} her death was diabetes. Though {{she was no longer}} married, her ex-husband, Clarence Williams III, was the one to {{announce}} her death. [...] A memorial was held at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn on October 15, 2001. Many of her close friends and actors and actresses who had performed with her came to attend the funeral. [...] Judith Rutherford James, a well-known producer and good friend who worked with Foster on In White America and Having Our Say played a huge part in the memorial service and helped to oversee that it ran smoothly. [...] Many of the speeches given at the service showed and spoke about how Gloria Foster not only played her part, but also embodied the character, both emotionally and physically. [...] Martin Duberman, the author of In White America, told the audience that, [...] "she embodied it. [...] At the end of the scene each night, there were tears streaming down her face, her body <b>was</b> <b>trembling,</b> but her dignity was intact...Foster had to be covered with blankets in order to calm her shaking".|$|E
2500|$|From Aylesbury {{she went}} on to Beaulieu, where the {{security}} training was capped with a practice mission – in the case of wireless operators, to find a place in a strange city from which they could transmit back to their instructors without being detected by an agent unknown to them who would be shadowing them. The ultimate exercise was the mock Gestapo interrogation, intended to give agents a taste of what might be in store for them if they were captured and some practice in maintaining their cover story. Noor’s escaping officer found her interrogation [...] "almost unbearable" [...] and reported that [...] "she seemed terrified… so overwhelmed she nearly lost her voice", and that afterwards [...] "she <b>was</b> <b>trembling</b> and quite blanched." [...] Her finishing report, which the official historian of F Section found in her personal file long after the war, read: [...] "Not overburdened with brains but has worked hard and shown keenness, apart from some dislike of the security side of the course. She has an unstable and temperamental personality and it is very doubtful whether she is really suited to work in the field." [...] Next to this comment Maurice Buckmaster, the head of F Section, had written in the margin [...] "Nonsense." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{hatred of}} war, he argued in 1936, [...] "can be {{no reason for}} being false to ourselves, {{in the name of}} an aimless amiability that cries ‘peace’ where there is none." [...] And in 1937: [...] "We have not kept {{agreements}} we made; we have made agreements we should not; we have tried to cheat our way to security, and now the security proves a cheat. We have forgotten the wisdom which says that since we cannot foresee where any road will lead in the end, we should stick to the straight and honest one." [...] Despite the prevailing pacifism of the time – and he exchanged views with [...] "passive pacifists" [...] in the correspondence-columns – such sentiments struck a chord. [...] "This is the voice of the England I love," [...] wrote a correspondent from Prague in 1938, [...] "and for whose soul I <b>was</b> <b>trembling</b> when I heard about the welcome given Mr Chamberlain on his return from Munich." [...] Not everyone admired the letters, however: the pro-appeasement Times refused to publish him after 1935 (he described the Editor's office as [...] "an annexe of the German embassy"), and when he condemned the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the democracies' inadequate response, he received abusive and threatening replies from Fascists, including one from Ezra Pound. Lucas put Pound's letter on display at the Cambridge Anti-Fascist Exhibition.|$|E
