5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
25|$|George Lakoff, a {{professor}} of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use logic programming to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained biological neural network. Post modern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> know what they mean and feel that their interlocutors know what they mean. Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as {{to the meaning of}} one’s life should be straightforward.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{research}} regarding happiness and leisure relies on subjective well-being (SWB) as an appropriate measure of happiness. Research has demonstrated {{a wide variety of}} contributing and resulting factors in the relationship between leisure and happiness. These include psychological mechanisms, and the types and characteristics of leisure activities that result in the greatest levels of subjective happiness. Specifically, leisure may trigger five core psychological mechanisms including detachment-recovery from work, autonomy in leisure, mastery of leisure activities, meaning-making in leisure activities, and social affiliation in leisure (DRAMMA). Leisure activities that are physical, relational, and performed outdoors are correlated with greater feelings of satisfaction with free time. Research across 33 different countries shows that individuals <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> strengthen social relationships and work on personal development during leisure time are happier than others. Furthermore, shopping, reading books, attending cultural events, getting together with relatives, listening to music and attending sporting events is associated with higher levels of happiness. Spending time on the internet or watching TV is not associated with higher levels of happiness as compared to these other activities.|$|E

500|$|Xenogears was Yasunori Mitsuda's {{first major}} solo work, as his {{previous}} soundtracks were collaborations with other composers {{with the exception}} of the score to , which never saw an album release. According to Mitsuda, the music of Xenogears belongs to the traditional music genre. Though he first described it as stemming from [...] "a world of [...] own imagining" [...] rather than any specific country, he has also claimed a strong Irish or Celtic music influence. His musical approach for the original soundtrack was to insert Celtic influences into [...] "easy-to-listen-to" [...] pop tracks rather than making either [...] "dense" [...] Celtic music or simple background music. For Creid, he expanded on this theme to create an album of arranged Xenogears music with a more prominent Celtic style. The album contains a mixture of vocal and instrumental tracks, and combines Japanese and Celtic music together in its pieces. The album's title refers to two ideas, with one being [...] "a message to those <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> have lost sight of their ambitions for the flood of information this era surrounds us with" [...] and the other an affirmation to himself that Mitsuda had [...] "rediscovered [...] own path". Mitsuda felt that with this album, he had [...] "discovered the precise mode of musical expression [...] was seeking within" [...] himself and [...] "given form to the belief within [...] heart".|$|E

2500|$|In a 2007 {{article in}} Reason magazine, Hirsi Ali said that Islam, the religion, must be {{defeated}} and that [...] "we {{are at war}} with Islam. And there's no middle ground in wars." [...] She said, [...] "Islam, period. Once it's defeated, it can mutate into something peaceful. It's very difficult to even talk about peace now. They're not interested in peace...There comes a moment when you crush your enemy." [...] She reiterated her position that the problem isn't just a few [...] "rotten apples" [...] in the Islamic community but [...] "I'm saying it's the entire basket." [...] She stated {{that the majority of}} Muslims aren't [...] "moderates" [...] and they must radically alter their religion. Max Rodenbeck, writing in The New York Review of Books, notes that Ali's view of Islam has shifted and [...] "mellowed," [...] as she no longer completely rejects Islam. She now narrowly criticizes what she calls [...] "Medina Muslims", meaning the fundamentalists who envision a regime based on sharia, and who ignore the more inclusive passages of Muhammad's Meccan period, a small minority of Muslims, who are, nevertheless, quite influential among young Muslims, according to Hirsi Ali: [...] "These men, I find them to be far more influential in inspiring and mobilising young men to see the religion of Islam the way they see it, than the way either Imam Faisal says he sees it, or Maajid Nawaz says he sees it." [...] Ayaan Hirsi Ali stated that, in her opinion, [...] "The Christian extremists here, in the United States, who take the Bible and use it to kill people and hurt people, they are the fringe, but unfortunately, what we are seeing in Muslim countries is that the people <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> should be governed under the Sharia Law, are not a fringe. (..) Islam can become a religion of peace, if politics is divorced from religion", and she stated that: [...] "The individual that wants to kill me because I am an apostate of Islam, is inspired to do that from the scripture of Islam, the example of the prophet Mohammed, the clergy that preached to him, and the reward that he will get in the hereafter." ...|$|E

60|$|This is {{the least}} {{intrusive}} approach by which I can touch on a topic that must of necessity be a delicate one; yet which {{may well be a}} difficulty among Latins like yourself. Against this preposterous Prussian upstart we have not only to protect our unity; we have even to protect our quarrels. And the deepest of the reactions or revolts of which I have spoken is the quarrel which (very tragically as I think) has for some hundred years cloven the Christian from the Liberal ideal. It would ill become me, in whose country there is neither such clear doctrine nor such combative democracy, to suppose it can be easy for any of you to close up such sacred wounds. There must still be Catholics <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> can never forgive a Jacobin. There must still be old Republicans who feel that they could never endure a priest. And yet there is something, the mere sight of which should lock them both in an instant alliance. They have only to look northward and hold the third thing, which thinks itself superior to either: the enormous turnip-face of ce type là, as the French say, who conceives that he can make them both like himself and yet remain superior to both.|$|E

6000|$|I do {{not know}} how far Americans are aware of the trend of feeling in Europe at the present time. Both France and Great Britain have a sense of righteousness in this war such as no nation, no people, has ever felt in war before. We know we are {{fighting}} to save all the world from the rule of force and the unquestioned supremacy of the military idea. Few Frenchmen or Englishmen can imagine the war presenting itself to an American intelligence under any other guise. At the invasion of Belgium we were astonished that America did nothing. At the sinking of the Lusitania all Europe looked to America. The British mind contemplates the spectacle of American destroyers acting as bottleholders to German submarines with a dazzled astonishment. [...] "Manila," [...] we gasp. In England we find excuses for America in our own past. In '64 we betrayed Denmark; in '70 we deserted France. The French have not these memories. They do not understand the damning temptations of those <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> are [...] "au-dessus de la melee." [...] They believe they had some share in the independence of America, that there is a sacred cause in republicanism, that there are grounds for a peculiar sympathy between France and the United States in republican institutions. They do not realise that Germany and America have a common experience in recent industrial development, and a common belief in the [...] "degeneracy" [...] of all nations with a lower rate of trade expansion. They do not realise how a political campaign with the slogan of [...] "Peace and a Full Dinner-Pail" [...] looks in the middle west, what an honest, simple, rational appeal it makes there. Atmospheres alter values. In Europe, strung up to tragic and majestic issues, to Europe gripping a gigantic evil in a death struggle, that would seem an inscription worthy of a pigsty. A child in Europe would know now that the context is, [...] "until the bacon-buyer calls," [...] {{and it is difficult to}} realise that adult citizens in America may be incapable of realising that obvious context.|$|E
