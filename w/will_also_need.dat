5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E

Most <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> periodic progestin to regularize menses. Fertility is usually reduced because egg maturation and ovulation is poorly supported by the reduced intra-ovarian steroid production.|$|E

25|$|Recursion, neural {{nets and}} genetic {{algorithms}} are all components of intelligent machines, Kurzweil explains. Beyond algorithms Kurzweil says the machines <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> knowledge. The emergent techniques, neural nets and genetic algorithms, require significant training effort {{above and beyond}} creating the initial machinery. While hand-coded knowledge is tedious and brittle acquiring knowledge through language is extremely complex.|$|E

It is not advisable to have a soldier so engrossed in displays that an enemy can sneak up and hit him {{over the head with}} a rock. One of the challenges of designing modern networked systems is not to overwhelm the users with information. Those users <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> extensive training, with their sensing and synchronization information, to use them properly under combat stress.|$|E

This {{will ensure}} that public bodies are compelled to contribute to te reo's revival and that key agencies are held properly accountable for the strategies they adopt. For instance, targets for the training of te reo teachers must be met, education curricula involving te reo must be approved, and public bodies in districts with a sufficient number and/or proportion of te reo speakers and schools with a certain proportion of Māori students must submit Māori language plans for approval.|$|E
25|$|A recent area of {{research}} is {{in the field of}} bionic lenses. These are visual displays that include built-in electric circuits and light-emitting diodes and can harvest radio waves for their electric power. Bionic lenses can display information beamed from a mobile device overcoming the small display size problem. The technology involves embedding nano and microscale electronic devices in lenses. These lenses <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to have an array of microlenses to focus the image so that it appears suspended in front of the wearer’s eyes. The lens could also serve as a head-up display for pilots or gamers.|$|E

25|$|Prang et al. (2006) {{assessed}} {{the capacity of}} ACH gels to promote directed axonal regrowth in the injured mammalian CNS. The multivalent ions used to create the alginate-based ACH gels were copper ions, whose diffusion into the sodium alginate layers created hexagonally structured anisotropic capillary gels. After precipitation, the entire gel was traversed by longitudinally oriented capillaries. The ACH scaffolds promoted adult NPC survival and highly oriented axon regeneration. This is the first instance of using alginates to produce anisotropic structured capillary gels. Future studies are need to study the long-term physical stability of the ACH scaffolds, because CNS axon regeneration can take many months; however, {{in addition to being}} able to provide long-term support the scaffolds must also be degradable. Of all the biological and synthetic biopolymers investigated by Prang et al. (2006), only agarose-based gels were able to compare with the linear regeneration caused by ACH scaffolds. Future studies <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to investigate whether the ACH scaffolds allow for reinnervation of the target in vivo after a spinal cord injury.|$|E

[...] The ability {{to determine if a}} person has greater susceptibility to an infectious disease will be valuable to determine how to treat the disease if it is present or prevent the person from getting the disease. [...] Several infectious diseases have shown a link between genetics and susceptibility in that families tend to have heritability traits of a disease.|$|E

2500|$|Although Cyprus, which {{joined the}} EU in 2004, is legally bound {{to join the}} Schengen Area, {{implementation}} has been delayed because of the Cyprus dispute.

Because the flight path is determined by the Pluto flyby, and the probe only has 33 kilograms of hydrazine remaining, the object to be visited needs to be within a cone, extending from Pluto, of less than a degree's width. This ruled out any possibility for a flyby of Eris, a trans-Neptunian object comparable in size to Pluto. It <b>will</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to be within 55AU, because beyond 55AU, the communications link will become too weak, and the RTG power output will have decayed significantly enough to hinder observations. Desirable KBOs would be well over [...] in diameter, neutral in color (to compare with the reddish Pluto), and, if possible, have a moon that imparts a wobble.
