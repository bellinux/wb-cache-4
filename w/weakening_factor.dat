40|$|AbstractA damage {{plasticity}} {{model for}} ductile fracture is proposed. This model is established on the {{cylindrical coordinate system}} of principal stress space. Experimental results show that fracture initiation in uncracked ductile solids is sensitive to the hydrostatic pressure and dependent on the Lode angle. The joint effects of pressure and Lode angle define a fracture envelope in principal stress space. Plastic deformation induced damage is calculated by an integral of the damage rate measured at current loading and deformation status {{with respect to the}} fracture envelope. A power law damage rule is proposed to characterize the nonlinearity in damage accumulation. A damage-related <b>weakening</b> <b>factor</b> is adopted to describe the material deterioration.

The accelerations of cement hydration and slag reaction at elevated temperatures are modeled by Arrhenius law. Second, the gel-space ratios of hardening concrete are calculated using reaction degrees of cement and slag. Using a modified Powers’ gel-space ratio strength theory, the strength of slag blended concrete is evaluated considering both strengthening <b>factors</b> and <b>weakening</b> <b>factors</b> involved in strength development process.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to describe the implementation of KTSP {{in the teaching of}} English in SMK Negeri 2 Surakarta. The research was carried out from January to April 2010. It is a qualitative research in the form of naturalistic study. The object of the research is the teaching and learning activities of English in SMK Negeri 2 Surakarta. The data were gained from several techniques including non-participant observation, in-depth interview, and document analysis. In analyzing the data, the researcher applied the constant comparative method as a means to derive the theory, i. e, by comparing incidents applicable to each category, integrating categories and their properties, delimitating the theory, and writing theory. The implementation of KTSP has some supporting factors from the syllabus and creativities of teachers’ teaching strategy. However, the findings reveal that the implementation of KTSP has some <b>weakening</b> <b>factors,</b> too. Those are from adaption of new curriculum and teachers’ character. Dealing with its supporting factors of KTSP, the teachers have rights to arrange their syllabus which are appropriate to the school’s need and the condition and the teachers are free to improve and apply any teaching strategy which is the most appropriate and effective for the students to learn. The <b>weakening</b> <b>factors</b> of implementing KTSP is that it needs time to make adaptation since it is as a new curriculum and the teachers’ point of views toward KTSP are not easy to change due to their perspective of previous curriculum. Anyhow, there some impacts of the implementation of KTSP to the instructional process in SMK Negeri 2 Surakarta, to the teachers’ teaching strategy, and the students’ learning intensity. The research finding of this study imply that the implementation of KTSP in teaching English increases the intensity of student to learn. Therefore, it is recommended that (1) the teacher should not only increase their communicative competence, but also have to change their {{point of view of the}} KTSP implementation.

Tomicus are monogamous and univoltine species that develop on pines, except for one species that feeds on Picea. Their life cycle alternates between reproductive attacks on stem and sexual maturation in shoots. A species identification key, the phylogenetic tree, and the host ranges are presented. Only the biology of three European species and one Asian species is known sufficiently in detail. They are associated with a large diversity of organisms under the bark of the host tree and whenever possible their role is discussed. They are generally unable to overcome the resistance of healthy trees and thus develop on very weak or recently killed trees, but they can cause considerable damage to shoots, thus sometimes becoming a <b>weakening</b> <b>factor.</b> Factors affecting population abundances and host susceptibility are discussed.

However, Mohr-Coulomb criterion is restricted to the description of rock mass. To overcome its shortcomings, this paper combined Hoek-Brown criterion and limit equilibrium method and proposed an equation for calculating the safety factor of slope with limit equilibrium method in Hoek-Brown criterion through equivalent cohesive strength and the friction angle. Moreover, this paper investigates the impact of Hoek-Brown parameters on the safety factor of slope, which reveals that there is linear relation between equivalent cohesive strength and <b>weakening</b> <b>factor</b> D. However, there are nonlinear relations between equivalent cohesive strength and Geological Strength Index (GSI), the uniaxial compressive strength of intact rock σci, and the parameter of intact rock mi.

But in conifers, it usually takes several years to fully restore needle mass and assimilation capacity. Aims - This study aims to evaluate whether leaf shedding sustainably damages conifers or if these trees still {{have the ability to}} recover from drought with respect to their foliage and wood formation. Methods - An irrigation experiment was established in a mature dry forest to test the growth reactions of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) differing in crown transparency (low, medium, high) to a drought release by irrigation in comparison with equivalent control trees growing under naturally dry conditions on the same site. Results - Drought and high crown transparency had a combined negative effect on radial tree growth: Control trees with medium to high crown transparencies showed a substantially shorter growth period and a long-lasting growth depression in response to the severe summer drought in 2003. However, all trees benefited from irrigation, irrespective of their crown status, and immediately increased growth in response to irrigation.

Welfare chauvinism {{refers to the}} attitude that natives want to exclude immigrants from welfare state benefits. We analyse factors that are identified in two different strands of literature: studies of attitudes toward immigrants and welfare state studies. Namely egalitarian attitudes, negative stereotypes and economic circumstances. This paper also studies the direct effect of civic and ethnic nationhood endorsement on welfare chauvinism, {{as well as its}} moderating role on the previously mentioned factors. Civic nationhood is due to its inclusive nature expected to either <b>weaken</b> <b>factors</b> that are positively associated with welfare chauvinism, or strengthen the ones that have a negative association. The reverse applies for ethnic nationhood. We apply data of 2282 native Dutch respondents. Hypotheses are tested by means of a multi-group model, based on different types of nationhood endorsement. Results show that some factors (e. g. negative stereotypes, egalitarianism) do indeed directly explain welfare chauvinism. Stereotypes are associated with more welfare chauvinism, whereas egalitarianism is associated with less. In addition, civic and ethnic nationhood are in some instances significant moderators: the moderations of civic nationhood on negative perceived economic development and ethnic nationhood on egalitarianism have a negative association with welfare chauvinism...|$|R

40|$|The {{fracture}} initiation in ductile {{materials is}} governed by the damaging process along the plastic loading path. A new damage plasticity model for ductile fracture is proposed. Experimental results show that fracture initiation in uncracked ductile solids is sensitive to the hydrostatic pressure and {{is dependent on the}} Lode angle. The damage plasticity model is established on a "cylindrical decomposition" system accounting for the pressure dependence, Lode angle dependence and the non-linear damage rule. Two internal variables are adopted to quantify the evolution of material properties. One is the plastic strain and the other is so-called damage variable. The joint effects of pressure and Lode angle define a fracture envelope in the principal stress space. Plastic deformation induced damage is expressed by an integral of the damage rate measured at current loading and deformation status with respect to the fracture envelope. A non-linear damage rule is proposed to characterize the damage accumulation with respect to the plastic strain. Furthermore, a damage related <b>weakening</b> <b>factor</b> is adopted to describe the material deterioration. (cont.) Aluminum alloy 2024 -T 351 is selected and a series of experiments have been conducted to determine the necessary material parameters for the description of the mechanical and damage properties.

These simulations illustrate realistic crack patterns.

40|$|The {{subject of}} F. Bastien's lecture given to Polish {{students}} within the framwork of Tempus cooperation is the procedure {{of controlling the}} conformity the of laws with the constitution. Although the idea of such a control {{was born in the}} USA {{at the beginning of the}} 19 th century, it was introduced in Europe only in the 20 th century. The first part of the article concerns the development of constitutional justice in Europe, from the first Constitutional Court in Austria till the latest legal changes after 1989. At the moment all written constitutions in the European states provide the control of conformity to the constitution of laws stated by parliaments or by special courts. The second part of the article focuses on the French system. According to the French Constitution of 1958, the special court, named Conseil Constitutionnel, is authorised to control the contents of laws (but not decrees, which are controlled by Conseil d'Etat). The procedure can take place only after the vote of the Parliament and before the promulgation of law by President: it is on a priori controlling system. The main part contains the analysis of Conseil Constitutionnel's decisions. As the Constitution of 1958 does not include many specific rules concerning civil rights, the court decided to base its decisions on the Declaration of Civil and Human Rights of 1789 and on the "republican laws". They are both referred to as "especially valuable for the French People" in the Preamble of the Constitution. In this way, the court began - in 1972 - to control the laws not only in their form, but also taking into account their contents. Since then the Conseil Constitutionnel has awarded many decisions precising the notion of liberty, of right to property, of social order and so on. The last part of the lecture contains an evaluation of the development of constitutional control of laws: some scepticism is uttered about the fact, that it i. e. the Parliament is not the representation of nation, but it is the lawyers and clerks who - as the highest authority - decide whether the law id admissible and in conformity with constitution.

As in former editions, tourism is analyzed from different theoretical approaches, sociology, social psychology anthropology, geography, ecology and management - planning - stating once again that several areas are needed for a comprehensive understanding of this social phenomenon. The most important tourism actors can be identified in the articles: public sector, in charge of law and administration in tourism, private sector, in charge of investments in facilities and services, tourist themselves and, even shortly, also some locals at tourism destinations. The role of government in tourism organization is evidenced in Sagi, Ruschmann and Ramos. Their report on a program developed in a Brazilian city shows that a correct planning project can benefit both, tourism management and managerial institutions. This is a detailed document on successful planning steps and will certainly be a precious instrument for future projects. Hocayen-da-Silva and Teixeira analyze hotel business entrepreneurial vision at Curitiba City, Paraná State, Brazil. Two cases are presented, under the framework of organizational management theories and paradigms. No strategic alliances were found between local entrepreneurs and big national and international chains and the authors conclude {{that this is a}} <b>weakening</b> <b>factor</b> for creating sustainable competitive advantages. Delphino focuses pressure in natural and cultural heritage issues in a seaside city at the northern part of São Paulo State. This article studies tourism within a broader scenery where also a port and the national oil refinery (Petrobrás) cause environmental problems. Ethnography is used for field research and theoretical frame includes management (planning), geography (mainly ecology), anthropology and urban planning. Only with such a diversity of tools can the researcher understand the complex relationships and interests which take {{place at the same time}} and space, including local land speculators. Noteworthily, in this article the role of tourism can be read otherwise. Displacement of tourism from the historic center to distant  beaches  lead to  real state speculation on the place. As former articles focus on what John Tribe termed as propositional knowledge, Melo´s article focuses on Tribe´s processual knowledge. His research is on psycho social processes involving the tourist gaze, the gaze of one who is abroad but brings his everyday life and his motivations, sometimes in contradictory ways. The researcher also considers tourism as being both an individual and a social action, because sometimes people tour as a social obligation compelled by consumption predicaments. Figueiredo, Pereira and Almeida write a conference report on a high level seminar held at Belem City, Pará State, where archaeological itineraries in Brazil were presented. These are new possibilities for cultural tourism based on sustainability and responsibility paradigms, for selected tourists who can appreciate the richness of Brazilian heritage. Finally, Rezende brings a detailed review on a book produced after the experiences of the Research Group Tourism, Land and Culture, under the coordination of Luzia Neide Coriolano. The book presents a new management model for tourism, based on local  production arrangements and solidarity economy, addressed to conscious tourists who want to be out of commercial circuits and know different realities. This turns into solidarity tourism experiences which make possible that the money brought by tourists does go to those who need it most. Margarita Barretto Sênia Basto...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. From a {{point of}} very little {{knowledge}} about illicit drugs in the 1980 s, Ghana has evolved {{over the last three}} decades into a major transhipment point in the global supply and demand of narcotics. Apart from the resultant rise in Ghanaians involved in trafficking activities and the consumption of narcotics, the prevalence of the phenomenon has suggested a growing interface between the country’s emerging political culture and drug trafficking trends. Taking advantage of the recent provenance of Ghana’s experience, this study investigates the cause-effect relationships in the onset and impact of drug trafficking, as a transnational security challenge to statehood in Africa. Following a thorough analysis of available quantitative and qualitative data collected from multiple primary and secondary sources, the study establishes the centrality of state weaknesses in the cause-effect relationships surrounding the onset and existence of drug trafficking in Ghana. It finds that the existence of Ghana in the confluence of the interaction between internal and external factors made it vulnerable to the activities of criminal networks exploring new routes to markets in the global North. Upon emerging, traffickers have sustained the country’s weaknesses, worsened them in some cases and also initiated new forms through narco-corruption, intimidation, infiltration and state capture. The study argues, among others, that the rise in drug trafficking, and organised criminality more broadly, is more of a symptom of existing weaknesses and structural fault lines in the state than an initiator of state weaknesses by itself. The onset and existence of transnational organised criminality is thus an important indicator of the existence of certain forms of state weaknesses as well as <b>weakening</b> <b>factors</b> requiring responses. The transnationalisation of security challenges in a given region requires the prior existence of a regional weakness complex.

This consideration leads to a stringent limit on the R parity and B violating Yukawa coupling of the superpotential operator U^c_i D^c_j D^c_k as λ"_ 112 < 10 ^- 15 (m_ 3 / 2 /eV) for a light gravitino, and λ"_ 112 < 10 ^- 15 (F_a/ 10 ^ 10 GeV) for a light DFSZ axino. For hadronic axino, the constraint is <b>weakened</b> by the <b>factor</b> of 10 ^ 3. Comment: 8 pages, RevTe...|$|R
