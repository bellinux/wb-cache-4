50|$|Direct {{sampling}} of volcanic gas sampling is often {{done by a}} method involving an evacuated flask with caustic solution, first used by Robert W. Bunsen (1811-1899) and later refined by the German chemist Werner F. Giggenbach (1937-1997), dubbed Giggenbach-bottle. Other methods include collection in evacuated empty containers, in flow-through glass tubes, in gas <b>wash</b> <b>bottles</b> (cryogenic <b>scrubbers),</b> on impregnated filter packs and on solid adsorbent tubes.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{previous}} work carried out between 2000 and 2002 {{has shown that}} the use of an XAD 2 sorbent in the case of PCB sampling tends to under-estimate PCB concentrations, specially when PCB concentrations are low (< 100 u. g/m 3). The objective of this new study was to compare PCBs sampling efficiencies for several methods, at lower concentrations. First, this study consisted in the comparison of 3 sampling methods: <b>washing</b> <b>bottles</b> filled with heptane, adsorption on XAD 2 (such as used for PCDD/F samplings according to EN 1948) and adsorption on polyurethane foam (PUF). Results have shown that <b>washing</b> <b>bottles</b> filled with heptane are far more efficient than XAD 2 or PUF adsorbtion.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Improper <b>wash</b> of reused <b>bottles</b> in {{beer and}} soft drink {{production}} plants {{can result in}} high cost of production and potentially dangerous health hazard to customers. It is shown that when machines are used {{over a period of}} time, they are not able to perform at their best, for which there are many root causes. This paper developed a mathematical model to predict and monitor the amount of Dirt Defect and Caustic Residue Defect in a <b>washed</b> <b>bottle</b> in a beverage bottling company. In this work, a 23 factorial design is applied to investigate the effect of Pressure, Temperature and Caustic soda concentration, on two <b>washing</b> responses namely: <b>bottles</b> with Caustic Residue Defect and bottles with Dirt Defect.

40|$|Bench-scale {{studies with}} mercury {{contaminated}} soil were {{performed at the}} SRTC to determine the optimum waste loading obtainable in the glass product without sacrificing durability, leach resistance, and processability. Vitrifying this waste stream also required offgas treatment for the capture of the vaporized mercury. Four soil glasses with slight variations in composition were produced, which were capable of passing the Product Consistency Test (PCT) and the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). The optimum glass feed composition contained 60 weight percent soil and produced a soda-lime-silica glass when melted at 1, 350 C. The glass additives used to produce this glass were 24 weight percent Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } and 16 weight percent CaCO{sub 3 }. Volatilized mercury released during the vitrification process was released to the proposed mercury collection system. The proposed mercury collection system consisted of quartz and silica tubing with a Na{sub 2 }S <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> followed by a NaOH <b>wash</b> <b>bottle.</b> Once in the system, the volatile mercury would pass through the <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> containing Na{sub 2 }S, {{where it would be}} converted to Hg{sub 2 }S, which is a stable form of mercury. However, attempts to capture the volatilized mercury in a Na{sub 2 }S solution <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> were not as successful as anticipated. Maximum mercury captured was only about 3. 24 % of the mercury contained in the feed. Mercury capture efforts then shifted to condensing and capturing the volatilized mercury. These attempts were much more successful at capturing the volatile mercury, with a capture efficiency of 34. 24 % when dry ice was used to pack the condenser. This captured mercury was treated on a mercury specific resin after digestion of the volatilized mercury...|$|R
