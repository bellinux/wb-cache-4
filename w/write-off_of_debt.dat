These new measures would allow Greece {{to get an}} extra instalment of international loans, a second bailout package, that would prevent a sovereign default and they would make possible the partial <b>write-off</b> <b>of</b> Greek <b>debt,</b> the so-called private sector involvement (PSI).

Moreover, bank loan growth is actually higher than reported by the official loan statistics, because they are distorted by the <b>write-offs</b> <b>of</b> bad <b>debt.</b> However, there are several simple ways in which the government can quickly accelerate bank loan growth...|$|R

The incident led to an emergency upgrade of the Hungarian Air Force, which obtained 28 new MiG-29B fighter jets in exchange for a <b>write-off</b> <b>of</b> ex-Soviet state <b>debt.</b> The Hungarian government also invited NATO's E-3 AWACS planes to patrol over the Lake Balaton area, keeping a constant radar eye on the Balkan civil war theatre.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{sovereign}} debt relief {{in a long-term}} perspective. We quantify the relief achieved through default and restructuring in two distinct samples: 1920 - 1939, focusing on the defaults on official (government to government) debt in advanced economies after World War I; and 1978 - 2010, focusing on emerging market debt crises with private external creditors. Debt relief was substantial in both eras, averaging 21 % of GDP in the 1930 s and 16 % of GDP in recent decades. We then analyze the aftermath <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> relief and conduct a difference-in-differences analysis around the synchronous war <b>debt</b> defaults <b>of</b> 1934 and the Baker and Brady initiatives of the 1980 s/ 1990 s. The economic landscape of debtor countries improves significantly after debt relief operations, but only if these involve <b>debt</b> <b>write-offs.</b> Softer forms <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> relief, such as maturity extensions and interest rate reductions, are not generally followed by higher economic growth or improved credit ratings...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the links between implementing ISA 540 and mitigating the practice of smoothing reported net earnings using <b>write-offs</b> <b>of</b> accounts receivable and inventory by reporting entities in Poland. The research question stems from the previous analysis carried out by the author in which evidence was provided that reporting entities in Poland in the period 2000 – 2010 effectively used <b>write-offs</b> <b>of</b> accounts receivable and inventory in order to mitigate fluctuations of reported net earnings. This paper provides evidence that before implementing ISA 540 reporting entities used <b>write-offs</b> <b>of</b> receivables and inventory for income smoothing in effective manner, however in the period after implementing the standard (2009 – 2014) no link was observed between the write-offs and reduced fluctuations of reported net earnings. The research has been carried out using Wilcoxon signed-rank test used to check equality of medians of mean deviations of net earnings before <b>write-offs</b> <b>of</b> receivables and inventory and mean deviations of net earnings after write-offs. For the period before implementing ISA 540 there are grounds to reject the hypothesis of equality of medians of mean deviations of net earnings, however in the post-adoption period there is no justification to reject the hypothesis of equality of medians. The research provides evidence of positive impact of ISA 540 mitigating the processes of accounting earnings management. The indicated regularity does not apply to banks, because within this group of companies we have not observed the use <b>of</b> <b>write-offs</b> <b>of</b> loan receivables {{in order to reduce the}} variability of net earnings before implementing ISA 540 and in the period following the implementation of the standard...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis deals with the way of {{recording}} in accountancy, valuation and categorization of receivables.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} further {{empirical evidence}} {{on the relationship between}} taxes and financial reporting by focusing on accounting decisions to write-offs equity investments. The analysis is based on panel data for Italian companies. In the period 1998 - 2006 the Italian corporate income tax has been reformed several times. In particular the tax deductibility <b>of</b> <b>write-offs</b> <b>of</b> equity investment was repealed in 2004. The paper exploits the ensuing high cross-sectional and times series variation in the marginal tax rate to identify tax effects. The econometric analysis delivers strong evidence that taxes affect the probability <b>of</b> <b>write-offs.</b> In contrast {{there is no evidence that}} taxes affect the magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>write-offs.</b> The paper also tests for the existence of a trade-off between tax minimization and non tax costs such as financial reporting costs and agency costs. Surprisingly, the evidence of such trade-off is rather weak. corporate taxation, <b>write-offs</b> <b>of</b> equity investments, financial reporting, tax planning...|$|R

25|$|The {{market was}} forced to restructure. An ambitious plan {{entitled}} Reconstruction and Renewal was produced in 1995, with proposals for separating the ongoing Lloyd's from its past losses. Liability for all pre-1993 business was to be compulsorily transferred (by RITC) into a special vehicle named Equitas (which would require {{the approval of the}} UK's Department of Trade & Industry (DTI)) at a cost of around $21bn. Many Names faced large bills, but the plan also provided for a settlement of their disputes, a tax on recent profits, and the <b>write-off</b> <b>of</b> nearly $5bn <b>of</b> <b>debts,</b> skewed towards those with the most severe losses. The plan was debated at length, modified, and eventually strongly supported by the Association of Lloyd's Members (ALM) and most leaders of Names' action groups. Money was raised in many ways, including the sale and leaseback of the Lloyd's building, and a tax on future business. Individual offers were accepted by 95 per cent of Lloyd's names. The past liabilities of all Names were transferred to Equitas in September 1996.|$|R
