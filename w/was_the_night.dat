However, the failure of the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain in 1940 ended hopes for an early victory and forced the continuance of hostilities with the British Empire. Faced with German domination of the continent, the only weapon the British could use to exert immediate military pressure on Germany <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> bombing operations of RAF Bomber Command.|$|E

25|$|Together {{with the}} arrival of new Italian-speaking migrants, this led to strong dissatisfaction among South Tyroleans, which culminated in {{terrorist}} acts perpetrated by the Befreiungsausschuss Südtirol (BAS–Committee for the liberation of South Tyrol).

One of the most notable attacks <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night</b> of Fire, when the South Tyrolean Liberation Committee destroyed a number of electricity pylons. The second phase was bloodier, costing 21 lives (among them four activists and 15 Italian policemen and soldiers), four of them during a BAS ambush at Cima Vallona, province of Belluno, on 25 June 1967.|$|E

25|$|Ethel's {{original}} character outline {{states that}} {{she was born in}} 1920. However, during the series this was altered to 1916 and for many years her birthday fell on 19 February. When Ethel came back to Walford to die in 2000, she revealed to Dot that she had lied about her age for many years. She was actually 86, not 85 (the character was aged two years, in a dramatic technique known as SORAS making her birthday fall in 1914). Ethel died on what she claimed <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of her 86th birthday in September 2000, and although Dot knew very well her birthday was in February, she organised a party at Ethel's request to give her one last 'birthday' before she died. 19 February is also the day that EastEnders was first broadcast.|$|E
25|$|After Ryan {{was sentenced}} to Pentridge Prison, he was placed in B Division where he met fellow {{prisoner}} Peter John Walker (who was serving a 12-year sentence for bank robbery). When Ryan was informed {{that his wife was}} seeking a divorce, he made a plan to escape from prison. Walker decided to go along with him. Ryan planned to take himself and his family and flee to Brazil, which did not have an extradition treaty with Australia. At around 2:07pm on Sunday, 19 December 1965, Ryan and Walker put the escape plan into effect. As prison officers were taking turns attending a staff Christmas party in the officers' mess hall, Ryan and Walker scaled a five-metre prison wall with the aid of two wooden benches, a hook and blankets. Running {{along the top of the}} wall to a prison watch tower, they overpowered prison warder Helmut Lange and took his M1 carbine rifle. Ryan threatened Lange and demanded he pull the lever to open the prison tower gate. Lange, however, deliberately pulled the wrong lever. Ryan, Walker and Lange then proceeded down the steps to the tower gate, but it would not open. At the bottom of the stairs <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> officers' lodge. Warder Fred Brown was returning from lunch to relieve Lange when he was confronted by the escapees. Brown did not resist. When Ryan realised Lange had tricked him, he jabbed the rifle into Lange's back and marched him back up the stairs so Lange could pull the correct lever to open the tower gate. The two escapees then exited through the gate into the prison car park. To the escapees' dismay there were only two cars in the car park and one had a flat tyre.|$|E

Among the 27 songs selected for the Voyager Golden Record, [...] "Dark <b>Was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night,</b> Cold Was the Ground" [...] was included because, according to Sagan, [...] "Johnson's song concerns a situation he faced many times: nightfall with no place to sleep. Since humans appeared on Earth, the shroud of night has yet to fall without touching a man or woman in the same plight". Johnson's recording of [...] "Dark <b>Was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night,</b> Cold Was the Ground" [...] was also selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry, which selects recordings annually that are deemed [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E
500|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in Johnson's music began in the 1960s, following his inclusion on Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, and by {{the efforts of the}} blues guitarist Reverend Gary Davis. Johnson's work has become more accessible through compilation albums such as Blind Willie Johnson 1927–1930 and The Complete Willie Johnson, both spearheaded by Charters. As a result, Johnson is credited {{as one of the most}} influential practitioners of the blues, and his slide guitar playing, particularly on his hymn [...] "Dark <b>Was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night,</b> Cold Was the Ground", is highly acclaimed. Other recordings by Johnson include [...] "Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed", [...] "It's Nobody's Fault but Mine", and [...] "John the Revelator".|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} aspect of Johnson's recordings was his mastering of the bottleneck guitar technique, which was immediately influential on Robert Johnson and Howlin' Wolf. He punctuated his selections with tonal control and sense of timing, often using the guitar {{as a part of}} his harmonic phrasing, particularly on [...] "Dark <b>Was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night,</b> Cold Was the Ground". By most accounts, including one by the reputable blues guitarist Blind Willie McTell, Johnson used a knife as a slide, but other claims by Harris and the bluesman Thom Shaw also state he used a thumb pick or brass ring on his recordings. The music historian Steve Halt said of Johnson's style: [...] "opposed to other bottleneck artists he varies the speed of his vibrato drastically, often speeding up as he slides into a note. He {{is also one of the}} few bottleneck artists with the ability to consistently sound 3 or 4 discreet melody notes upon striking a string once, a skill that reflects uncanny left-handed strength, accuracy and agility".|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Johnson began his {{recording}} career, {{he was a}} well-known evangelist with a [...] "remarkable technique and {{a wide range of}} songs", as noted by the blues historian Paul Oliver. On December 3, 1927, Johnson was assembled along with Billiken Johnson and Coley Jones at a temporary studio that talent scout Frank Buckley Walker had set up in the Deep Ellum neighborhood in Dallas to record for Columbia Records. In the ensuing session, Johnson played six selections, 13 takes in total, and was accompanied by Willie B. Harris on his first recording, [...] "I Know His Blood Can Make Me Whole". Among the other songs Johnson recorded in Dallas were [...] "Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed", [...] "It's Nobody's Fault but Mine", [...] "Mother's Children Have a Hard Time", [...] "Dark <b>Was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night,</b> Cold Was the Ground", and [...] "If I Had My Way I'd Tear the Building Down". He was compensated with $50 per [...] "usable" [...] side—a substantial amount for the period—and a bonus to forfeit royalties from sales of the records.|$|E
500|$|The first {{songs to}} be {{released}} were [...] "I Know His Blood Can Make Me Whole" [...] and [...] "Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed", on Columbia's popular 14000 Race series. Johnson's debut became a substantial success, as 9,400 copies were pressed, more than the latest release by one of Columbia's most established stars, Bessie Smith, and an additional pressing of 6,000 copies followed. His fifth recorded song, [...] "Dark <b>Was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Night,</b> Cold Was the Ground", eventually the B-side of Johnson's second release, best exemplifies his unique guitar playing in open D tuning for slide. For the session, Johnson substituted a knife or penknife for the bottleneck and—according to Harris—he played with a thumb pick. His melancholy, indescribable humming of the guitar part creates the impression of [...] "unison moaning", a style of singing hymns that is common in southern African-American church choirs. In 1928, the blues critic Edward Abbe Niles praised Johnson in his column for The Bookman, emphasizing his [...] "violent, tortured, and abysmal shouts and groans, and his inspired guitar playing".|$|E

500|$|In the {{remaining}} 17 weeks of war the Jagdwaffe struggled to recover sufficiently from the 1 January operation to remain an effective force. In strategic terms, German historian Werner Girbig wrote, [...] "Operation Bodenplatte {{amounted to a}} total defeat". The exhausted German units were {{no longer able to}} mount an effective defence of German air space during Operation Plunder and Operation Varsity, the Allied crossing of the Rhine River, or the overall Western Allied invasion of Germany. Subsequent operations were insignificant as a whole, and could not challenge Allied air supremacy. The only service in the Luftwaffe capable of profitable sorties <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> fighter force. In the last six weeks of the war the Luftwaffe was to lose another 200 pilots killed. Girbig wrote, [...] "it was not until the autumn of 1944 that the German fighter forces set foot down the sacrificial path; and it was the controversial Operation Bodenplatte that dealt this force a mortal blow and sealed its fate. What happened from then on {{was no more than a}} dying flicker".|$|E
