500|$|Elle first {{appears in}} the episode [...] "Fight or Flight" [...] searching for Peter in Ireland. Peter has no {{recollection}} of his past and is staying with the owner of Wandering Rocks Pub, Ricky. Elle questions Rick about Peter's whereabouts and when he pretends not to know Peter, she kills him with a large bolt of electricity on her <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Later on, during a telephone conversation with Bob Bishop, her father and Company head, she dismisses the murder as trivial and insists she can find Peter.

2500|$|The {{crossbar}} {{from the}} goalposts which {{stood in the}} north end zone of Tiger Stadium from 1955 through 1984 is now mounted above the door which leads from LSU's locker room onto the playing field.

2500|$|It is Kitty who {{pulls away}} and Laura is assailed by a panic. She feels {{she will be}} {{perceived}} as the predator in this astounding development, and indeed [...] "Laura and Kitty agree, silently, that this is true." [...] She also realizes her son, Richie, has been watching everything. However Kitty is already on her <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> her momentary lapse of character wiped from memory. Nothing is mentioned of the kiss, she brushes off Laura's continued overtures of help politely, and leaves. Laura's world has been jolted. It is too much. It is like a Virginia Woolf novel, too full. Attempting {{to return to the}} world she knows, she attends to her son and, without hesitation, dumps her freshly made cake in the bin. She will make another cake, a better one.|$|E
50|$|However, Pulis {{was on his}} <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> exit <b>door</b> very soon, {{returning}} to Stoke {{to make way for}} Ian Holloway to join the club.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{it would do}} us small good. This {{seems to have been}} built for a regular prison, and I suppose <b>the</b> only <b>way</b> <b>out</b> is through <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and that is {{securely}} fastened." ...|$|R
500|$|Jay-Z was {{initially}} skeptical about signing Rihanna after he felt [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] {{was too big}} for her, saying [...] "when a song is that big, it's hard [...] to come back from. I don't sign songs, I sign artists". The audition resulted in Rihanna signing a six-album record deal with Def Jam Recordings in February 2005, {{on the same day}} of the audition, with Jay-Z saying [...] "There's only two <b>ways</b> <b>out.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> after you sign this deal. Or through this window ...", meaning {{that he was not going}} to let her leave without signing a record deal.|$|R
2500|$|Having {{walked back}} home from Richard's, Clarissa Vaughan enters her apartment. Her partner Sally, a TV producer, {{is on her}} <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to a lunch meeting with a film star. Suddenly, left alone, Clarissa feels unmoored. She feels as if her home and its comforts are trivial {{in light of the}} {{impending}} death of her closest friend Richard; compared to a time when she felt most alive and had everything to hope for. Her apartment is just as much a [...] "realm of the dead" [...] as Richard's. Like the other characters in Cunningham's novel she questions the value of her present life and whether it isn't a negation via triviality of the life she could lead. Then the feeling moves on. Clarissa is disappointed but relieved to find her life is her own and that she wants no other. She holds onto the prospect of preparing Richard's party as affirmation and begins arrangements.|$|E
2500|$|Next, Karen learns {{through the}} French {{newspapers}} that Max has committed suicide, and Naomi arrives in London, where she explains {{the circumstances surrounding}} his death: after receiving his letter and informing Mme Fisher of his intentions, Naomi is quarantined by her mother, who intends to keep Naomi from seeing Max and removing any possibility of spoiling Max's chance for happiness with Karen. Max does visit Naomi, however, speaking to her of the failure inherent in his relationship with Karen: [...] "'What she and I are' he said, 'is outside life; we shall fail.'" [...] He is visibly distressed as Mme Fisher returns to the salon. [...] Naomi returns to her upstairs bedroom. There is a commotion in the salon, and Naomi returns to find her mother strewn across the sofa and blood on the floor. Max has cut his own wrist, making his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> into the street, and dying in an alley. In the following days, Mme Fisher will observe that [...] "it was the commendation he could not bear. I was commending him when he took his knife out." [...] At {{the end of the}} section, Karen reveals to Naomi that she is pregnant with Max's child, and will leave for Germany to try to avoid any scandal.|$|E
50|$|Jackson {{wakes up}} in the {{aftermath}} of an orgy and heads to his job at his friend Sam's alternative record store. At the store he gets a call from Sonny Spike.

6000|$|Dan felt {{a rush of}} {{tenderness}} in {{his heart}} {{at the sound of the}} kind, humbugging little voice. [...] "No, thank you, Mrs. Pasmer, I couldn't stay, thank you. I--I thank you very much. I--good-bye, Mrs. Pasmer." [...] He wrung her hand, and found his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> apartment <b>door,</b> leaving her to clear up the mystery of his flight and his broken words as she could.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave me a}} {{friendly}} smack on the shoulder which nearly knocked me down--relapsed, the instant after, into her leaden stolidity of look and manner---and led <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> by <b>the</b> front <b>door.</b> I heard her hoarse chuckling laugh as she locked the gate behind me. My star was at last in the ascendant! In {{one and the same}} day I had found my way into the confidence of Ariel and Ariel's master.|$|R
40|$|JIM {{pushed his}} <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> back <b>door</b> as <b>the</b> cold March wind slammed against the North {{side of the}} house and tried to hold him in. Immediately the driving snowflakes began to find little gaps around the collar of his blanket- lined denim jacket. He hunched his shoulders, flipped up the collar, and gave a little tug at his snug {{lumberjack}} 2 Ì† 7 s cap as he struggled to pull on his fivebuckle overshoes [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Marcone {{shows up}} in Dresden's office. He offers to hire Dresden as his {{security}} adviser, for protection. Dresden refuses. On his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> Marcone says that these killings are connected to Harley MacFinn and his Northwest Passage Project. Dresden summons the demon Chaunzaggoroth {{in order to get}} information, exchanging one more part of his name for information about Harley MacFinn. Before Dresden can check on Harley MacFinn, Lt. Murphy arrests him. Kim Delaney's shredded body is found in MacFinn's apartment next to a summoning circle.|$|E
5000|$|Minnie Mouse {{is calling}} Mickey {{to remind him}} about their date, which he has totally {{forgotten}} about while sleeping on the couch. With the help of Pluto, Mickey gets dressed for the date, but loses the tickets to the show on his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Pluto takes the tickets to Mickey, after his suit has been ruined by water from a passing car, and then Minnie arrives and tells him he has a cute costume for the [...] "hard times" [...] costume party.|$|E
60|$|Lady Janet listened absently. There was {{a certain}} {{expression}} in her eyes which suggested to Julian that her mind was busy with some project of its own. He stopped as he passed Mercy, on his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> by <b>the</b> billiard-room <b>door.</b> It cost him a hard effort to control the contending emotions which the mere act of looking at her now awakened in him. His heart beat fast, his voice sank low, as he spoke to her.|$|R
60|$|And {{before the}} others could {{appreciate}} his intention he {{snatched up the}} dagger, sprang at <b>the</b> other <b>door</b> at <b>the</b> {{lower end of the}} passage, burst it open, bolt and all, and confronted Bruno in his dressing-room. As he did so, old Parkinson tottered in his wavering <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and caught sight of the corpse lying in the passage. He moved shakily towards it; looked at it weakly with a working face; then moved shakily back into the dressing-room again, and sat down suddenly on one of the richly cushioned chairs. Father Brown instantly ran across to him, taking no notice of Cutler and the colossal actor, though the room already rang with their blows and they began to struggle for the dagger. Seymour, who retained some practical sense, was whistling for the police {{at the end of the}} passage.|$|R
50|$|When Zaphod and Marvin {{reach the}} fifteenth {{floor of the}} Guides office, half of the {{building}} is {{lifted off the ground}} by Frogstar Fighters.

Roosta gives Zaphod final instructions before he leaves: Go through the window on his <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> not <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Zaphod then meets Gargravarr who informs Zaphod that he is to be sent through the Total Perspective Vortex, a torture device which can annihilate ones soul by showing them how small they are compared {{to the size of the}} Universe. However, when Zaphod enters it, the Vortex shows him that he is one of the most important things in the Universe. Zaphod escapes, and finds Zarniwoop in the first class cabin of a spaceliner in an abandoned spaceport.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the final}} callback, the {{director}} {{and a group of}} studio executives watch a Hispanic girl audition, but decide she is [...] "too ethnic" [...] for the part. Sandy arrives and begins her audition, following the script. The director intervenes, asking Sandy to improvise a scene in which they play husband and wife. Pleased with her performance, he finalizes the deal. He asks Sandy {{to take a look at}} some [...] "migrant trash picker" [...] documents he has in his house; she hesitates but accepts. On her <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> Sandy drops several items from her bag, accidentally leaving behind a book. The director picks it up and sees that it is a compendium of A Return to Love and A Woman's Worth by Marianne Williamson.|$|E
5000|$|In the Great Days: The John Prine Anthology liner notes, Prine {{claims that}} the {{inspiration}} for [...] "That's The Way The World Goes Round" [...] came from him being [...] "kind of fed {{up with a lot}} of cynicism that I saw in people, even in myself at the time. I wanted to find a way to get back to a better world, more childlike. I immediately went back and started writing from a child's perspective." [...] Prine was introduced to Phil Spector by L.A. Times writer Robert Hillburn and wrote [...] "If You Don't Want My Love" [...] with the producer at his house, recalling to Bluebirdrailroad magazine, [...] "It happened on the <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Weâ€™d been there for seven hours, jokinâ€™, drinkinâ€™. And by the way, when you go in the house, heâ€™s got two bodyguards on his shoulder. It was just craziness, you know...So I was leaving around four in the morning, and all of a sudden Phil sits down at the piano as I was getting my jacket on, and he hands me an electric guitar unplugged. And I sit down on the bench next to him. I played him 'Thatâ€™s The Way The World Goes Round', and he really liked it. He said, 'Letâ€™s do this,' and he played the beginning notes of 'If You Donâ€™t Want My Love'. And we came up with the first couple lines and he insisted that we repeat them. Over and over. He said it would be very effective. And we took 'That's The Way The World Goes Round' and took the melody and turned it inside out...And that was on my <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> And as soon as he sat down and had a musical instrument, he was normal. Thatâ€™s the way he was. He was just a plain old genius." ...|$|E
50|$|Hogan {{entered the}} cage early, by force, {{so he and}} Stevie Ray could take <b>out</b> all <b>the</b> other participants, {{including}} their teammate Bret Hart. When Hogan went to pin Kevin Nash, smoke engulfed the ring and it appeared that The Warrior had magically entered the cage. Hogan and Stevie Ray beat him down, but more smoke appeared, and when it cleared away The Warrior was gone leaving Hogan holding his coat. The real Warrior then ran <b>out</b> from <b>the</b> back to enter the match. Hogan would eventually force his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> cage <b>door,</b> with Warrior following suit by climbing up the cage wall and kicking it in.|$|R
60|$|We {{have come}} this Evening with a guide--for without was impossible--into {{the middle of}} the Isle of Mull, {{pursuing}} our cheap journey to Iona, and perhaps Staffa. We would not follow the common and fashionable mode, from the great Imposition of Expense. We have come over heath and rock, and river and bog, to what in England would be called a horrid place. Yet it belongs to a Shepherd pretty well off perhaps. The family speak not a word but Gaelic, and we have not yet seen their faces for the smoke, which, after visiting every cranny (not excepting my eyes very much incommoded for writing), finds its <b>way</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> I am more comfortable than I could have imagined in such a place, and so is Brown. The people are all very kind--We lost our way a little yesterday; and inquiring at a Cottage, a young woman without a word threw on her cloak and walked a mile in a mizzling rain and splashy way to put us right again.|$|R
60|$|The Indian village {{occupied}} a lovely {{situation at the}} base of a gentle hill or rising ground, the summit of which was clothed with luxuriant trees and shrubs. The huts were of various shapes and sizes, and very simple in construction. They were built upon the bare ground; some were supported by four corner posts, twelve or fifteen feet high, and from thirty to forty feet long, the walls being made of thin laths connected with wicker-work, and plastered with clay. <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> were made of palm-leaves, and the roofs were covered with the same material, or with maize straw. Other huts were made almost entirely of palm-leaves and tent-shaped in form; and, while a few were enclosed by walls, the most of the square ones had one or more sides entirely open. In the large huts several families dwelt together, and each family had a hearth and a portion of the floor allotted to it. The smoke from their fires was allowed to find its <b>way</b> <b>out</b> by <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and chinks in the roofs, as no chimneys were constructed for its egress.|$|R

5000|$|But the Red Sox, {{facing the}} end of Ted Williams' great career in , were a team in disarray. Composed of aging {{veterans}} and mostly unpromising youngstersâ€”and stunned by the sudden retirement, in his prime, of right fielder and [...] Most Valuable Player Jackie Jensenâ€”the 1960 Red Sox fell into the American League basement after losing 27 of their first 42 games. Jurges, an intense competitor, suffered in an alien organization composed largely of cronies of owner Yawkey. The Red Sox front office was about to undergo a massive shakeup, with Harris, Jurges' patron, on his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> On June 8, Jurges left the team, citing illness. (Some Boston baseball writers believed that he suffered from nervous exhaustion.) He was fired two days later, and, after bench coach Del Baker handled the team for five days, Higgins returned to the manager's post he had lost 11 months before.|$|E
50|$|Ram and Kurt's macho fathers {{leave for}} a fishing trip, {{roughing}} their sons {{up on the}} <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{in a similar fashion}} to the way their sons treat the kids at school. With his folks gone, Ram starts the party, which quickly grows out of control as Veronica gets increasingly drunk ("Big Fun"). Martha shows up, thinking Ram invited her because of the note but is cruelly rebuffed. The Heathers try to prank her by dressing up a pig-shaped piÃ±ata to resemble her, but Veronica stops them and throws the piÃ±ata in the pool. She angrily resigns from the Heathers, but Heather Chandler refuses to allow her to walk away, threatening to ruin her social life. In response, the inebriated Veronica vomits on Heather's shoes, enraging her, and the frightened students turn their backs on her. Feeling she has nothing to lose now, she breaks into J.D.'s bedroom and seduces him, losing her virginity ("Dead Girl Walking").|$|E
6000|$|I {{began to}} doubt whether I {{had been one}} too many for the celebrated Cuff, after all! It was rather a relief {{to me that we}} were {{interrupted}} here by a knock at <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and a message from the cook. Rosanna Spearman HAD asked to go <b>out,</b> for <b>the</b> usual reason, that her head was bad, and she wanted a breath of fresh air. At a sign from the Sergeant, I said, Yes. [...] "Which is the servants' way out?" [...] he asked, when the messenger had gone. I showed him <b>the</b> servants' <b>way</b> <b>out.</b> [...] "Lock <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of your room," [...] says the Sergeant; [...] "and if anybody asks for me, say I'm in there, composing my mind." [...] He curled up again at the corners of the lips, and disappeared.|$|R
50|$|The pair {{decide to}} take Clank's car to a fence, but crash in the process. Sitting on an old cooker down a back lane, they come across a large {{television}} set. With {{the help of a}} fence named Kittser, they take the TV to Ballymun and attempt to sell it to an older man. But Kittser and the buyer argue and the TV gets damaged in the altercation, forcing the again hopeless depressed Adam and Paul to leave. On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> they pass <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of drug dealer Martin who is being attacked by a gang of vigilantes. As the two sit outside the block, the contents of Martin's flat are thrown off of his tower block and land on the ground around the boys including two bags of heroin.|$|R
5000|$|Tension {{has been}} {{building}} throughout the entire movie between Elder Johnson and Elder Van Pelt. Earlier, Johnson had received an audio tape from his girlfriend. He hasn't been able to play the tape for several days because Van Pelt had lent their tape player to a ward member. Also, Van Pelt is annoyed by Johnson's repeated {{use of the word}} [...] "flip", as a mild substitute for any of a number of profane words. Johnson had told Van Pelt to hit him every time he used that word, but while waiting outside the apartment Johnson says it, and frustrated with Van Pelt for always hitting him, physically forces him to stop, showing his anger. This tension culminates outside of the missionary apartment just as Kyle is leaving from his first discussion. As he is leaving, Johnson and Van Pelt are looking in, hoping for him to leave soon. However, Johnson states: [...] "Oh, flip! They're just standing around in there!" [...] Forgetting Johnson's threats if he does so again, Van Pelt hits Johnson on the back. Johnson chases Van Pelt around, and eventually, as Kyle is on his <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> Van Pelt enters and hides. Johnson quickly bursts in as well, smashing Kyle behind <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> He demands to know where Van Pelt is, and misunderstands most of what Rogers says and hears only, [...] "Behind the door" [...] He angrily starts to smash Kyle even more, until he realized what he just did. Rogers and Calhoun leave with Kyle <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but rush back in when they hear Van Pelt scream. They run in to see that Johnson has just hogtied Van Pelt with a rope when the mission president arrives in the apartment.|$|R

50|$|In {{the final}} scene, set {{several days later}} as the {{deadline}} approaches, Brewster is back in New York at Peggy's house with the recepts of his spending sprees, thinking he has met his goal, only to have his friends present him with $40,012 that they have recovered from his failed ventures. Luckily as the clock to the deadline strikes 12 noon, {{he is able to}} get rid of the money by paying the executor's fee, an old $10 debt, and the last $2 for a cab fare, just before time runs out. Having secured his inheritance of $7,000,000, Brewster then takes Peggy out saying that they have to go downtown to the nearest justice of the peace to get married right away. On the <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> he is confronted by a door-to-door salesman. The salesman is trying to sell the item for two cents more than it can be bought at the store.

50|$|Joanne, {{a fashion}} photographer, helps her friend, Lane Daniels (Hilary Duff), an {{aspiring}} writer, {{get in to}} see Kate White, primary editor at Cosmopolitan Magazine, to pitch a story idea - which doesn't go well. On the <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> Kate and Lane discuss {{how hard it is}} to find a good man, which leads to Kate assigning Lane the task of joining the business world to find a man amongst all those eligible 'downtown' bachelors, and writing an article about that. She is to go under-cover and look for her 'magic man' (one for whom she has a lengthy checklist of desirable attributes, as opposed to her friend Joanne's checklist which consists of: 1> breathing, and 2> through 7> cute). With a fraudulent rÃ©sumÃ©, Lane bluffs, bumbles, and sabotages her way into getting an administrative assistant position in the Corporate Strategic Planning department of a major investment firm. She is to work for Tom Rinehart (Michael McMillian), Managing Director, who is a bit of a quirky 'stick in the mud' when it comes to personal 'risk-taking'.|$|E

When they came sometime before noon, they introduced their teacher to the brothers in the refectory, so that they could convert, actually persecute them into the Lutheran faith. But when they ended two lessons about dinner time and could not convince the brethren of their heresy, they drove them by force <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> friary, every one of the brothers received his bedclothes and a washbasin that was retrieved from the cells. When they were about to leave through the cemetery, they took the Guardian Gabriel Poulsen and Brother Bernhard Poulsen, the other Vice-Guardian away from the brothers and led them to prison because they would not tell where the founding letters4 were, they (the Guardians) had sent them in advance to another place for safe-keeping.|$|R
5000|$|On June 29, 1981, the Wonderland Gang, {{comprising}} Ron Launius, Billy DeVerell, David Lind, Tracy McCourt, {{and their}} associate, John Holmes, conspired {{to launch a}} home invasion and robbery upon Eddie Nash, a reputedly powerful organized crime figure who usually referred to himself {{in the third person}} as [...] "The Nash". The robbery was an inside job set up by Holmes, who was a close associate of Nash's, and whom Nash regularly referred to as [...] "my brother". Early in the morning of the robbery, Holmes visited Nash's mansion ostensibly to party and to buy drugs, but on his <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> left <b>the</b> patio <b>door</b> to <b>the</b> kitchen unlatched. The objective of the robbery was to steal a hoard of cash, heroin, and cocaine that Holmes claimed was in a safe embedded in Nash's bedroom floor, as well as to retrieve some antique guns that the Wonderland Gang had stolen from another businessman and then subsequently, using Holmes as an intermediary, sold to Nash in exchange for drugs.|$|R

He stood a moment under the tower looking up at the clock, and then pulled out his own watch, as though to verify the one by the other. He made, unconsciously, a struggle to drive away from his thoughts the facts of the late scene, and for some five or ten minutes he succeeded. He said to himself a word or two about Sir Raffle and his letters, and laughed inwardly as he remembered the figure of Rafferty bringing in the knight's shoes. He had gone some half mile upon his way before he ventured to stand still and tell himself that he had failed in the great object of his life.|$|R
