5|$|As Duckworth {{gathered}} his squadron, Northumberlands mainmast collapsed across the deck, causing severe {{damage to the}} ship's fittings. Although Cochrane's flagship was the most severely damaged of the squadron, all had suffered to a degree: Superbs men counted 60 shot holes while Atlas <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and Donegal had lost one of her topmasts. Casualties were also distributed throughout the fleet, with Northumberland and Spencer suffering the worst and Atlas the least except for the barely engaged Agamemnon. Total losses were 74 killed and 264 wounded and several ships were damaged, but Duckworth was rapidly able to effect repairs as his ships remained on station to observe the situation ashore.|$|E
5|$|Imperator Aleksandr III and {{the other}} ships of the {{division}} briefly followed Knyaz Suvorov until {{it became clear that}} the latter ship <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and then turned north in an effort to get behind Tōgō's ships. Knyaz Suvorov never regained her position in the battle line and became the primary target of the Japanese for a time. Around 16:00 the captain of Imperator Alexandr III, Nikolai Bukhvostov, decided to duplicate 's maneuver at the Battle of the Yellow Sea by charging straight for the Japanese battleline in an attempt to focus their attention on his ship rather than Knyaz Suvorov. He was successful, but Imperator Aleksandr III was badly damaged in the process. Borodino now assumed the lead position and turned the fleet to the south where they temporarily managed to disengage in the mist and fog.|$|E
5|$|It {{was soon}} {{established}} {{that some of}} the pirates were from Cabo Rojo, since they disembarked there. Undercover agents were sent to the town to track them, and new mayor Juan Font y Soler requested resources to deal with a larger group which <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Links between the pirates and local sympathizers made arresting them difficult. The central government, frustrated with Cabo Rojo's inefficiency, demanded the pirates' capture and western Puerto Rico military commander José Rivas was ordered to exert pressure on local authorities. Although Cofresí was tracked to the beach in Peñones, near his brothers' homes in Guaniquilla, the operation only recovered the Johns sails, meat, flour, cheese, lard, butter and candles; the pirates escaped aboard a schooner. A detachment caught Juan José Mateu and charged him with conspiracy; his confession linked Cofresí to the two hijackings.|$|E

5|$|When Viscount Mountmorres {{visited the}} {{concession}} in 1905 he reported abandoned villages across the territory and that villagers had {{fled to the}} deepest parts of the forest to avoid Abir's taxes. These villagers were living in makeshift leaf shelters and with few comforts. By March 1906 Richard Mohun, Abir's director, admitted that {{the situation in the}} area <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and suggested that the Congo Free State should assume control of the concession. By September of that year Abir was unable to contain the increasing number of rebellions and, facing falling profits, was forced to completely withdraw from the area and hand control of the concession back to the Free State. At this point there were still 47,000 rubber collectors listed on the company's books. The other two major rubber companies in the Congo, the Société Anversoise and the Lulonga Company, also had their concessions taken back into state control in 1906.|$|E

25|$|Simultaneously, {{opposition}} media, politicians, business guilds {{and other}} organizations helped to accelerate a campaign of domestic political and economical destabilization, some of which was backed by the United States.

25|$|Of these, 20 {{were killed}} at Nkhata Bay where those {{detained}} in the Northern Region {{were being held}} prior to being transferred by Lake Steamer to the south. A local Congress leader, {{who had not been}} arrested, encouraged a large crowd to gather at the dockside at Nkhata Bay, apparently to secure the release of the detainees. Troops who should have arrived in the town early on 3 March were delayed and, when they arrived, the District Commissioner felt the situation <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and he ordered then to open fire. The other death on 3 March was in Blantyre, and there were six more deaths in the Northern Region and five in Machinga District up to 19 March. Most if these deaths occurred when soldiers of the Royal Rhodesia Regiment or Kings African Rifles were ordered to open fire on rioters. The remainder of the 51 officially recorded deaths were in military operations in the Northern Region.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} {{addition}} of $800 million of state funds promised in 1978, {{less than half of the}} $600 million authorized in the 1967 bond issue for major construction had been spent. The MTA made improvements to tunnels, tracks, switches and signals. It had to do this with a smaller amount of funding than available in the past due to the fiscal crisis, and keep the subway operating 24 hours a day. However, it had a major public relations problem. As people didn't see any improvements, they assumed that crime <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and for a while it was, but this assumption was maintained even during periods of reduced crime. In an attempt to alleviate the crime situation and extend the service life of rolling stock, half-length trains began running during off-peak hours. Infrastructure was in such poor condition that even the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue subway projects were threatened by 1980. The 63rd Street Line was flooded with water, while the Archer Avenue Line could barely be built past Parsons Boulevard.|$|E

25|$|USS Ferret {{was part}} of a naval fleet that sailed to the Caribbean to subdue the {{occurrence}} of pirate raids on merchant ships that had increased to almost 3,000 by the early 1820s. The financial losses to the United States was great while murder and the practice of torture were common. Losses to American ships and merchants had increased to such proportions that the situation began making headlines in American newspapers. In little time merchants and shippers along with the American public were demanding that the U.S. Navy take definite action against piracy that <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. In November 1822 when the captain of the USS Alligator was killed in a battle with the notorious Cuban pirate Domingo that was the last straw. Response was quick and by 22 December President James Monroe authorized the creation of the West Indies squadron for purposes of seeking and routing out pirates and their numerous strongholds about the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. They were also directed to suppress the international slave trade which also operated out of this region and outlawed in the United States. Following Monroe's authorization the Secretary of the Navy, Smith Thompson, promoted David Porter to commodore, allocated $500,000 to him and appointed him to take commanded of and outfit the squadron for war against the pirates. British interests in the Caribbean also threatened, the West Indies squadron fought piracy in a concerted effort with the Royal Navy.|$|E
500|$|Kaali {{is often}} shown {{standing}} {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest. This represents an episode where Kaali <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> on the battlefield, such that {{she was about to}} destroy the entire universe. [...] Shiva pacified her by laying down under her foot, both to receive her blessing, but also to pacify and calm her. Shiva is sometimes shown with a blissful smile on his face. She is typically shown with a garland of severed heads, often numbering fifty. This can symbolize the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet and therefore as the primordial sound of Aum from which all creation proceeds. The severed arms which make up her skirt represent her devotee's karma that she has taken on.|$|E

[...] During the band's recording sabbatical between 1976 and 1978, Moon gained a considerable amount of weight. [...] By the time of the Who's invitation-only show at the Kilburn Gaumont in December 1977 for The Kids are Alright, Moon was visibly overweight and had difficulty sustaining a solid performance. After recording Who Are You, Townshend refused to follow the album with a tour unless Moon stopped drinking, and said that if Moon's playing did not improve he would be fired. Daltrey later denied threatening to fire him, but said that by this time the drummer <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
500|$|The 19th Infantry Brigade then {{advanced}} on Tobruk. The {{attack on}} this fortified town proceeded along similar lines to that on Bardia, with the 16th Infantry effecting a break-in of the position, {{but this time}} the 19th Infantry Brigade was to carry out the exploitation phase. Robertson's contribution to the plan was to increase its tempo, so that the attack would be carried through without pause, the exploitation being carried out before the initial break-in was complete. Robertson accepted the surrender of the fortress commander, Generale di Corpo d'Armata Petassi Manella, and later Admiral Messimiliano Vietina, the Italian naval commander. Comments by [...] "a sunburnt red-headed Australian brigadier" [...] made headlines in Britain, where senior officers rarely spoke to the media, but did not endear Robertson to his critics, who felt that his ego <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Following the entry of the 19th Infantry Brigade to Benghazi on 7 February, Robertson declared [...] "give me two stout ships and a bearing on Rome and we'll dine in the hall of the caesars".|$|E

500|$|Rozhestvensky {{decided to}} take the most direct route to Vladivostok using the Tsushima Strait and was intercepted by the Japanese battlefleet under the command of Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō on 27 May 1905. At the {{beginning}} of the battle, Imperator Alexandr III was second in line behind Rozhestvensky's flagship, [...] Very little is known of the ship's actions during the battle as there were no survivors from the ship and visibility was poor for most of the battle, but Captain W. C. Pakenham, the Royal Navy's official military observer under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, noted that she was set on fire early in the engagement. She did initially follow Knyaz Suvorov when that ship's steering was damaged about a half-hour after the Japanese opened fire at 14:10, but turned north when her captain, Nikolai Bukhvostov, realized that Knyaz Suvorov <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Tōgō tried to concentrate his fire on the crippled Knyaz Suvorov around 16:00, but Bukhvostov turned Imperator Alexandr III straight for the Japanese battleline in a successful attempt to focus their attention on his ship. He was successful, but she was badly damaged in the process. Observers noted that her bow was badly damaged and that there was a large hole in the forward hull on the port side. When the shooting resumed around 18:00, the Japanese concentrated their fire upon the ship and her sister, [...] Imperator Alexandr III sheered out of line to port around 18:30 and capsized, but did not sink until 19:07; there were no survivors.|$|E
