It concluded ： Seismic performance of prefabricated <b>wall</b> <b>beam</b> node and cast <b>wall</b> <b>beam</b> node are basically the same, while the prefabricated <b>wall</b> <b>beam</b> node has higher strength, which indicates that the connection of precast specimen is reliable.

40|$|The use of thin <b>wall</b> <b>beam</b> {{theory for}} the {{analysis}} of simply supported shells is described and the necessary modifications to the thin <b>wall</b> <b>beam</b> theory are shown which will make the solution as theoretically correct as the basic classical theories used in the analysis of simply supported shells. A simply supported circular cylindrical shell is analyzed by this method and the results compared with a solution by the classical theory for the same shell which is given in the American Society of Civil Engineers Manual No. 31. The results show close agreement. The analysis is similar to the method of analysis of H. Lundgren. Either a successive corrections methods as used by Lundgren, or a successive approximations procedure, developed in this thesis, may be used. Slow convergence, or even divergence, is obtained in many problems. However, very rapid convergence may be obtained by the use of extrapolation formulas based upon the assumption that in successive cycles the differences between the true solution and the trial solution decrease, or increase, in a geometric ratio. The basic purpose for presenting the "mOdified thin <b>wall</b> <b>beam</b> theory" is not just to simplify the analysis of thin shells {{from the standpoint of the}} mathematics involved, but rather to provide an addi-tional method to use in the analysis of shells in cases where the goy-, erning differential equations cannot be solved exactly or even be de- fined in explicit mathematical terms...|$|E

The dependences on the height of circular holes and bulkheads width are shown in a graphic form for a simply supported I-beam subjected to the uniformly distributed load. Empirical lineal dependences are given for <b>wall</b> <b>beams.</b> It is shown that in I-beams with oval holes not higher than 0. 6 H the values are lower than near the circular ones. The biggest contribution to the stress concentration factor gives shear deformation, not bending strain. The distance between holes influences the value only when the bulkheads width is twice less than the length of a hole, and the less distance gives less stress concentration...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{covers the}} operator-related {{formulation}} of the eigenvalue problem of analysis of the <b>wall</b> <b>beam</b> with piecewise-constant physical and geometrical parameters alongside the so-called basic direction {{within the framework of}} the discrete-continual approach (discrete-continual finite element method, discrete-continual variation-difference method). Generally, discrete-continual formulations are contemporary mathematical models which are currently becoming available for computer-based implementation. They allow investigators to consider the boundary effects whenever solution components represent rapidly varying functions. Another feature of discrete-continual methods is the absence of limitations imposed on lengths of structures. Two-dimensional model of elasticity is used as a design model of a structure. In accordance with the so-called extended domain method, the domain is limited by the boundary of arbitrary shape. Corresponding key features at the stage of numerical implementation of discrete-continual methods include convenient mathematical formulas, effective computational patterns and algorithms, simple data processing techniques, etc. The definition of an expression for an operator of the problem under consideration, if resolved in the isotropic medium, is presented; the allowance for supports restrained by elastic members is provided; standard boundary conditions are taken into accoun...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new {{composite}} thin <b>wall</b> <b>beam</b> {{element of}} arbitrary cross-section with open or closed contour is developed. The formulation incorporates {{the effect of}} elastic coupling, restrained warping, transverse shear deformation associated with thin walled composite structures. A first order shear deformation theory is considered with the beam deformation {{expressed in terms of}} axial, spanwise and chordwise bending, corresponding shears and twist. The formulated locking free element uses higher order interpolating polynomial obtained by solving static part of the coupled governing differential equations. The formulated element has super convergent properties as it gives the exact elemental stiffness matrix. Static and free vibration analyses are performed for various beam configuration and compared with experimental and numerical results available in current literature. Good correlation is observed in all cases with extremely small system size. The formulated element is used to study the wave propagation behavior in box beams subjected to high frequency loading such as impact. Simultaneous existence of various propagating modes are graphically captured. Here the effect of transverse shear on wave propagation characteristics in axial and transverse directions are investigated for different ply layup sequences...|$|E

40|$|The {{collimator}} absorber {{array of}} the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) project {{is responsible for}} stopping the 1. 0 GeV protons {{that are in the}} halo of the beam. It is estimated that 0. 1 % of the 2 MW beam will be intercepted by the adopted collimating scheme implemented at various sections of the beam transport and accumulation. This paper summarizes the conceptual design of the collimator absorber as well as the supporting detailed analysis that were performed and guided the design process. Key requirement in the design process is the need for the collimator beam tube to minimize beam impedance while closely following its beta function. Due to lack of available experimental data, the long-term behavior of irradiated materials in an environment where they interface with coolant flow becomes an issue. Uncertainties in the long-term behavior prompted a special double-wall design that will enable not only beam halo interception but also the efficient transfer of deposited energy both under normal and off-normal conditions to the coolant flow. The thermo-mechanical response of the double <b>wall</b> <b>beam</b> tube and of a particle bed surrounding it are discussed in detail in the paper. 1...|$|E
40|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} on {{the area}} of the market place in Bieruń Stary were next stage of researches intended to lead to modernisation and rebuild of the market surface as well as rebuild and partial exchange of the terrain’s infrastructure. As a result of an agreement between a building company and the Preservation Service, after having informed the Investor, the Town and Commune Council in Bieruń Stary, seven exploratory units of total 200 sq m have been marked out. They were located in places where earlier radar and electromagnetic investigations of the ground made with the SIR radar indicated disturbances in stratification. It suggested that archaeological features occurred there. The disturbances were interpreted as remains of a town hall, scales, other market buildings and surfaces hardening the market area (covering with wood, stone pavements). The excavations carried out on the market of Bieruń Stary have yielded considerable collection of artefacts. Together 5875 items have been found; the most numerous group (4565) was constituted by fragments of clay vessels. The frequency of each collection of artefacts in different exploratory units was various and the whole material can be treated as strongly shattered and secondary mixed to a great extent. The artefacts quite regularly saturated stratification of all the units except unit VII where barely 144 specimens have been found. As a result of the excavations it has been stated that in the areas in point there are no remains that could be connected with the town functioning from its location {{at the end of the}} 14 th till the 17 th century. It is possible that the town originally had a different location and different directions of development and no sooner than after the great fire in 1677 a new town regulation took place. Great probability of this hypothesis is well founded by the fact that the oldest traces of the market usage only come from the 2 nd half of the 17 th century. Also all the discovered relics of wooden buildings are dated to the years immediately after the fire. As far as inter-market buildings are concerned, in the northern part of the market (in a place indicated as a result of the radar investigation) relics of the south-western comer of a building have been revealed. We believe that, with great probability, it can be assumed that it is a remnant of the town scales. In the terrain it manifests in a layer of broken stone being a foundation of inconsiderably preserved comer <b>wall</b> <b>beam.</b> The relic can be preliminarily dated to the 19 th century. Unfortunately no other remains of the inter-market building area have been found although their occurrence is suggested by the SIR radar investigation. Similarly, relics of the stone paved road have not been found. Only the presence of earthen layers from the 2 nd half of the 17 th - the beginning of the 20 th century. In the central part of the market, in the place suggested by the SIR investigation, relics of the town hall have not been found. To be quite truthful, there are some relics of an archaeological object, but its fragmentary state excludes any far-reaching conclusions. We think that there is an interesting situation in the south-western frontage of the market where relics of its older, southern frontage have been registered. It should be dated to the period from the 2 nd half of the 17 th to the end of the 18 th century. It was shifted about 13 metres north of the present frontage. A wooden pavement once coming under the arcades has been registered, which is showed by relics of posts placed in the surface of the pavement. Before padding beams were laid, the surface of the market had been strengthened by fascine. Whereas after the liquidation of the original building line and enlargement of the market to its present size its surface (at least in the region under consideration) was paved with broken limestone. It probably happened at the end of the 18 th or at the beginning of the 19 th century. In the surface the presence of a gutter (a sewer canal) made of different kinds of coniferous wood has been stated. At the beginnings of the 20 th century the rebuild of the market surface took place. In the area under investigation it was carefully paved with broken limestone, what undoubtedly contributed to the town’s aesthetics, but unfortunately at the opportunity destroyed the older layers.
