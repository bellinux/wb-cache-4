5|$|Paraphrasing John Wheeler, Einstein's {{geometric}} {{theory of}} gravity {{can be summarized}} thus: spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> addressed in the following three sections, which explore the motion of so-called test particles, examine which properties of matter serve {{as a source for}} gravity, and, finally, introduce Einstein's equations, which relate these matter properties to the curvature of spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.|$|E
25|$|Classical deism {{held that}} a human's {{relationship}} with God was impersonal: God created the world and set it in motion but does not actively intervene in individual human affairs but rather through divine providence. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that God will give humanity such things as reason and compassion but this applies to all and not to individual intervention.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The biggest {{challenge}} for clinicians is {{their relationship with}} patients and the public. As knowledge and technical possibilities have advanced, {{there is evidence that}} the healthcare system is falling down in the more mundane aspects of healthcare. What has gone wrong with healthcare? Four published case studies are discussed. The government and the General Medical Council are determined to put the patient at the centre of healthcare. Examples of <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>are</b> given from the NHS Plan, the Duties of a Doctor and recommendations from a Leeds Castle healthcare symposium. The changes involved are articulated from clin...|$|R
25|$|<b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> {{that even}} if we have {{extracted}} all possible energy from a Fermi gas by cooling it to near absolute zero temperature, the fermions are still moving around at a high speed. The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This is the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the Fermi temperature do the electrons begin to move significantly faster than at absolute zero.|$|E
25|$|In short, {{even though}} some {{individual}} slaveowners grew rich and some family fortunes were founded on the exploitation of slaves, that {{is very different from}} saying that the whole society, or even its non-slave population as a whole, was more economically advanced {{than it would have been}} in the absence of slavery. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that, whether employed as domestic servants or producing crops or other goods, millions suffered exploitation and dehumanization for no higher purpose than the...aggrandizement of slaveowners.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the context}} of Spinoza's {{philosophical}} system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that for Spinoza, questions regarding the reason why a given phenomenon {{is the way it}} is (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.|$|E
50|$|<b>What</b> <b>this</b> {{basically}} <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that if x {{is greater}} than y, for example, there are levels of A {{which can be found}} which makes two relevant ordered pairs, the levels of P, equal.|$|R

25|$|Hermeneutic {{therapists}} {{state that}} ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address these}} issues and limitations because, as these authors state, it is a comprehensive theory of human nature, and it is an open system that enables exploration of therapeutic intervention without deviating from the theory itself. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that therapists integrate multiple therapies simultaneously because what one theory lacks insight into, another theory provides; even though the theories may be contradictory among themselves. Ontological hermeneutics therapists, on the other hand, state that it is comprehensive enough to provide adequate insight into human nature as a starting point, but also provides a framework through dialogue to uncover truths about clients in therapy, therefore evading any problems of contradiction. Since ontological hermeneutics theory is a single theory, it avoids the problems of therapists creating their own forms of therapy.|$|E
25|$|In industry, thermal {{analyses}} are often {{ignored in the}} design process or performed too latenbsp&—nbsp&when design changes are limited and become too costly. Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods {{can be used to}} determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural convection heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.|$|E
25|$|The two {{arguments}} Sam and Sally in tree (a) {{are dependent}} on the predicate likes, whereby these arguments are also syntactically dependent on likes. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point {{in the same direction}} (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence big is a predicate in tree (b) that takes bones as its one argument; the semantic dependency points up the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate on takes the two arguments the picture and the wall; one of these semantic dependencies points up the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate to help in (d) takes the one argument Jim but is not directly connected to Jim in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.|$|E

25|$|For a batsman to be {{dismissed}} by being bowled, run out, stumped or hit wicket, his wicket needs to be put down. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> defined by Law 29. A wicket is put down if a bail is completely removed {{from the top of}} the stumps, or a stump is struck out of the grounds by the ball, the striker's bat, the striker's person (or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person), a fielder (with his hand or arm, and provided that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used). A 2010 amendment to the Laws clarified the rare circumstance where a bat breaks during the course of a shot and the detached debris breaks the wicket; the wicket has been put down in this circumstance. The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner.|$|E
500|$|Cochrane has {{research}} interests in animal ethics, bioethics, environmental ethics, rights theory, and human rights, {{as well as}} contemporary political theory more broadly. He is a leading figure in what Garner calls the [...] "political turn in animal ethics", though precisely <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> disputed. Similarly, Tony Milligan characterises Cochrane as {{a key figure in}} the [...] "political turn in animal rights", while Svenja Ahlhaus and Peter Niesen identify a discipline of [...] "Animal Politics", of which Cochrane's work is a major part, separate from animal ethics. The literature to which these authors variously refer explores the relationships of humans and nonhuman animals from the perspective of normative political theory.|$|E
500|$|He {{spent much}} of the next few years writing some of his orchestral pieces, {{including}} The Rock (1893) and Caprice Bohémien (1895). His return to pianistic work in early 1896 was marked by his contribution to Four Improvisations, a collaboration with Anton Arensky, Alexander Glazunov, and Sergei Taneyev. After the Six Moments Musicaux were completed in 1896, Rachmaninoff composed a single Morceau de Fantaisie in G minor on 11 January 1899. He subtitled it [...] "Delmo", however <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> unknown. It is two pages long and features an emphatic, if not brief, climax. He also produced a Fughetta in F major in February of that year, which is also short and has clean counterpoint. He composed most of his published works in this period, starting with the Chopin Variations.|$|E
50|$|<b>What</b> <b>this</b> balance <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that a {{structure}} composed of structural tetrahedra joined at corners is exactly {{on the border between}} being rigid and floppy. What appears to happen is that symmetry reduces the number of constraints so that structures such as quartz and cristobalite are slightly floppy and thus support some RUMs.|$|R

2500|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} to write relators in the form [...] where x and y are words on S. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that [...] This has the intuitive meaning that the images of x and y {{are supposed to be}} equal in the quotient group.

2500|$|Another {{important}} discovery {{made from}} the genome sequencing, is that the coelacanths are still evolving today (but at a relatively slow rate).

5000|$|In 2004, the Doom Patrol was rebooted in a JLA storyline and new Doom Patrol series, both {{written and}} {{illustrated}} by John Byrne. In this version of the Doom Patrol, which ignored previous continuity, Trainor is once again Negative Man (although his negative-energy form now has the appearance of a black skeleton instead of a shadowy humanoid shape). After this series was canceled, the miniseries Infinite Crisis explained that this alteration had been caused by Superboy-Prime's attempts to escape from the extradimensional [...] "heaven" [...] he shared with Alexander Luthor and the Superman and Lois Lane of Earth-Two. When the Doom Patrol joins other heroes in fighting Superboy-Prime, Negative Man and the other Doom Patrol members (including former member Beast Boy) begin recalling their previous lives; all previous incarnations of the Doom Patrol are now in continuity, although the exact details of <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>are</b> not yet clear.|$|R
5000|$|The set {{of limited}} hyperreals or {{the set of}} infinitesimal hyperreals are {{external}} subsets of <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> in practice <b>is</b> that bounded quantification, where the bound is an internal set, never ranges over these sets.|$|R
2500|$|According to Kant, the {{categorical}} imperative {{is possible}} because whilst {{we can be}} thought of as members of both of these worlds (understanding and appearance), it is the world of understanding that “contains the ground of the world of sense [...] and so too of its laws.” <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that the world of understanding is more fundamental than or ‘grounds’ the world of sense. Because of this, the moral law, which clearly applies to the world of understanding, also applies to the world of sense as well, because the world of understanding has priority. To put the point slightly differently: Because the world of understanding is more fundamental and primary, its laws hold for the world of sense too. So the moral law binds us even in the world of appearances.|$|E
2500|$|The film takes a turn {{of style}} as Van Gasteren begins to act, playing {{himself as a}} good-timer who cheats on his wife with casual encounters.

The two decide to book a flight to Zagreb on a lark, but are told by the travel agent, Nema aviona za Zagreb ("There is no plane to Zagreb" [...] in Serbian). Not knowing the language, they find the expression hilarious, and repeat it wherever they go. But later, when alone, the expression begins to haunt Louis. It becomes a personal catchphrase. [...] "What Nema expresses is good will and a great incapacity. Nema and life as such cannot be tied down. You are in them, yet always off the mark." [...] <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> never entirely clear, but what we see is that from this point forward Louis becomes a sincere seeker of truth.|$|E
2500|$|Humanitarian aid {{is argued}} to often not reach {{those who are}} {{intended}} to receive it. For example, a report composed by the World Bank in 2006 stated that an estimated half of the funds donated towards health programs in sub-Saharan Africa did not reach the clinics and hospitals. Money is paid out to fake accounts, prices are increased for transport or warehousing, and drugs are sold to the black market. Another example is in Ghana, where approximately 80% of donations do not go towards their intended purposes. This type of corruption only adds to the criticism of aid, as it is not helping those who need it, and may be adding to the problem. Only about one fifth of U.S. aid goes to countries classified by the OECD as ‘least developed.’ This [...] "pro-rich" [...] trend {{is not unique to}} the United States. According to Collier, [...] "the middle income countries get aid because they are of much more commercial and political interest than the tiny markets and powerlessness of the bottom billion." [...] <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>means</b> <b>is</b> that, at the most basic level, aid is not targeting the most extreme poverty.|$|E
