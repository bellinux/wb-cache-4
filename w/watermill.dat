50|$|The {{industrial}} uses of <b>watermills</b> in the Islamic world {{date back to}} the 7th century, while horizontal-wheeled and vertical-wheeled <b>watermills</b> were both in widespread use by the 9th century. A variety of industrial <b>watermills</b> were used in the Islamic world, including gristmills, hullers, sawmills, shipmills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, and tide mills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial <b>watermills</b> in operation, from al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. Muslim and Middle Eastern Christian engineers also used crankshafts and water turbines, gears in <b>watermills</b> and water-raising machines, and dams as a source of water, used to provide additional power to <b>watermills</b> and water-raising machines. Fulling mills, and steel mills may have spread from Al-Andalus to Christian Spain in the 12th century. Industrial <b>watermills</b> were also employed in large factory complexes built in al-Andalus between the 11th and 13th centuries.|$|R
5|$|Following the Norman conquest, the Hundred {{of what is}} now Eastbourne, {{was held}} by Robert, Count of Mortain, William the Conqueror's half brother. The Domesday Book lists 28ploughlands, a church, a <b>watermill,</b> {{fisheries}} and salt pans.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Watermill</b> at Opwetten is {{situated}} {{along the river}} Kleine Dommel. Diverted river water flows along a channel with force to drive two wooden undershot water wheels, connected to two buildings {{on either side of}} the channel.|$|E
5|$|This chapter {{looks at}} the mediaeval {{landscape}} from the Domesday Book onwards, with the section 'The Landscape in 1086'. The country had almost every village that exists today; a typical one, Hoskins writes, had a small <b>watermill</b> and a church without a spire.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{became the}} {{administrative}} centre for the earldom {{and was used}} by Robert's court. There was already an existing market held at nearby St Stephen's church by the local canons, but Robert appropriated it and moved the market to outside his new castle, intending {{to profit from the}} trade. A <b>watermill</b> was built to the south-west of the castle.|$|E

50|$|Medveščak {{has been}} the center of Zagreb {{industry}} {{since the early days}} of the city, spawning numerous <b>watermills.</b> The <b>watermills</b> caused the development of Zagreb industry, easing the construction of Zagreb's first cloth, soap, paper and liquor factories and later animal skin industry. The <b>watermills</b> were often the subject of feuds between the twin cities, Kaptol and Gradec. A 1392 peace treaty forbade construction of new <b>watermills</b> along the shared city border, between today's southern end of Medvedgradska Street and Ban Jelačić Square, leaving only two mills within the city. Both mills were owned by a Cistercian monastery. However, they were both razed during the 1898 covering of the creek.|$|R

5|$|In 2011, a {{full-size}} {{replica of the}} mill was built at the Binjiang Park in Nanjing, China. Together with replicas of three other Dutch monuments, {{it is part of}} the 'Van Gogh Friendship Park', in honour of the relationships between the sister cities of Eindhoven and Nanjing, and the sister provinces of North-Brabant and Jiangsu. The mayor of Nanjing, Ji Jianye, visited the <b>Watermill</b> at Opwetten in 2012, during his visit to Eindhoven.|$|E
5|$|The {{county has}} several museums; those at Bath include the American Museum in Britain, the Museum of Bath Architecture, the Herschel Museum of Astronomy, the Jane Austen Centre, and the Roman Baths.

5|$|In {{the second}} case, Miloš, an ex-soldier turned farmer who {{allegedly}} {{was attacked by}} a vampire years before, died while haying. After his death, people began {{to die in the}} surrounding area and it was widely believed that Miloš had returned to prey on the neighbours. Another famous Serbian vampire legend recounts the story of a certain Sava Savanović, who lives in a <b>watermill</b> and kills and drinks blood from the millers. The character was later used in a story written by Serbian writer Milovan Glišić and in the Yugoslav 1973 horror film Leptirica inspired by the story.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Luccombe {{lies at the}} foot of Dunkery Hill. Along with Stoke Pero and Horner it forms a civil parish. Horner is on the eastern bank of Horner Water on which there is a restored, but non-working, <b>watermill.</b> The river is crossed by two medieval {{packhorse}} bridges, one of which is known as Hacketty Way Bridge which is crossed by the Coleridge Way. The parish Church of St Mary has a chancel dating from about 1300, with the nave and tower being added around 1450. Stoke Pero Church has a 13th-century tower. The Dovecot at Blackford Farm is part of the estate. It was built in the 11th century and is a Grade II* listed building, and ancient monument. It was attached to a mansion house which burnt down in 1875.|$|E
5|$|The {{waterwheel}} {{appeared in}} Chinese records during the Han. As mentioned by Huan Tan in about 20 AD, {{they were used}} to turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers, and were used in pounding, threshing and polishing grain. However, there is no sufficient evidence for the <b>watermill</b> in China until about the 5th century. The Nanyang Commandery Administrator and mechanical engineer Du Shi (d.38 AD) created a waterwheel-powered reciprocator that worked the bellows for the smelting of iron. Waterwheels were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches. The chain pump was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his 1st-century-AD Balanced Discourse.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1527 there are records of <b>watermills</b> on the river. In the 17th and 18thcenturies, {{there were several}} <b>watermills</b> which ground corn and made paper, with 13 mills on the Yeo at the peak, declining to seven by 1791 and just three by 1915.|$|R
5|$|A {{small number}} of medieval {{buildings}} remain standing in the town. St Denys' Church and St Botolph's in Quarrington date to the 12th and 13th centuries respectively, while Sleaford's half-timbered vicarage is 15th century. St Denys' Church is noted for its tracery and its stone broach spire {{is one of the}} oldest in England. Cogglesford Mill is the only remaining <b>watermill</b> in town and is a testament to the economic importance of the River Slea from the late-Saxon period onwards. The Bishops of Lincoln used the medieval town as a base, constructing the now-ruined Sleaford Castle, and as a means of extracting produce and wealth through demesne farming and by granting a market and limited freedoms to the town. As a result, the oldest areas are the market place and the four roads which meet there: Northgate, Southgate, Eastgate and Westgate; many 18th and 19th century buildings are found in this area.|$|E
5|$|Just to {{the south}} of the castle is the {{restored}} 18th-century castle <b>watermill.</b> In 2010 the castle received 128,242 visitors. Dunster Castle has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. The castle has required continuing maintenance work, in particular to its roof, itself an important historical feature. Efforts have been made to gradually redecorate the castle in a period style, using reproductions of original wallpapers and materials. The National Trust installed solar panels behind the battlements on the roof in 2008 to provide electricity and make the premises more environmentally friendly. This {{was the first time the}} National Trust have taken this approach to a Grade I listed building, and it is expected to save 1,714kg (3,778lb) of carbon a year. In 2015, the National Trust announced plans to make the 19th-century reservoir open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Tatchell leased {{the mill}} to his {{son-in-law}} John Sherrin, who inherited the mill in 1824 following Tatchell's death. When Sherrin died, the mill passed to his three sons, although only one, Robert, worked the mill. Simon Spearing became the miller in 1869. He was later assisted {{by his son}} William, who lost an arm when he was thirteen due to an accident at a <b>watermill</b> in Low Ham. The mill was acquired by Adam Sherrin in 1881 and owned by his family until 1902. By the late 1880s, the mill was being rented by George Parker. He added a portable steam engine as auxiliary power. It drove one pair of stones. The mill was damaged by storms in 1897 or 1898 and after that was only powered by the steam engine, which had been installed in 1894, rather than the wind. The bakehouse ceased to be used around this time.|$|E
25|$|A Stone Nut {{is a small}} {{gear driven}} by the Great Spur Wheel or Spur Wheel. It drives the Runner Stone. In most <b>watermills,</b> the stones are driven from below. These are called Underdrift stones. A few <b>watermills</b> drove the stones from above, known as Overdrift stones.|$|R
