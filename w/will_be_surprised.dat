25|$|Several {{months after}} her presumed death, Ryan {{receives}} a champagne flute from Greenlee. Realizing {{that no one ever}} actually identified the body, he comes to believe that Greenlee is still alive. In November 2009, Ryan discovers Greenlee's medical records on David's computer, who claims he was using them for research into Amanda Dillon's pregnancy. It is later revealed that David has been keeping Greenlee in Massachusetts while she recovers. Greenlee has been comatose for the past year and has no memory of the accident. Upon her awakening, David tells Greenlee that she is paralyzed and if she does not have surgery to fix her spine, she will remain paralyzed {{for the rest of her}} life. She tells David that she wants to do the surgery, but if she dies during surgery, not to tell anybody that she was alive before her death. After successfully recovering from her injuries, Greenlee attempts to visit Ryan but is surprised to see him having sex with Erica Kane. Out for revenge, Greenlee asks David to bring her a hard-drive hidden in Ryan's house. She puts the hard-drive into Fusion's computer and it crashes all the files. Even with Fusion's files being lost, Erica is set out to build Fusion back up once again; during an interview, she tells reporters that whoever crashed Fusion's computers has not destroyed the company. Greenlee feels that she has not done enough and decides to stay in Pine Valley. Greenlee asks David to marry her, hoping that when she walks down the aisle at her wedding, everyone <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised,</b> and that Ryan will be hurt.|$|E
500|$|The {{negative}} views towards Wollstonecraft persisted {{for over}} a century. The Rights of Woman was not reprinted {{until the middle of}} the 19th century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute. George Eliot wrote [...] "there is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the Rights of Woman as in some way or other a reprehensible book, but readers who go to it with this impression <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to find it eminently serious, severely moral, and withal rather heavy".|$|E
500|$|Casamassina {{initially}} criticized Nintendo for its minimal {{marketing campaign}} for Corruption and {{compared it to}} the larger campaign for the original Metroid Prime, which included its own live action advertisement. He concluded that the campaign {{was the result of}} Nintendo's new focus on casual games for their console. When questioned on the company's actions, Nintendo of America responded by saying, [...] "Nintendo fans <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by {{the quantity and quality of}} Metroid Prime 3: Corruption information that becomes available before the game launches on Aug. 27. Your patience will be rewarded (or Corrupted)." [...] Following this promise, Nintendo released the [...] "Metroid Prime 3 Preview" [...] channel on August 10, 2007, in North America and on October 15, 2007, in Europe. The channel, available as a free download via the Wii Shop Channel, allowed Wii owners to view preview videos of the game that included a battle sequence and previously unannounced details on new characters. The Preview channel was the first in a series of new downloadable content including videos made available in North America. The [...] "month of Metroid", as named by Nintendo, included Virtual Console versions of Metroid, available on August 13, 2007, and Super Metroid, available on August 20, 2007.|$|E

500|$|... "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] was lauded {{by music}} critics. Parisien called the song [...] "a year-long banger", complimenting its {{instrumentation}} and melody. Steve Morse, editor of The Boston Globe, wrote that Carey sang {{with a lot}} of soul. According to Barry Schwartz from Stylus Magazine, [...] "to say this song is an instant classic somehow doesn't capture its amazingicity; it's a modern standard: joyous, exhilarating, loud, with even a hint of longing." [...] Schwartz praised the song's lyrics as well, describing them as [...] "beautifully phrased," [...] and calling Carey's voice [...] "gorgeous" [...] and [...] "sincere." [...] Kyle Anderson from MTV labeled the track [...] "a majestic anthem full of chimes, sleigh bells, doo-wop flourishes, sweeping strings {{and one of the most}} dynamic and clean vocal performances of Carey's career". While reviewing the 2009 remix version, Becky Bain from Idolator called the song a [...] "timeless classic" [...] and wrote, [...] "We love the original song to pieces—we blast it while decorating our Christmas tree and lighting our Menorah." [...] In his review for Carey's Merry Christmas II You, Thomas Connor from the Chicago Sun-Times called the song [...] "a simple, well-crafted chestnut and one of the last great additions to the Christmas pop canon". Shona Craven of Scotland's The Herald, said, [...] " [...] a song of optimism and joy that maybe, just maybe, hints at the real meaning of Christmas." [...] Additionally, she felt the main reason it was so successful is the subject [...] "you" [...] in the lyrics, explaining, [...] "Perhaps what makes the song such a huge hit is the fact that it's for absolutely everyone." [...] Craven opened her review with a bold statement: [...] "Bing Crosby may well be turning in his grave, but no child of the 1980s <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to see Mariah Carey's sublime All I Want For Christmas Is You bounding up the charts after being named the nation's top festive song." [...] In a 2006 retrospective look at Carey's career, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker said, the [...] "charming" [...] song was one of Carey's biggest accomplishments, calling it [...] "one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon". Dan Hancox, editor of The National, quoted and agreed with Jones' statement, calling the song [...] "perfection". In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a [...] "holiday standard." ...|$|E

Darwin noted in his journal in April 1833 that [...] "It blew half a gale of wind; but it was fair & we scudded before it. — Our decks fully deserved their nickname of a [...] "half tide rock"; so constantly did the water flow over them", but John Lort Stokes who was on all three survey expeditions praised the Beagle: [...] "The reader <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to learn that she belongs to that much-abused class, the '10-gun brigs'—coffins, as they are not infrequently designated in the service; notwithstanding which, she has proved herself, under every possible variety of trial, {{in all kinds of}} weather, an excellent sea boat." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{reviewing}} the film at AboutFilm.com, Carlo Cavagna regards {{this as a}} misleading classification, as does Leo Goldsmith, writing at notcoming.com, and the review on Blu-ray.com. Writing in TV Guide, Maitland McDonagh writes [...] "No one familiar with the cold precision of Kubrick's work <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> that this isn't the steamy erotic thriller a synopsis (or the ads) might suggest." [...] Writing in general about the genre of 'erotic thriller' for CineAction in 2001, Douglas Keesey states that [...] "whatever [...] actual type, [...] was at least marketed as an erotic thriller". Michael Koresky, writing in the 2006 issue of film journal Reverse Shot, writes [...] "this director, who defies expectations at every turn and brings genre to his feet, was... setting out to make neither the 'erotic thriller' that the press maintained nor an easily identifiable 'Kubrick film'". DVD Talk similarly dissociates the film from this genre.|$|E

2500|$|Commenting on Ulver’s evolution, Rygg said, [...] "I don't {{think anyone}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised.</b> The shock value is gone, I think it went away with Metamorphosis. Since then, the changes haven't been {{fundamental}} at all.” Continuing, “I think the shapeshifting story {{is one that}} has been greatly exaggerated by the media. There have been a couple of twists and turns after the Blake record, that's granted, but nothing too significant. I see Ulver as having a part one and a part two. And that's a division that we already had in our minds before those first three albums were even finished. We already knew we were going somewhere else after Nattens madrigal. Due to logistics, we had to wait almost two years until that one got released, and in the interim we had amassed a huge array of influences. We were out of our teens and our outlook was becoming more complex." ...|$|E
2500|$|A shorter {{version of}} “Strix's” article {{appeared}} in The Spectator {{and this is}} the fourth essay of the book. “Strix”, pseudonym of [...] Peter Fleming, was a British adventurer and travel writer, who was James Bond author Ian Fleming’s elder brother and a friend of Nancy. He begins saying that Nancy Mitford's article has given rise to much pleasurable discussion. Before pushing on to the less etymological aspects of her theme, he addresses how language evolves and changes naturally, and U-slang, attributing to it a sense of parody. He says interest in the study of U-speech has been arbitrarily awakened and considers this interest unhealthy and contrary to the [...] "national interest". He closes his article hoping (ironically) that the U-young will strive for a clear, classless medium of communication in which all say [...] "Pardon?" [...] and none say [...] "What?", and every ball is a dance and every man's wife is [...] "the" [...] wife, but then saying that he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> and disappointed if they do anything of the sort.|$|E
2500|$|A {{particularly}} significant production – from Beckett's perspective – {{took place in}} Lüttringhausen Prison near Remscheid in Germany. An inmate obtained {{a copy of the}} French first edition, translated it himself into German and obtained permission to stage the play. The first night had been on 29 November 1953. He wrote to Beckett in October 1954: [...] "You <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> to be receiving a letter about your play Waiting for Godot, from a prison where so many thieves, forgers, toughs, homos, crazy men and killers spend this bitch of a life waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting. Waiting for what? Godot? Perhaps." [...] Beckett was intensely moved and intended to visit the prison to see a last performance of the play but it never happened. This marked [...] "the beginning of Beckett's enduring links with prisons and prisoners ... He took a tremendous interest in productions of his plays performed in prisons ... He even gave Rick Cluchey, a former prisoner from San Quentin, financial and moral support over a period of many years." [...] Cluchey played Vladimir in two productions in the former Gallows room of the San Quentin California State Prison, which had been converted into a 65-seat theatre and, like the German prisoner before him, went on to work on a variety of Beckett's plays after his release. (The 1953 Lüttringhausen and 1957 San Quentin Prison productions of Waiting For Godot were the subject of the 2010 documentary film The Impossible Itself, produced and directed by Jacob Adams.) ...|$|E

2500|$|He put Death on hold {{after this}} to {{continue}} Control Denied, {{which he had}} been putting together prior to the release of The Sound of Perseverance, and released The Fragile Art of Existence in 1999. Control Denied also had other players from the latest Death album but featured a melodic metal vocalist. Schuldiner also played guitar in the [...] "supergroup" [...] Voodoocult on the album Jesus Killing Machine in 1994 and played a guest solo on Naphobia's 1995 release, Of Hell on the track [...] "As Ancients Evolve" [...] as a favor to the band's bassist at the time who was a friend of Schuldiner's. Schuldiner was also asked {{to be one of the}} many guest vocalists on Dave Grohl's 2001 Probot. Grohl, Napalm Death, Ozzy Osbourne, and Anthrax all increased efforts to raise funds for Schuldiner's medical bills with Grohl trying to involve Schuldiner on an album he was working on. In a 1999 interview Schuldiner spoke about why he didn't sing on the album The Fragile Art of Existence [...] "...these vocals are all I ever wanted to do in Death but couldn't. I've had this dream of recording like that for years, and it seems like a dream come true. Tim Aymar is an amazing singer and this is the main difference. I think people <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at the violence and strength of the album. Many people are expecting something like Iron Maiden, but, despite being one of my favorite bands, I didn't want to make an Iron Maiden-like album. I wanted to make an unpredictable album, just like I did in Death, I guess. I don't like to make predictable albums." ...|$|E
