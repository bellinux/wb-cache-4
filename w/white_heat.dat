5|$|Cagney Productions was {{in serious}} trouble; poor {{returns from the}} {{produced}} films, and a legal dispute with Sam Goldwyn Studio over a rental agreement forced Cagney back to Warner Bros. He signed a distribution-production deal with the studio for the film <b>White</b> <b>Heat,</b> effectively making Cagney Productions a unit of Warner Bros.|$|E

5|$|His next film, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye, {{was another}} gangster movie, {{which was the}} first by Cagney Productions since its acquisition. While {{compared}} unfavorably to <b>White</b> <b>Heat</b> by critics, it was fairly successful at the box office, with $500,000 going straight to Cagney Productions' bankers to pay off their losses. Cagney Productions was not a great success, however, and in 1953, after William Cagney produced his last film, A Lion Is in the Streets, the company came to an end.|$|E

25|$|He {{wrote an}} {{historical}} novel at this time, {{which was published}} posthumously in 1994. <b>White</b> <b>Heat</b> Over Red Fire features Thomas Christophe, a young Eastern Rite Catholic Bishop ministering in post-war Austria.

25|$|Face/Off was a spec script which writers Mike Werb and Michael Colleary {{tried to}} sell to a studio from as early as 1990. The first actors who were chosen to play Sean Archer and Castor Troy were Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger {{respectively}} but John Woo instead hired John Travolta and Nicolas Cage to play those characters. It took numerous studios, producers and rewrites before John Woo became attached several years later. For the Archer character, Woo considered casting either Michael Douglas or Jean-Claude Van Damme whom he had worked with in Hard Target. When the film was eventually made, Douglas served as an executive producer. Werb and Colleary have cited <b>White</b> <b>Heat</b> (1949) and Seconds (1966) as influences on the plot.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} FireHouse {{can be traced}} back to 1984, when Leverty's band <b>White</b> <b>Heat</b> needed a drummer. After over 20 auditions, current FireHouse drummer Michael Foster {{answered}} the ad and when Leverty was impressed by his skill, he quickly hired him. When the band wasn't on tour, Leverty and Foster would visit rock clubs, and it was at one of these clubs where they caught sight of a band called Maxx Warrior. Singing for the band was C. J. Snare, and the band's bassist was Perry Richardson. Leverty and Foster were impressed with Snare's vocal ability, and became determined to unite the bands. As soon as Maxx Warrior broke up, Leverty sent Snare some of his songs and asked him to sing on his tape. Foster and Leverty were again impressed, so they brought Snare in to be the band's lead singer for a show in Virginia several weeks later.|$|E

Haggard went on to declare: [...] "The fact is that it was written at <b>white</b> <b>heat,</b> almost without rest, and that {{is the best way to}} compose."

500|$|Film noir {{is often}} {{associated}} with an urban setting, and a few cities—Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, in particular—are the location of many of the classic films. In the eyes of many critics, the city is presented in noir as a [...] "labyrinth" [...] or [...] "maze". Bars, lounges, nightclubs, and gambling dens are frequently the scene of action. The climaxes of a substantial number of films noir take place in visually complex, often industrial settings, such as refineries, factories, trainyards, power plants—most famously the explosive conclusion of <b>White</b> <b>Heat,</b> set at a chemical plant. In the popular (and, frequently enough, critical) imagination, in noir it is always night and it always rains.|$|E

500|$|During the 20th-century, Virginia Radley {{points out}} that [...] "The most serious charge that can be brought against the poem {{is that it is}} not poetry as Coleridge {{generally}} conceived poetry to be. In fact, it is the one poem in this group that may mean but is not [...] Like 'France' too, the poem suffers from a lack of 'heart'." [...] George Watson declares that the poem [...] "shows how precarious Coleridge's new achievement was. It is a shameless return to the older, effusive manner, evidently written in a <b>white</b> <b>heat</b> of patriotic indignation against the degradation of English public opinion during the French wars, and it is only by stretching charity that it can be considered a conversation poem at all." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} year back at Warner Bros., Cagney became the studio's highest earner, making $324,000. He {{completed}} his first decade of movie-making in 1939 with The Roaring Twenties, his first film with Raoul Walsh and his last with Bogart. After The Roaring Twenties, {{it would be a}} decade before Cagney made another gangster film. Cagney again received good reviews; Graham Greene stated, [...] "Mr. Cagney, of the bull-calf brow, is as always a superb and witty actor". The Roaring Twenties was the last film in which Cagney's character's violence was explained by poor upbringing, or his environment, {{as was the case in}} The Public Enemy. From that point on, violence was attached to mania, as in <b>White</b> <b>Heat.</b> In 1939, Cagney was second to only Gary Cooper in the national acting wage stakes, earning $368,333.|$|E
500|$|Cagney's {{portrayal}} of Cody Jarrett in the 1949 film <b>White</b> <b>Heat</b> {{is one of}} his most memorable. Cinema had changed in the 10 years since Walsh last directed Cagney (in The Strawberry Blonde), and the actor's {{portrayal of}} gangsters had also changed. Unlike Tom Powers in The Public Enemy, Jarrett was portrayed as a raging lunatic with few if any sympathetic qualities. In the 18 intervening years, Cagney's hair had begun to gray, and he developed a paunch for the first time. He was no longer a romantic commodity, and this was reflected in his performance. Cagney himself had the idea of playing Jarrett as psychotic; he later stated, [...] "it was essentially a cheapie one-two-three-four kind of thing, so I suggested we make him nuts. It was agreed so we put in all those fits and headaches." ...|$|E

500|$|Not all of {{the poems}} have been well received. Watson {{believes}} that Fears in Solitude [...] "shows how precarious Coleridge's new achievement was. It is a shameless return to the older, effusive manner, evidently written in a <b>white</b> <b>heat</b> of patriotic indignation against the degradation of English public opinion during the French wars, {{and it is only}} by stretching charity that it can be considered a conversation poem at all." [...] Holmes simply claims Fears in Solitude as [...] "one of the most difficult of [...] Conversation Poems". In discussing The Nightingale, Ashton writes that, [...] "Bantering though this is, and, however, beautiful the final lines about Hartley are, 'The Nightingale' is as a whole a less successful poem than the other conversation poems. It has rather a blank at the centre, just where the others pivot on a significant controlling idea." ...|$|E
500|$|Our Friends in the North {{has been}} invoked on several {{occasions}} as a comparison when similar drama programmes have been screened on British television. The year following Our Friends in the Norths broadcast, Tony Marchant's drama serial Holding On was promoted by the BBC as being an [...] "Our Friends in the South," [...] after Marchant made the comparison when discussing it with executives. The 2001 BBC Two drama serial In a Land of Plenty was previewed by The Observer newspaper as being [...] "the most ambitious television drama since Our Friends in the North." [...] The writer Paula Milne drew inspiration from Our Friends in the North for her own <b>White</b> <b>Heat</b> (2012); she felt that Our Friends in the North had been too centred on white, male, heterosexual characters, and she deliberately wanted to counter that focus.|$|E
500|$|James Francis Cagney Jr. (July 17, 1899March 30, 1986) was an American {{actor and}} dancer, both {{on stage and}} in film, though he had his {{greatest}} impact in film. Known for his consistently energetic performances, distinctive vocal style, and deadpan comic timing, he won acclaim and major awards {{for a wide variety}} of performances. He is best remembered for playing multifaceted tough guys in movies such as The Public Enemy (1931), Taxi! (1932), Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), and <b>White</b> <b>Heat</b> (1949), and was typecast or limited by this view earlier in his career. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him eighth among its list of greatest male stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema. [...] Orson Welles said of Cagney, [...] " [...] maybe the greatest actor who ever appeared in front of a camera", and Stanley Kubrick considered him to be one of the best actors of all time.|$|E
