2500|$|Several {{characteristics}} of the magnetron's output make radar use of the device somewhat problematic. The first of these factors is the magnetron's inherent instability in its transmitter frequency. This instability results not only in frequency shifts from one pulse to the next, but also a frequency shift within an individual transmitted pulse. The second factor is that {{the energy of the}} transmitted pulse is spread over a relatively wide frequency spectrum, which requires the receiver to have a correspondingly wide bandwidth. This wide bandwidth allows ambient electrical noise to be accepted into the receiver, thus obscuring somewhat the weak radar echoes, thereby reducing overall receiver signal-to-noise ratio and thus performance. [...] The third factor, depending on application, is the radiation hazard caused by the use of high power electromagnetic radiation. In some applications, for example a marine radar mounted on a recreational vessel, a radar with a magnetron output of 2 to 4 kilowatts is often found mounted very near an area occupied by crew or passengers. In practical use these factors have been overcome, or merely accepted, and there are today thousands of magnetron aviation and marine radar units in service. [...] Recent advances in aviation <b>weather</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>radar</b> and in marine radar have successfully replaced the magnetron with semiconductor microwave oscillators, which have a narrower output frequency range. [...] These allow a narrower receiver bandwidth to be used, and the higher signal to noise ratio in turn allows a lower transmitter power, reducing exposure to EMR.|$|E

The aircraft took off at 5:04 p.m. CET (UTC +1) from Rotterdam Airport. The crew noted heavy rain in thunderstorms on the airplane's <b>weather</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>radar</b> at 5:09 p.m., receiving clearance to avoid the area. At 5:12 p.m. the aircraft entered a tornado while flying through clouds.

Meteorologically, these vortices are indeed tornadoes, and the disintegrating airliner was seen exiting cloud cover. A police officer first photographed the tornado, then smoke from the burning plane a few minutes later. An investigation concluded that {{a sharp increase in}} altitude registered on the altimeter was not a change in altitude, rather a pressure drop associated with the tornado.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} keep flights away from weather hazards while {{maintaining}} aircraft-to-aircraft separation is critically important. The Advanced Airspace Concept is an automation concept that implements a ground-based strategic conflict resolution algorithm for management of aircraft separation. The impact of dynamic and uncertain <b>weather</b> <b>avoidance</b> on this concept is investigated. A strategic weather rerouting system is integrated with the Advanced Airspace Concept, which also provides a tactical <b>weather</b> <b>avoidance</b> algorithm, in a fast time simulation of the Air Transportation System. Strategic weather rerouting is used to plan routes around weather in the 20 minute to two-hour time horizon. To address forecast uncertainty, flight routes are revised at 15 minute intervals. Tactical <b>weather</b> <b>avoidance</b> is used for short term trajectory adjustments (30 minute planning horizon) that are updated every minute to address any weather conflicts (instances where aircraft are predicted to pass through weather cells) that are left unresolved by strategic weather rerouting.

The weather model can simulate a number of pseudo-random hazardous weather patterns, such as slow- or fast-moving cells and opening or closing weather gaps, and also allows for modeling of onboard weather radar limitations in range and azimuth. The <b>weather</b> <b>avoidance</b> concept employs nested "core" and "avoid" polygons around convective weather cells, and the simulations assess the effectiveness of various avoid polygon sizes {{in the presence of}} different weather patterns, using traffic scenarios representing approximately two times the current traffic density in en-route airspace. Results from the simulation experiment show that the <b>weather</b> <b>avoidance</b> concept is effective over a wide range of weather patterns and cell speeds. Avoid polygons that are only 2 - 3 miles larger than their core polygons are sufficient to account for weather uncertainties in almost all cases, and traffic separation performance does not appear to degrade with the addition of <b>weather</b> polygon <b>avoidance.</b> Additional "lessons learned" from the batch simulation study are discussed in the paper, along with insights for improving the <b>weather</b> <b>avoidance</b> concept.

A key component in the weather plan of the Next Generation of Air Transportation System (NextGen) is to assimilate observed weather information and probabilistic forecasts into the decision process of flight crews and air traffic controllers. In this research we explore supporting flight crew weather decision making through the development of a flight deck predicted weather display system that utilizes weather predictions generated by ground-based radar. This system integrates and presents this weather information, together with in-flight trajectory modification tools, within a cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) prototype. that the CDTI features 2 D and perspective 3 D visualization models of weather. The weather forecast products that we implemented were the Corridor Integrated Weather System (CIWS) and the Convective <b>Weather</b> <b>Avoidance</b> Model (CWAM), both developed by MIT Lincoln Lab.

40|$|Convective weather {{can cause}} arrival traffic to fly less {{efficient}} <b>weather</b> <b>avoidance</b> routes {{and is the}} primary cause for time-based metering to be discontinued. Dynamic Arrival Routes (DAR) is a trajectory-based <b>weather</b> <b>avoidance</b> system {{that is designed to}} help improve arrival traffic flow when weather is present. The DAR system continuously analyzes airborne arrival flights for opportunities to reroute them to more efficient arrival routes or around weather that is predicted to be on their current flight plan early enough to allow the arrival time-based metering system to adjust its times of arrival for the presence of weather. Analysis of 93 hours of actual traffic over 12 different days from Fort Worth Center showed DAR proposed more efficient arrival reroutes for 352 arrival flights for an average time savings of 12. 3 minutes per flight at a look-ahead time of 60 minutes from the meter fix.

Near-term operations with datalink are characterized by a fleet of which not all aircraft are equipped with datalink communications (i. e., mixed equipage). The objectives of this simulation were to continue to develop capabilities such as the conflict resolution algorithm, as well as evaluate new capabilities and concepts such as tactical conflict detection and trajectory-based <b>weather</b> <b>avoidance</b> with feedback from experienced pilots and controllers. Conflict resolutions and tactical conflict detections were compared to controller actions. The direction of the conflict resolution maneuver advised by the algorithm agreed with controller actions 79 % of the time when both chose to apply the same type of resolution maneuver to the same aircraft. Comparing controller actions to conflicts detected by the tactical conflict detection function revealed no missed alerts and a false alert rate of 11 %.
