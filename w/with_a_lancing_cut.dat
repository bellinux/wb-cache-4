60|$|After a time Oraric retired a {{few steps}} from the rest, and made a sign, on which an Irishman came forward and gave him his weapons. He {{instantly}} fell upon Hugo de Lacy, and would have cloven his skull, if the interpreter had not thrown himself between, and saved his master, with the loss of his own arm. Oraric's men sprung from their ambush, but at the same moment the eight Fitzgeralds rushed to the rescue; the traitor fled, pursued by Griffith, who overtook him, thrust him through <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lance,</b> <b>cut</b> off his head, and sent it to King Henry.|$|R
50|$|Downing {{gas masks}} and gloves, Kwinto {{and his companions}} {{infiltrate}} into the bank through a ventilation shaft of the restaurant located over it. There they stun security guards, block the alarm <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plate {{that served as the}} necklace clasp, and take out of the safe all money and valued papers. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> thermal <b>lance</b> Nuta <b>cuts</b> through <b>a</b> side wall of the safe an opening, and the group goes away leaving at the crime scene a plate of the necklace. Taking advantage of the owner's absence, the accomplices transport the main portion of the valuables to the Kramer's house.|$|R
6000|$|A Norman trumpet {{gave the}} signal for the {{commencement}} of the battle, and the archers along the whole line poured a storm of arrows into the English. It was unanswered, for there were few bowmen among the defenders of the hill, and the distance was too great for the javelin-men to hurl their missiles. After the archers had shot several volleys of arrows they fell back, and the infantry advanced against the hill; but before they did so Taillifer, a Norman minstrel, dashed forward on horseback, and spurring up the ascent, tossing his sword {{in the air and}} catching it as it fell, rode up to the English line. One man he pierced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lance,</b> another he <b>cut</b> down with his sword, and then fell dead under the blow of a heavy axe. This mad exploit had scarce terminated when the Norman infantry advanced up the hill. They were greeted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shower of stones and javelins, which slew many, but with unbroken front they pressed upwards until they reached the palisade. Here a desperate struggle began. The Norman sword and spear were met by the axes of the housecarls, and the clubs, spears, and forks of the levies. In vain Norman, Breton, Frenchmen, and Fleming strove to break the English line. The high position of the defenders gave them a great advantage over their assailants, among whose crowded ranks the javelin-men did great execution, while the Normans could receive little aid from their archers. Both sides fought with obstinate valour. The Norman battle-cry was [...] "God help us!" [...] the English [...] "God Almighty and the Holy Cross!" [...] The latter invocation being to the relic at Waltham, which was the king's special object of devotion.|$|R
5000|$|While the men {{take turns}} keeping guard, Jake pleads with Ortero to save Peggy and return her to Cold Stream. As night falls, several calls are heard outside and Jake tells the men they are {{surrounded}} by Indians who will attack soon. When the others dart outside, Ortero tells Jake {{that he was not}} responsible for the teenager's death at the bank, but Clint allowed him to believe it in hopes of binding Jake to him. As the Indian calls intensify, Rennie anxiously tells the men they should flee as it is apparent Clint has abandoned them. The men return to the saloon and are bickering about escaping, when Clint abruptly returns. As Burke hysterically announces that they must go, he is killed by <b>an</b> Indian <b>lance.</b> The building is quickly surrounded by Indians and a vicious fight breaks out. Clint runs outside to fight and soon after, Wexler and Rennie are killed by Indian arrows. When an Indian breaks in, Jake distracts him and Peggy kills him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lance.</b> Peggy then <b>cuts</b> Jake's ropes, and as Clint and Ortero fight off the last of the Indians, they attempt to escape, but are caught by Clint. After Ortero buries the others, Clint asks Jake {{to take him to the}} money, and Jake reveals it is in a saddlebag, buried three feet deep in the cemetery. Jake digs up the saddlebag, then surprises Clint by pulling out a pistol from it. Although Clint suspects the gun will not function after spending a year underground, he eventually surrenders his gun as does Ortero. Jake then asks Ortero to take Peggy away and he agrees, they two ride out of town despite her protests. After Ortero and Peggy depart, Jake gives Clint an opportunity to settle the score by tossing his gun several yards away. Frustrated, Clint dashes for the gun, while Jake hides among the dilapidated buildings, forcing Clint to search for him. After a tense game of [...] "cat-and-mouse," [...] Jake and Clint confront each other in the street and Jake kills Clint. Hearing the gunshots, Peggy and Ortero return for Jake.|$|R

However, in the actual robbery, the criminals tried but failed to achieve this <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thermal <b>lance</b> and ultimately had to use explosives instead.|$|R

50|$|Popular {{depictions of}} thermal lances {{sometimes}} exaggerate their capabilities. In the movie The Score Nick Wells (played by Robert De Niro) uses <b>a</b> thermal <b>lance</b> to <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> {{hole in the}} top of a safe, to avoid the safe's glass relocker device. A similar device was used in the 2012 film Stolen by Nicolas Cage's character. MythBusters tested the capabilities of the thermal lance and discovered opening <b>a</b> modern safe <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thermal <b>lance</b> takes far longer than depicted in popular accounts. The intense heat also destroyed the items inside the vault (however, in the test, the items were simply inside the safe, while in the clip of The Score, shown in the episode, the contents were themselves in boxes). MythBusters concluded that using <b>a</b> thermal <b>lance</b> for safe-cracking is plausible, but impractical.|$|R

5000|$|Legends about Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki's {{intervention}} {{on behalf of}} the besieged town were actually recorded shortly after Kaloyan's death. Robert of Clari wrote already before 1216 that the saint himself came to Kaloyan's tent and [...] "struck him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lance</b> through the body", causing his death. Stefan Nemanjić wrote down the same legend in 1216 in his hagiography about his father, Stefan Nemanja. John Staurakios, who compiled the legends of Saint Demetrius in the late 13th century, recorded that a man riding on a white horse struck Kaloyan <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lance.</b> Kaloyan, continued Staurakios, associated the attacker with Manastras, the commander of his mercenaries, who thus had to flee before Kaloyan's death. The legend was depicted on the walls of more than five Orthodox churches and monasteries. For instance, a fresco in the Decani Monastery depicts Saint Demetrius slaying Tsar Skaloyan.|$|R
50|$|As {{body armour}} improved, knight's shields became smaller, {{leading to the}} {{familiar}} heater shield style. Both kite and heater style shields were made of several layers of laminated wood (citation needed), <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gentle curve in cross section.

Eventually, specialised shapes were developed such as the bouche, which had <b>a</b> <b>lance</b> rest <b>cut</b> into the upper corner of the lance side, to help guide it in combat or tournament. Free standing shields called pavises, which were propped up on stands, were used by medieval crossbowmen who needed protection while reloading.|$|R
