25|$|Among {{the ancient}} Middle Eastern Akkadian people, a salzikrum <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> {{appeared}} biologically female but had distinct male traits. Salzikrum is a compound word meaning male daughter. According to the Code of Hammurabi, salzikrūm had inheritance rights {{like that of}} priestesses; they inherited from their fathers, unlike regular daughters. A salzikrum's father could also stipulate that she inherit a certain amount.|$|E
25|$|A common {{informer}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> {{provided evidence}} on criminal trials or prosecuted for breaches of Irish penal laws {{solely for the}} purpose of being rewarded with the penalty recovered, or a share of it. In medieval England, there was no police force and the state bureaucracy was insufficiently well developed to be able to ensure obedience to new laws. The practice of allowing the public to sue for penalties was successful and soon became widespread.|$|E
25|$|Restriction of Trusts and schemes: Swamiji <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> {{wanted to}} help people of every {{community}} {{and not just the}} Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin Community. Most schemes for welfare development were bound by trusts and schemes that allowed the benefit to go only to the members of that community alone. He wanted to be a true Jagadguru (Jagad = World + guru= Teacher). Thus He found discontentment in these projects and is cited as His chief reason to relinquish the title.|$|E

25|$|Vollenhoven <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> {{combined}} direct clarity {{with deep}} insight. He had an analytical mind that mastered many distinctions. He was pious, modest, obliging, and dedicated in his many tasks. In {{the faculty of}} Arts and Philosophy he gave, from 1926 till 1954, all the courses in philosophy: history of philosophy, general systematic philosophy, logic, and theoretical psychology (the latter {{was considered to be}} a philosophical discipline at the time), and also the mandatory introduction to philosophy for first-year students of all the faculties.|$|E
25|$|A {{crossing}} sweeper <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> would sweep a path {{ahead of}} people crossing dirty urban streets {{in exchange for}} a gratuity. This practice was an informal occupation among the urban poor, primarily during the 19th century. It was the focus of fairly intense study and commentary, and attitudes toward the presence of crossing sweepers on city streets varied greatly among urban residents, ranging from appreciation for their work to feelings that they were a public nuisance. Crossing sweepers also found their way into 19th-century fiction and artwork, including a novel by Charles Dickens and a popular painting by William Powell Frith.|$|E
25|$|A farmer (also {{called an}} agriculturer) {{is a person}} engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies {{to people who do}} some {{combination}} of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past, a farmer <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish).|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of learning, Trần Thủ Độ was praised as a skilled and devoted {{official}} of the Trần Dynasty, the ruling dynasty which was found by his very own effort. As a result, the grand chancellor held a position in royal court which was so powerful that he was suspected by some of overruling the Emperor. Once there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> went to the Emperor to report him about this suspicion, Thái Tông immediately visited Trần Thủ Độ's place with this man and made him tell everything {{in front of the}} grand chancellor. After hearing the story, Trần Thủ Độ not only accepted that the man had somewhat his reason but also awarded him for being concerned for the Trần Dynasty. His successful governing was considered by historical books as the main factor that not only led to the stability of Early Trần period but also contributed to the victory of Đại Việt over the first Mongol invasion.|$|E
500|$|Dodd {{was working}} on Bitter Springs as a tracker and {{interpreter}} for actor Michael Pate when Rafferty arranged {{for him to have}} an on-screen role. There was a positive relationship between the Indigenous Arrente people and the cast and crew, particularly Rafferty, involved in the location filming for Bitter Springs in the area of Quorn in northern South Australia. Michael Pate said that Rafferty [...] "wasn't a prejudiced person... Chips <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> appreciated the Aborigine [...] very much... he got on very well with the people". Dodd, meanwhile, appreciated Rafferty's vision for an Australian film industry and its potential to provide opportunities for Indigenous Australians.|$|E
500|$|When the Milken {{study was}} published, HUD had already {{commissioned}} its own study of seller-funded down-payment assistance programs. [...] It {{was performed by}} the Concentrance Consulting Group and published in March 2005 (herein, the [...] "Concentrance study"). [...] Unlike the earlier OIG reports, the Concentrance study was based largely on a cross-sectional analysis of data collected in interviews with individual homebuyers, sellers and various types of real-estate professionals in ten metropolitan areas. [...] Their findings corroborated some of the claims made by the nonprofit organizations, particularly that the typical recipient <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> would not otherwise {{have been able to}} become a home owner. [...] But the interviewees also generally corroborated some of the claims made by detractors of the programs—that sellers were routinely raising their sales prices to recoup the payment made to the nonprofit organization, and that the price increases led to higher loan costs for the buyers along with a higher risk of default on their loans. [...] The study was not restricted to the Nehemiah Program; no particular program was singled out {{in the body of the}} report. [...] However, the appendices gave summary results of questionnaire answers from real-estate professionals. [...] These results indicated that the Nehemiah Program was the most active program in the ten metropolitan areas covered by the study.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics of}} CBS and Dan Rather argued that by {{proceeding}} {{with the story}} when the documents had not been authenticated, CBS was exhibiting liberal bias and attempting to influence {{the outcome of the}} 2004 U.S. Presidential Election.

2500|$|... 1855, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan {{finished}} his scholarly, well researched and illustrated edition of Abul Fazl's Ai’n-e Akbari. Having finished {{the work to}} his satisfaction, and believing that Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> would appreciate his labours, Syed Ahmad approached the great Ghalib to write a taqriz (in the convention of the times, a laudatory foreword) for it. Ghalib obliged, but what he produced was a short Persian poem castigating the Ai’n-e Akbari and, by implication, the imperial, sumptuous, literate and learned Mughal culture of which it was a product. The least that could be said against {{it was that the}} book had little value even as an antique document. Ghalib practically reprimanded Syed Ahmad Khan for wasting his talents and time on dead things. Worse, he highly praised the [...] "sahibs of England" [...] who at that time held all the keys to all the a’ins in this world.|$|E

[...] During Ili Rebellion, Abbas sheltered the Yang family at his home. [...] When Abbas fell ill, Yang Fengyi (杨凤仪) nursed him for 40 days back to health. [...] In the spring of 1945 as fighting between Nationalists and the Ili rebels intensified, Yang Fengyi felt extreme family and social pressure. [...] In April, Yang Fengyi committed suicide using Abbas' pistol. [...] In a parting letter, she explained that she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> observed no ethnic boundaries but could not tolerate the atrocities committed around her. [...] She wrote that she had died for him, asked him to protect her family and urged him to live on [...] "for me, for the revolution and for the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang." [...] Abbas was heartbroken by Yang's death and ordered bans against killings of civilians.|$|E
