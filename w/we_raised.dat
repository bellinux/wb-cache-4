Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: [...] "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation... The money <b>we</b> <b>raised</b> was secondary, and although we had some money problems... they still got plenty... {{even though it was}} a drop in the ocean. The main thing was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended." [...] The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid.|$|E

500|$|The last {{scene in}} the film was {{arranged}} for {{the last day of}} filming. Initially, the language was supposed to be more somber and classical, but Meyer made some last minute changes. Flinn said that Meyer [...] "was in an optimistic mood", and the director suggested that Kirk quote Peter Pan for the last lines: [...] "Second star to the right, and straight on till morning." [...] Emotions ran high as the last shots of the cast were captured; Shatner said, [...] "By the time we finished the last scene, which extended longer than we expected, {{there was a sense of}} irritation. <b>We</b> <b>raised</b> a glass of champagne, but everybody was actually a little antsy." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the trial}} in December 2000, it emerged that Katz's claim that Abu Fahmi, one of the witnesses, had told him the [...] "army rounded up the villagers, lined them {{up against a wall}} and shot them", was incorrect. When the court {{examined}} Katz's tapes of his interviews, it did not find such a statement. On the contrary, Abu Fahmi said repeatedly, [...] "We did not see them killing after <b>we</b> <b>raised</b> our hands." [...] According to Morris, it is telling that [...] "no residents went on record in 1948 or any time before the 1990s to claim there had been a massacre." [...] In August 1998, a former resident of the village, Mahmoud al Yihiya Yihiya, published a book about Tantura in which he describes the battle and names 52 villagers who died, but does not call it a massacre.|$|E
