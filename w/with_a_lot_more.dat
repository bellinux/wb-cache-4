25|$|Women {{were the}} primary vehicle for rumors that touched upon issues of family and {{everyday}} life. Fears that collectivization {{would result in the}} socialization of children, the export of women’s hair, communal wife-sharing, and the notorious common blanket affected many women, causing them to revolt. For example, when it was announced that a collective farm in Crimea would become a commune and that the children would be socialized, women killed their soon-to-be socialized livestock, which spared the children. Stories that the Communists believed short hair gave women a more urban and industrial look insulted peasant women. After local activists in a village in North Caucasus actually confiscated all blankets, more fear dispersed among villagers. The common blanket meant that all men and women would sleep on a seven-hundred meter long bed under a seven-hundred-meter long blanket. Historians argue that women took advantage of these rumors without actually believing them so they could attack the collective farm “under the guise of irrational, nonpolitical protest.” Women were less vulnerable to retaliation than peasant men, and therefore able to get away <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E

Cultural changes are happening because people can upload their gaming experiences to a Web 2.0 tool like Facebook and YouTube for the world to see. Consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have WiFi connectivity and chat rooms on most of their video games that allow gamer-to-gamer conversations around the world. They also allow people to connect to YouTube, so if they stream/record a gamer, it allows for easy uploading to YouTube for the world to see. Even the older video game consoles are becoming new media because YouTube can display the walkthroughs and let's plays of the game. YouTube gaming is evolving because some YouTubers are getting wealthy and earning money from their videos. The more people that become YouTube members, the popular YouTube becomes and the more it starts emerging as a new source of media, along with video games and consoles. The chat room/online gaming/WiFi consoles are getting the highest increase in popularity because they are not only the most advanced, but because of the newest video games being created {{that the majority of the}} gaming community wants to buy, play and watch. The older video games and consoles also get popularity, but from YouTube's capabilities of uploading them to the gamer's channels for everyone to see. The older games get popularity from the communities nostalgia of the game(s), and the old school graphics and gameplay that made people see how old-school technology was the best at some point in time. Facebook helps those video games and consoles get popularity as well. People can upload the videos they create to Facebook as well.

500|$|Loveless {{was largely}} {{recorded}} in mono sound, as Shields felt it {{important that the}} album's sound consisted of [...] "the guitar smack bang {{in the middle and}} no chorus, no modulation effect". Shields wavers his guitar's tremolo bar as he strums, which contributes, in part, to the band's distinctive sound. This technique—nicknamed [...] "Glide guitar"—causes the guitar strings to bend slightly in and out of tune. Shields said that due to his use of the tremolo bar, [...] "People were thinking it's hundreds of guitars, when it's actually got less guitar tracks than most people's demo tapes have." [...] The guitarist asserted that unlike other bands of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s, My Bloody Valentine did not use chorus or flanger pedals. He insisted, [...] "No other band played that guitar like me [...] We did everything solely with the tremolo arm".

500|$|When The Fabulous Baker Boys was {{released}} in 1989, the idea of Pfeiffer portraying a sex worker who becomes a singer immediately garnered attention from the media. Pfeiffer's performance of [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] was used heavily to promote the film; the attention garnered by this particular musical sequence rivaled those of every other film released that year. Pfeiffer continued to generate significant press even after the studio was forced to remove The Fabulous Baker Boys from most theaters to which it had initially been released due to financial concerns. In 1990, Empire magazine published an article entitled [...] "The Fabulous Pfeiffer Girl" [...] in homage to the actress' role. Ultimately, Pfeiffer's performance garnered widespread acclaim from nearly every critic who reviewed the film. The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin wrote that [...] "Pfeiffer is [...] unexpected... choice for this musical bombshell" [...] but ultimately admitted that she [...] "proves to be electrifyingly right." [...] According to Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel, [...] "Pfeiffer does as much for this movie as her Susie does for the Baker boys' act", praising all of her musical performances. Referencing one of her character's lines in which Susie negatively compares the song [...] "Feelings" [...] to parsley, Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers insisted, [...] "Michelle Pfeiffer... is not parsley. Take her out of this movie, and the movie would evaporate." [...] Travers credits the actress with resurrecting the film during its final moments, opining, [...] "The bounce goes out of the movie until Pfeiffer returns to wrap things up", concluding, [...] "the Bridges brothers are a winning pair. But make no mistake: It's Michelle Pfeiffer who puts the 'fabulous' into Baker Boys." [...] Steve Simels of Entertainment Weekly agreed that Pfeiffer [...] "saves Baker Boys from cliché", going on to hail the actress as [...] "a marvel... so funny and vulnerable that she almost makes her indifferently written bad-girl-with-a-heart-of-gold into something three-dimensional and believable." [...] Vanity Fairs Katey Rich concurred: [...] "The film is ostensibly about the Baker (and Bridges) boys, but Pfeiffer stole the show" [...] by [...] "endow her lounge-singer character <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> soul and vulnerability than she needed to." [...] Contributing to The Morton Report, Chaz Lipp agreed that [...] "Pfeiffer feels absolutely authentic in the role... put just the right spin on her line readings to sidestep cliche at every turn", appreciating the actress for interpreting Susie as more than simply a stock character. Despite lamenting that the three main actors [...] "become less interesting" [...] {{towards the end of}} the film, TV Guide agreed that although [...] "the Bridges boys give typically solid performances, it's Pfeiffer who deserves the most credit". The Independents David Thomson was particularly impressed with Pfeiffer's singing, opining, [...] "Anyone who can sing like that would be in Las Vegas, not holding together a piano act in the bars and clubs of Seattle".
