5|$|According to Dallas, {{it rained}} on days that <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sunny, while other days of {{production}} lacked rain when they <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rainy. Goodwin {{added that the}} scene of Snow and Charming releasing the birds was freezing because of the heavy rain. Their scene in the cabin {{took place on the}} first day of the episode's production. Her near-death scene involved a real cliff, though the height was exaggerated later using CGI and a green screen; a stunt double stood in for some of the shots.|$|E
5|$|The {{northbound}} side platforms of Bay Ridge Avenue and 77th Street do {{not have}} platform pillars because the platforms <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> temporary; however, the southbound platforms do have pillars.|$|E
5|$|Hoover's {{influence}} {{extended beyond}} federal government employees {{and beyond the}} loyalty-security programs. The records of loyalty review hearings and investigations <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confidential, but Hoover routinely gave evidence from them to congressional committees such as HUAC.|$|E

5|$|French {{military}} forces occupied the citadel during the French Mandate period in Syria (1920–1946). During the Great Syrian Revolt in 1925, the French shelled Al-Hariqa, the area immediately {{south of the}} citadel—where Syrian rebels <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present—from positions in the hills {{to the north of}} the city, and from the citadel itself. This bombardment resulted in widespread destruction. After the French Mandate period, the citadel continued to serve as a prison and barracks until 1986.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 Peace Agreement between Israel and Jordan it {{was decided}} that {{operations}} <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transferred from Eilat Airport to Aqaba Airport. The original plan was to rename Aqaba Airport as Aqaba-Eilat Peace International Airport. The agreement was never followed, however, and an agreement between the two countries in March 1997, stipulated that domestic flights would continue to use Eilat Airport, whilst no further action to move international flights took place.|$|E
5|$|The decisive {{battle between}} Ottokar II and Rudolph I {{took place on}} 25 August 1278 in the known Battle on the Marchfeld. As many 1/3 of the Czech army <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allied with the Polish troops. Przemysł II wasn't among them, because he was then in Ląd. However this doesn't mean that, as historians speculate, he didn't send troops to the Bohemian King as was planned.|$|E
5000|$|... "Kings Oak" [...] <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{slightly}} larger than Tanworth, and in later years the production crew also used Bristol Road in Selly Oak {{as part of the}} village.

5|$|A {{number of}} SmarTrip {{features}} that <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> introduced in 2005 by SmarTrip's creator, Cubic Transportation Systems, were not fully implemented until 2012. Initially, riders could only add value to a SmarTrip card at Metrorail stations or by using cash while boarding a Metrobus. In November 2008, {{after years of}} delays, WMATA announced that customers would {{have the ability to}} add funds to their SmarTrip cards online by September 2009, but that deadline was missed. WMATA did launch SmarTrip's online reload feature in September 2011. WMATA allowed customers to load a seven-day unlimited Metrorail pass to their SmarTrip cards in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E
5|$|As noon {{drew near}} with no sight of either Huger or Magruder, who <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> manning the Confederate right flank, Lee {{replaced}} these two {{forces with the}} smaller units of Brig. Gens. Armistead and Wright, two of Huger's brigades that had reached the battlefield some time earlier. Huger and his other two brigades (under Brig. Gens. Ransom and Mahone) were still too far north of the scene. Despite the mishaps and disunity, Malvern Hill {{would be the first}} time during the Seven Days Battles that Lee managed to concentrate his force.|$|E

3000|$|... {{guardrail}} <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> partly recycled; {{the steel}} {{will be fully}} recycled while the zinc <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sent <b>to</b> landfill despite the proposal of using some new technical solutions in order to recycle the zinc. These hypotheses reflect the adopted solution in the Italian context.|$|R
50|$|The 1936 Hong Kong {{municipal}} election <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> held on 13 January 1936 {{for the one}} of the 2 unofficial seats in the Urban Council of Hong Kong.

5|$|City were relegated again {{five seasons}} later, but when O'Rourke was reappointed as manager before the 1928–29 season, they broke several club records to earn {{promotion}} back to Division Two. After eight seasons in Division Two, City returned to Division Three, and they {{remained in the}} third and fourth tiers of the English football league system until 1985–86. During that time, they endured several periods of financial hardship, and in 1985, their ground suffered a disastrous fire in which 56people died, on a day the club and their fans <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> celebrating promotion.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse {{arrived at}} Cap-Français on 15 August. He {{immediately}} dispatched {{his response to}} Rochambeau's note, which {{was that he would}} make for the Chesapeake. Taking on 3,200 troops, De Grasse sailed from Cap-Français with his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line. Sailing outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid notice, he arrived at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on August 30, and disembarked the troops to assist in the land blockade of Cornwallis. Two British frigates that <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on patrol outside the bay were trapped inside the bay by de Grasse's arrival; this prevented the British in New York from learning the full strength of de Grasse's fleet until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} Farmer left office, Comer {{announced}} that he had requested a full audit of the department by newly elected Democratic State Auditor Adam Edelen. Among the items Comer asked Edelen to investigate were 171 items of missing agriculture department property valued at about $334,000 and another 103 items worth about $146,000 that <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> returned to the state as surplus but could not be accounted for. A week later, Farmer returned some of the missing items.|$|E
5000|$|... iTunes {{labeled the}} tracks 18, 19 & 20 incorrectly. Track 18 (Vestige) <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Circle VII: Sins Of The Lion; Track 19 (Lullaby of the Crucified) should be Vestige; and Track 20 <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Lullaby of the Crucified instead of Before Him All Shall Scatter.|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Part of the Plan" [...] <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the third}} {{official}} single {{but due to}} low record sales and not enough promotion it was eventually dropped. The music video <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> based on the movie Crash and <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> directed by {{the director of the}} movie himself, Paul Haggis.

5|$|On August 11, 1944, the 258 {{men from}} the prison barge were marched to a nearby sports field and lectured by Admiral Wright who told them that troops {{fighting}} on Saipan desperately needed the ammunition they <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loading and that continued refusal to work would be treated as mutinous conduct, which carried {{the death penalty in}} times of war. Wright, who had seen nearly 400 of his men killed in 1942 in the Battle of Tassafaronga, said that although loading ammunition was risky, death by firing squad was the greater hazard.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiation}} doses {{received in}} these two accidents are not known with any semblance of accuracy. A {{large part of the}} dose was due to neutron radiation, which could not be measured by dosimetry equipment of the day. The available equipment, film badges, were not worn by personnel during the accident, and badges that <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> planted under tables in case of disasters like these were not found. Disaster badges hung on the walls did provide some useful data about gamma radiation.|$|E
5|$|Two federal cavalry {{divisions}} {{encountered the}} remnants of General Early's army at Waynesboro, Virginia, on March 2. Most of Early's army was killed or captured, although Early evaded capture. Custer's division did the fighting. His 1st Brigade dismounted and attacked as infantry, then the 3rd Brigade charged and cut off over half of Early's force—which forced {{that portion of the}} rebels to surrender. All of Early's headquarters equipment was captured, as were 11 pieces of artillery. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry captured 200 wagons loaded with supplies that <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sent to Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Early's army was eliminated from the war.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} innovation of the 4th {{century was}} the corps of protectores, which contained cadet senior officers. Although protectores <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> soldiers who had risen through the ranks by meritorious service, it became a widespread practice to admit to the corps young men from outside the army (often the sons of senior officers). The protectores formed a corps that was both an officer training-school and pool of staff officers available to carry out special tasks for the magistri militum or the emperor. Those attached to the emperor were known as protectores domestici and organised in four scholae under a comes domesticorum. After a few years' service in the corps, a protector would normally be granted a commission by the emperor and placed in command of a military regiment.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included Bahias sister , the aging cruiser , and the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their potential power, however, was dwarfed by the dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat, and the numbers of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Geneva Accord {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind {{for up to}} eight months in some areas. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their equipment to the RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UN peacekeepers, named the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). Furthermore, the RSK forces remained in areas outside designated UNPAs which were under RSK control {{at the time of}} the signing of the Implementation Agreement ceasefire of 3 January 1992. Those areas, later better known as the pink zones, <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> restored to Croatian control from the outset of the plan implementation. Failure of this aspect of the implementation of the Vance plan made the pink zones a major source of contention for Croatia and the RSK.|$|E
