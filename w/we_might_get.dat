I really figured <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> a season and a cult following, and that might be it." [...] In an interview, Tom Kenny told that [...] "What I'm most proud of is that kids still really like it and care about it [...] They eagerly await new episodes. People who were young children when it started 10 years ago are still watching it and digging it and think it's funny. That's the loving cup for me." ...|$|E

500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants was an {{immediate}} hit. Within its first month on air, it overtook Pokémon (1997) as the highest-rated Saturday morning children's series. By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television. Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change {{increased the number of}} older viewers significantly. By May 2002, the show's total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49. Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: [...] "I never imagined that it would get to this point. When you set out to do a show about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for children. I can tell you that we hoped it would be liked by adults. But we really thought the best we could hope for was a college audience." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has gone on {{to become one of the}} longest-running series on Nickelodeon. [...] "Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that. ...I really figured <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> a season and a cult following, and that might be it," [...] Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show's tenth anniversary.

According to Burk, [...] "The creative team has fleshed out an entire backstory which, if we're lucky, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> to explore in future films". Abrams stated that {{he does not want to}} rush into the development of the sequel merely because the first film has been a success; he explained that he would rather create a sequel that is true to the previous film.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson became {{president}} upon {{the assassination of}} President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, and the goodwill generated by the incident gave him tremendous popularity. He enjoyed strong support against the bitterly divided Republicans; polls in January 1964 showed him leading Republican challengers Barry Goldwater 75% to 20% and Nelson Rockefeller 74% to 17%. However, Wallace had received over 100,000 letters and telegrams of support, nearly half from non-southerners, following his 1963 Stand in the Schoolhouse Door in defiance of {{a court order to}} integrate the University of Alabama, and he subsequently became [...] "Tennyson's Mordred, exposing the dark side of Camelot". He began a national speaking tour with a well-received lecture at Harvard on November 7, 1963, bringing him additional notoriety as he flirted {{with the idea of a}} national campaign.

[...] Meanwhile, Johnson forbade discussion of politics in the White House and refused to comment on whether he would run in the 1964 election, instead pursuing the late Kennedy's legislative agenda (most notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964), managing the Vietnam War, and declaring his own [...] "War on Poverty".|$|E
