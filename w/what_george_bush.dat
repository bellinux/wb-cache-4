Harper emerged as Day's main rival, and declared his own candidacy on December 3, 2001. He eventually won {{the support of}} at least 28 Alliance MPs, including Scott Reid, James Rajotte and Keith Martin. During the campaign, Harper reprised his earlier warnings against an alliance with Quebecois nationalists, and called for his party to become the federalist option in Quebec. He argued that [...] "the French language is not imperilled in Quebec", and opposed [...] "special status" [...] for the province in the Canadian Constitution accordingly. He also endorsed greater provincial autonomy on Medicare, {{and said that he}} would not co-operate with the Progressive Conservatives {{as long as they were}} led by Joe Clark. On social issues, Harper argued for [...] "parental rights" [...] to use corporal punishment against their children and supported raising the age of sexual consent. He described his potential support base as [...] "similar to <b>what</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> tapped".|$|E

The links to al Qaeda that the president talked about were not there.... While I appreciate that there was an effort to make people in this county think that was a connection... the fact is that's not true." ...|$|E

Watkins explores the criminal justice system, the educational system, and the economic systems of America, using statistics and anecdotes to describe likely fates for President Bush and other privileged individuals if they were poor and Black.|$|R

2500|$|US President Barack Obama {{said that}} the {{agreement}} {{would need to be}} built on in the future and that [...] "We've come a long way but we have much further to go."

In 2014 he authored the book Genesis: Truman, American Jews, and the Origins of the Arab/Israeli Conflict in which he discussed {{the connection between the}} Israel lobby in the United States and the origin of the modern state of Israel. In 2016, {{he published}} The Populist Explosion: How the Great Recession Transformed American and European Politics. This book, which was widely reviewed, analyzed, among other things, the remarkable success of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.|$|R
2500|$|Some had {{wondered}} if Tiner's liberal newspaper editorials had cost him potential {{votes in the}} congressional race. Tiner {{said that he had}} not expected his editorials to become a campaign issue. When the editorials became part of the campaign, Tiner called himself [...] "a conservative with a heart", a designation like <b>what</b> <b>George</b> W. <b>Bush</b> would late dub as [...] "compassionate conservatism". When Tiner was questioned about a change in his position to support navigation of the Red River and American aid to the Contras in Nicaragua, he said that the previous opposition to both proposals came from the Shreveport Journal editorial board, not himself: [...] "The Shreveport Journal is not running for Congress. ... I'm coming out from behind the printing press ... two years from now the {{people will be able to}} see what I am." ...|$|R
40|$|THE American F 16 jetfighters that {{attacked}} an {{area near}} the Iraqi towns of Fallujah and Tikrit with 5001 b bombs last weekend have contradicted <b>what</b> President <b>George</b> W. <b>Bush</b> had confidently proclaimed in May. Bush had on May 1 proudly announced the official end of major combat by the invading forces, and that the situation in Iraq was "firmly under US control". The bombing, the first after that Bush announcement, is part of Qperation Ivy Cyclone â€” a new drive to root out guerillas around Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown. It {{was intended as a}} "show of force" designed to scare unknown assailants (at one time assumed as undeter mined and unskilled) who were re sponsible for shooting down a Chinook transport helicopter on Nov 2, killing 16 US soldiers, the largest single casualty so far...|$|R

5000|$|Aaron L. Friedberg, {{professor}} {{of politics and}} international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, believes U.S. strategy toward China has coupled engagement with balancing. [...] "The engagement half of this strategy has been geared toward enmeshing China in global trade and international institutions, discouraging it from challenging the status quo, and giving it incentives to become <b>what</b> the <b>George</b> W. <b>Bush</b> administration termed a 'responsible stakeholder' in the existing international system." [...] The other half attempts to maintain the balance of power, deter aggression, and mitigate any attempts of coercion. Friedberg believes more emphasis {{has been placed on}} the former and not the latter. [...] "The problem with the pivot is that to date it lacks serious substance. The actions it has entailed either have been merely symbolic, such as the pending deployment of a small number of U.S. marines to Australia, or have involved simply the reallocation of existing air and naval assets from other theaters." ...|$|R

40|$|Ten {{years after}} the {{terrorist}} attacks on New York and Washington DC on September 11, 2001, the United States remains embroiled in a long-term struggle with <b>what</b> <b>George</b> W. <b>Bush</b> termed the existential threat of international terrorism. On the campaign trail, his successor as US President, Barack Obama, promised to reboot the 'war on terror'. He claimed that his new administration would step back from the rhetoric and much of the Bush administration policy, conducting a counterterrorism campaign that would be more morally acceptable, more focused and more effective-smarter, better, nimbler, stronger. This article demonstrates, however, that those expecting wholesale changes to US counterterrorism policy misread Obama's intentions. It argues that Obama always intended to deepen Bush's commitment to counterterrorism {{while at the same time}} ending the 'distraction' of the Iraq War. Rather than being trapped by Bush's institutionalized construction of a global war on terror, the continuities in counterterrorism can be explained by Obama's shared conception of the imperative of reducing the terrorist threat to the US. The article assesses whether Obama has pursued a more effective counterterrorism policy than his predecessor and explores how his rhetoric has been reconstituted as the actions of his policy have unfolded. By addressing his policies toward Afghanistan and Pakistan, Guantanamo Bay and torture, the uses of unmanned drone attacks and domestic wire-tapping, this article argues that Obama's 'war' against terrorism is not only in keeping with the assumptions and priorities of the last ten years but also that it is just as problematic as that of his predecessor...|$|R
