How and <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{describe}} my method of remaining under water, or how long I can stay without eating; and I do not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use them as means of destruction {{at the bottom of the}} sea, by sending ships to the bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them. And although I will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.|$|E

500|$|On September 22, 2011, an 18-year-old Melanie Amaro {{performed}} [...] "Listen" [...] on {{the second}} day of the opening week of first season of The X Factor in the US. As commented by both Becky Bain of Idolator and Jennifer Still of the British entertainment and media news website Digital Spy, the [...] "powerful [...] emotional" [...] performance [...] "deservedly brought the judges to their feet". Amaro received a standing ovation from the audience and panel of judges alike. The performance of Amaro also brought Nicole Scherzinger to tears. She said: [...] "This is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> this. People like you inspire me. You made a believer out of me. Thank you." [...] Paula Abdul said: [...] "You are the brightest gift, God bless you." [...] L.A. Reid declared: [...] "Melanie, you are truly amazing. You have the gift, you have the soul, you have the spirit, you have the swagger ... you have the X Factor" [...] while Simon Cowell said: [...] "When I was asked by a lot of people why I was bringing this show to America, it was because I hoped that we were going to find someone like you." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{warfare and}} the inner value of the Russian opponent, the dull mass had two kinds of [...] "ideas": the tsar and God. Today, there is neither. Bolshevism has taken their place. I {{consider}} {{that to be a}} weakness since I never believed that this idea means anything to the bulk of the Russian people. That is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe that the people will be carried away by Bolshevism. They will soon be indifferent and fatalistic.|$|E
2500|$|While {{some have}} {{stressed}} her queer, feminist, pro-immigration, and democratic politics, her statements on immigration include sentiments {{that would be}} considered racist today. In a 1934 interview published in The New York Times she stated: That is the reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not approve of the stringent immigration laws in America today. We need the stimulation of new blood. It is best to favor healthy competition. There {{is no reason why}} we should not select our immigrants with greater care, nor why we should not bar certain peoples and preserve the color line for instance. But if we shut down on immigration completely we shall become stagnant.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked why}} he writes, King responds: [...] "The {{answer to that is}} fairly simple—there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it. I really can't imagine doing {{anything}} else and I can't imagine not doing what I do." [...] He is also often {{asked why he}} writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: [...] "Why do you assume I have a choice?" [...] King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.|$|E

2500|$|The Chilcot report {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of the Iraq Inquiry was issued on 6 July 2016 and it criticised Blair for joining the US in the war in Iraq in 2003. Afterwards, Blair issued a statement and held a two-hour press conference to apologise and to justify the decisions he had made in 2003 [...] "in good faith" [...] and denying allegations that the war had led to a significant increase in terrorism. He acknowledged that the report made [...] "real and material criticisms of preparation, planning, process and of the relationship with the United States" [...] but cited sections of the report that he said [...] "should lay to rest allegations of bad faith, lies or deceit". He stated: [...] "whether people agree or disagree with my decision to take military action against Saddam Hussein; I took it in good faith and in what I believed to be {{the best interests of the}} country.... I will take full responsibility for any mistakes without exception or excuse. I will at the same time say why, nonetheless, I believe that it was better to remove Saddam Hussein and <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe this is the cause of the terrorism we see today whether in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world".|$|E

K M Shafiullah, S Force commander, and a handful of others were also among the hundreds of local masses who surrounded the event from a distance. [...] "No protocol was set on what they were supposed to do". A fact Shafiullah admitted himself. [...] "We rushed to the Race Course from the airport. I was a member of Bangladesh delegation. But we were not sure what we were supposed to do. I {{was standing in front of}} the signing table. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not appear in any photographs. There was rejoicing all around. We put Niazi on a jeep and sent him away. That night I did not come across anyone." [...] -Major General Shafiullah spoke to Kaushik Sankar Das.|$|E
