A bitter argument ensues and the village decides to hire an assassin from town to carry out the deed. Ma enlists the help of an old man known as One Stroke Liu (Chen Qiang), a former Imperial executioner. He is told that being beheaded by Liu feels like a passing breeze, and that the severed head <b>will</b> <b>roll</b> nine times on the ground, blink three times, and smile in a gesture of gratitude for such a painless death. However, Liu fails to harm either prisoner with one stroke. Claiming that it is the will of Heaven, Liu leaves with the prisoners uninjured.|$|E

500|$|About {{four days}} in advance of a typical {{tropical}} cyclone, an ocean [...] of [...] in height <b>will</b> <b>roll</b> in about every 10 seconds, moving towards the coast {{from the direction of}} the tropical cyclone's location. [...] The ocean swell will slowly increase in height and frequency the closer a tropical cyclone gets to land. [...] Two days in advance of the center's passage, winds go calm as the tropical cyclone interrupts the environmental wind flow. [...] Within 36 hours of the center passage, the pressure begins to fall and a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the cyclone's direction. [...] Within 24 hours of the closest approach to the center, low clouds begin to move in, also known as the bar of a tropical cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. [...] Within 18 hours of the center's approach, squally weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. [...] Winds increase within 12 hours of the center's approach, occasionally reaching hurricane force. [...] The ocean's surface becomes whipped with foam. [...] Small items begin flying in the wind. [...] Within 6 hours of the center's arrival, rain becomes continuous and the storm surge begins to come inland. [...] Within an hour of the center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. [...] When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the eye moves overhead. [...] At this point, the pressure ceases to drop as the lowest pressure within the storm's center is reached. [...] This is also when the peak depth of the storm surge occurs. [...] Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. [...] The storm surge retreats as the pressure suddenly rises in the wake of its center. [...] One day after the center's passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent. [...] By 36 hours after the center's passage, the high overcast breaks and the pressure begins to level off.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} was done, Music for Nations founder Martin Hooker {{wanted to}} arrange a triple bill UK tour in March / April 1984 with Exciter, Metallica, and The Rods. However, the Hell on Earth Tour never materialized because of poor ticket sales. To promote Ride the Lightning, Metallica commenced the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour on November 16, in Rouen, France, with British NWOBHM band Tank as support. The tour continued with dates in Belgium, Italy, Germany, and the Nordic countries to an average crowd of 1,300. After a Christmas break, the group embarked on a 50-date North American tour, firstly as a co-headlining act with W.A.S.P. and then as headliners with Armored Saint supporting. At a gig in Portland, Oregon, Metallica covered [...] "The Money <b>Will</b> <b>Roll</b> Right In" [...] by Fang, with Armored Saint onstage. The American leg ended in May 1985, and the band spent the following two months working on the next studio album, Master of Puppets, whose recording sessions were scheduled to begin in September. Metallica performed at the Monsters of Rock festival held at Castle Donington in England on August 17 in front of 70,000 fans. The band was placed between Ratt and Bon Jovi, two glam metal groups whose sound and appearance were much unlike Metallica's. At {{the start of the}} set, Hetfield pronounced to the audience: [...] "If you came here to see spandex, eye make-up, and the words 'oh baby' in every fuckin' song, this ain't the fuckin' band!" [...] Two weeks later, Metallica appeared on the Day on the Green festival in Oakland, California, before 90,000 people. The last show Metallica played before recording began was the Loreley Metal Hammer festival in Germany, headlined by Venom. Metallica finished 1985 with a show at the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium on December 29 opening for Y, and a New Year's Eve concert at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on a bill with Metal Church, Exodus, and Megadeth, the first time Metallica and Megadeth shared a stage. At this gig, Metallica premiered [...] "Master of Puppets" [...] and [...] "Disposable Heroes", songs from the then-upcoming third studio album.|$|E

2500|$|Without tilting, {{the lowest}} {{possible}} score is theoretically 300,000, by shooting each ball through the graveyard without hitting anything and letting it drain (the ball <b>will</b> <b>roll</b> over a trigger that gives no points but disables the replay that is normally given when a ball hits no trigger).

2500|$|These {{arguments}} are countered in two ways.

Outside of specific contexts, interest rates caps {{had the effect of}} allowing small loans in most areas without an increase of [...] "loan sharking". [...] Next, since 80% of payday borrowers <b>will</b> <b>roll</b> their loan over at least one time [...] because their income prevents them from paying the principal within the repayment period, they often report turning to friends or family members to help repay the loan [...] according to a 2012 report from the Center for Financial Services Innovation.

2500|$|In early Mormonism, God's Kingdom {{was thought}} of as an {{amalgamation}} between two distinct yet intimately related parts.
