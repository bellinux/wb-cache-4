5000|$|According to Nevin Hubbard of the M.D. Hubbard Spring Company, the <b>Welch</b> <b>plug</b> was {{originally}} {{designed in the}} 1900s by the Welch brothers at the Welch Motor Car Company of Pontiac, Michigan. Hubbard claims that [...] "at that time core holes in the engine blocks were fitted with pipe plugs. During one of these run-ins a pipe plug backed out. In order {{to get back on}} the road one of the brothers drove a quarter or half dollar into the hole. From this they developed the <b>Welch</b> <b>plug,</b> some with the help of my great grandfather Martin Hubbard. They then patented the plug and the M.D. Hubbard Spring Company became the sole manufacturer of the <b>Welch</b> <b>plug</b> for the life of the patent." ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Welch</b> <b>plug,</b> (misnomer: Welsh plug), is a thin, domed disc, of a {{metallic}} alloy, which is pressed, convex side out, into a casting hole and against an internal shoulder. Alternatively a non-ferrous metal such as brass offers improved corrosion prevention. When struck with a hammer, the dome collapses slightly, expanding it laterally {{to seal the}} hole. Other core plugs have a dish design, so that when pressed into the casting hole the tapered sides form the seal.|$|E
