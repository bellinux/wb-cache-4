5|$|Soma Bringer is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where players {{take control of}} members of a military unit dubbed Pharzuph Division 7. The three-dimensional environments are explored from a top-down perspective, and the overhead camera can be zoomed in and out on the playable character. Seven characters {{are available at the}} start of the game, with an eighth being unlocked later on. The game uses two modes of play. In single-player, the player controls the party leader while the two assigned companions are controlled using the game's artificial intelligence. In addition to the single-player mode, the game features cooperative (co-op) multiplayer. Activated through <b>wireless</b> <b>connection,</b> up to three players can freely explore environments and team up for dungeons.|$|E
5|$|There are six {{different}} specialized combat roles equivalent to standard character classes. They are Battlers (warriors), Dark (dark knights), Gunners, Kanbus (ninja), Koas (paladins), and Somas (mages). A character's class determines {{what types of}} weapons and skills they can equip. Each class consequently uses a different fighting style: the Kanbus focuses on dual weapons and one-hit attacks, the Koas focuses {{on a combination of}} attack and healing abilities, the Dark sacrifices health to deal heavier damage, Gunners specialize in long-range attacks, Battlers focuses on melee attacks, and the Somas use long-range magic over close-range physical attacks. Weapons are equipped based on a character's class, and can be upgraded using special items called Orbs. Weapons and items collected through exploration and from enemy drops can be sold to other players through <b>wireless</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E

40|$|Wireless Internet service shows {{great promise}} in {{allowing}} users to have nation-wide, ubiquitous Internet access. Two varieties of service are forming. In one variety, a user is given free wireless access either as advertising or {{as a public}} service. In another, the user pays for wireless access from a com-mercial provider, must like a wired ISP. However, {{the very nature of}} wireless creates some additional technical problems which wired connections do not have to consider. Because <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> use collision avoidance rather than collision detection, <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> have additional overhead. In addition, because <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> use RF signals rather than hard-to-tap wire, they are vulnerable to eavesdropping. Also, <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> are susceptible to freeloading if proper authentication is not implemented. The current security protocol,WEP, is fatally flawed due to improper imple-mentation and use of a weak key. Before commercial services can mature, these problems with authentication and security must be satisfactorily dealt with. 2...|$|R

30|$|Pande et al. also {{analyzed}} hybrid NoC architectures [21]. The simulated networks had 128, 256, and 512 cores, {{and for all}} of {{them the}} number of cores in each sub-network was set to be 16, and only the number of sub-networks varied. Sub-network cores were connected in a mesh topology using wires. Wired and <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> were used to connect sub-networks. The number of <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> varied between 1, 6, and 24. Initially, the wireless links were randomly distributed and the distributions that obtained the best results were later determined. The conclusion was that inserting long-ranged <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> in a NoC significantly improves its performance. Additionally, the performance gains are more significant as the system grows in size.|$|R

30|$|A network {{split into}} sub-networks and {{interconnected}} using wired and <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> is also shown by Ganguly et al. [14]. The proposal consists of sub-networks using mesh topology {{in which the}} cores are connected {{to each other and}} to a central hub by wires. In the second level of the network, all of the sub-networks are also connected by wires in a ring topology. Initially, the available <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> are probabilistically distributed among pairs of hubs, based on the distance between them, measured in number of hops. After network start-up, the simulated annealing heuristic is used to reassign <b>wireless</b> <b>connections</b> for performance optimization. Tests were conducted with 128, 256, and 512 simulated cores, varying the number of sub-networks and the number of cores per sub-network. Results showed that the proposed network achieved better transfer rates and lower energy dissipation and delay.|$|R

25|$|The Adapter was {{developed}} by Mad Catz by experimenting with all legacy Xbox 360 controllers they wanted to support and verifying what inputs they sent via <b>wireless</b> <b>connection.</b> They also worked with a former Microsoft employee that had experience with the Xbox 360's wireless features for additional insight. Existing USB microphones remain compatible with Rock Band 4. Harmonix was also working to get backward compatibility for the Stage Kit, an add-on hardware unit for Xbox 360 owners that allowed for a smoke machine and light show display {{in time with the}} song. Owing to the game's focus on core gameplay, and concerns that consumers may be unwilling to buy additional hardware for specific games early in a console generation's lifecycle, Rock Band 4 did not feature additional accessories. At retail, the game is available in a band bundle, with a guitar, drum, and microphone, and a guitar-only bundle.|$|E
25|$|The Telegraphy Administration took {{contact with}} the Marconi Company in 1899 to inquire about {{purchasing}} wireless systems. The thought had been to use a <b>wireless</b> <b>connection</b> to places where laying a cable would be prohibitively expensive, but high license costs caused them to dismiss a purchase. The agency established a cooperation with the navy in 1901, and the following year the decided to launch a program to establish wireless connections to the islands of Røst, Værøy, Træna and Grip. Røst and Værøy were selected for a trial to connected them to Sørvågen, based on {{the high costs of}} laying a cable in Moskstraumen, estimated at five times the cost of a wireless system. The system would also act as a trial to select a manufacturer. Marconi was disregarded because of its high price, but both Telefunken and Société Française de Télégraphes & Téléphones sans fils systems were installed in 1903 on a trial basis.|$|E
