500|$|William Gibson is an American-Canadian <b>writer</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> {{been called}} the [...] "noir prophet" [...] of the {{cyberpunk}} subgenre of science fiction. Since first being published in the late 1970s, Gibson has written more than twenty short stories and nine critically acclaimed novels. His early works are bleak, noir near-future stories {{about the relationship between}} humans and technology – a [...] "combination of lowlife and high tech".

[...] An opinion piece in the magazine West Africa said the book deserved to win the Booker Prize, and that Achebe was [...] "a <b>writer</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> long deserved the recognition that has already been accorded him by his sales figures." [...] The prize went instead to Penelope Lively's novel Moon Tiger.|$|E

Her SF novel A Different Light (1978) featured a same-sex relationship between two men, and inspired the name of the LGBT bookstore and chain [...] "A Different Light".

500|$|At first, Angelou {{intended}} {{to return to}} poetry and play-writing after completing Caged Bird and write no more autobiographies, but she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and {{so that she could}} [...] "change it, to make it bigger, richer, finer, and more inclusive in the twentieth century". In a 1989 interview, she stated, [...] "I think I am the only serious <b>writer</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> chosen the autobiographical form to carry my work, my expression". [...] As she told journalist George Plimpton during a 1990 interview, [...] "Autobiography is awfully seductive; it’s wonderful". [...] She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by Frederick Douglass in slave narratives, she used the literary technique of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". [...] As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. [...] Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1980s it {{has become}} common to speak of Post-Boom writers, {{most of whom were}} born during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, such as Roberto Bolaño, the post Boom Spanish {{language}} <b>writer</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> made the greatest impact on world literature. It is difficult to clearly situate the Post-Boom as many of its writers were active {{before the end of the}} Boom. [...] Indeed, some writers, like Jose Donoso could be said to belong to both movements. [...] His novel The Obscene Bird of Night (El obsceno pájaro de la noche, 1970) is considered, as Philip Swanson notes, [...] "one of the classics of the Boom." [...] His later work, however, fits more comfortably into the post-Boom. [...] Manuel Puig and Severo Sarduy are considered writers whose works embody the transition from the Boom to the Post-Boom. It is important to note that this uneasiness in categorization is perpetuated by the fact that major writers of the Boom (Fuentes, García Márquez and Vargas Llosa) continued writing well after the end of the Boom. [...] The post-Boom is distinct from the Boom in various respects, most notably in the presence of female authors such as Isabel Allende, Luisa Valenzuela, Giannina Braschi, Cristina Peri Rossi, and Elena Poniatowska. [...] While Valenzuela and Poniatowska were both active writers during, and in Poniatowska's case even before, the Boom period, Allende is considered [...] "a product of the Boom." [...] Shaw also identifies Antonio Skármeta, Rosario Ferre and Gustavo Sainz as Post-Boom writers. [...] The Post-Boom writers challenge the perceived elitism of the Boom by using a simpler, more readable style and going back to realism.|$|E
