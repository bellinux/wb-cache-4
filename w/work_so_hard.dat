500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, space science became a topical field of {{research}} {{in the wake of the}} launch of Sputnik I. Urey helped persuade NASA to make unmanned probes to a moon a priority. When Apollo 11 returned moon rock samples from the moon, Urey examined them at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. The samples supported Urey's contention that the moon and the Earth shared a common origin. While at UCSD, Urey published 105 scientific papers, 47 of them about lunar topics. When asked why he continued to <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> he joked, [...] "Well, you know I’m not on tenure anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Stefani was {{the first}} artist Oxley wrote a song for outside of Keane, and the singer remarked that [...] "he's like Clark Kent-subtle, but Superman-talented. I'm lucky I was his first, because I'm sure he's going to go write with lots of girls after me." [...] Oxley would later {{collaborate}} with artists like Australian singer Kylie Minogue, and in an interview he talked about working with her and Stefani, saying [...] "I've been very lucky {{to work with people}} {{at the top of the}} industry. Both were very talented and more creative than I think they’re given credit for. They’re both very good writers and singers and they both <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> just grafting the whole time. Honing those pop sensibilities through writing with them was good fun".|$|E
500|$|From May 2007 onwards, the {{character}} was portrayed as increasingly emotionally unstable, having had [...] "her whole world crash down around her", following storylines including {{the death of}} her husband, and her son's request to be taken into foster care. As this emotional instability continued and worsened with the abrupt ending of another relationship, {{the character}} was seen to develop full blown alcoholism. Series producer Diana Kyle said of the storyline: [...] "It's important we cover topics that are relevant today. Every day, people in the medical profession deal with patients who have drink or drug problems. Plus, {{the fact that some of}} the Holby staff are also suffering with these addictions is very pertinent to hospitals in real life." [...] Speaking of Kyla's struggle to deal with her addiction, she added: [...] "She'll <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to get her life together. She has a long way to go, but hopefully there's a light at the end of the tunnel..." ...|$|E

500|$|Häkkinen {{said that}} his race was [...] "over" [...] when the rain started to fall having not {{managing}} to achieve a higher finishing position. Jos Verstappen scored points {{for the first time}} since the 1996 Argentine Grand Prix. Verstappen said that was pleased with the result and praised his team for switching to wet tyres as he kept in contact with his mechanics. Trulli remarked that he had [...] "never had to <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> for one point" [...] after the amount of pressure he came under in the race. Coulthard said that he lost the chance of victory when he stalled his car and admitted it was his mistake. On the other hand, he criticised his penalty as Coulthard believed that the race stewards should have been given more freedom by Formula One's governing body, the FIA, to decide whether a driver gained an advantage. David Tremayne of The Independent noted had Coulthard raised his hand before the start, he might have started from the back of the grid. After the race, Villeneuve and Diniz were penalised 25 seconds–which were added to their total race times–for their collisions with Diniz and de la Rosa respectively.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "major consequence" [...] of the typewriter's {{development}} was {{the entrance of}} women into the clerical work force. Although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in the 1880s, the typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings. Before the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) established the first typing school in 1881, women were trained by the manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with the machine. The expansion of correspondence and paper work that demanded the efficiency of typewriters, however, also created demand for additional clerical workers. The low wages accepted by women—often 50% (or less) of those paid to a man—made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling the new positions. As typing and stenography positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories, women were attracted in large numbers to office work. In 1874, less than 4% of clerical workers in the United States were women; by 1900, the number had increased to approximately 75%. Before his death, Sholes remarked of the typewriter, [...] "I do feel that I have done something for {{the women who have}} always had to <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> This will enable them more easily to earn a living." ...|$|E
500|$|The Village Voice {{called the}} sound [...] "emo-core... intercut with elegiac little pauses that align Blink 182 with {{a branch of}} punk rock you could trace back through The Replacements and Ramones Leave Home, to the more {{ethereal}} of early Who songs". Aaron Scott of Slant Magazine, however, found the sound to be recycled from the band's previous efforts, writing, [...] "Blink shines when they deviate from their formula, but it is awfully rare... The album {{seems to be more}} concerned with maintaining the band's large teenage fanbase than with expanding their overall audience." [...] Entertainment Weekly felt similarly, with David Browne opining that [...] "the album is angrier and more teeth gnashing than you'd expect. The band <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> at it, and the music is such processed sounding mainstream rock played fast, that the album becomes a paradox: adolescent energy and rebellion made joyless". British magazine New Musical Express, who heavily criticized the band in their previous efforts, felt no more negative this time, saying [...] "Blink-182 are now indistinguishable from the increasingly tedious 'teenage dirtbag' genre they helped spawn". The magazine continued, [...] "It [...] like all that sanitised, castrated, shrink-wrapped 'new wave' crap that the major US record companies pumped out circa 1981 in their belated attempt to jump on the 'punk' bandwagon." ...|$|E

500|$|Similarly to the club's {{successful}} campaign {{the season}} before, but in complete {{contrast to his}} first tenure at the club, the 2010–11 season saw five players joining the club, while roughly five players left the club in the close season. The club started the season inconsistently, with Westley stating the season would be a [...] "massive learning curve" [...] for both himself and the players. Following four defeats in six games in December 2010 and January 2011, Stevenage found themselves in 18th position, just four points above the relegation zone. However, during a congested period throughout February and March 2011, Stevenage won nine games out of eleven, propelling the club up the league table and into the play-off positions. This included winning six games on the trot, a sequence only matched by Bury. A 3–3 draw against Bury {{on the final day}} of the season meant that Stevenage finished the season in sixth place. They faced fifth place Accrington Stanley in the 2010–11 League Two play-off semi-finals, winning both legs by a 3–0 aggregate scoreline. They beat Torquay United 1–0 in the Final at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011. The victory meant that Westley had guided the club to back-to-back promotions, playing in League One for the first time in the club's history. On securing promotion, Westley said [...] "It's a fantastic feeling. The players <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> and they deserve everything they get". During the 2010–11 season, Westley also guided the club to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup, where they lost to Reading 2–1. In the previous round, Stevenage beat Premier League side Newcastle United 3–1 at Broadhall Way. After the match, Westley said before the game he had told the players to [...] "go out and win the match 5–0. We established that if we did just 20% of what it would take to win 5–0 then we would still win the game".|$|E
2500|$|In 2010 Robbins {{released}} the album Tim Robbins & The Rogues Gallery Band, {{a collection of}} songs written {{over the course of}} 25 years that he ultimately took on a world tour. He was originally offered the chance to record an album in 1992 after the success of his film Bob Roberts, but he declined because he had [...] "too much respect for the process", having seen his father <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> as a musician, and because he felt he had nothing to say at the time.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} tour to Zimbabwe, after two close draws, Lloyd {{generated}} controversy with his post-match statements.

One more ball and we'd have walked it. We murdered them and they know it. To <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> and get so close, there is no praise too high. We have had some stick off your lads.

So I knew they didn't want to publicize anything about me." [...] Perron then states that Lane [...] "says she was more offended by that myth than any slight to her as a dancer who worked 'painstaking' hours on the set. She says she's talked to her colleagues about 'how unfortunate it is that, as professional dancers, we <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> but people can actually believe that it's easy enough to do it in a year.

[...] "First of all, congratulations to AJ and the 47 team," [...] Ambrose said. [...] "They deserved that win. I left nothing on the table. I tried to rattle his cage and couldn't shake him. We raced fair and square to the end there. It was a tough couple laps but it was fair. We were both giving it to each other pretty hard. No harm, no foul. We just came up a little short." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was the {{development}} of the knitting machine that introduced hooked needles and enabled faultless, automated knitting. Most knitters probably aren’t even aware of the many processes that their fingers perform in the making of a single stitch. [...] However, large gauge needles emphasize those actions and knitting becomes increasingly more awkward when the needle diameter is greater than the width of the knitter's finger. [...] On a one-inch diameter (size 50) needle for instance, the shaft begins to taper one and three quarter inches from the tip. This means that the stitches are spread much further apart on mega knitting needles, making them more difficult to control. [...] The hook catches the loop of yarn as each stitch is knitted, meaning that wrists and fingers don’t have to <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> and there is less chance of stitches slipping off the needle. The position of the hook is most important. [...] Turn the left (non-working) hook to face away at all times; turn the right (working) hook toward you up whilst knitting (plain stitch) and away whilst purling.|$|E

[...] Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly graded the album a B- and noted that Just Whitney had a refreshingly [...] "old-school vibe." [...] He also commented, [...] "Whatever her personal problems, our gal [...] sounds plucky {{and on top of}} her game. Still, in her third decade as a diva, Houston remains a formidable role model for American Idolwannabes." [...] Robert Hilburn of Los Angeles Times graded the album one and half stars out of five commenting, [...] "Just Whitney suffers from the sense of career desperation that surrounded Michael Jackson's recent CDs. She and four dozen writers and producers <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> finding another hit, they lose track of the human qualities that made her music so formidable." [...] Jon Caramanica of Rolling Stone said that the album [...] "lacked any fire whatsoever." [...] He also commented on Houston's cover of [...] "You Light Up My Life" [...] saying, [...] "this cover... only shows an artist vainly trying to reach for what her future once could have been" [...] and graded the album two stars out of five.|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Rosenqvist said the result had been awaiting Mahindra {{for a long period}} of time and felt as if his team could win many races over the course of the season and the first Berlin race was an event that saw [...] "all the puzzle pieces came together." [...] He added that despite small errors, he was still able to secure the victory: [...] "We <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> and you can really see the suffering sometimes but when you have days like this it's all worth it." [...] Di Grassi stated that his car was not satisfactory and that his team started the day [...] "very lost" [...] and made car set-up alterations: [...] "If you look at the pure pace from the morning - this was not the best race for us, so I tried to hang on as much as I could." [...] He revealed he lost regeneration from his overheating battery at the end of his first stint which persisted in his second stint. However di Grassi affirmed his team would improve his car and challenge for the victory in the following day's race. Third-place finisher Heidfeld said Mahindra's achievement of strong finish was [...] "a really outstanding result" [...] and stated he struggled in the first car but could mount a challenge to di Grassi in his second vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the release}} {{and success of}} her album Loud (2010), Rihanna {{originally}} revealed via Twitter that the album would be re-issued with new songs and released in Fall 2011, writing that [...] "he [...] continues with more new music to add to [...] collection".

In an interview with Capital FM, Harris – who produced the track – explained that followers of Rihanna had sent messages to him regarding their expectations of the song, saying [...] "The song better not be rubbish", which he interpreted as slightly threatening, but {{went on to say that}} [...] "it's all part of the fun".

2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E
