5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result <b>was</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{damage was}} widespread. Across the country 40% of the {{sugarcane}} crop, 80–100% of the banana crop, 75% {{of the coffee}} trees under three years old, and 20% of {{the top layer of}} the cocoa crop were lost to the storm. Insured damage in Jamaica was initially estimated at around US$1.5billion, but post-storm analysis showed that it <b>was</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> US$310million.|$|E

5|$|Despite the defeat, the {{soldiers}} were received as heroes in Santiago. Thanks to Las Heras, a potential disaster for the patriot armies turned into a minor setback. The army was reorganized again, but the deaths, injuries and desertions caused by the defeat at Cancha Rayada reduced its size to 5,000 soldiers, which <b>was</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the royalist forces. They took position next to the Maipo River, near Santiago.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. It had a pair of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s. This pitched Odontogriphus {{into the middle of the}} debate about whether Wiwaxia <b>was</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the mollusc or the annelid lineage, resulting in a frank exchange of views.|$|E
5|$|Greer Stadium, {{once one}} of the best stadiums in Triple-A baseball, began to be out shined by newer {{state-of-the-art}} ballparks being built in the late 1980s. The Reds let their player development contract (PDC) with the Sounds expire so they could place their Triple-A affiliate in Indianapolis, which <b>was</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Cincinnati and was planning to build a new stadium. Nashville entered the offseason unsure of their next major league affiliate.|$|E

5|$|The M21 had a {{different}} layout from the early M4 and M4A1 MMC, {{as it was the}} replacement of the M4. The major difference, was that the M21 and the M4 were based on different half-tracks (the M4 was based on the M2 Half-track while the M21 was based on the M3 Half-track). The major difference was the location and direction of the mortar (the M4's mortar was rear-facing and was near the back, while the M21's mortar was front-facing and <b>was</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the front).|$|E

5|$|After much discussion, Harrison, who {{coordinated the}} meetings, {{determined}} that a design based on Niemeyer's project 32 and Le Corbusier's project 23 would be developed for the final project. Le Corbusier's project 23 consisted of a large block containing both the Assembly Hall and the Council Chambers {{near the center of}} the site with the Secretariat tower emerging as a slab from the south. Niemeyer's plan <b>was</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> that actually constructed, with a distinctive General Assembly building, a long low horizontal block housing the other meeting rooms, and a tall tower for the Secretariat. The complex as built, however, repositioned Niemeyer's General Assembly building to the north of this tripartite composition. This plan included a public plaza as well.|$|E

5|$|Also in 2001, Denise Sigogneau-Russell {{and colleagues}} in their {{description}} of the earliest Laurasian tribosphenic mammal, Tribactonodon, agreed with the relationship between Ausktribosphenos and monotremes, but argued that Ambondro <b>was</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Laurasian tribosphenidans than to Ausktribosphenos and monotremes. As evidence against the integrity of Australosphenida, they cited the presence of lingual cingula in various non-australosphenidan mammals; the presence of two cusps in the anterior cingulum in Ambondro {{as well as some}} boreosphenidans; the different appearance of the premolar in Ambondro (flat) and Ausktribosphenos (squared); and the contrast between the talonids of Ambondro (with a well-developed hypoconid on the labial side) and Ausktribosphenos (squared).|$|E
5|$|Another factor {{pointing}} to Deva Victrix as a provincial capital {{is the presence}} of a port. From Deva, Ireland (Hibernia) was also accessible, a land which Agricola had plans to conquer; he even launched an expedition to Ireland, though where from is unclear. Also, the Flavian dynasty was expansionist, and Deva <b>was</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> what would then have been the front, making administration quicker and easier. Furthermore, historian Vittorio Di Martino believes that Agricola could have chosen Deva Victrix as a possible future capital of Roman Britain because it was practically placed at the centre of the British isles, being located geographically at nearly the same distance from the westernmost shores of Ireland, the easternmost lands of Britannia and the Channel.|$|E

5|$|Bayer catalogued five {{stars in}} the constellation, giving them the Bayer designations Alpha to Epsilon. John Flamsteed added Eta, Iota and four Roman letters; of these, only Iota is still used as the others were dropped in {{subsequent}} catalogues and star charts. Flamsteed gave 16 stars Flamsteed designations, of which numbers 1 and 16 are not used—1's coordinates were in error as there was no star present at the location that corresponds to any star in his Catalogus Britannicus; Baily presumed that the coordinates were mistranscribed 32s in error by Flamsteed and in fact referred to 7.4 magnitude HD 10407.

5|$|Before the British Mandatory {{government}} {{took over in}} 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the Old City. With an eye to the continuing development of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls, the British drew up a master town plan that called {{for the establishment of}} two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area, which <b>was</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the Old City.

5|$|By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was manumitted {{from slavery}} {{at the age}} of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's will, though his actual age <b>was</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> 55. He {{continued}} working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family, who had held him as a slave. Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status. The lawyer discovered that a former owner had issued instructions that Rit, like her husband, would be manumitted {{at the age of}} 45. The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families had ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves. Challenging it legally was an impossible task for Tubman.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of neural classifier outputs shows that, {{in case of}} MLP, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 1 and more this output will <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the identified fault class. Contrarily, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 0 and more this output will be far to be the identified fault class. In case of RBF, the outputs are distances from RBF centers. In this case with a new scale of outputs it is easily to make output class values varying between [0, c], where c is a constant to be determined (e.g., see Sect.  5.1, Fig.  7 a–c). Then, more the output which is a distance <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> c and more this output will be far {{to be identified as}} fault class. Contrarily, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 0 and more this output will <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the identified fault class. From this purpose, one interesting way to built efficient decision-making from two neural classifiers is fuzzy logic [18, 19].|$|R
