40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{dopamine}} receptor blockade by sulpiride (D 2 -class antagonist) and sulpiride plus SCH 23390 (D 1 -class antagonist) on the V – log I {{function of the}} ERG b- and d-waves were investigated in dark adapted frog eyes. We observed that sulpiride enhanced the amplitude of the suprathreshold b- and d-waves in the lower intensity range, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> were mediated by rods, but diminished it in the higher intensity range, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> were mediated by cones. A similar effect on the b-, but not d-wave amplitude was seen during the perfusion with sulpiride plus SCH 23390. The d-wave amplitude was enhanced over the whole intensity range {{with the exception of}} the highest intensities during the combined D 1 and D 2 receptor blockade. The results obtained indicate that the endogenous dopamine has an overall inhibitory action on the suprathreshold rod-mediated ON and OFF responses, while its action on the cone-mediated responses shows clear ON–OFF asymmetry. It is excitatory upon the ON responses, but inhibitory upon the OFF responses except for those in the highest intensity range. Participation of different types of dopamine receptors (predominantly D 2 for the ON versus D 1 for the OFF response) is probably responsible for this difference...|$|E

Each scale comprised three to five trichotomized items reflecting the respective alienation variant in question. Based on conceptual considerations, we trichotomized the response categories into high, medium and low degree of alienation aiming to create a conceptual symmetry in the responses. ‘High’ reflected response categories which the authors assessed as indicators of alienation, ‘low’ reflected that the responses did not indicate alienation, and ‘medium’ denoted the remaining response categories.|$|E

Finally, lower bounds on the signal-to-noise ratio are established for approximate recovery of the unknown linear function by any estimator...|$|E

It has been shown that using such a kind of multisensor system makes it possible to overcome the restriction of the selectivity in comparison with single sensors. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Banks {{and other}} credit {{institutions}} are {{key players in the}} transmission of monetary policy, especially in emerging market economies, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> of deposit and loan interest rates to shifts in policy rates are among the most important channels. This pass-through depends on the conditions prevailing in the loan and deposit markets, which are, in turn, affected by macroeconomic factors. Hence, when setting their policy, monetary authorities must take into account those conditions and the behavior of banks. This paper illustrates this point by means of a theoretical micro-banking model and shows empirical evidence for Colombia suggesting that some aspects of the model might be relevant features of the transmission mechanism.
