The basic hypotheses of this study are as follows: 1. The students <b>who</b> are <b>taught</b> in the open structured classroom will produce significantly higher results on tests for curiosity than those students <b>who</b> are <b>taught</b> in the traditionally structured classroom. 2. The students <b>who</b> are <b>taught</b> under the open-structured classroom will score significantly higher on a self-concept test than students <b>who</b> are <b>taught</b> under traditionally structured classroom...|$|R

Putri, Ayu, 2012, The Effect of Gist and Learning Style on Reading Comprehension of Grade XI Students at SMA Dwijendra Bualu in Academic Year 2011 / 2012, Post Graduate Program, Ganesha University of Education. This master thesis {{has been}} revised and {{approved}} by: Advisor 1. Prof. Dr. I Ketut Seken, M. A., Advisor 2. Prof. Dr. Nyoman Padmadewi, M. A. Key words: GIST, learning style, reading comprehension, conventional reading technique This study concerned with experimental research which investigated {{whether or not}} there is any effect of Generating Interaction between Schemata and Text (GIST) and learning style on reading comprehension, and to investigate the relationship between the use of GIST, conventional reading technique and learning style. This study was carried out in SMA Dwijendra Bualu on grade XI students through a 2 X 4 true-experimental research design where the participants were homogenously The students in experimental group were taught using GIST while the students in control group were taught using conventional reading technique. Each group consisted of students with visual, aural, read-write, kinesthetic learning style. Therefore, there were eight groups altogether; students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using GIST with visual learning style, students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using conventional reading technique with visual learning style, students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using GIST with aural learning style, students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using conventional reading technique aural learning style. students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using GIST with read-write learning style, students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using conventional reading technique with read-write learning style, students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using GIST with kinesthetic learning style, and students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using conventional reading technique kinesthetic learning style. Post-tests were administered to all groups after the twelfth meeting. A two-way ANOVA test indicated that the experimental group students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using GIST outperformed the group of students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using the conventional reading technique. However, two-way ANOVA test could not answered the significance of average data in this 2 x 4 factorial design. Therefore, it was needed to use post-hoc or multiple comparison test to show the interaction from each cell of the data in this study...|$|R

The third one is	the significant difference reading achievement of recount texts between students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using sequence picture media and those <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using students’ worksheets. The kind {{of this research was}} quasi-experimental research. The design was the pretest-posttest control group design. The population consisted of grade 8 students of MTs Negeri Bantul Kota in the second semester in the academic year of 2014 / 2015. The sample was taken using the cluster random sampling technique. There were two classes of the experimental group and one class of the control group. The first experimental group was treated using PowerPoint presentation. The second experimental group was treated using sequence picture media. Then, the control group was treated using students’ worksheets. The instrument of data collection was a reading comprehension test. The supporting instrument were observation sheets of the English learning process in the class. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics with SPSS 17. 0 for windows. The descriptive statistics consisted of mean, standard deviation, the minimum and the maximum scores. The inferential statistics involves three tests. They were the normality test using One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the homogeneity test using Lavene’s test, and the hypothesis test using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). To see the significant difference, the scheffe test was applied. The research results reveal three things. Firstly, there is a significant difference of reading achievement of recount texts between students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using PowerPoint presentation and those <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using sequence picture media. The significant value is less than 0. 05 i. e. 0. 036. Secondly there is no significant difference of reading achievement of recount texts between students <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using PowerPoint presentation and those <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using students’ worksheets. The significant value is more than 0. 05 i. e. 0. 990. Thirdly, there is a significant difference of reading achievement of recount texts between <b>who</b> were students <b>taught</b>	using sequence picture media and those <b>who</b> were <b>taught</b> using students’ worksheets.

5|$|All {{thirteen}} known Ruisdael etchings {{come from}} his early period, {{with the first}} one dated 1646. It is unknown <b>who</b> <b>taught</b> him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at the Edge of a Wood and The Travellers as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.|$|E

This study involved 72 students which are divided into two groups: class VIIID (36 students) as the experimental group, and class VIIIB (36 students) as the control group. The data were obtained by means of two essay writing tests. They were administered to the two groups as the pre-test and the post-test. The pre-test was given to both groups before the treatment and the post-test was at the end of the treatment. The data were analyzed by means of descriptive and inferential statistics. The hypothesis was tested using the analysis of covariance.
