60|$|Then comes another saga, {{how they}} met the Assipitti, of whom, {{whether they were}} Tacitus's Usipetes, of the Lower Rhine, or Asabiden, the remnant of the Asen, who went not to Scandinavia with Odin, we know not, and need not know; and how the Assipitti would not let them pass; and how they told the Lombards that they had dogheaded men in their tribe who drank men's blood, which Mr. Latham <b>well</b> <b>explains</b> by {{pointing}} out, in the Traveller's Song, a tribe of Hundings (Houndings) sons of the hound; and how the Lombards sent out a champion, who fought the champion of the Assipitti, and so gained leave to go on their way.|$|E
60|$|A further {{characteristic}} of a true cause is that it accounts {{not only for the}} particular group of phenomena to be interpreted, but also for other groups. The cause here alleged does this. It equally <b>well</b> <b>explains</b> the worship of animals, of plants, of mountains, of winds, of celestial bodies, and even of appearances too vague to be considered entities. It gives us an intelligible genesis of fetichistic conceptions in general. It furnishes us with a reason for the practice, otherwise so unaccountable, of moulding the words applied to inanimate objects in such ways as to imply masculine and feminine genders. It shows us how there naturally arose the worship of compound animals, and of monsters half man, half brute. And it shows us why the worship of purely anthropomorphic deities came later, when language had so far developed that it could preserve in tradition the distinction between proper names and nicknames.|$|E
5000|$|Wesley {{is remembered}} for visiting the Moravians of both Georgia and Germany and {{examining}} their beliefs, then founding the Methodist movement, the {{precursor to the}} later variety of Methodist denominations. Wesley's desire was not {{to form a new}} sect, but rather to reform the nation and spread scriptural holiness as truth. However, the creation of Wesleyan-Arminianism has today developed into a popular standard for many contemporary churches. Wesleyanism <b>well</b> <b>explains</b> the two main events {{in the life of the}} believer; [...] "saving faith," [...] or justification, the threshold of the Christian life; and [...] "the fullness of faith," [...] or sanctification, as its goal. Wesleyanism also stresses good works through faith that acts by love, and the primacy of revelation in the scriptures.|$|E

The primary support for KAA is an explanatory inference from a broad range of linguistic data. The more data that KAA <b>well</b> <b>explains,</b> the stronger the case for it, and the more difficult it is for the competition to keep pace. In this paper we critically assess a purported new linguistic datum, which, it has been argued, KAA <b>well</b> <b>explains.</b> We argue that KAA does not well explain it. 1...|$|E

40|$|Large-degree nodes in scale-free {{networks}} are normally responsible for large cascades of epidemics. However, recent research shows small-degree nodes can also produce large-scale epidemics {{in the real}} world. In this letter, we investigate the relation between local and global influence of individuals in scale-free network in order to theoretically explain this real-world phenomenon. The local influence of an individual corresponds to the node degree, and the global influence of an individual reflects the expected number of individuals directly or indirectly influenced by this individual in epidemics. We formalize the later as the novel epidemic betweenness concept, to mathematically estimate the global influence of individuals. Our analysis shows that the global influence follows power-law distributions in scale-free networks. We also observe that the average global influence of individuals is power-law {{to the degree of}} nodes, which <b>well</b> <b>explains</b> the reason why large-degree nodes are more likely to produce large cascades of epidemics. In addition, we discover that some smalldegree nodes also possess large global influence in terms of epidemics betweenness. This <b>well</b> <b>explains</b> the counter-intuitive phenomenon in recent research...|$|E
