5|$|Hensley {{lived in}} Tennessee {{until at least}} late 1941. He then moved to Evansville, Indiana, after {{separating}} from Irene. After a brief stay in Pineville, Hensley returned to Ooltewah in 1943. There he stayed <b>with</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> and held religious services. Snake handling had lost popularity since the late 1920s and groups that promoted nontrinitarianism had become popular. Various churches in the area barred those who practiced snake handling from membership.|$|E
5|$|Though Western {{classical}} and other musics {{play an important}} role in Anglican church services on Barbados, religion and folk music are closely intertwined in the everyday lives of most Barbadians. The basis for religious folk music is the Anglican hymn, a kind of praise song mostly sung on Sundays, a day when Christian Barbadians come together <b>with</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> to sing and praise God to ask for strength for the next week's work.|$|E
5|$|While Jenner was alive, {{very few}} people knew of him, {{and the effects of}} his evangelism were largely unrecognised. After his death, however, stories about his evangelism {{circulated}} widely. Stories of his evangelistic activities generated a largely oral tradition, and elements of some stories contradicted others. Many storytellers said that Jenner was small in stature and that he had white hair; this description is contradicted by interviews <b>with</b> <b>family</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E

5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases. Interviews <b>with</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> are also utilised {{in the assessment of}} the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on the}} decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2005, the Council of Social Sciences, Pakistan, in {{collaboration}} with the National Rural Support Programme and other institutions, announced the Akhter Hameed Khan Memorial Award. The annual cash award is given on Khan's birthday to a Pakistani author for a book on issues related to rural and urban development, peace, poverty alleviation, or gender discrimination. At the occasion of the award ceremony in 2006, a documentary film about {{the life and times of}} Akhter Hameed Khan was premiered.

He later explained that he had uploaded it only to share it <b>with</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> on completion of the memorial services for Thomas's grandmother. Thomas's father wrote that the video greatly affected his son, and enabled him to cope with grief and feel comforted. He praised Capaldi for his kind act and explained that the video improved his son's mental well-being throughout the ordeal.|$|E

5|$|In September 2013, Steam {{introduced}} {{the ability to}} share most games <b>with</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> and close friends by authorizing machines to access one's library. Authorized players can install the game locally and play it separately from the owning account. Users can access their saved games and achievements providing the main owner is not playing. When the main player initiates a game while a shared account is using it, the shared account user is allowed {{a few minutes to}} either save their progress and close the game or purchase the game for his or her own account. Within Family View, introduced in January 2014, parents can adjust settings for their children's tied accounts, limiting the functionality and accessibility to the Steam client and purchased titles.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{establishing}} a centralized empire, Saladin had established hereditary ownership throughout his lands, dividing his empire among his kinsmen, <b>with</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> presiding over semi-autonomous fiefs and principalities. Although these princes (emirs) owed {{allegiance to the}} Ayyubid sultan, they maintained relative independence in their own territories. Upon Saladin's death, az-Zahir took Aleppo from al-Adil per the arrangement and al-Aziz Uthman held Cairo, while his eldest son, al-Afdal retained Damascus, which also included Palestine and much of Mount Lebanon. Al-Adil then acquired al-Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), where he held the Zengids of Mosul at bay. In 1193, Mas'ud of Mosul joined forces with Zangi II of Sinjar and together the Zengid coalition moved to conquer al-Jazira. However, before any major results could be achieved, Mas'ud fell ill and returned to Mosul, and al-Adil then compelled Zangi {{to make a quick}} peace before the Zengids suffered territorial losses {{at the hands of the}} Ayyubids. Al-Adil's son al-Mu'azzam took possession of Karak and Transjordan.|$|E

25|$|In China, the Nanai (Hezhe) {{people use}} Chinese for writing.
