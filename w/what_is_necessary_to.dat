25|$|This {{series of}} {{evaluations}} is providing {{a mechanism to}} characterize in more precise terms exactly <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> compute in meaning. As such, the evaluations provide an emergent mechanism to identify the problems and solutions for computations with meaning. These exercises have evolved to articulate more of the dimensions {{that are involved in}} our use of language. They began with apparently simple attempts to identify word senses computationally. They have evolved to investigate the interrelationships among the elements in a sentence (e.g., semantic role labeling), relations between sentences (e.g., coreference), and the nature of what we are saying (semantic relations and sentiment analysis).|$|E
25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E

Rajoelina said that he wanted the constitution to be respected and that it was Ravalomanana who had violated the constitution.

Sergei Mironov stated on 30 March 2002 that [...] "89 federation subjects is too much, but larger regional units are easier to manage" [...] and that the goal was to merge them into 7 federal districts.

One who knows how to compose the longest passages on trivial topics or the briefest passages on topics of great importance is similar, when he claims that to teach this is to impart the knowledge of composing tragedies; if one were to claim to have mastered harmony after learning the lowest and highest notes on the lyre, a musician would say that this knowledge is what one must learn before one masters harmony, {{but it is not the}} knowledge of harmony itself. This, then, is what must be said to those who attempt to teach the art of rhetoric through [...] "Preambles" [...] and [...] "Recapitulations"; they are ignorant of dialectic, and teach only <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> learn as preliminaries.|$|E
