40|$|Coke plants, {{which produce}} {{various types of}} coke (metallurgical, foundry or heating), at {{temperatures}} between 600 and 1200 °C, with limited access to oxygen, are major emitters of particulates and gaseous pollutants to air, water and soils. Primarily, the process of <b>wet</b> <b>quenching</b> should be mentioned, {{as one of the}} most cumbersome. Atmospheric pollutants include particulates, tar substances, organic pollutants including B(a) P and many others. Pollutants are also formed from the decomposition of water used to quench coke (CO, phenol, HCN, H 2 S, NH 3, cresol) and decomposition of hot coke in the first phase of quenching (CO, H 2 S, SO 2) [1]. The development of the coke oven technology has resulted in the changes made to different types of technological installations, such as the use of baffles in quench towers, the removal of nitrogen oxides by selective NOx reduction, and the introduction of fabric filters for particulates removal. The BAT conclusions for coke plants [2] provide a methodology for the measurement of particulate emission from a wet, low-emission technology using Mohrhauer probes. The conclusions define the emission level for <b>wet</b> <b>quenching</b> process as 25 g/Mgcoke. The conducted research was aimed at verification of the presented method. For two of three quench towers (A and C) the requirements included in the BAT conclusions are not met and emissions amount to 87. 34 and 61. 35 g/Mgcoke respectively. The lowest particulates emission was recorded on the quench tower B and amounted to 22. 5 g/Mgcoke, therefore not exceeding the requirements...|$|E

For {{the first time}} established {{is the effect of}} Al 2 (SO 4) 3, AlCl 3, FeSO 4, Fe 2 (SO 4) 3, Al 2 (OH) 5 Cl and FeCl 3 doses onto residual tar content in phenolic wastewater. Results obtained give the possibility to prevent air pollution resulting from the toxic substances emission at the <b>wet</b> <b>quenching</b> with water containing excessive oils and to increase the quality of wastewater biological treatment. It is shown experimentally that the most efficient are Fe 2 (SO 4) 3, FeCl 3 and Al 2 (OH) 5 Cl at optimum concentrations of 50, 30 and 30 mg/dm 3 respectively. The Al 2 (OH) 5 Cl can be recommended for implementation at industry on existing coking plants and municipal wastewater treatment plants to improve the environmental air and water resources condition in Ukraine...|$|E
40|$|Borate {{glasses are}} {{suitable}} for thermoluminescent dosimetry. In particular, borate glasses doped with different elements show good characteristics in terms of linearity, sensitivity and effective atomic number. However, these glasses are also hygroscopic, which can reduce their viability as dosimeters. In this work, the characteristics of borate glasses made with lithium and potassium oxides (LKB) were studied. To improve the glass features new formulations adding different amounts of magnesium oxide were developed. Mg improves {{the stability of the}} glasses since it reduces the mobility of the alkali ions and thus may reduce the hygroscopicity of the LKB glass. Three glass formulations containing 0, 5 and 11 mol% of magnesium oxide were produced by <b>wet</b> <b>quenching</b> method {{in order to determine the}} effect of Mg specifically on hygroscopicity and high-temperature resistance. The possibility to use this material for optically stimulated luminescence dosimetry was demonstrated. The LKB glass containing 11 mol% of Mg was found to withstand higher temperatures and to present the lower hygroscopicity compared to the other formulations...|$|E

The incinerator is equipped with an air pollution control system (APCS) that includes a <b>wet</b> <b>quench</b> and scrubber followed by dry air filtration using high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. The system was designed with optimum materials to maximize reliability, runtime, and ease of maintenance. Changes to the CIF operation and materials {{have been made to}} maximize system performance and minimize corrosion.

40|$|Particles {{agglomeration}} {{is obtained}} by spraying liquid over solid particles fluidized by hot air. The growth mechanism {{depends on the}} operating parameters (geometry and process conditions) and initial materials, influencing drying conditions and agitation, leading either to agglomeration or coating or <b>wet</b> <b>quenching.</b> It is linked to air temperature and/or humidity distributions appearing in the well-mixing system of the fluidized bed due to the penetration of the sprayed liquid jet. In this study, air temperatures distributions in a conical fluidized bed of model particles (glass beads) top sprayed with water were measured varying the initial particles load (250, 500, 750 g), the fluidizing air inlet temperature (60 - 70 - 80 degrees C), the liquid feed rate (2. 65, 5. 33, 7. 55 ml min(- 1)) and the relative air spraying pressure (1, 2, 3 bars). Three thermal zones were identified (heat transfer, isothermal, wetting-active), with sizes and shapes related to particles circulation patterns and drying and spraying conditions influenced by the operating parameters. Subsequent agglomeration trials, were carried out with glass beads and soluble maltodextrin particles agglomerated, respectively, with an acacia gum solution and water. They showed {{a relationship between the}} air temperatures distribution and the resulting growth mechanism. Particularly, controlled agglomeration was obtained for a wetting-active zone occupying 18 - 30 % of the fluidized bed...|$|E
40|$|The {{nanoparticles}} synthesis and deposition can {{be carried}} out using an innovating technique named dry impregnation in a fluidized bed. Its principle consists in the spraying of a solution containing a metallic precursor or preformed nanoparticles into a hot fluidized bed of porous particles. The solvent vapour saturation rate value, s, defined as the ratio between the solvent content in the bed atmosphere and the maximum solvent content, appears as a key parameter allowing predicting the deposit location. Three operation conditions can be distinguished: •	"Unstable conditions" for high s (between 1 and 0. 8). The operation is unstable: a low increase of the liquid flow rate, or a reduction of the gas inlet temperature, can lead to <b>wet</b> <b>quenching.</b> •	"Operating conditions" or "slow drying conditions" for intermediate values of s (between 0. 8 and 0. 2). •	"Fast drying conditions" characterized by high bed temperatures and low solvent saturation rates (s < 0. 2). This paper presents experimental results obtained during the dry impregnation of coarse and fine porous particles using different types of precursors: inorganic precursors (metallic salts), metal organic complexes and a colloidal suspension containing preformed metallic nanoparticles (rhodium). The operating conditions were chosen in order to study the three operation conditions previously described. Interesting results were obtained concerning the deposit distribution within the support grains at the local scale, Indeed, it appeared that a fast drying leads to a deposit located only at the external particle surface (like coating), whereas a uniform deposit on the whole particle volume is obtained with slow drying conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present {{research}} work {{is aimed at}} the estimation of quench severity Polyalkylene Glycol (PAG) polymer quenchants having varying concentrations. An Inconel 600 probe instrumented with thermocouples was used for this purpose. The thermal history at various locations in the probe {{was used as an}} input to the inverse heat conduction model. The inverse analysis yields spatially dependent heat flux transients. The quench severity was assessed using the Grossmann technique. The <b>wetting</b> kinematics of <b>quenching</b> was studied by cooling curve analysis. The severity of quenching as measured by the Grossmann’s technique was found to be higher for polymer quenchants. However, the heat flux transients estimated by the inverse technique and rewetting times measured form the cooling curve analysis suggested comparable and uniform heat transfer with polymer quenchants compared to water quenchants...|$|R
