40|$|In {{slices of}} carrot-phloem {{parenchyma}} <b>washed</b> <b>for</b> 7 days in water at 20 C, 50 mm KCl stimulates respiration {{by up to}} 100 % of the ground respiration within 4 minutes of application. The data presented imply that ADP liberated in the cytoplasm {{as a consequence of}} KCl accumulation first stimulates a regulator reaction requiring ADP (phosphoglycerate kinase). Thereafter, the point of control alternates between this reaction and the phosphofructokinase reaction, forming a sequence of enzyme stimulations which continue after the new steady state of increased respiration is established. KCl induces a similar sequence in slices <b>washed</b> <b>for</b> 3 days, but it is completed within 3 minutes, and metabolite oscillations are not so marked. In slices <b>washed</b> <b>for</b> 2 days, KCl stimulates respiration by less than 10 %, and the sequence of regulator reactions does not occur. Phosphoglycerate kinase is the only enzyme stimulated within 3 minutes of applying KCl to these slices. Contrary to previous reports, KCl frequently stimulates the respiration of freshly prepared slices by 10 to 30 %...|$|R
