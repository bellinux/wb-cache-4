Then, the model has been calibrated in both steady-state and transient flow regimes based on hydraulic head and water discharge rate observations. Finally, the calibrated model has been used to run several scenarios in order to assess the impacts of possible future phenomena on the hydraulic heads and the water discharge rates. Among others, the simulation of a strong rainfall event shows a quick and strong increase in hydraulic heads in some exploited zones coupled with a strong increase in associated water discharge rates. This could lead to stability problems in the hill slopes near the exploited zones.

30|$|In {{order to}} study the {{mechanism}} of confined <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> from coal seam floor, the main influences on permeability {{in the process of}} triaxial seepage experiments were analyzed with methods such as laboratory experiments, theoretical analysis and mechanical model calculation.

The practical criterion of <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> was put forward. The results show that the rock permeability “mutation” phenomenon reflects the differences of stress state and cracks extension rate when the rock internal crack begins to extend in large-scale. The rock ultimate destruction form is related to the rock lithology and the angle between crack and principal stress. The necessary condition of floor <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> is that the mining pressure leads to the extension and transfixion of the crack. The sufficient condition of floor <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> is that the confined water’s expansionary stress in normal direction and shear stress in tangential direction must be larger than the internal stress in the crack.

40|$|Hydrogeological {{models can}} greatly help {{simulating}} groundwater {{flow in the}} particular context of mining works. However, classical modeling techniques are not so suited in this context because the medium is strongly disturbed by shafts and networks of galleries. Consequently, specific modeling techniques have been developed. Box model techniques require only few parameters but they calculate only mean water levels in exploited zones and do not consider interactions between exploited and unexploited zones. Conversely, physically-based and spatially-distributed techniques represent explicitly both exploited and unexploited zones and take into account interactions between them but they {{require a lot of}} parameters sometimes difficult to estimate. The Hybrid Finite Element Mixing Cell (HFEMC) method is a new modeling technique constituting a compromise between simple and complex techniques used in mining context. The principle of this method is to fully couple a representation of exploited zones by a group of mixing cells possibly interconnected by pipes and a representation of unexploited zones by classical finite elements. Interactions between mixing cells and finite elements of the mesh are taken into account through 3 rd type (Fourier) internal boundary conditions. With this method, exploited zones are characterized by mean water levels while spatially-distributed hydraulic heads are calculated for the entire adjacent and overlaying unexploited zones. Additionally, thanks to the coupling between mixing cells and finite elements, water exchanges between exploited and unexploited zones are explicitly taken into account. The HFEMC method allows also simulating groundwater rebound following mine closure and associated phenomena such as <b>water</b> <b>inrushes.</b> Concepts and equations of the HFEMC method are presented and illustrated using test cases.

In the study of <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> mechanism, scholars have carried out a lot of research work and proposed <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> theory and criteria such as <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> coefficient method (Peng et al. 2003), <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> critical index method, “lower three zone” theory (Li 1999), in situ tensile and zero failure theory (Wang et al. 1994), board model theory (Zhang and Wang 2006), key strata theory (Qian et al. 1996), mutation and nonlinear model (Yang et al. 2001, 2005), <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> advantage theory, <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> power information theory, strong seepage theory (Ye and Liu 2005), similar theory, rock-water stress theory and so on, and formed <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> prevention and control methods such as waterproof coal pillar mining (Jiang et al. 2008), double down (Miao et al. 2008, 2009), bottom grouting etc. Some scholars studied the change of rock permeability in the process of rock deformation and failure through rock stress and permeability coupling experiment (Oda et al. 2002; Noiriel et al. 2010; Watanabe et al. 2011). At present, these research results play a positive role in guiding the control of <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> from coal seam floor. But there are some obvious weaknesses such as studying the rock and water separately or directly considering the confined water pressure to be hydrostatic pressure to floor, ignoring the interaction between seepage field and stress field. The essence of floor <b>water</b> <b>inrush</b> is the result of the interaction between seepage field and stress field and will lead to the extension and transfixion of the crack, which has been ignored. Scholars both at home and abroad have been doing extensive and in-depth research for the evolution rules of stress, strain and permeability in the process of rock seepage experiment. Some articles have presented the rock coupling seepage rule through experiments (Zheng et al. 1999; Zhu and Liu 2002) and summed up the empirical formula between rock permeability characteristics and effective stress. But there are few literatures overall considering the main permeability influence factors, the crack extension rule and the ultimate destruction form.|$|E
