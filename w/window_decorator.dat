This move {{reflected}} {{a shift in}} the center of the Parisian high society and the growing importance for fashion of both rue de la Paix, where the house of Worth had opened in 1858, and the palais Garnier against the Théâtre Italien, closer to Charvet's original location. Though Charvet began to offer women's blouses and men's suits in its new store, men's shirts remained the house's specialty. An American journalist, visiting the store in 1909, reported [...] "there were shirts of every variety and almost every color [...] artistic enough to make one long for them all, and each and every one most beautifully made." [...] The store was noted for its displays, compared in 1906 to Loie Fuller performances, and Charvet paid an [...] "immense salary" [...] to the <b>window</b> <b>decorator,</b> who displayed [...] "each day a new series", producing [...] "veritable works of art in his harmonious combinations of scarves and handkerchiefs and hosiery".|$|E

[...] Elements usually associated with window managers allow the user to open, close, minimize, maximize, move, resize, and keep track of running <b>windows,</b> including <b>window</b> <b>decorators.</b> Many <b>window</b> managers also come with various utilities and features: e.g. docks, task bars, program launchers, desktop icons, and wallpaper.|$|R

50|$|Samuel and Alfred Woolf came to Leavenworth, Kansas in 1865, {{after the}} Civil War, from their native New York. There, they {{established}} a store where fine men's shirts {{were made and}} sold. By June 1879, Kansas City had become the region's urban commercial center and the business was accordingly relocated there, where it prospered. Herbert Woolf began working for the business in 1912 and was president three years later. He {{worked his way up}} from collector to <b>window</b> <b>decorator</b> to buyer, and junior partner in his twenties. For over thirty years, Woolf Brothers expanded and thrived under Herbert {{to become one of the}} largest and most revered luxury goods department stores in the Midwest, with branches in five other major cities.

5000|$|Sam Hinton {{was born}} March 31, 1917 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was raised largely in Crockett, Texas, and studied zoology {{for two years}} at Texas A&M, helping to finance his {{education}} via singing appearances. Leaving college, he moved to Washington D.C. to stay with his parents, where {{he worked as a}} <b>window</b> <b>decorator</b> for a department store and did scientific illustration for the Smithsonian in the evenings. While in Washington he and his two sisters Ann and Nell formed a semi-professional singing group called [...] "The Texas Trio," [...] and performed locally. In 1937 the group visited New York City to win a Major Bowes' Amateur Hour competition, at which time he was invited to join the travelling Bowes troupe as a single act. Hinton left school to tour the country with the troupe, finally settling in Los Angeles three years later, where he enrolled at UCLA to study marine biology, and met his wife, Leslie. During his stay in Los Angeles, he landed a role in the musical comedy Meet the People alongside then-unknowns including Virginia O'Brien, Nanette Fabray, and Doodles Weaver. After graduating from UCLA in 1940, Hinton was appointed director of the Desert Museum in Palm Springs, California, where he served from 1942 to 1944, moving on to San Diego, California in 1944 as Editor of Illustration at the University of California Division of War Research (UCDWR), a University of California-wide wartime laboratory that was located at Point Loma.

5000|$|Lilly Reich {{was born}} in Berlin, Germany in the year 1885. In 1908 she put her {{embroidery}} training to use {{when she went to}} Vienna to work for the Wiener Werkstätte (Vienna Workshop), a visual arts production company of designers, artists, and architects. She returned to Berlin by 1911. There she began to design furniture and clothing. She also worked as a shop <b>window</b> <b>decorator</b> at this time. The following year she joined the Deutscher Werkbund, or German Work Federation, a group similar to the Vienna Workshop whose purpose was to help improve competitiveness of German companies in the global market. That year she designed a sample working-class flat in the Berlin Gewerkschaftshaus, or Trade Union House. It received much praise for the clarity and functionalism of the furnishings. She contributed work to the Werkbund exhibition in Cologne in 1914. In 1920 Lilly became the first woman elected to the governing board of the Deutscher Werkbund. From 1924 to 1926 she worked at the Messeamt, or Trade Fair Office, in Frankfurt am Main. There, she was in charge of organizing and designing trade fairs.It was there that she met Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, vice president of the Deutscher Werkbund. This sparked a period of involvement of furniture for van der Rohe as the two collaborated on many projects together. In 1927 the two worked on “Die Wohnung” in Stuttgart for the Werkbund. She designed many interiors for this exhibition including “Wohnraum in Spiegelglas" [...] ("living space in mirror glass"). During her career she designed store windows, exhibition displays, and fashion. In 1929 she became the artistic director for the German contribution to the Barcelona World Exposition, where van der Rohe designed his world-famous pavilion. This is where the famous Barcelona chair made its first appearance. This pavilion was considered the highlight of their design efforts. In 1932 Lilly was asked by van der Rohe to teach at the Bauhaus and direct the interior design workshop. The Bauhaus was closed shortly after in 1933 by the Nazis who saw their work as “degenerate art, probably influenced by Jews.” She taught at the Hochschule für bildende Künste after the Second World War, but not for long because she became ill and had to resign. She died a few years later in 1947 in Berlin.|$|E
