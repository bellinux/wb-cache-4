The two then <b>walk</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> and {{arrive at a}} protest where revolution leaders are giving speeches. Reza's cousin Ali Shirazi (Nicholas Guilak) arrives and, when the protest is interrupted by soldiers and the crowd begins to disperse, he tries to convince Reza to throw rocks at the soldiers. Babak opposes, and Reza is left {{to decide whether to}} act aggressively and throw rocks, or act passively and voice his concerns instead. When the soldiers start threatening the crowds by firing, Reza and Babak flee into an alley, shortly followed by Ali and an injured Abbas (Ray Haratian), one of the revolution leaders who was stabbed in the commotion. After briefly being tended to, Abbas is escorted away by Ali and Bibi Golestan (Mozhan Marnò).|$|E

The 2010 testimonies of former Taliban commanders show that Pakistan through its Inter-Services Intelligence was however [...] "actively encouraging a Taliban revival" [...] from 2004-2006. The effort to reintroduce the Afghan Taliban militarily in Afghanistan was preceded by a two-year, large-scale training campaign of Taliban fighters and leaders conducted by the ISI in several training camps in Quetta and other places in Pakistan. From 2004-2006 the Afghan Taliban consequently started a deadly insurgency campaign in Afghanistan killing thousands of civilians and combatants and thereby renewing and escalating the War in Afghanistan (2001-present). One Taliban commander involved in the Taliban resurgence said that 80 percent of his fighters had been trained in an ISI camp.|$|E
2500|$|By then, the {{historian}} lived a bohemian life, {{and was a}} regular at Fialcovsky Coffeehouse, where he appeared [...] "jocular and always absent minded". According to the recollections of Mariu Theodorian-Carada, although [...] "Boniface Florescu" [...] and Demetriade made efforts to keep it alive, by 1886 [...] "Fialkovsky was dwindling". Potra notes that Florescu was memorable as a Bucharest [...] "type", [...] "with his quite disheveled appearance, his paddling, slow and measured stride, and above all with his way of life". Reportedly, he always wore just one galosh, or sometimes one of his wife's boots, and his suits were covered in ink blots. Gheorghe Gh. Longinescu, who was schooled at Saint Sava, recalls that his teacher had an unusual, crooked, stride, which matched his handwriting. An unnamed Saint Sava alumnus recalled in 1926: [...] "Just about every day, he would <b>walk</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> reading from a newspaper or a book, and, since he was shortsighted, he kept [...] very close to his eyes, and so he bumped into streetlights or street corners, after which he would present his excuses." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 1 March 2007 Ungdomshuset {{was cleared}} of its {{occupants}} {{by the police}} at about 7:00 (CET) in the morning. A 50-metre area surrounding the building was sealed off.

Special forces entered the building from the roof, the windows and the ground, while the house was covered in foam to diminish the effectiveness of possible counterattacks such as Molotov cocktails. Afterwards the supporters of Ungdomshuset announced that it was [...] "either an Ungdomshus or a battle for an Ungdomshus — the clearing will never be forgiven". Rioting broke out, including a blockade of Nørrebrogade, the main street of Nørrebro, and fires in the areas surrounding Freetown Christiania and south of Nørrebrogade. Containers were turned over, windows were broken. Molotov cocktails were thrown out by the demonstrators, at the cries of [...] "The street are ours!" [...] Setting up barricades, they played alter-globalization songs such as Manu Chao from trucks. Riot police used tear gas (CS gas) on several occasions throughout the riots. The entire area was unsafe and neighbors to Ungdomshuset were told to stay indoors. It was unsafe to <b>walk</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> because of the riots and because the police proclaimed that anyone without a valid reason for being on the streets would be arrested.
