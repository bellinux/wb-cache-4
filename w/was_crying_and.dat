Dean biographer John Howlett said these read like wishful fantasies, as Bast claims them to be. Joe Hyams, in his 1992 biography of Dean, claims that he visited Dean just as Angeli, then married to Damone, was leaving his home. Dean <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> allegedly told Hyams she was pregnant, with Hyams concluding that Dean believed the child might be his.|$|E
25|$|Tabari writes, “God created Adam {{with his}} own hands so that God could say to Iblis (Satan) that he was exalting himself over that which God formed {{with his own}} hands. So God created Adam as a human and his body was from clay. God breathed his spirit into Adam. Then when God’s spirit entered his eyes he saw the fruits of Paradise and when it entered his stomach he was hungry, so before the spirit reached his feet {{he tried to get}} up in haste to have the fruits of Paradise. This is the meaning of God’s word: “Man was created in haste” (21:37) In regards to the testing of Adam and Eve, Ibn Ishaq writes, “Iblis started off by crying for Adam and Eve, and they became sad when they heard him. They asked him why he <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> he said, “I am crying for you because you will die and be forced to give up the luxury and plenty you are enjoying.” Then Iblis went to them and whispered saying, “Adam, may I lead you to the Tree of Immortality and to a kingdom that does not decline?” (20:120) Meaning that they might become angels or live forever in Paradise. In the Qur'an it states, “When we took from the prophets their {{covenant}} from you, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant” (Q 33:7) That covenant was, as quoted by Ibn Abbas “The Prophet Muhammad said, “God took a covenant from the back of Adam on the day of ‘Arafat. He caused all of his offspring to come out of him, and spread them out in front of him. In regards to Adam’s death, Tabari writes, “When Adam died it was Friday. The angels came to him, sent by God from Paradise, to embalm and wrap him, and they honored his son and heir Seth. Ibn Ishaq says: The sun and the moon were eclipsed for seven days and nights.|$|E

500|$|Journalist James P. O'Donnell, who {{conducted}} extensive interviews in the 1970s, provides one {{account of what}} happened next. SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke, {{who presided over the}} court martial for desertion, told O'Donnell that Hitler ordered him to set up a tribunal. Mohnke arranged for a court martial panel, which consisted of generals Wilhelm Burgdorf, Hans Krebs, SS-Gruppenführer Johann Rattenhuber, and himself. Fegelein, still drunk, refused to accept that he had to answer to Hitler, and stated that he was responsible only to Himmler. Fegelein was so drunk that he <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> vomiting; he was unable to stand up, and even urinated on the floor. Mohnke was in a quandary, as German military and civilian law both require a defendant to be of sound mind and to understand the charges against them. Although Mohnke was certain Fegelein was [...] "guilty of flagrant desertion", it was the opinion of the judges that he was in no condition to stand trial, so Mohnke closed the proceedings and turned the defendant over to General Rattenhuber's security squad. Mohnke never saw Fegelein again.|$|E
500|$|Elena Pignatti, who had {{employed}} Morisi {{after she}} left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that [...] "seven or eight years ago... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and {{it was said that}} he was going to die. Around then, one morning... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, I was sure that he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother <b>was</b> <b>crying,</b> <b>and</b> despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E

500|$|Although some {{survivors}} {{disputed the}} accounts of cannibalism, Charles McGlashan, who corresponded {{with many of the}} survivors over a 40-year period, documented many recollections that it occurred. Some correspondents were not forthcoming, approaching their participation with shame, but others eventually spoke about it freely. McGlashan in his 1879 book History of the Donner Party declined to include some of the more morbid detailssuch as the suffering of the children and infants before death, or how Mrs. Murphy, according to Georgia Donner, gave up, lay down on her bed and faced the wall when the last of the children left in the third relief. He also neglected to mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek. The same year McGlashan's book was published, Georgia Donner wrote to him to clarify some points, saying that human flesh was prepared for people in both tents at Alder Creek, but to her recollection (she was four years old during the winter of 1846–1847) it was given only to the youngest children: [...] "Father <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> did not look at us the entire time, and we little ones felt we could not help it. There was nothing else." [...] She also remembered that Elizabeth Donner, Jacob's wife, announced one morning that she had cooked the arm of Samuel Shoemaker, a 25-year-old teamster. Eliza Donner Houghton, in her 1911 account of the ordeal, did not mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.|$|E

[...] The hunters were game as was Nolan but a curious change in description of the events were later declared. Johnny Cook's version stated that Nolan <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> dramatic with the hunters. And the hunters felt sympathy for him and agreed to press on. Nolan's version was different and he wrote that he believed water was to be had some six or seven miles (11km) ahead as reported by Tafoya.

He had a goal to follow the Indians and to seek water and that is what he did.

2500|$|Ivana Baquero as Ofelia / Princess Moanna, a {{child who}} comes to believe she is the reincarnation of a princess from the underworld. Del Toro said he was nervous about casting the lead role, and that finding the 10-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental. (The film was shot from June–October 2005, when she was 11.) [...] "The {{character}} I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9, and Ivana came in {{and she was a}} little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, my wife <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age." [...] Baquero says that Del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairy tales to help her [...] "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt". She says she thought the film was [...] "marvelous", and that [...] "at the same time it can bring you pain, and sadness, and scariness, and happiness".|$|E
2500|$|Neely was {{captain of}} the undefeated 1922 team. In {{the second week of}} play Vanderbilt shut out Henderson-Brown 33–0, with Neely scoring a third-quarter touchdown. Despite an injured left arm, he started in the [...] at the {{dedication}} at Dudley Field. Vanderbilt was forced to punt from its seven-yard line early in the first quarter. [...] The Wolverines completed their first pass (from Doug Roby to Paul Goebel), setting in motion a change in field position which placed them inside the five-yard line. The Commodore punt was partially blocked, giving Michigan the ball at Vanderbilt's 25-yard line. Two end runs, two line bucks and a forward pass brought them to first and goal after six minutes. The Commodore defense stiffened, repelling four touchdown tries; three runs up the middle were stopped before the goal line. Franklin Cappon gained a yard, Harry Kipke lost one and Cappon drove to within a foot of the goal; Neely was heard shouting, [...] "Stop 'em!" [...] On fourth down, Michigan faked a field goal and ran with Harry Kipke off tackle to the right. Kipke was tackled inches from the end zone. A Vanderbilt player pushed himself off the goal post to generate a greater backwards push as the crowd cheered. Vanderbilt's only noteworthy offensive play occurred soon afterwards. The Commodores punted out of the shadow of their goalpost after a goal line stand; Neely tackled Kipke (or Irwin Uteritz) hard on the punt return, causing a fumble which he recovered. He then connected on a 20–plus-yard pass to Tot McCullough. This gave Vanderbilt the ball at Michigan's 20-yard line, but subsequent Vanderbilt plays saw runs stopped with little gain and a pass intercepted by Uteritz. The tie was reportedly preserved when Neely recovered a fumble near the Commodore goal. He and Lynn Bomar were acknowledged as Vanderbilt's players of the game, and Neely wept tears of joy by the game's end. Bomar spent much of his day tackling Michigan runners, and Neely was a battered, bruised captain playing hard despite his injuries. Franklin Cappon said after the game, [...] "What sort of a crazy man is this Neely? He played like a fiend and when he tackled me I thought I was broken in two. When I got up he <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> <b>and</b> cussed me out. I was the one who should have been crying".|$|E
