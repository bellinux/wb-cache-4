5|$|The <b>Westerlies</b> or the Prevailing <b>Westerlies</b> are the {{prevailing}} winds {{in the middle}} latitudes between 35 and 65degrees latitude. These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, and weakest {{during the summer and}} when pressures are higher over the poles.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} trade winds, the <b>westerlies</b> enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships {{crossing}} the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the <b>westerlies</b> {{lead to the}} development of strong ocean currents on the western sides of oceans in both hemispheres through the process of western intensification. These western ocean currents transport warm, sub tropical water polewards toward the polar regions. The <b>westerlies</b> can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down. The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are within a band known as the Roaring Forties, between 40 and 50degrees latitude south of the equator. The <b>Westerlies</b> {{play an important role in}} carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents, especially in the southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific ocean, {{the full}} wind circulation, which {{included}} both the trade wind easterlies and higher-latitude <b>Westerlies,</b> was unknown to Europeans until Andres de Urdaneta's voyage in 1565.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} the Patagonian region is {{influenced}} both by the close distance to Antarctica and by the Southern Hemisphere <b>Westerlies.</b> Polar cold air outbreaks, cool ocean upwelling, orographic precipitation and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current further affect the regional climate.|$|E
5|$|The polar easterlies, {{also known}} as Polar Hadley cells, are dry, cold {{prevailing}} winds that blow from the high-pressure areas of the polar highs at {{the north and south}} poles towards the low-pressure areas within the <b>Westerlies</b> at high latitudes. Unlike the <b>Westerlies,</b> these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular. Because of the low sun angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is deflected westward by the Coriolis effect.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{atmospheric}} circulation bands consist {{of the trade}} winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the <b>westerlies</b> in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°. Ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.|$|E
5|$|When a {{tropical}} cyclone crosses the subtropical ridge axis, normally through {{a break in}} the high-pressure area caused by a system traversing the <b>Westerlies,</b> its general track around the high-pressure area is deflected significantly by winds moving towards the general low-pressure area to its north. When the cyclone track becomes strongly poleward with an easterly component, the cyclone has begun recurvature, entering the <b>Westerlies.</b> A typhoon moving through the Pacific Ocean towards Asia, for example, will recurve offshore of Japan to the north, and then to the northeast, if the typhoon encounters southwesterly winds (blowing northeastward) around a low-pressure system passing over China or Siberia. Many tropical cyclones are eventually forced toward the northeast by extratropical cyclones in this manner, which move from west to east {{to the north of the}} subtropical ridge. An example of {{a tropical}} cyclone in recurvature was Typhoon Ioke in 2006, which took a similar trajectory.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Yap, Mitag {{turned to}} the northwest and later to the north due to an approaching trough. It passed {{to the north of}} Palau, contributing to one death there. Despite predictions of weakening, the typhoon continued to intensify, reaching peak winds of 175km/h (110mph 10minute sustained) on March5. The combination of cooler air and interaction with the <b>westerlies</b> caused Mitag to weaken significantly. Only four days after reaching peak winds, the storm had dissipated well to the east of the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the <b>westerlies,</b> they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its core, {{and as a result}} develops central convection. A particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} began to reorganize, the forward motion had become {{virtually}} stationary but later began {{to increase as}} Arlene turned northeastward, beginning recurvature into the main belt of the <b>Westerlies.</b> Ships {{in the vicinity of}} the depression reported that it had regained gale-force winds on August8, resulting in advisories on Arlene being re-initiated around that time. Later that day, a Navy reconnaissance plane found hurricane-force winds around the center of the storm, resulting in Arlene being upgraded to a minimal hurricane a second time.|$|E
5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named storms. This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939. Four of the five storms {{developed from}} the intertropical convergence zone. The decreased activity is partially due to the <b>westerlies</b> extending further south than usual, {{as well as a}} persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler than usual. Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Fran rapidly tracked {{towards the}} {{northeast}} {{in response to}} an area of low pressure within the <b>westerlies.</b> By October11, the hurricane attained its peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) and its lowest barometric pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg) after bypassing the Azores islands. Situated over exceedingly cold waters, Fran transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on October12 as it neared the French coastline. Shortly before reaching land, the system was absorbed by a cold front. Throughout its existence, Fran had little effect on land.|$|E
5|$|In {{general the}} summers are warm-hot with {{rainfall}} erratic but occasionally heavy while in winter {{it is very}} mild with rainfall more or less uniform. There is a gradual transition from summer to winter conditions and vice versa. Winds are frequent and salt-laden being moderate easterlies {{in the summer and}} fresh to strong <b>westerlies</b> in the winter. July is the windiest month, and the winter months are subject to frequent gales and strong winds. The island has 67.8 clear days, annually.|$|E
5|$|In the Caribbean, {{the trough}} caused the {{depression}} to slow to a westward drift, resulting in {{several days of}} heavy rainfall in the region, particularly Puerto Rico. One forecast on October 5 anticipated a continued westward track toward Jamaica. Instead, the depression turned to the north the next day {{under the influence of}} the upper-level <b>westerlies.</b> On October 7, the depression attained its lowest pressure of 1000 mbar (29.53 inHg), off the southern coast of Hispaniola. The next day, it made landfall in Peravia Province in the Dominican Republic. After crossing the country and exiting into the Atlantic Ocean, the depression accelerated to the northeast, followed by an eastward turn on October 10 before another turn to the northeast. By October 12, the depression could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone, although satellite imagery indicated that its remnants continued northeastward. On October 15 the system turned to the west, suppressed by a strong high-pressure area to its north. It re-intensified while crossing through the Azores, attaining a pressure of 994 mbar. It turned to the northwest and was absorbed into the <b>westerlies</b> on October 20.|$|E

5|$|Kona lows, most extra{{tropical}} cyclones, {{and tropical}} upper tropospheric cyclones are cold core lows. In {{the eastern half}} of the north Pacific ocean and north Indian ocean, the formation of a weak circulation underneath a mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the <b>westerlies</b> during the cold season (winter) is called a subtropical cyclone. In the case of the north Indian ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Emmy turned {{more to the}} northwest, {{and passed}} about 135miles (220km) {{northeast}} of Barbuda on August 23. The rapid development of an unseasonable frontal low pressure system to the northeast of the storm turned Emmy sharply east-northeastward on August 25. Its eastward movement at such a low latitude for {{the time of year}} was unprecedented. The storm steadily intensified and Emmy attained hurricane status later on the 25th while located 270miles (430km) north of Barbuda. After moving eastward for about 24hours, the <b>Westerlies</b> retreated northward, and Emmy turned gradually to the northwest.|$|E
5|$|A {{squall line}} which moved {{offshore}} New York and southern New England formed a mesoscale convective vortex, which fired new thunderstorm activity each day {{as it moved}} within the <b>westerlies</b> across the northern Atlantic.
