5|$|The UK Singles Chart is {{a record}} chart {{compiled}} {{on behalf of the}} British record industry based on sales of singles in the UK. Since 1997, the chart has been compiled by The Official Charts Company and was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets until 2005, when digital downloads were included in the chart compilation.
