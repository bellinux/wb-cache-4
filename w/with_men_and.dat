5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for.

Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} <b>with</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E

5|$|Twenty-three years later, in 1976, sexologist Shere Hite {{published}} {{a report on}} the sexual encounters of 3,019 women who had responded to questionnaires, under the title The Hite Report. Hite's questions differed from Kinsey's, focusing more on how women identified, or what they preferred rather than experience. Respondents to Hite's questions indicated that 8% preferred sex with women and 9% answered that they identified as bisexual or had sexual experiences <b>with</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women, though they refused to indicate preference.|$|E

On the drive, she and Bruce struggle to express themselves to each other ("Telephone Wire").|$|E

5|$|Physical {{exercises}} {{were popular}} <b>with</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> wrestling {{was an important}} male preoccupation for sport and entertainment.

Royal palaces and market places had special arenas where royalty and common people alike amused themselves by watching matches such as cock fights, ram fights and wrestling between women.

5|$|Throughout the 1970s {{construction}} continued, {{starting with}} the Mathematical Sciences Building, followed by the Offenhauer Towers in 1971 and Industrial Education & Technology Building in 1972. The Business Building and the Industrial Arts Building opened in 1973 and University Hall received renovations in 1974 that included new seating, an improved sound system, and air conditioning in the auditorium. In 1979, the Student Recreation Center and the Moore Musical Arts Center opened. In 1970, the Board of Trustees ended an alcoholic beverage ban on campus. The Cardinal Room, an on-campus eatery, began serving beer. A growing trend in the late 1960s and early 1970s was the development of large apartment complexes adjacent to campus. By the 1970s approximately 4,000 students lived in private, off-campus housing. On campus, Darrow Hall became the first co-ed dorm in 1972 <b>with</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women inhabiting alternating floors.|$|E
5|$|Traditional historiography {{emphasizes}} Li Yuan's initial {{reluctance to}} {{revolt against the}} Sui, {{and that he had}} to be persuaded by his senior aides and his second son (and eventual successor), Li Shimin. In reality, Li Yuan was considering a rebellion at least by the time of his appointment to Taiyuan in early 617. In mid-617, Li began raising additional troops from his province and executed his two deputies—who were appointed by Yang to watch over him. He also concluded an alliance with Shibi, the powerful khagan of the Eastern Turks, which secured his northern frontier from a Turkish invasion and provided him <b>with</b> <b>men</b> <b>and,</b> most importantly, horses, which he lacked. Initially, however, Li Yuan portrayed himself a Sui loyalist, and proclaimed his intention of placing Yang's grandson, Yang You, on the throne.|$|E
