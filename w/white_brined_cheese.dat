Cheese A was produced with strains: Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis 653, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris 656, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis 07 and Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei 08 (8 : 5 : 5 : 2) and cheese B with strains: Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis 195, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris 656 and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis 07 (10 : 5 : 5). The lactococci counts in both cheeses and lactobacilli count in cheese A remained at a high level, while lactobacilli count in cheese B increased through the ripening. No significant differences (P< 0. 05) were found in the gross composition of the experimental cheeses, although the pH values were lower in cheese A. Proteolysis was assessed by the water-soluble nitrogen fractions, 5 %-phosphotungstic-acid-soluble nitrogen fractions and SDSPAGE- electrophoresis.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Fast {{proteolysis}} {{of cheese}} in ripening process {{may lead to}} the premature attack of casein, release of the majority of enzymes into the whey, and loss of cheese composition from curd to whey. In this study, the effect of liposomal Flavourzyme on proteolysis of Iranian <b>white</b> <b>brined</b> <b>cheese,</b> {{as well as on the}} yield and composition of whey and curd was investigated. Materials and Methods: Heating method (without using any toxic, volatile organic solvent or detergent) was used to nanoliposomal encapsulation of Flavourzyme. So, 0. 15 % and 0. 3 % (w/v) Flavourzyme-loaded liposome were incorporated to pasteurized cow milk. Iranian brined cheese was produced in triplicate using a complete randomized design. Then total solids were determined by drying them in an Infrared Oven. Water soluble nitrogen/total nitrogen and non-protein nitrogen/total nitrogen was determined by Kjeldahl method. Results: Encapsulation efficiency of liposomal Flavourzyme was 25 %. No significant differences between chemical components of cheese curd (total solid, protein, TCA-soluble nitrogen, water soluble nitrogen) and whey (total solid, protein) were observed between encapsulated cheese and the control. Cheese production yield in experimental cheese was not different from that in the control cheese (P> 0. 05). Conclusions: The results suggest that application of liposomal Flavourzyme for acceleration of Iranian <b>white</b> <b>brined</b> <b>cheese</b> inhibits premature attack of casein and the release of the majority of cheese compositions into the whey.

White brined cow cheese of overheated milk went through specific proteolytic changes during ripening that were result of high level of whey proteins incorporated into the gel matrix. Specificity was reflected through the relatively low level of soluble nitrogen fractions, the intensive and continual decrease of αs-caseins up to 15. 42 % of initial content, slow degradation of β-casein throughout the whole ripening period and high level of proteolytic products tightly bounded into gel matrix. Strong negative correlations (- 0. 97, - 0. 98 and - 0. 91; p< 0. 05) between ripening time and resudual αs-caseins, β-casein and low molecular weight products were observed.
