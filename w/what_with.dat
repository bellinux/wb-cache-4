5|$|Because of {{atypical}} scheduling of the show's first 7 episodes, American Dad! has {{a controversial}} season number discrepancy {{in which many}} are divided as to how many seasons the program has had. Beyond division between media journalists and fans, there has been conflicting reports as to what season the show is in even between American Dad! creators and the show's official website—both from its original Fox website and now from TBS website. At Comic-Con 2013 on July 20, American Dad! co-creator Mike Barker hinted that an American Dad! movie—centering on the Roger character and set from his birth planet—is in the works and partially written. <b>What</b> <b>with</b> Barker's departure from the series however, it is unclear {{if any of these}} plans have been scrapped or modified in any way.|$|E

I never remember seeing better running between wickets than of these two – and found myself comparing them, in fact, with Hobbs and Sutcliffe. With the field constantly changing over as right- and left-hander alternated, England, in much heat, sweated and chased unavailingly.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} the forces ranged against L.Ron Hubbard, {{in this war}} he never started, {{it is necessary to}} gain a cursory glimpse of the old and venerable science of psychiatry-which was actually none of the aforementioned. As an institution, it dates back to shortly {{before the turn of the}} century; it is certainly not worthy of respect by reason of age or dignity; and it does not meet any known definition of a science, <b>what</b> <b>with</b> its hodgepodge of unproven theories that have never produced any result-except an ability to make the unmanageable and mutinous more docile and quiet, and turn the troubled into apathetic souls beyond the point of caring.

Furthermore, 770 schools in Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao were considered overcrowded.

25|$|He {{made his}} World Cup debut against South Africa at Hove {{striking}} a half century, but scored just 13 {{in the next}} game against Zimbabwe. India lost both the games. Having lost the first two games, India needed to win the remaining three games {{of the first round}} to have any chance of advancing into the Super Six stage. Dravid put up a partnership of 237 runs with Sachin Tendulkar against Kenya at Bristol – a World Cup record – and in the process hit his maiden World Cup hundred, helping India to a 94-run victory. Mongia had left the field at the end of 9th over forcing Dravid to keep the wickets {{for the rest of the}} Kenyan innings. In the absence of injured Nayan Mongia, Dravid played his first ODI as a designated keeper against Sri Lanka at Taunton. Dravid once again staged a record breaking partnership worth 318 runs – the first ever three hundred run partnership in ODI history – but this time with Sourav Ganguly, guiding India to a 157-run win. Dravid scored 145 runs from 129 balls with 17 fours and a six, becoming the second batsman in World Cup history to hit back-to-back hundreds. Dravid struck a fine fifty in the last group match as India defeated England to advance into the Super Six stage. Dravid scored 2, 61 & 29 in the three Super Six matches against Australia, Pakistan & New Zealand respectively. India failed to qualify for the semi-finals having lost to Australia and New Zealand but achieved a consolation victory against Pakistan in a tense game, <b>what</b> <b>with</b> the military conflict going on between the two countries in Kashmir at the same time. Dravid emerged as the top scorer of the tournament with 461 runs from 8 games at an average of 65.85 and a strike rate of 85.52. He capped a successful World Cup outing on personal front with a commentary stint during the World Cup Final which resulted in him getting reprimanded by the BCCI for appearing on television without board's permission. He received CEAT Cricketer of the World Cup award, later that year.|$|E

'Louboutins' ... definitely has the catchiest chorus she's had in years. This could actually bring Jennifer out of the pit her last album Brave dug her into." [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as [...] "a Tricky and The-Dream-produced club banger with a chorus that succeeds through sheer attrition, with a proper Janet Jackson-style dance break. [...] Truth be told, it's not a J.Lo classic to rival 'Play' or 'Love Don't Cost a Thing', and it's about as original as starting your day {{with a bowl of}} Kellogg's Cornflakes, but it does burrow into your brain after a few spins." ...|$|E

Leane added that [...] "by pitting May against her other self in a well-shot, thumpingly-scored fight sequence, new-to-S.H.I.E.L.D. director Kevin Tancharoen used his experience from Mortal Kombat: Legacy to highlight how far the action elements of the show have come since the early days." [...] and also noted the development of multiple characters as positive. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said [...] "I had my trepidations about [...] "Face My Enemy"'s cutesy-looking callbacks to more camp episodes and spy tropes, the kind you might expect from Chuck, back in the day.
