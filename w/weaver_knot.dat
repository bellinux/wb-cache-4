60|$|He worked mechanically. When a {{small bobbin}} ran out, {{he used his}} left hand for a brake, {{stopping}} the large bobbin {{and at the same}} time, with thumb and forefinger, catching the flying end of twine. Also, at the same time, with his right hand, he caught up the loose twine-end of a small bobbin. These various acts with both hands were performed simultaneously and swiftly. Then there would come a flash of his hands as he looped the <b>weaver's</b> <b>knot</b> and released the bobbin. There was nothing difficult about <b>weaver's</b> <b>knots.</b> He once boasted he could tie them in his sleep. And for that matter, he sometimes did, toiling centuries long in a single night at tying an endless succession of <b>weaver's</b> <b>knots.</b>|$|R
60|$|Daughtry dashed {{into the}} cabin, {{came back with}} a pillow and three sheets, and, using the first as a pad and {{knotting}} the last together in swift <b>weaver's</b> <b>knots,</b> he left the Ancient Mariner safe and soft and took Michael back into his own arms.|$|R
50|$|The {{sheet bend}} (also known as becket bend, <b>weaver's</b> <b>knot</b> and <b>weaver's</b> hitch) is a bend, that is, a knot that joins two ropes together. Doubled, it is {{effective}} in binding lines of different diameter or rigidity securely together, although it {{has a tendency to}} work loose when not under load.|$|R
50|$|One type of <b>weaver's</b> <b>knot</b> is topologically {{equivalent}} to a sheet bend, but is tied (usually in smaller stuff) with a different approach. Sheet bends are also used for netting.Notice that, to have any strength, the two free ends should {{end up on the}} same side of the knot (see below). Under even moderate load, a left-hand sheet bend will quickly slip and release completely.|$|R
50|$|Men shear {{sheep in}} spring and autumn, while women collect dyestuffs and spin and dye yarn in the spring, summer and autumn. The weaving is {{undertaken}} during winter by the female members of the extended family, girls learning from their mothers and grandmothers and wives assisting their mothers-in-law. The carpet is made on horizontal or vertical looms using multi-coloured wool, cotton or silk yarn coloured with natural dyes. Applying special techniques to create pile carpets, <b>weavers</b> <b>knot</b> the pile yarn around threads of the warp; pile-less carpets are variously made with interlacing structural warps, wefts, and patterning wefts. The cutting of a finished carpet from the loom is an unusually solemn celebration.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, the Mechanical {{properties}} of polypropylene yarn of outer protection layer on Submarine High Voltage Cable, twisted around submarine cable,is determined on various conditions at ABB Company. In the first step, tensile tests are done with polypropylene yarn specimens {{with and without}} Bitumen at Room temperature. In the second step,tensile tests are done with polypropylene yarn specimens with and without Bitumen and with knotted polypropylene yarn namely: the Fishermen’s <b>knot,</b> the <b>Weaver’s</b> <b>knot,</b> the Square knot and the Overhand knot at Warm Condition (60 ˚c) and Cold Condition(- 5 ˚c). In the final step,it is proposed to obtain numerical solution using FEM analysis with ABAQUS Software to obtain the hoop stress, the yarn stresses from twisting cable and analyzing of the cylindrical buckling in the buckling torsion and buckling bending on the outer layer of submarine cable with polypropylene material that is mixed with Bitumen...|$|R
25|$|Weaving {{normally}} begins {{from the}} bottom of the loom, by passing a number of wefts through the warps to form a base to start from. Knots of dyed wool, cotton or silk threads are then tied in rows around consecutive sets of adjacent warps. As more rows are tied to the foundation, these knots become the pile of the rug. Between each row of knots, one or more shots of weft are passed to keep the knots fixed. The wefts are then beaten down by a comb-like instrument, the comb beater, to further compact and secure the newly-woven row. Depending on the fineness of the weave, the quality of the materials and the expertise of the <b>weavers,</b> the <b>knot</b> count of a handmade rug can vary anywhere from 16 to 800 knots per square inch.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminology}} “macramé” {{dates back}} to an Arabic origin and translates to ‘fringe’. This skill originated in the 13th century when Arabian <b>weavers</b> would <b>knot</b> excess fabric {{at the edges of}} loomed fabric. It then became popular in the 14th and 15th centuries on French and Italian ships and was known to the sailors as “square knotting”, a fancy rope work used to make small decorative items aboard a ship. Sailors would describe the rope materials used by their circumference, however, now cord size is given in diameter length. They typically used cotton, hemp or steel cord to ornament the ships rigging. The round braids, hitching and Turk’s head macramé styles were often used as protective wrappings for rails, spars and rigging. Mats were made from hemp and cotton to create nonskid surfaces on deck.|$|R

2500|$|In {{areas with}} traditional, time-honoured local designs, {{such as the}} Persian nomad tribes, the weaver is able to work from memory, as the {{specific}} patterns {{are part of the}} family or tribal tradition. This is usually sufficient for less elaborate, mostly rectilinear designs. For more elaborate, especially curvilinear designs, the patterns are carefully drawn to scale in the proper colours on graph paper. The resulting design plan is termed a [...] "cartoon". The <b>weaver</b> weaves a <b>knot</b> for each square on the scale paper, which allows for an accurate rendition of even the most complex designs. Designs have changed little through centuries of weaving. Today computers are used in the production of scale drawings for the weavers.|$|R
50|$|The upright pile of Turkish rugs usually {{falls in}} one direction, as knots are always pulled down before {{the string of}} pile yarn is cut off and work resumes on the next knot, piling {{row after row of}} knots on top of each other. When {{touching}} a carpet, this creates a feeling similar to stroking an animal's fur. This can be used to determine where the <b>weaver</b> has started <b>knotting</b> the pile. The pile in Turkish carpets is usually between 2 and 4 mm thick. Coarse nomadic rugs like the Yürük rugs, can be as thick as 12 mm. A special bedding carpet called yatak may reach a pile thickness of 20 to 25 mm.|$|R

50|$|The upright pile of oriental rugs usually {{inclines}} in one direction, as knots {{are always}} pulled downwards before {{the string of}} pile yarn is cut off and work resumes on the next knot, piling {{row after row of}} knots on top of each other. When passing one's hand over a carpet, this creates a feeling similar to stroking an animal's fur. This can be used to determine where the <b>weaver</b> has started <b>knotting</b> the pile. Prayer rugs are often woven “upside down”, as becomes apparent when the direction of the pile is assessed. This has both technical reasons (the weaver can focus on the more complicated niche design first), and practical consequences (the pile bends {{in the direction of the}} worshipper's prostration).|$|R
5000|$|In the Western Hemisphere, macramé is {{believed}} to have originated with 13th-century Arab <b>weavers.</b> These artisans <b>knotted</b> the excess thread and yarn along the edges of hand-loomed fabrics into decorative fringes on bath towels, shawls, and veils. The Spanish word macramé is derived from the Arabic migramah (مقرمة), believed to mean [...] "striped towel", [...] "ornamental fringe" [...] or [...] "embroidered veil." [...] After the Moorish conquest, the art was taken to Spain, then to Italy, especially in the region of Liguria, and then spread through Europe. It was introduced into England at the court of Mary II in the late 17th century. Queen Mary taught the art of macramé to her ladies-in-waiting.Sailors made macramé objects in off hours while at sea, and sold or bartered them when they landed, thus spreading the art to places like China and the New World. Nineteenth-century British and American sailors made hammocks, bell fringes, and belts from macramé. They called the process [...] "square knotting" [...] after the knot they used most frequently. Sailors also called macramé [...] "McNamara's lace".|$|R
