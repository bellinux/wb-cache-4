The cook had earlier worked with some Bollywood people. Bollywood lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri used to regularly visit Lataji at her home daily at 6 pm.

Children were interviewed to obtain information as to how they thought their parents knew when they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>pain</b> and what did their parents do when they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>pain.</b> Facial drawings depicting anger, fear, and sadness and a 2 ̆ 2 comic book 2 ̆ 2 type format depicting African-American children who had pain and one of the above emotions were utilized to stimulate responses. From the interview responses of 22 parents and their children the data were categorized for commonalities. Based on the established categories the responses were coded and tallied.

The results suggested that parents and children can articulate what cues help them to identify when the child <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>pain</b> and what coping strategies they use to help alleviate the childs pain.

500|$|The last {{film that}} Monroe {{completed}} was John Huston's The Misfits, which Miller {{had written to}} provide her with a dramatic role. She played Roslyn, a recently divorced woman who becomes friends with three aging cowboys, played by Clark Gable, Eli Wallach and Montgomery Clift. The filming in the Nevada desert between July and November 1960 was again difficult. The four-year marriage of Monroe and Miller was effectively over, and he began a new relationship with Inge Morath. Monroe disliked that he had based her role partly on her life, and thought it inferior to the male roles; she also struggled with Miller's habit of re-writing scenes the night before filming. Her health was also failing: she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>pain</b> from gallstones, and her drug addiction was so severe that her make-up usually had to be applied {{while she was still}} asleep under the influence of barbiturates. In August, filming was halted for her to spend a week detoxing in a Los Angeles hospital. Despite her problems, Huston stated that when Monroe was playing Roslyn, she [...] "was not pretending to an emotion. It was the real thing. She would go deep down within herself and find it and bring it up into consciousness." ...|$|E

Although he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>pain,</b> team manager Benny Foster forced Simpson to race in the quarter-final against New Zealand's Warwick Dalton, hoping to unsettle Dalton ahead of a possible meeting with Simpson's teammeate Sheil. Simpson wanted to turn professional, but needed to prove himself first, setting his sights on the world amateur indoor hour record. Reg Harris arranged for an attempt at Zürich's Hallenstadion velodrome on Simpson's birthday in November. He failed by 320 metres, covering a distance of [...] and blaming his failure on the low temperature generated by an ice rink in the centre of the velodrome. The following week he travelled to Ghent, in the Flanders region of Belgium, to ride amateur track races.

Kurt Busch's crew chief Pat Tryson stated that he and the Penske Racing South team were relieved that the driver emerged uninjured after his crash on lap 256, and that they would do better at the next weekend's race.

Biffle said there should have been no open gaps in the circuit barriers and that all NASCAR tracks should have SAFER barriers installed.
