Ryōtarō Okiayu was chosen as Terra's Japanese voice actor as the staff <b>wanted</b> <b>one</b> actor similar to Chikao Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor, and Akio Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor while using Terra's body. The staff found Chikao's was a dry sort of voice, Akio's a deep, resonating sort of voice, and liked how Okiayu bore elements from both actors.|$|E

5|$|David Adler's book {{contains}} {{a detailed account}} of the event that made the Fool's Gold Loaf sandwich famous. On the night of February 1, 1976, Elvis Presley was at his home at Graceland in Memphis, entertaining Capt. Jerry Kennedy of the Denver, Colorado police force, and Ron Pietrafeso of Colorado's Strike Force Against Crime. The three men began discussing the sandwich, and Presley decided he <b>wanted</b> <b>one</b> right then. Presley had been to the restaurant before, while in Denver. Kennedy and Pietrafeso were friends of the owners and hung out there often, so they were driven to the Memphis airport and boarded Presley's private jet, the Lisa Marie, and flew the two hours to Denver. When they arrived at Stapleton International Airport at 1:40 AM, the plane taxied to a special hangar where the passengers were greeted by Buck Scott, the owner of the Colorado Mine Company, and his wife Cindy who had brought 30 fresh Fool's Gold Loaves for the men. They spent two hours in the hangar eating the sandwiches, washing them down with Perrier and champagne. Presley invited the pilots of the plane, Milo High and Elwood Davis, to join them. When they were done, they flew back to Memphis without ever having left the Denver airport.|$|E

25|$|In February 1905, {{the federal}} {{government}} introduced legislation to create the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan effective Dominion Day – July 1, 1905.

Haultain's opposition – along with Conservative attacks on the act's provisions for Catholic schools – delayed the passing of the act, and it did not receive royal assent until July 20, with September 1 now set as the date of provincial autonomy.|$|E

25|$|In May1938 {{with the}} Religions Law, Puyi was {{declared}} a god, and a cult of emperor-worship {{very similar to}} Japan's began with schoolchildren starting their classes by praying to {{a portrait of the}} god-emperor while imperial rescripts and the imperial regalia become sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor. Puyi's elevation to a god was due to the Sino-Japanese war, which caused the Japanese state to begin a program of totalitarian mobilization of society for total war in Japan and the places ruled by Japan. His Japanese handlers felt that ordinary people in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan were more willing to bear the sacrifices for total war because of their devotion to their god-emperor, and it was decided that making Puyi into a god-emperor would have the same effect in Manchukuo. After 1938, Puyi was hardly ever allowed to leave the Salt Tax Palace, while the creation of the puppet regime of President Wang Jingwei in November1938 crushed Puyi's spirits, as it ended his hope of one day being restored as the Great Qing Emperor. Puyi became a hypochondriac, taking all sorts of pills for various imagined aliments and hormones to improve his sex drive and allow him to father a boy, as Puyi was convinced that the Japanese were poisoning his food to make him sterile. Puyi believed that Japanese <b>wanted</b> <b>one</b> of the children that Pujie had fathered with his Japanese wife Lady Saga to be the next emperor, {{and it was a great}} relief to him that their children were both girls (Manchukuo law forbade female succession to the throne).|$|E
