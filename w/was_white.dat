The author described the best variety of the breed to be those with long ears whose coat <b>was</b> <b>white</b> under the belly and around the neck but brown on the back.|$|E
5|$|A {{squad of}} 16 members, {{built around the}} core of the former Rhodesia team, was hastily {{assembled}} by Liz Dreyer, {{the president of the national}} women's hockey association, who became the team's manager. Every player and official <b>was</b> <b>white.</b> Ann Grant, the team's 25-year-old sweeper, was appointed captain. Anthea Stewart, who had played for South Africa 25 times before retiring in 1974, both coached the squad and played herself. Liz Chase, the only other team member with international experience (having also represented South Africa) was made vice-captain. At 35 years old, Stewart was the team's oldest player, while Arlene Boxall, the 18-year-old reserve goalkeeper, was the youngest. The squad included twin sisters in Sandy Chick and Sonia Robertson.|$|E

5000|$|The question, what is being, {{is seeking}} {{an answer to}} {{something}} [...] "that is." [...] A contemporary example in rhetoric would be {{to look at a}} color. Using white as an example, when we define a color, we define it by association. Snow <b>is</b> <b>white.</b> Paper <b>is</b> <b>white.</b> A cow <b>is</b> <b>white.</b> But what <b>is</b> <b>white?</b> While we <b>are</b> saying things that <b>are</b> <b>white,</b> we <b>are</b> not defining what <b>white</b> <b>is</b> without qualification. Ousia is thus {{the answer to the question}} of [...] "what is being" [...] when the question is without qualification. The unqualified answer of what <b>is</b> <b>white</b> <b>is</b> the ousia of white.|$|R

5|$|According to the 2001 census, 96% of the {{population}} <b>was</b> <b>White</b> British, and 2.1% non-white (mainly of British Asian origin). Most non-white groups were concentrated in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Welsh Asian and African communities developed mainly through immigration after the Second World War. In the early 21st century, parts of Wales saw an increased number of immigrants settle from recent EU accession countries such as Poland; though a 2007 study showed a relatively low number of employed immigrant workers from the former Eastern Bloc countries in Wales compared to {{other regions of the}} United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|By 1 March, over {{two-thirds of}} BuzzFeed users polled responded that the dress <b>was</b> <b>white</b> and gold. Some people have {{suggested}} that the dress changes colours on its own. Media outlets noted that the photo was overexposed and had poor white balance, causing its colours to be washed out, giving rise to the perception by some that the dress is white and gold rather than its actual colours.|$|E
5|$|NY192 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY30 in the hamlet of Paul Smiths within {{the town of}} Brighton in Franklin County. The highway headed to the northeast, passing Cooler Pond {{to the south and}} Church Pond to the north. Just north of Church Pond was Osgood Pond, which was accessible at the first intersection, which <b>was</b> <b>White</b> Pond Road. NY192 then headed eastward, intersecting with County Route31 (CR31, named Jones Pond Road) in the hamlet of Paul Smiths Easy Street. The highway turned to the southeast, intersecting with another county route and passing Brighton Town Park. At the intersection with CR60 near the park, NY192 entered Gabriels.|$|E

5|$|Russell {{was married}} to his college {{sweetheart}} Rose Swisher from 1956 to 1973. They had three children, namely daughter Karen Russell, the television pundit and lawyer, and sons William Jr. and Jacob. However, the couple grew emotionally distant and divorced. In 1977, he married Dorothy Anstett, Miss USA of 1968, but they divorced in 1980. The relationship was shrouded in controversy because Anstett <b>was</b> <b>white.</b> In 1996, Russell married his third wife, Marilyn Nault; their marriage lasted until her death in January 2009. He has been a resident of Mercer Island, Washington for over four decades. His older brother was the noted playwright Charlie L. Russell.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Census {{revealed}} that approximately 93.6% of the town's resident population were White British; {{the second largest}} ethnic group <b>was</b> <b>White</b> Irish at approximately 3.4%, followed by Asian (including Asian British) at 1.09%; no other ethnic group represented 1% {{or more of the}} population. 88.5% of residents were born in England and 4.41% {{in other parts of the}} United Kingdom; 4.3% were from EU countries, with 2.5% coming from EU member states which joined after 2001.|$|E

5|$|The Maya {{viewed the}} cosmos as highly structured; there were {{thirteen}} {{levels in the}} heavens, and nine levels in the underworld; the mortal world occupied a position between the heavens and the underworld. Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour. Major deities had aspects associated with these directions and colours; north <b>was</b> <b>white,</b> east was red, south was yellow, and west was black.|$|E
5|$|The Thayer system <b>was</b> <b>white</b> {{with large}} {{polygonal}} patches of light sea blue (called Thayer Blue). This measure was most useful in Arctic latitudes with extended twilight and frequent fog and cloud cover. Purity of color {{was important for}} full realization of the Purkinje effect where some colors appear lighter and some appear darker at low levels of illumination. Darkening the pattern increased course deception, but increased visibility at night and in haze.|$|E
5|$|The former England home strip <b>was</b> <b>white</b> with a {{strip of}} red around the neck, and the away strip was black (causing much {{controversy}} due to the famous All-Black kit of New Zealand), both kits had a ground breaking new technology {{in the form of}} a gripper print. A special strip was worn during the match versus Wales in the 2010 Six Nations Championship which replicated that worn in 1910 to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of Twickenham.|$|E

5|$|The {{massacre}} was {{remembered in}} 1858 in a celebration organized by William Cooper Nell, an African American abolitionist {{who saw the}} death of Crispus Attucks {{as an opportunity to}} demonstrate the role of African Americans in the Revolutionary War. Partly because of this activism, artwork commemorating the massacre was produced that changed the color of a victim's skin to black (which in Revere's original engraving <b>was</b> <b>white)</b> to emphasize Attucks' claimed martyrdom. In 1888, a monument was erected on the Boston Common to the men killed in the massacre, and the five victims, along with Christopher Seider, were reinterred in a prominent grave in the Granary Burying Ground.|$|E
5|$|The mythological kelpie {{is usually}} {{described}} as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools of rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters, One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the nykur of Iceland. An Aberdeenshire variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the River Spey <b>was</b> <b>white</b> and could entice victims onto its back by singing.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} home jersey <b>was</b> <b>white</b> {{with black and}} red stripes. The original 'away' jersey was black, with white and red trim. Shoulder patches used a winged 'S' 'established MDCCCXCIV' (1894) logo. The League changed its policies on coloured and white jerseys and the white jersey became the away jersey. The club would use the white jersey with the original logo {{until the end of}} the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from one}} guest {{appearance}} for Barbados {{in a friendly}} match early in 1939, Constantine did not play first-class cricket after 1935 until the West Indies toured England in 1939. Constantine had deliberately not signed a league contract in 1939, to be available for the tour. However, he was unhappy with the playing strength of the touring team and the £600 he was offered in wages. He believed that the captain, Rolph Grant (younger brother of Jackie), was unqualified for the job and had been appointed only because he <b>was</b> <b>white.</b> Constantine captained the side in one match, but was reprimanded by the West Indies board for not pursuing a win. The West Indies lost the three-match Test series 1–0 against a very strong England side, although critics judged the overall playing record of the team to be good. In the three Tests, Constantine scored 110 runs at 27.50 and took 11 wickets at 29.81, including five for 75 in the final Test.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor's fire company {{existed for}} more than a year before Briarcliff Manor's incorporation. Frederick C. Messinger (a fireman in Kingston for ten years) and {{thirteen}} local men founded the private fire company in 1901. Thirty-six men became the company's charter members on March 4, 1902, and dues were set at 25cents per month. On April 15 of that year, the company took the name Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1. The company's first equipment was a 1901 hand-drawn chemical apparatus, with a tank containing a mixture of water and sodium bicarbonate. Sulfuric acid would be added to the tank, creating carbon dioxide, which would propel the solution through the hose and help extinguish the fire. That first apparatus <b>was</b> <b>white,</b> which Messinger thought more visible than the conventional red in a village without street lights, and the village's engines remain white.|$|E
