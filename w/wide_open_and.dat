5|$|Leopoldii hybrids {{arose from}} the work of the British {{explorer}} and botanist Richard Pearce, an employee of James Veitch & Sons, a plant nursery. Pearce brought back specimens of Hippeastrum leopoldii and Hippeastrum pardinum from the Andes. These two species were notable for large flowers that were <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> relatively symmetrical. Crossing these two species with the best of the Reginae strain produced a lineage of very large open flowered specimens, with up to 4-6 flowers on each scape. The Veitch nursery dominated the commercial development of Hippeastrum leopoldii and other varieties up to {{the early years of the}} twentieth century, the best of their hybrids setting the standard for modern commercial development.|$|E

25|$|Copepods, {{the primary}} zooplankton, {{are a major}} item on the forage fish menu. They are a group of small {{crustaceans}} found in ocean and freshwater habitats. Copepods are typically one millimetre (0.04in) to two millimetres (0.08in) long, with a teardrop shaped body. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on the planet. Copepods are very alert and evasive. They have large antennae (see photo below left). When they spread their antennae they can sense the pressure wave from an approaching fish and jump with great speed over a few centimeters. If copepod concentrations reach high levels, schooling herrings adopt a method called ram feeding. In the photo below, herring ram feed on a school of copepods. They swim with their mouth <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> their opercula fully expanded.|$|E
25|$|Although Howe had {{defeated}} the American army, the unexpected resistance {{he had met}} prevented him from destroying it completely. The American morale had not been destroyed; despite losing the battle, the Americans had good spirits hoping to fight the British again another day. But neither commander in the battle had proven themselves. Washington had committed a serious error in leaving his right flank <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> nearly brought on destruction {{if it had not}} been for Sullivan, Sterling, and Stephen's divisions that fought for time. Howe had waited too long to attack the American right flank, showing again his lack of killer instincts because he was still afraid of sustaining heavy casualties since the costly victory at the Battle of Bunker Hill two years earlier, and thus allowed most of the American army to escape.|$|E

25|$|For IIIAC, the {{cease-fire}} agreement meant a lessening of the hit-and-run guerrilla attacks, {{but there was}} never a time in the following months when a guard detachment could consider itself safe. By March, political and military differences had again split China <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> <b>and,</b> although a pretense at negotiation continued, clashes increased between Communists and Nationalists. Neither side was blameless in the covert renewal of hostilities, but the major share of blame fell to the Communists, who definitely violated the January 10 agreement in March and April by moving troops from Shansi and Hopeh into Manchuria. With the assistance of the Soviet occupation forces, which conveniently withdrew when Chinese Communists arrived to take over, and which left large stockpiles of Japanese weapons and munitions behind, Mao Zedong managed to strengthen his forces considerably during {{the cease-fire}}.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} played on a cold icy field {{that would have a}} big impact on the game. The Browns took the opening kickoff and drove into Bills territory, but came up empty when Matt Bahr slipped while {{planting}} his foot on a 45-yard field goal attempt. On Buffalo's second play after the missed kick, Kelly threw a short pass to Andre Reed. Defensive back Felix Wright slipped while going into coverage, leaving Reed <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> he ended up taking the ball 72 yards to the end zone. But Cleveland struck back with a 45-yard field goal by Bahr and a 52-yard touchdown pass from Kosar to Slaughter in the second quarter.

They were utterly routed; a great number were killed or wounded and several high-ranking officers were taken prisoner.|$|E

25|$|The {{flowers are}} large, <b>wide</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> last during about two weeks. They have sepals of similar sizes and form an almost {{invisible}} chin with the column foot. The petals may {{be similar to}} the sepals but smaller, or much smaller and with a much narrower base, occasionally showing different patterns or colors. The labellum articulates with the column, is trilobed, with comparatively small lateral lobes and larger terminal, which has variable shapes with diverse patterns and a callus under to column. The later is é semi-cylindrical, slightly arching, erect and thick, without any kind of appendix, ending in an apical anther and elongated in a small foot at the base. The flowers bear to pairs of pollinia of different sizes. The caudicle is narrow and the retinacle is small. The fruits resemble the ones of Maxillaria. There are no observation records of pollinators activities but Scuticaria are supposedly pollinated by Euglossini bees.|$|E
500|$|The overall {{look was}} {{influenced}} by television images, particularly commercials: Many shots have characters leaning into the lens with their eyeballs <b>wide</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> the interior scenes are heavily lit, because Weir wanted to remind viewers that [...] "in this world, everything was for sale". Those involved in visual effects work found the film somewhat difficult to make, because 1997 was the year many visual effects companies were trying to convert to computer-generated imagery. CGI was used to create the upper halves {{of some of the}} larger buildings in the film's downtown set. Craig Barron, one of the effects supervisors, said that these digital models did not have to look as detailed and weathered as they normally would in a film because of the artificial look of the entire town, although they did imitate slight blemishes found in the physical buildings.|$|E

[...] "That wide stance keeps him from over striding", Joe Torre observed, [...] "which can be your biggest problem when you’re trying to hit for power." [...] The low crouch also shrunk his strike zone, allowing him to walk more often. [...] Standing 6 feet tall (...) and weighing , he did not present the image of an imposing, home run-hitting giant that would cause pitchers to be very careful when he batted after he began his major league career.|$|E

Foster tries to follow Clancy through the door, but the energy tears him apart and is destroyed. Ryu instructs Irene to stay behind while he goes through the rift into the subspace, as he knows that he will be {{protected}} from the power that is inside. Ryu encounters the look-alike bio-noid again while inside the subspace, who was resurrected and transmuted into a super creature. After he defeats the look-alike, Ryu is instantly teleported into a room, where he meets Clancy once again. He tells Ryu that he has already claimed the life energy as his and explains the truth behind Castle Rock– that the ruins are a dimensional warship called the [...] "Ancient Ship of Doom". He says that [...] "these super-dimensional ruins are the foundation upon which a new world will be created", and that it will now be where all new life will originate from. The ship reappears in the real world, and Clancy then fires a test shot from the ship into the distance to demonstrate its power, which Irene watches in horror. He then drops Ryu through a trap door to the outside of the ship.|$|E

[...] Brian Lowry of Variety concluded that [...] "Lost … approaches its twists with {{what appears to be a}} greater degree of intellectual rigor than almost anything else on primetime. [...] Even when it's difficult to keep track of the myriad connections, a sense lingers that somebody knows—which is strangely reassuring." [...] Despite being more interested in the romantic aspirations of the show's characters, Jennifer Godwin of E! remarked that [...] "the Lost mythology is a miracle to behold. [...] It's grandiose, compelling, gaspworthy and, despite what the haters would have you believe, altogether satisfying". [...] Katherine Nichols of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin enjoyed the opening scene, [...] "but the rest of it didn't capture [...] as [...] hoped it would", citing high expectations due to the eight-month hiatus after the fourth season finale and a possible [...] "yearning for more character-driven stories over machinations revolving around time travel, however clever they might be."
