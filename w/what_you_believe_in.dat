500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E

2500|$|On July 19, 1992, a Mafia bomb killed Borsellino, {{less than}} two months after his {{colleague}} Giovanni Falcone had been killed. Italy was in shock. Rita wrote in her diary: [...] "You have died for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in,</b> but without <b>you,</b> I too am dead." [...] A week later Rita locked herself into the apartment and wrote a note, which said: [...] "I am devastated by the killing of Judge Borsellino.

6000|$|There {{is another}} {{difficulty}} in trusting to the honor and conscience of a doctor. Doctors {{are just like}} other Englishmen: {{most of them have}} no honor and no conscience: what they commonly mistake for these is sentimentality and an intense dread of doing anything that everybody else does not do, or omitting to do anything that everybody else does. This of course does amount to a sort of working or rule-of-thumb conscience; but it means that you will do anything, good or bad, provided you get enough people to keep you in countenance by doing it also. It is the sort of conscience that makes it possible to keep order on a pirate ship, or in a troop of brigands. It may be said that in the last analysis there is no other sort of honor or conscience in existence--that the assent of the majority is the only sanction known to ethics. No doubt this holds good in political practice. If mankind knew the facts, and agreed with the doctors, then the doctors would be in the right; and any person who thought otherwise would be a lunatic. But mankind does not agree, and does not know the facts. All that can be said for medical popularity is that until there is a practicable alternative to blind trust in the doctor, the truth about the doctor is so terrible that we dare not face it. Moliere saw through the doctors; but he had to call them in just the same. Napoleon had no illusions about them; but he had to die under their treatment just as much as the most credulous ignoramus that ever paid sixpence for a bottle of strong medicine. In this predicament most people, to save themselves from unbearable mistrust and misery, or from being driven by their conscience into actual conflict with the law, fall back on the old rule that if you cannot have <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> you must believe in what you have. When your child is ill or your wife dying, and you happen to be very fond of them, or even when, if you are not fond of them, you are human enough to forget every personal grudge before the spectacle of a fellow creature in pain or peril, what you want is comfort, reassurance, something to clutch at, were it but a straw. This the doctor brings you. You have a wildly urgent feeling that something must be done; and the doctor does something. Sometimes what he does kills the patient; but you do not know that; and the doctor assures you that all that human skill could do has been done. And nobody has the brutality to say to the newly bereft father, mother, husband, wife, brother, or sister, [...] "You have killed your lost darling by your credulity." ...|$|E

5000|$|Another {{attempt at}} {{fighting}} racial stereotypes was {{the formation of}} the BRC. “Their goal: to assert that a new generation of black musicians could play more than just R&B and hip- hop, and could rock the house as much as Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Arthur Lee, and Jimi Hendrix had done before. Now most of the scene’s bands are either footnotes or forgotten." [...] The BRC's mission is to maximize the development, exposure, and acceptance of black rock musicians, and encourage artists who refuse to cater to [...] "the creative straitjacket the industry has designed." [...] The BRC is about expanding possibilities of black art and black identity and escaping the critique presented by society. Vernon Reid expresses that it is about building community and standing up for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> even if there is no agreement in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in.</b> “Don’t believe in a story.

40|$|I {{advocate}} Time-Slice Rationality, {{the thesis}} {{that the relationship between}} two timeslices of the same person is not importantly different, for purposes of rational evaluation, from the relationship between time-slices of distinct persons. The locus of rationality, so to speak, is the time-slice rather than the temporally extended agent. I motivate this claim in two ways. First is an appeal to puzzle cases about personal identity over time such as fission, where, in my view, we can settle all the facts about what the agents in the scenario ought to believe without first settling the metaphysical facts about who is identical to whom. Second is an mild internalist intuition that if you are justifiably ignorant of facts about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> the past, these facts should not affect <b>what</b> <b>you</b> ought to <b>believe</b> now. Time-Slice Rationality conflicts with two proposed principles of rationality, Conditionalization and Reflection. Conditionalization is a diachronic norm saying how your current degrees of belief should fit with your old ones, while Reflection is a norm enjoining you to defer to the degrees of belief that you expect to have in the future. But they are independently problematic and should be replaced by improved, time-slice-centric principles. Conditionalization should be replaced by a synchronic norm saying what degrees of belief you ought to have given your current evidence and Reflection should be replaced by a norm which instructs you to defer to the degrees of belief of agents you take to be experts. Finally, I show that these replacement principles do all the work that the old principles were supposed to do while avoiding their problems. In sum, a time-slice-centric conception of rationality puts the theory of rationality on firmer foundations and yields better norms than alternative, non-time-slice-centric approaches. 1...|$|R
