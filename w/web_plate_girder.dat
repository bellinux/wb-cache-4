This paper {{analyzed}} and summarized the formulas about the calculations of the corrugated steel web plate buckling, {{and based on}} a certain bridge as the engineering background, and the author calculated the related formulas of web buckling load and made comparative analysis. The result showed that the corrugated steel web related buckling should occur at the earliest. Overview:Corrugated steel <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> bridge is {{a new type of}} bridge structure, which can enhance the aesthetic feeling and improve the use efficiency of the materials[1],but after thinning the web, bridge girder web should meet the requirements of shear strength and stability. The web can't suddenly be in buckling failure which can make the structure lose bearing capacity[2]. From the current research results, the research of the buckling strength mainly concentrated on the local buckling and overall buckling, but rarely on the related buckling[3]. Although there are many scholars have put forward the formulas, but no common agreement had been made. The related buckling is yet to be considered in the design, so it is necessary to study the interrelationship of the three forms of buckling.

40|$|A {{conventional}} <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> {{involves the}} use of transverse intermediate stiffeners, especially in a slender web to avoid catastrophic failure associated with shear buckling of the web. In this study, a profiled web was used to replace the transversely stiffened web. The process involves introducing coldformed ribs into a flat steel sheet to form alternative stiffeners. This study therefore seeks to establish comparative performance of conventionally stiffened <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> and profiled <b>web</b> girders of a specially formed rib arrangement with single and also double webs. Nine numbers of specimens were tested to failure under a three-point-bending system.

The results of the tests on girders with profiled steel sheets, PSS(s) have shown that profiling is extremely effective in increasing the shear buckling load because it moves the sheet material out of the plane of the web, thereby increasing the rigidity 1. 08 to 2. 0 times higher than the equivalent conventional flat <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> <b>girders.</b> The experimental results also showed that post-buckling capacities are reduced by 30...|$|R
5000|$|The current {{bridge was}} {{completed}} on September 29, 1928. It {{is one of}} the ‘Three Sisters’ bridges, which also include the 7th and 9th Street Bridges. The three bridges are nearly identical self-anchored, eye-bar suspension type, so called because the horizontal pull of the top cords is resisted by the steel girders along each side of the roadway. The suspension system consists of 14" [...] eye-bars extending from end to end having two pins on the top of each tower and carrying the roadway by 4" [...] eye-bar suspenders at the panel points. The stiffening system consists of triple <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> placed parallel to the road grade.

An idealized model is developed representing the loading of the tapered panel that generates uniform normal stresses due to flexure, or uniform and constant shear stresses {{in the case of}} shear. Eigen-value analysis was performed for several tapered <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> that have different geometric parameters. A parametric study is made to reduce the FE model size showing the effect of decreasing the tapered panel adjacent straight panels, maintaining the same result accuracy as a complete girder model. The combined buckling capacity of bending and shear is determined by applying all possible load pattern combinations, together with different interaction ratios. An analysis study is presented to investigate the effect of the tapering angle on the combined bending–shear capacity of the girder. The study also includes the effect of the flange and web slenderness on the local buckling of the girder. Considering residual stresses as part of the loading stresses, the analysis procedure is repeated for some cases, and the effect of combining of the residual stresses together with the external loads is found.

40|$|In {{the thesis}} two {{problems}} have been studied: {{the first one is}} the use of corrugated <b>webs</b> in <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> for composite bridges; the second one is the study of lateral restraints in composite bridges. In structural design corrugated webs are frequently used in beams for buildings in Sweden. They have also been used in four bridges in France and two in Japan. The shear stresses of corrugated panels were the main subject of previous studies. This thesis deals with local flange buckling of beams with corrugated webs. Computer analyses give a ratio of areas for use in design of the compressed flange. The validity of this ratio is confirmed by experimental work undertaken on five specimens (two of them loaded by bending only; three loaded by a combination of bending and shear). The interaction between the local buckling of the flange and web buckling is examined. A formula for calculating the effective shear modulus is given. The possible methods of fabrication of a cambered beam with a corrugated web are shown here and the problems which could arise are discussed. There is also a comparison between the design of an existing bridge and a new design where a plane <b>web</b> in a <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> is replaced by a corrugated web. The second part of the thesis contains computational investigations of the lateral restraints in composite <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> bridges. This method of investigation is more appropriate than laboratory testing, due to the difficulty of fabricating steelwork to maximum permitted imperfections. Numerical elastic finite element analyses with geometric non—linear facilities are used on a relevant part of the structure (a compressed flange) that has the maximum allowed geometric imperfections. The F— forces in elastic lateral restraints modelled by spring elements are then determined.

40|$|In many steel {{structures}} like buildings, industrial halls and bridges, standardized hot-rolled sections are used. These sections {{are divided into}} specific types in Europe and similar profiles in the USA. The range of hot-rolled sections is limited and therefore fabricated <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> are used when the standard hot-rolled sections {{do not meet the}} requirements for stiffness, strength, stability and economy. Such a <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> is built up from steel plates for the top and bottom flange and for the web, welded together to an I-shape cross-section, single or double symmetric. Using this type of <b>plate</b> <b>girders,</b> a high degree of optimisation of material use is achieved by using different plate thickness and width for the flanges, and thickness and height for the web over the span of the girder adapted to the distribution of bending moments and the shear forces. A model is developed for the distribution of a certain amount of steel over the flanges and the <b>web</b> of a <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> to achieve the maximum bending moment resistance.

50|$|In {{the past}} two decades the steel plate shear wall (SPSW), also known as the steel plate wall (SPW), has been used in a number of {{buildings}} in Japan and North America as part of the lateral force resisting system. In earlier days, SPSWs were treated like vertically oriented <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> and design procedures tended to be very conservative. Web buckling was prevented through extensive stiffening or by selecting an appropriately thick <b>web</b> <b>plate,</b> until more information became available on the post-buckling characteristics of <b>web</b> <b>plates.</b> Although the <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> theory seems appropriate for the design of an SPW structure, a very important difference is the relatively high bending strength and stiffness of the beams and columns that form the boundary elements of the wall. These members are expected to {{have a significant effect on}} the overall behaviour of a building incorporating this type of system and several researchers have focused on this aspect of SPWs. The energy dissipating qualities of the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> under extreme cyclic loading has raised the prospect of using SPSWs as a promising alternative to conventional systems in high-risk seismic regions. A further benefit is that the diagonal tension field of the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> acts like a diagonal brace in a braced frame and thus completes the truss action, which is known to be an efficient means to control wind drift.|$|R
40|$|Civil {{engineers}} are presently {{faced with the}} challenge of strengthening and repairing many existing structures to assure or increase their structural safety. The reasons for this include changes in the use of structures, and increased traffic loads on bridges. In Iraq, for example, several highway bridges needed to accommodate increased axle load during the transportation of huge turbines for electricity generating stations. The requirement for structural strengthening and repair methods is, however, driven by the worldwide need to ensure the safety and sustainability of our aging infrastructure which is deteriorating at a rate faster than it can be renovated. The ever increasing damage caused by environmental effects and the corrosion of steel and deterioration of concrete, reduce structural safety and lead to disruption for the users, which can have serious economic consequences. In a <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> bridge, the <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> are typically I-beams made up from separate structural steel plates (rather than rolled as a single cross-section), which are welded or, in older bridges, bolted or riveted together to form the vertical web and horizontal flanges of the beam. The two primary functions of the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> in a <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> are to maintain a relative distance between the top and bottom flanges and to resist the induced shear stresses. In most practical ranges of <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> bridges’ spans, the induced shear stresses are relatively low compared to the bending stresses in the flanges induced by flexure. As a result the <b>web</b> <b>plate</b> is generally chosen to be much thinner than the flanges. The web panel consequently buckles at a relatively low shear force. For steel girder structures dominated by cyclic loading, {{as is the case with}} repeated vehicle axle loads on bridges, this can lead to the so-called ‘breathing’ phenomenon; an out-of-plane buckling displacement that can induce high secondary bending stresses at the welded plate boundaries. In the current work, a novel FRP strengthening technique using bonded shapes is applied to resist these out of plane deformations, and hence reduce the breathing stresses, and improve the fatigue life of the <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> which is very different to the majority of applications of FRP strengthening that exploit the FRP for its direct tensile strength and stiffness. The objective of the current experimental programme is to strengthen thinwalled steel girders against web shear buckling using a corrugated CFRP or GFRP panel bonded externally along the compression diagonal of the <b>web</b> <b>plate.</b> The programme was divided into three main phases, including: (1) the development of a new preformed corrugated FRP panel, and (2, 3) testing its performance in two main experimental series. The initial series involved tests on 13 steel plates strengthened with the proposed preformed corrugated FRP panel and subjected to in-plane shear loading using a specially manufactured “picture-frame” arrangement designed to induce the appropriate boundary conditions and stresses in the <b>web</b> <b>plates.</b> This initial test series investigated the performance of different forms of strengthening under static load, in preparation for another series of cyclic tests to investigate their fatigue performance. The test variables included FRP type (CFRP or GFRP), form of FRP (closed or open section), number of FRP layers, and orientation of GFRP fibres used to produce the FRP panel. In the second series, six specimens were manufactured to simulate the end panel of a <b>plate</b> <b>girder.</b> These were strengthened with the optimized FRP panel from the initial series and tested for shear buckling under repeated cyclic loading with a stress range 40 - 80...|$|R

However, it is a {{necessary}} and important part of <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> design when applying the Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Specification. 1 A beam can be a rolled or a welded shape, but it does not have intermediate stiffeners and its web width-thickness ratio hc/tw must not exceed yfF/ 970, where hc is twice the distance from the neutral axis to the compression flange (Fig. 1). <b>Plate</b> <b>girders</b> have stiffeners or hc/tw is greater than yfF/ 970, or both.

An explanation of <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> design in the LRFD Specification will include: flexural design strength, shear design strength, flexure-shear interaction, bearing strength under concentrated loads and stiffener design. Application of the LRFD method will show there is actually little difference between it and Allowable Stress Design (ASD) 8 of <b>plate</b> <b>girders.</b> FLEXURAL STRENGTH The design flexural strength is calculated to provide an adequate section modulus.

40|$|Abstract-Behavior of {{structure}} during earthquake motion depends on distribution of weight, stiffness and strength in both {{horizontal and vertical}} planes of building. To reduce the effect of earthquake elements steel plate shear walls {{are used in the}} building. These can be used for improving seismic response of buildings. The main role of steel shear wall is to collect lateral forces of earthquake in a building and transfer those forces to the foundation. The <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> in steel shear walls are categorized according to their ability to resist buckling. The <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> can be sufficiently stiffened to preclude buckling and allow the full shear strength of the web to be reached. Shear walls are the walls like vertically aligned structural components which are subjected to lateral loads in their plane. These have proved to be very effective for lateral load resistance particularly in the medium to high-rise buildings. These depending upon the material of construction they may be classified as the RCC and steel shear walls. Steel structures are generally lighter than masonry or RC structures. Lower weight translates to lower seismic forces. Steel structures typically show good ductility, even when they are not specifically designed or detailed for seismic resistance.

Numerical model is developed for nonlinear static analysis. Virtual experimenting – considering actual material behavior and imperfections – is invoked for the calibration of the model...|$|R
50|$|The three inner girders are {{conventional}} being 0.76m {{deep and}} built up of a <b>web</b> <b>plate,</b> four angles and {{top and bottom}} cover <b>plates.</b> The outer <b>girders</b> are less conventional, with the angles n {{one side of the}} web left off to provide a flush face. The 5/16 inch (a standard recommendation in the early twentieth century) <b>web</b> <b>plates</b> are fastened with 8 rivets to the 100 x 75 x 9.5 mm vertical angles. The horizontal angles are 100 x 75 x 16 mm and secured with an additional 13 or 14 rivets per <b>web</b> <b>plate.</b> Corners are bolted through with 28 mm bolts.|$|R
