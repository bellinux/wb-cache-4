5|$|Soon {{after his}} anxious departure, five buses {{containing}} crowds of ravenous tourist anchovies {{stop at the}} Krusty Krab, its abundance of passengers furiously demanding meals. Unable to satisfy the anchovies' hunger and alarmed by the mob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are left to helplessly deal with the unsatisfied crowd. Before long, SpongeBob returns from his errand, having fulfilled the request of Mr. Krabs and found a mechanical spatula, which he uses in speedily <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> bundles of Krabby Patties for the anchovies and satisfying their hunger. After the mob subsides, SpongeBob is welcomed as a Krusty Krab employee, much to Squidward's dismay. After Mr. Krabs leaves, Patrick orders a Krabby Patty and is hurled from the establishment upon a mostly-unseen, and audibly manic, reprise of SpongeBob's cooking feat.|$|E
5|$|The Atlanta Journal {{wrote that}} {{a crowd of}} men, women, and {{children}} arrived on foot, in cars, and on horses, and that souvenir hunters cut away parts of his shirt sleeves. According to The New York Times, one of the onlookers, Robert E. Lee Howellrelated to Clark Howell, editor of The Atlanta Constitutionwanted to have the body cut into pieces and burned, and began to run around, screaming, <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> the mob. Judge Newt Morris tried to restore order, {{and asked for a}} vote on whether the body should be returned to the parents intact; only Howell disagreed. When the body was cut down, Howell started stamping on Frank's face and chest; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket, and he and his driver John Stephens Wood drove it out of Marietta.|$|E
5|$|The eggs may be {{deposited}} singly or {{in small}} groups, or may {{take the form of}} spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams. The amphibious salamander Ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots. The greenhouse frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris) lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage. The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs. First a raft is built, then eggs are laid in the centre, and finally a foam cap is overlaid. The foam has anti-microbial properties. It contains no detergents but is created by <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> proteins and lectins secreted by the female.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time that the L.A. Times was <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> enthusiasm for the {{expansion}} of Los Angeles it was also trying to turn it into a union-free or open shop town. Fruit growers and local merchants who had opposed the Pullman strike in 1894 subsequently formed the Merchants and Manufacturers Association (M & M) to support the L.A. Times anti-union campaign.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, general Andrew Jackson {{exceeded}} his authority on numerous times and attacked American Indian tribes {{as well as}} invaded the Spanish territory of Florida without official government permission. Jackson was not reprimanded or punished for exceeding his authority. Some accounts blame newspaper journalism called yellow journalism for <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> virulent pro-war sentiment to help instigate the Spanishâ€“American War. Some critics suggest foreign policy is manipulated by lobbies, such as the pro-Israel lobby or the Arab one, although there is disagreement {{about the influence of}} such lobbies. Nevertheless, Brzezinski argues for stricter anti-lobbying laws.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Featherston drifts for a short while, before joining the newly created Freedom Party. Featherston establishes himself as head propagandist, and eventually becomes its leader, aided by Party member Ferdinand Koenig. With his raw energy and humble origins, Featherston has little trouble <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> support from much of the Confederate populace, and it seems by the early 1920s that he would surely be leading the country. But with the assassination of President Wade Hampton V in June 1922 by a Party stalwart, the Freedom Party suffers a sudden and near-total collapse as a political force.|$|E

25|$|Theodore's {{contingent}} {{fared well}} against Shahin in Mesopotamia, inflicting a crushing defeat on the Persians. During this battle, at Constantinople, {{the city was}} well defended with a force of some 12,000 cavalry (presumably dismounted), supported by the entire city's population. Indeed, {{the efforts of the}} Patriarch Sergius in <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> the population into a religious and patriotic frenzy cannot be overlooked. When the Byzantine fleet annihilated a Persian and an Avar fleet in two separate ambushes, the besiegers appeared to have withdrawn in panic. And when word of Theodore's victory in Mesopotamia came, it was concluded by the besiegers that Byzantium was now under the protection of the Romans' Christian God.|$|E
25|$|In 1969 a major {{split in}} the Indian National Congress. Indira Gandhi had entered into open {{conflict}} with the traditional Congress leadership. Effectively two separate Congress parties appeared, the Congress(R) led by Indira and the Congress(O) led by Kamaraj. The split {{was in many ways}} a left-right one, with Indira <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> populism against the established party elites. The Forward Bloc did in some ways welcome the new developments. It appreciated Indira's stands and reformulated its anti-Congress line to focus mainly opposition to the traditional Congress elite (i.e. the Congress(O)). In the 1969 presidential elections, AIFB supported Indira's candidate V.V. Giri. This caused an abrupt break-up of the Swatantra-AIFB alliance in Tamil Nadu, as the Swatantra Party sought to align itself with the Congress(O).|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} was {{not just}} nationalist, but it also played out in Greece's internal politics. The two leading Greek political parties, the ruling conservative New Democracy under Constantine Mitsotakis and the socialist PASOK under Andreas Papandreou, sought to outbid each other in <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> nationalist sentiment and the long-term (rather than immediate) threat posed by the apparent irredentist policies of Skopje. To complicate matters further, New Democracy itself was divided; the then prime minister, Mitsotakis, favored a compromise solution on the Macedonian question, while his foreign minister Adonis Samaras took a hard-line approach. The two eventually fell out and Samaras was sacked, with Mitsotakis reserving the foreign ministry for himself. He failed {{to reach an agreement}} on the Macedonian issue despite United Nations mediation; he fell from power in October 1993, {{largely as a result of}} Samaras causing the government's majority of one to fall in September 1993.|$|E

500|$|In November 1811, a {{messenger}} brought news to Kentucky of former Kentucky Attorney General Joseph Hamilton Daveiss's {{death at the}} Battle of Tippecanoe, amplifying Kentuckians' outcry for war with the British and Indians. In anticipation of a federal call for volunteers, Scott published messages in the state's newspapers in February and April 1812 <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> support for the impending war effort. By the end of July, the state's quota of 5,500 volunteers had been met. On August 14, 1812, Scott greeted two regiments of soldiers at the governor's mansion just prior to their muster at Georgetown. He hobbled among the soldiers with his crutch, then turned and hammered it against the mansion's steps and was heard to mutter [...] "If it hadn't been for you, I could have gone with the boys myself." ...|$|E

Protesters criticized Morsi for alleged mismanagement of the country and for the growing influence of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Tamarod movement, which translates into English as [...] "Rebel", claimed it had gathered 22 million signatures from Egyptians opposed to Morsi. According to some sources, the protests were the largest in Egypt's history.|$|E
2500|$|In 1867 Stalybridge was {{disturbed}} {{by the arrival of}} William Murphy. Records of this man indicate that his sole interest was to sow the seeds of dissent between Roman Catholics, who by this time had grown to significant proportions, and Protestants. He succeeded in this goal only too well for a full year. During 1868 {{there were a number of}} violent disturbances and rioting created by this man who described himself as a [...] "renegade Roman Catholic". In his lectures to the public [...] "pretending to expose the religious practices of the Roman Catholic Church", he became a master at <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> a crowd into a frenzy. Newspaper reports of the time told of his common practice of waving a revolver in the air in [...] "a most threatening manner". On one occasion he incited a riot of such proportions that Fr. Daley, the parish priest of St. Peter's, took to the roof of the church to defend it. A man was shot. The parish priest was tried but eventually acquitted at the Quarter Sessions. Following this incident, the community began to settle down and Murphy chose to extend his political activities elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|Billboard {{described}} [...] "Frustrated" [...] as [...] "The Rolling Stones' {{answer to}} Sharona", {{and called it}} one of the album's [...] "best tracks". [...] Ken Tucker of Rolling Stone called [...] "Frustrated" [...] a [...] "neck breaker" [...] and considered the song an [...] "artfully veiled metaphor for their leader's professional ambitions", which describes Fieger as [...] "an ingenious overreacher just now closing in on his real goal of securing power by <b>whipping</b> <b>up</b> a pop-rock treat that'll have kids begging to rot their minds on it." [...] Ira Robbins and Michael Sandlin of Trouser Press described the song as a [...] "tight guitar pop" [...] song which described women as [...] "prick-teases". Author John Borack described [...] "Frustrated" [...] like [...] "Good Girls Don't" [...] as a [...] "mean pop tune" [...] in which Fieger comes off [...] "like a leering, sexist twit with hormones a-raging." [...] Pete Bishop of the Pittsburgh Press clained that [...] "Frustrated" [...] "lean(s) towards bubblegum". Critic S. Victor Aaron of Something Else! praised [...] the song's [...] "huge backbeat", [...] "lively bass line" [...] and [...] "thick slab of guitar riffs" [...] as well as Fieger's [...] "impishly sung lyrics". Aaron summed up [...] "Frustrated" [...] as a [...] "perfect danceable tough rocker for any party" [...] and noted that it got significant airplay on AOR radio stations. [...] Audio magazine called it a [...] "basher" [...] with [...] "plenty of style". [...] Tina Maples of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised its [...] "hooky effervescence". Charla Wasel of The Evening Independent described it as a song [...] "with which we can all relate." [...] The Knack bassist Prescott Niles described the song as [...] "catchy" [...] and noted that it was [...] "a big crowd favorite".|$|E
