40|$|In {{recent years}} it has been pointed out that {{regional}} unemployment disparities are much more entrenched across member states of the European Union (E. U.) {{than they are in}} the U. S. A 'conventional wisdom' has emerged to the effect that this difference {{is due in part to}} the greater degree of wage rigidity in E. U. regions. In this paper we explore this issue by estimating short run and long run real <b>wage</b> (in) <b>flexibility</b> for the regions in five core E. U. countries (Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands) and for the U. S. states for the period 1976 - 1994. We find that real <b>wage</b> (in) <b>flexibility</b> varies across regions both in the E. U. and the U. S., but that, on average, regional wages are no less flexible in E. U. core regions than in U. S. states. The paper also examines some of the possible correlates ofregional variations in <b>wage</b> (in) <b>flexibility.</b> Copyright 2000 Blackwell Publishers inc. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, the West has been deeply {{transformed}} by globalisation; global markets have been replacing national economies and states have been losing their legislative and executive powers. The global economy is imposing its own standards, such as the so-called Brazilianisation of the West, consisting of labour changes inspired by typical Brazilian features (low <b>wages,</b> <b>flexibility</b> and insecurity). In such a context, a question arises: how is the legal system changing?

50|$|The lecture {{develops}} {{this theme}} informally. The conclusion, stated with specific reference to labour markets, has more general validity. It applies to any {{situation where the}} uninsurable uncertainty about future prices results in welfare costs. Even though price rigidities entail a loss of productive efficiency, this can be more than offset by a gain of efficiency in risk-sharing. What may be specific to the labour market is the realistic possibility of controlling (minimum) wages and organising unemployment compensation.

5000|$|The {{economics}} of Kalecki was based, more explicitly and systematically {{than that of}} Keynes, {{on the principle of}} the circular flow of income that goes back to the Physiocrat François Quesnay. According to that principle, income is determined by expenditure decisions, not by the exchange of resources (capital or labor). Kalecki and Keynes claimed that in capitalist economy, production and employment levels (economic equilibrium) are determined foremost by the magnitude of investment by business enterprises (the crucial [...] "driver of the business cycle"), not by price and <b>wage</b> <b>flexibility.</b> Savings are determined by investments, not the other way around. Contrary to the Ricardian, Marxian and Neoclassical economics, they asserted that higher wages lead to fuller employment. Kalecki's monetary theory was rooted in the business cycle theory of Knut Wicksell. Quesnay's circular flow of income fell into disrepute in the political economy of the 19th century, when the idea that prices integrate exchange decisions gained ground, but was revived by Joseph Schumpeter, who pointed out the necessity of considering the circular flow of income (recognition of the economic cycle) as an integrating factor in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the total economic process in a given period. The principle was discarded again with the arrival of neoliberal domination in economics and its main current defined by prices of economic equilibrium. Economist Jan Toporowski said that Kalecki's theory of the business cycle remains [...] "the most serious challenge to general equilibrium macroeconomics", which has prevailed since the late 19th century. More than Keynes, Kalecki was skeptical about government's ability to sustain fiscal and monetary stimulus policies or of business support for full employment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an ex-post {{assessment of the}} current situation of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) {{in light of the}} conditions prescribed by the theory of Optimum Currency Areas (OCA). The analysis shows that those conditions were satisfied at very different degrees. Factors mobility has clearly increased since the inception of the Eurozone, with an important difference between free movement of capital, which can be considered as fully accomplished, and labour mobility, which has improved, but to a lower degree. Prices and <b>wages</b> <b>flexibility</b> was initially lower compared to other regions, like the US, but has improved over time. The similarity of business cycles among different economies joining the euro was a condition not respected at the beginning, which probably led to sustained imbalances within the Eurozone. Finally, fiscal union was the main missing element of the initial construction of the Eurozone, and still is. The common budget is so exiguous that its effectiveness as shock absorption mechanism is negligible. The analysis then shows how some of the concerns raised {{on the eve of the}} euro did actually materialize, even if not immediately. First, in its first decade the Eurozone did not experience major turbulences, because growing financial integration was compensating the need for fiscal transfers, through the private insurance channel. Second, once the long-feared shock hit, the mechanism proved weak and non-resilient. The inherent weaknesses of the EMU became evident. Third, as it had been foreseen, the cost of the adjustment after the shock fell mainly on labour, with much higher and longer unemployment in the Eurozone than both non-Eurozone EU and the US. Fourth, as the theory suggested, the lack of common mechanisms of adjustment dramatically increased socio-economic divergences within the EMU. ...|$|R

40|$|Conclusion] The {{necessity}} {{of establishing a}} fiscal capacity at the European level in order to smooth asymmetric shocks in EMU is largely based on the theory of optimum currency areas. If countries {{do not have the}} possibility to align exchange rates, the effects of asymmetric shocks on a country's income must be absorbed by other mechanisms. In an economy with sticky wages and prices as well as with low factor mobility, only a transfer mechanism between countries provides for a compensation of such adverse cyclical effects and thus serves as an insurance against the risk of asymmetric shocks. This rationale is based on many assumptions regarding the economic conditions in a country. Instead of a fiscal capacity for risk-sharing an increase in factor mobility or a higher <b>wage</b> and price <b>flexibility</b> also allow for an absorption of shocks. Indeed, a monetary union requires economies to become more flexible. The analysis in this paper shows that the contribution of a fiscal capacity to absorb shocks in federations in which a fiscal union is established is relatively low. This holds for the US, Germany and Canada alike. More important according to empirical studies are capital markets. The more integrated capital markets are, the better they serve as an interregional risk-sharing mechanism. Thus, the creation of a banking union along the lines proposed by Buch et al. (2013) in the EU will be the best way of insuring EMU member countries against adverse asymmetric shocks. In addition, higher labor mobility and higher <b>wage</b> and price <b>flexibility</b> will help to accommodate future shocks. Moreover, if member countries consolidate their budgets following the rules of the fiscal compact and the six pack regulations, their ability to smooth shocks by national fiscal policy will be increased. It {{should be noted that the}} establishment of a fiscal capacity does not only provide for at best a rather small risk-sharing mechanism. It also induces negative incentives for member countries to reduce the probability of being affected by economic shocks adversely. Reforms of labor and products markets aiming at higher <b>wage</b> and price <b>flexibility</b> will be postponed. Consolidation efforts will wane. Moral hazard occurs. Given this downside of a fiscal capacity, its introduction cannot be advised...|$|R
30|$|However, in the MOF  4 ‘Construction, woodworking, plastic {{manufacture}} and processing occupations’ the labour market actually gets tighter due to wage dynamics. Here, although the <b>wage</b> responsiveness of <b>flexibility</b> is actually not too high, the projected {{development of the}} outside wage options induces the workforce to switch more often to other occupations. In this case, the possibility of a future labour shortage may be understated when dynamic behaviour in occupational flexibility is not accounted for. Ultimately, we can conclude that assumptions about the wage responsiveness of labour mobility are crucial for assessing possible future labour market outcomes.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} {{the degree of}} real <b>wage</b> <b>flexibility</b> in 19 EU countries in a wage Phillips curve panel framework.

Our {{results suggest that the}} degree of real <b>wage</b> <b>flexibility</b> tends to be larger in the central and eastern European (CEE) countries than in the euro area; weaker in downturns than during upswings. Moreover, there exists an inflation threshold, below which real <b>wage</b> <b>flexibility</b> seems to decrease.
