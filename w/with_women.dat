5|$|Aristocratic Heian women lived {{restricted}} and secluded lives, {{allowed to}} speak to men only when they were close relatives or household members. Murasaki's autobiographical poetry shows that she socialized <b>with</b> <b>women</b> but had limited contact with men other than her father and brother; she often exchanged poetry <b>with</b> <b>women</b> but never with men. Unlike most noblewomen of her status, she did not marry on reaching puberty; instead she stayed in her father's household until her mid-twenties or perhaps even to her early thirties.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether the plasma concentrations of homocysteine (Hcy) are elevated in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (a condition of chronic hypoestrogenism) and in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS, a syndrome characterized by hyperandrogenemia). A cross-sectional study was performed. The plasma concentrations of Hcy were determined in 12 normal-cycling women, in 14 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> hypogonadotropic amenorrhea (HA), and in 20 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> PCOS. The plasma LH, FSH, E(2), testosterone, free testosterone, and androstenedione levels were measured. The blood samples analyzed were taken during the early follicular phase in controls and without regard to the menstrual phase in the patients. Twelve normal-cycling <b>women</b> were compared <b>with</b> 14 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> HA and <b>with</b> 20 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> PCOS. <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> HA or PCOS have plasma concentrations of Hcy similar to those of healthy <b>women</b> <b>with</b> normal menstrual cycles. The results suggest that young <b>women</b> <b>with</b> chronic hypoestrogenism (HA) or hyperandrogenism (PCOS) have plasma concentrations of Hcy similar to those of healthy <b>women</b> <b>with</b> normal menstrual cycle...|$|R

5|$|According to Confucian teachings, upper-class men honored their {{ancestors}} through rituals carried {{out over the}} course of their lives. These rituals were passed down through generations from father to son. Official family lists were inscribed, <b>with</b> <b>women</b> only acknowledged on that of their marital families. Women who did not produce sons were not inscribed and were thus forgotten from family memory.|$|E
5|$|Andy's and Red's {{relationship}} {{has been described as}} a non-sexual love story between two men, that few other films offer, where the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship <b>with</b> <b>women.</b> Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy's and Red's true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.|$|E

5|$|As {{measured}} on women undergoing in vitro fertilization, a longer menstrual cycle length {{is associated with}} higher pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment. Delivery rates after IVF have been estimated to be almost doubled for women with a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared <b>with</b> <b>women</b> with a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days. A longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation and embryo quality.|$|E
5|$|As of 2000, {{the median}} intake of iodine from {{food in the}} United States was 240 to 300μg/day for men and 190 to 210μg/day for women. The general US {{population}} has adequate iodine nutrition, <b>with</b> <b>women</b> of childbearing age and pregnant women having a possible mild risk of deficiency. In Japan, consumption was considered much higher, ranging between 5,280μg/day to 13,800μg/day from dietary seaweed or kombu kelp, often {{in the form of}} Kombu Umami extracts for soup stock and potato chips. However, new studies suggest that Japan's consumption is closer to 1,000–3,000μg/day. The adult UL in Japan was last revised to 3,000µg/day in 2015.|$|E
