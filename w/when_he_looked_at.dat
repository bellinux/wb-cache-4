25|$|In 1902, aged only ten, Kramer {{ran away}} from his new home in Leeds, taking various jobs in {{different}} parts of the north of England, and even going away to sea for six months, being big for his age. During this sojourn away from his family Kramer attended occasional art classes, but his first formal art education was at Leeds School of Art where he had a scholarship from 1907 till 1913. During this time he was also to become involved in the radical modernist organisation the Leeds Arts Club, which introduced him to the ideas of expressionist artists, such as Wassily Kandinsky and the spiritualist beliefs that came to underpin his work. Writing to his close friend and fellow Arts Club member Herbert Read in 1918, Kramer stated that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> an object he saw both its physical appearance and its spiritual manifestation. His struggle, he claimed, was to escape the physical appearance and only paint the spiritual form. Such ideas came straight from the expressionist and Theosophical spiritualism that dominated the Leeds Arts Club, and show clearly that Kramer was himself an English Expressionist artist.|$|E

Washington remarked that Taylor was [...] "a firm and true Whig" [...] and that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Taylor, he remarked to himself [...] "there is the President of the United States that is to be." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, The New York Times {{reported}} that Jesse Ventura first approached Trump {{about a possible}} 2000 presidential run while both were in attendance at a wrestling event in Atlantic City. [...] Trump's ambitions may have spawned earlier. The America We Deserve co-writer Dave Shiflett said Trump first thought about running in late 1998, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his political advantages in money and name recognition, and concluded that he was [...] "at least as competent" [...] as then President Bill Clinton. According to Shiflett, this prompted Trump to ask top aide Roger Stone to find the [...] "most eminent hack writer in America" [...] to put Trump's political ideas into a book. [...] Stone reached out to Shiflett, a contributor to The American Spectator. In spring 1999, Shiflett met with Trump about the project that would later become The America We Deserve. [...] During the initial meeting, Shiflett claims Trump raised concerns about a suitcase bomb destroying Manhattan.|$|E

500|$|A {{month before}} the filming of the final episode, Aniston said that with each episode it got [...] "harder just to read the lines." [...] She {{explained}} that the cast was [...] "all just nerves and raw emotions [...] No one knows how to feel. We {{may need to be}} sedated on the last night." [...] The producers promised a tearful ending, and the cast admitted their crying was not faked when they filmed their scenes. LeBlanc revealed it had been too much for him {{and the rest of the}} cast; he said Kudrow started crying first, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Aniston and Cox they also appeared emotional. Schwimmer, who LeBlanc thought was the [...] "consummate professional", was also upset, so LeBlanc [...] "just lost it." [...] Maggie Wheeler, who was Chandler's [...] "on and off" [...] girlfriend Janice, told People, [...] "the entire cast had to go back and have their makeup redone before starting," [...] and that Perry broke the tension by saying, [...] "Somebody is gonna get fired." [...] Perry told the New York Daily News that he did not cry, [...] "but I felt like I was about to for like seven hours." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in 2006, Dobson said that, while [...] "there is disillusionment {{out there}} with Republicans" [...] and [...] "that worries me greatly," [...] he {{nonetheless}} suggested voters turn out and vote Republican in 2006. [...] "My first inclination was to sit this one out," [...] but according to The New York Times, Dobson then added that [...] "he had changed his mind <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> who would become the leaders of Congressional committees if the Democrats took over." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{his novels}} have earned mostly {{positive}} critical reception, Green has discussed {{what he believes}} to be flaws in his novels, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> them in retrospect. Additionally, {{in response to a}} fan's tweet, Green apologized for using the word retarded in Paper Towns, stating, [...] "Yeah, I regret it. At the time, I thought an author's responsibility was to reflect language as I found it, but now ... eight years later, I don't feel like a book about humanizing the other benefited from dehumanizing language," [...] adding, [...] "it's not in the movie, and I won't use the word again in a book or elsewhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2011, Schilling joined 130 House Republicans {{in voting}} against a $450 million budget cut {{for an extra}} F-35 fighter-jet engine—a project that the U.S. Department of Defense had {{repeatedly}} tried to kill, and that Defense Secretary Robert Gates called [...] "a waste of nearly 3 billion." [...] Schilling voted for a package of cuts that included a $230 million federal grant to build an Amtrak line from Chicago to Iowa City, though he had supported the project during his campaign, calling it [...] "critically important to both {{the economy and the}} environment of the Midwest." [...] The planned rail line was a celebrated project by many in his district, including local mayors. Schilling defended his vote, arguing {{it was a question of}} prioritizing, separating wants from needs, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the big picture, the rail service did not make the cut. He also stated that his constituents elected him to address national debt and deficit problems in Washington, not to take a business-as-usual approach.|$|E
2500|$|Rubin first {{conceived}} of the dating aspect for the film, [...] "being {{able to use}} your superior knowledge to pick up women", {{which led to the}} film to lean more into the comedy side. He knew he needed some calendar date to use for the day, and his earlier concept had the character reliving a late January day over and over; <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his calendar, he saw Groundhog Day, February 2, as a date with great potential as a recognized holiday but that had little fanfare, which the film could be played annually similar to Christmas or Halloween specials. Groundhog Day also presented Rubin with the idea of being able to take his character out of his home town into the unfamiliar territory and relative isolation of Punxsutawney, and cementing the character being named Phil in honor of Punxsutawney Phil, as well as making him a weatherman. Rubin took about seven weeks to fix the basic concepts and [...] "rules" [...] for the time loop in the film, and then completed the first draft of the screenplay within three to four days.|$|E
2500|$|McCreight knew many of {{the great}} Native American chiefs whose {{personal}} adornments filled The Wigwam, {{many of whom had}} been visitors to Du Bois, Pennsylvania, and he spoke of their stories with great eloquence, esteem and kinship. Plenty Coups, Grand Chief of the Crows, was an occasional visitor to The Wigwam during President Warren G. Harding’s term. [...] “The tall and dignified Chief took a lively interest in looking over the collection of Indian relics at the Wigwam.” “Flying Hawk related a time when he and Iron Tail spent an evening in the Indian room of the Wigwam going over all of the items there including pipes, war bonnets, moccasins, and other paraphernalia once belonging to Wanata, Red Cloud, Sitting Bull and other of their old-time friends. He said that Iron Tail told him it made him sad <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> all these things.” Chief Flying Hawk contributed his personal adornments and possessions to McCreight’s collection. [...] “When my brother Kicking Bear died he was put in a grave on a hill. [...] All his things are put in a grave with him. [...] I will see his son, Kicking Bear, if they will let us dig open the grave and take out the arrow-head and send it to this wigwam to put along with my things.” [...] When Chief Flying Hawk passed to the “Sand Hills” on December 30, 1930, McCreight expressed his kinship and esteem with a public announcement and exhibit in the Du Bois Public Library displaying chief Flying Hawk’s beaded jacket, pouch and pipe. Chief Flying Hawk was well known to the people of Du Bois, Pennsylvania, and McCreight remarked, “The schools are much interested in the exhibit as well as others of the town who had met him on other occasions.” [...] In his later years, McCreight attempted to donate the collection to museums, but without any success. McCreight cared for these national heritage treasures in The Wigwam until his death at the age of 94 in 1958. After his death, McCreight's Native American Collection at The Wigwam was sold and is now with private collectors and museums around the world.|$|E

Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering—at the hands of Sarah Ruth—for Christ is the way to fulfillment.|$|R

40|$|In two {{excellent}} recent papers, Jacob Ross {{has argued}} that the standard arguments for the ‘thirder’ answer to the Sleeping Beauty puzzle lead to violations of countable additivity.
