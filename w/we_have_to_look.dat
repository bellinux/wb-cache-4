500|$|The {{reaction}} to Russia's announcement and subsequent execution of {{its plan to}} deorbit Mir was mixed. Several cosmonauts expressed regrets {{at the loss of}} the station, but support for the decision to end the programme; Vladimir Titov described the station as [...] "a good ship", but said that he agreed with the decision to prioritise the International Space Station, while Vladimir Dezhurov said that he felt [...] "sad about Mir but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into the future." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 9, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Perry and his fellow Million Dollar Backfield teammate, John Henry Johnson, who died on June 3, 2011, would have their brains examined by researchers at Boston University who are studying head injuries in sports. Both men were suspected of suffering form chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disorder linked to repeated brain trauma. Perry's widow, Donna, told the San Francisco Chronicle that she believes her husband suffered from CTE. She further told the newspaper that [...] "When Joe was playing, they'd give them smelling salts and put them back in. [...] "Now the equipment is better, and they're looking into ways to protect them. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at what this is doing to our children." ...|$|E
500|$|Money was {{borrowed}} from Britain {{to fund the}} state's programs and at an unprecedented rate. Over £230 million was extended in loans from the City of London to state and Commonwealth treasuries during the 1920s. A further £140 million arrived through private investment. Bruce's plan for Australian economic development needed a much stronger role for the Commonwealth government than had been traditionally accepted. Both he and Page were [...] "conspicuously national rather than federal in their outlook" [...] and sought major changes to federal-state relations in order implement their development policy. Increasingly our problems are becoming national in character... Our financial resources are curtailed {{and there is an}} immediate repercussion throughout the Commonwealth. All our problems are common problems. None can be prosperous unless all are prospering. I am more convinced that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at all our problems with the eyes of a nation and not as individuals. Where a great problem confronts a State it may be solved by the cooperation of the Commonwealth {{for the benefit of the}} States, and the benefit and advancement of the whole of Australia.|$|E
60|$|It was curiously unlike earthly experience, too, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{the light}} {{coming up to}} one. On earth light falls from above, or comes {{slanting}} down sideways, but here it came from beneath our feet, and to see our shadows <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up.|$|R

I {{could almost hear}} Mackintyre gnashing his teeth at their inroads on the forced strawberries, and the park and Elmwood Spinney were dotted so thick with people, that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> sharp not <b>to</b> fall in with any one." ...|$|R

"Well, you see, lad, {{the chances}} are them bloody sneaks will soon try to work the same deviltry which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at idly last night, for {{it stands to reason}} that all who deserted from this fort fell into their clutches. The next time they start in to kill a man by inches, believin' they're out of range, we'll plump a ball into the middle of the gang that'll make em' hop a bit." ...|$|R
500|$|This led to Boycott {{being dropped}} from the side and forced to return to England, despite apologising via a note to the England {{dressing}} room. He claimed in his autobiography, however, {{that he went to}} the golf course following medical advice to get fresh air. Later in 1982 he was instrumental in organising, in defiance of a United Nations and a TCCB ban, a so-called [...] "rebel" [...] tour of apartheid South Africa by 13 current and former England Test cricketers, who were almost all nearing the end of their careers. All the players were banned from international cricket for three years as a result. By the mid-1980s, with Boycott in good county form and physical shape, there was speculation that he might return to the England side. David Gower, England captain of the time, stated, however, that [...] "Geoffrey's been a marvellous servant for England but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to the future and, in view of his age, it wouldn't make an awful lot of sense to pick him again." [...] This was confirmed by the return of Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson's 175 against Australia at Leeds, which prompted Botham, who had once remarked that Boycott was [...] "totally, almost insanely, selfish", to sing [...] "Bye-bye Boycott" [...] from the England balcony.|$|E
500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't {{want to see that}} gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, most of the women loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1995-1996 school year, 82% {{of black}} {{students}} and 70% of Hispanic students at Lanier passed state tests. 98% of White students had passed the same tests.

2500|$|Now there's a {{weird thing}} going on. Partly {{proposed}} by {{a colleague of}} mine writing in The Nation, Christopher Hitchens. He is saying, somehow {{he seems to be}} saying, it is wrong to look at history, it is wrong to {{look at the history of}} the past century. You don't have to exonerate the appalling deeds of Osama bin Laden and his associates, if it be Osama bin Laden, to say who brought this down, who contributed to this, a number of factors. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at history. For someone like Hitchens to attack Chomsky, as he's done in The Nation, saying he is somehow 'soft' on fascism because [...] tries to read history is an outrage – an absolute outrage.|$|E
2500|$|Following the budget, and in {{the period}} until the {{spending}} review, Alexander found himself {{at the heart of}} controversial spending decisions made by the government. A series of leaked letters from cabinet ministers showed that the spending review was causing strain within government departments including within the Department of Work and Pensions when a memo from Osborne to Iain Duncan Smith suggested that deep cuts to the welfare budget had already been agreed, prompting accusations by Labour that the cuts were [...] "vicious" [...] and an attack on the poorest in society. In response Alexander said [...] "I am not going to comment on a leaked letter but what I will say is that with welfare spending making up nearly £200 billion, of course it is something <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at {{in the context of the}} spending review." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The redskins' ways aint pleasant," [...] Dave said. [...] "Well, let us {{be moving}} up. The first thing <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for aint gold. There {{is no doubt about}} that being here somewhere. What <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for is if there is any way out of this hole, because it is a regular trap, and if we were caught here we might hold the gorge for a long time, but they would have us at last certain; besides, they could shoot us down from the top." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>had</b> time <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{upon each}} other more at leisure, which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not done {{for a piece of}} a minute before (upon a common impulse) we shook hands again.|$|R

2500|$|During {{this period}} foliage forms, though still conventional, more closely {{followed}} nature. The canopy {{work of the}} choir of Winchester contains exquisite carvings of oak and other leaves. The choir stalls of Ely and Chichester and the tomb of Edward III. in Westminster Abbey are all fine examples of this period. Exeter boasts a throne that of Bishop Stapledon (1308–1326) standing [...] high, which remains unequaled for perfection of proportion and delicacy of detail. In France the stalls of St Benoit-sur-Loire, Lisieux, and Évreux are good 14th-century examples. But little Gothic work is now {{to be seen in}} the churches of this country. It is to the museums <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for traces of the old Gothic carvers. The two retables in Dijon Museum, the work of Jacques de Baerze (1301), a sculptor of Flanders, who carved for Philippe le Hardi, Duke of Burgundy, are masterpieces of design and workmanship. The tracery is of the very finest, chiefly gilt on backgrounds of diapered gesso.|$|E
2500|$|Oasis {{formed in}} Manchester in 1991, and {{following}} the Manchester Arena bombing after a concert by US singer [...] Ariana Grande on 22 May 2017 — a terrorist attack that killed 22 people — the song {{was used by the}} people of Manchester in remembrance of the victims and to show the city's spirit. The song was sung by students of Manchester's Chetham’s music school on 23 May, and on 25 May it was spontaneously sung by the crowd gathered for a minute of silence in the city centre. The woman who started the singing told The Guardian, “I love Manchester, and Oasis is part of my childhood. Don’t Look Back in Anger – that’s what this is about: we can’t be looking backwards to what happened, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forwards to the future." [...] The song came back into the charts, along with Ariana Grande’s [...] "One Last Time," [...] which was number one in the iTunes single charts as of 26 May. On 27 May, the song was performed as a tribute by 50,000 audience members of a performance by The Courteeners in Manchester.|$|E

5000|$|Braithwaite {{was with}} The Wailers {{for eight months}} and sang lead on such songs as [...] "Habits", [...] "Straight and Narrow Way", [...] "Don't Ever Leave Me", and [...] "It Hurts To Be Alone". He had the best voice in The Wailers, {{according}} to Studio One's Coxsone Dodd, who discovered the band's talent. Bob Marley later commented: [...] "Junior used to sing high. It's just nowadays that I'm {{beginning to realize that}} he sounded like one of the Jackson Five. When he left <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for a sound that Bunny, Peter and me could manage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No they won't," [...] {{interrupted}} the boy; [...] "it's a monstrous big wood they've got {{to pass through}} before they can come here, so <b>we</b> <b>have</b> time <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at some of the}} 'stonishin' things." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Of that I {{suppose we}} {{have no right to}} judge,' said Mr. Dutton, {{somewhat}} tremulously. 'Justice is what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> to, and to allow Nuttie to be passed over would be permitting a slur to be cast on her and her mother.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In San Francisco, Petrelis {{witnessed}} the White Night riots at San Francisco City Hall, {{a reaction to}} the lenient sentencing of Dan White, convicted of killing San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and openly gay Supervisor Harvey Milk. Petrelis remembers feeling outrage on hearing the news of White’s sentence and said of the property destruction he had watched that night, “I remember feeling that was okay — that you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this destruction of personal property to send a message...to gay people here in San Francisco— [...] is not okay.

30|$|My {{background}} {{is actually in}} mainstream economics and I’ve worked all my life in economics and {{spent some time in}} international development where I had kind of the insight, or realisation that the economic development we were pursuing was not creating desirable solutions, and that, in fact, that was a huge wealth in many of the countries that I worked, which wasn’t recognised, which was the kind of the health and wealth of community and the connection to place and the spirit of the people, so I thought <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at transforming our economic model here, back in the west. So, I’ve worked in different forms (Interviewee 2).|$|R
6000|$|... "Partly for {{the sake}} of the {{literary}} material; you know <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for our own everywhere.

60|$|Now forasmuch as this {{inheritance}} in {{the heavens}} is the price, purchase, and reward of his blood, how evidently doth it appear that he hath paid full price to God for sinners!

Yea, and what comfort could <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for his coming, and kingdom, and glory as the fruits of his death, if his death had not for that purpose been sufficiently efficacious? O 'the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that shall follow!' (1 Peter 1:11).|$|E
60|$|By degrees we {{returned}} to our accustomed way of life. I resumed the daily work, which had been suspended during my absence in Hampshire. Our new lodgings cost us more than the smaller and less convenient rooms which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> left, and the claim thus implied on my increased exertions was strengthened by the doubtfulness of our future prospects. Emergencies might yet happen which would exhaust our little fund at the banker's, {{and the work of}} my hands might be, ultimately, all <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> for support. More permanent and more lucrative employment than had yet been offered to me was a necessity of our position--a necessity for which I now diligently set myself to provide.|$|R
5000|$|Writing {{about real}} people usually {{means there is}} a wealth of {{material}} to draw on. Not in this case. Apart from mentions in a few ghosted autobiographies and tabloid newspaper interviews there was virtually nothing. This meant <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in some odd places for our data. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> our memories of course; we both remembered Big Daddy on 'Tiswas' and Kendo Nagasaki being unmasked. We remembered the spectacle of seemingly thousands of old ladies at a fever pitch of excitement by the ringside, waving their umbrellas {{in the air and}} chanting 'Easy easy!' It was this excitement we wished to transmit by translating wrestling into theatre. Which, of course, is what it always was.|$|R
5000|$|In 1969 Wilkins and O'Brien sold Cove Haven to Caesars World of Las Vegas. Wilkins said, [...] "We {{had more}} {{business}} than {{we knew what}} to do with but had no money for expansion. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for somebody with deep pockets; that's why we sold to Caesars." [...] He became the {{president and chief operating officer}} of Caesars Pocono Resorts and opened three other resorts in the Poconos: Paradise Stream, Pocono Palace, and Brookdale. In 1997 Ski Magazine stated that the Caesars Pocono chain captured about one-third of the local couples market. Some of Wilkins's ideas, including mirrors on the ceilings, circular beds, and heart-shaped bathtubs, would appear at other Caesars resorts in Las Vegas and Tahoe.|$|R
