40|$|Changing network {{dynamics}} is {{a critical}} issue in many overlay networks especially in peer-to-peer file sharing systems. Previously these network formations were approached in two ways. First by implementing practical heuristics for cooperative peers, and later performing game theoretic analysis for selfish peers. Selfish Neighbour Selection (SNS) game theory is designed and implemented in overlay routing that unifies the fore mentioned ways. SNS limits number of neighbours for each peer. This approach reduces link monitoring overhead in overlay networks from O (n 2) to O (n). Best response wirings increase the utility of Overlays and Simple heuristic wirings benefits non-selfish nodes. EGOIST, an SNSinspired prototype overlay routing system that expresses and solves a node’s “best response ” <b>wiring</b> <b>strategy</b> as a k-median problem on asymmetric distance was developed. It’s evaluations {{on a variety of}} performance metrics like delay, available bandwidth, and node utilization in Planet Lab confirms its efficiency over existing heuristic overlays. EGOIST (assumes) is based on full-mesh topology which is hard to attain in network dynamics. We propose to use optimized spanning tree protocol (OSTP) that enables traffic traversing the full-mesh portion to take a shortest path from source to destination. Using this full-mesh the claims of EGOIST can be validated. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{a typical}} overlay network for routing or content sharing, each node must select a fixed number of {{immediate}} overlay neighbors for routing traffic or content queries. A selfish node entering such a network would select neighbors {{so as to}} minimize the weighted sum of expected access costs to all its destinations. Previous work on selfish neighbor selection has built intuition with simple models where edges are undirected, access costs are modeled by hop-counts, and nodes have potentially unbounded degrees. However, in practice, important constraints not captured by these models lead to richer games with substantively and fundamentally different outcomes. Our work models neighbor selection as a game involving directed links, constraints {{on the number of}} allowed neighbors, and costs reflecting both network latency and node preference. We express a node’s “best response ” <b>wiring</b> <b>strategy</b> as a k-median problem on asymmetric distance, and use this formulation to obtain pure Nash equilibria. We experimentally examine the properties of such stable wirings on synthetic topologies, as well as on real topologies and maps constructed from PlanetLab and AS-level Internet measurements. Our results indicate that selfish nodes can reap substantial performance benefits when connecting to overlay networks composed of non-selfish nodes. On the other hand, in overlays that are dominated by selfish nodes, the resulting stable wirings are optimized to such great extent that even non-selfish newcomers can extract near-optimal performance through naive wiring strategies.

40|$|Overlay {{networks}} {{have been used}} for adding and enhancing functionality to the end-users without requiring modifications in the Internet core mechanisms. Overlay {{networks have}} been used for a variety of popular applications including routing, file sharing, content distribution, and server deployment. Previous work has focused on devising practical neighbor selection heuristics under the assumption that users conform to a specific wiring protocol. This is not a valid assumption in highly decentralized systems like overlay networks. Overlay users may act selfishly and deviate from the default wiring protocols by utilizing knowledge they have about the network when selecting neighbors to improve the performance they receive from the overlay. This thesis goes against the conventional thinking that overlay users conform to a specific protocol. The contributions of this thesis are threefold. It provides a systematic evaluation of the design space of selfish neighbor selection strategies in real overlays, evaluates the performance of overlay networks that consist of users that select their neighbors selfishly, and examines the implications of selfish neighbor and server selection to overlay protocol design and service provisioning respectively. This thesis develops a game-theoretic framework that provides a unified approach to modeling Selfish Neighbor Selection (SNS) wiring procedures on behalf of selfish users. The model is general, and takes into consideration costs reflecting network latency and user preference profiles, the inherent directionality in overlay maintenance protocols, and connectivity constraints imposed on the system designer. Within this framework the notion of user’s "best response" <b>wiring</b> <b>strategy</b> is formalized as a k-median problem on asymmetric distance and is used to obtain overlay structures in which no node can re-wire to improve the performance it receives from the overlay. Evaluation results presented in this thesis indicate that selfish users can reap substantial performance benefits when connecting to overlay networks composed of non-selfish users. In addition, in overlays that are dominated by selfish users, the resulting stable wirings are optimized to such great extent that even non-selfish newcomers can extract near-optimal performance through naïve wiring strategies. To capitalize on the performance advantages of optimal neighbor selection strategies and the emergent global wirings that result, this thesis presents EGOIST: an SNS-inspired overlay network creation and maintenance routing system. Through an extensive measurement study on the deployed prototype, results presented in this thesis show that EGOIST’s neighbor selection primitives outperform existing heuristics on a variety of performance metrics, including delay, available bandwidth, and node utilization. Moreover, these results demonstrate that EGOIST is competitive with an optimal but unscalable full-mesh approach, remains highly effective under significant churn, is robust to cheating, and incurs minimal overheads. This thesis also studies selfish neighbor selection strategies for swarming applications. The main focus is on n-way broadcast applications where each of n overlay user wants to push its own distinct file to all other destinations as well as download their respective data files. Results presented in this thesis demonstrate that the performance of our swarming protocol for n-way broadcast on top of overlays of selfish users is far superior than the performance on top of existing overlays. In the context of service provisioning, this thesis examines the use of distributed approaches that enable a provider to determine the number and location of servers for optimal delivery of content or services to its selfish end-users. To leverage recent advances in virtualization technologies, this thesis develops and evaluates a distributed protocol to migrate servers based on end-users demand and only on local topological knowledge. Results under a range of network topologies and workloads suggest that the performance of the distributed deployment is comparable to that of the optimal but unscalable centralized deployment.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMuch of our {{understanding}} of how neural networks develop is based on studies of sensory systems, revealing often highly stereotyped patterns of connections, particularly as these diverge from the presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons. We know considerably less about the <b>wiring</b> <b>strategies</b> of motor networks, where connections converge onto the dendrites of motoneurons. Here, we investigated patterns of synaptic connections between identified motoneurons with sensory neurons and interneurons in the motor network of the Drosophila larva and how these change as it develops. ResultsWe find that as animals grow, motoneurons increase the number of synapses with existing presynaptic partners. Different motoneurons form characteristic cell-type-specific patterns of connections. At the same time, there is considerable variability in the number of synapses formed on motoneuron dendrites, which contrasts with the stereotypy reported for presynaptic terminals of sensory neurons. Where two motoneurons of the same cell type contact a common interneuron partner, each postsynaptic cell can arrive at a different connectivity outcome. Experimentally changing the positioning of motoneuron dendrites shows that the geography of dendritic arbors in relation to presynaptic partner terminals is an important determinant in shaping patterns of connectivity. ConclusionsIn the Drosophila larval motor network, the sets of connections that form between identified neurons manifest an unexpected level of variability. Synapse number and the likelihood of forming connections appear to be regulated on a cell-by-cell basis, determined primarily by the postsynaptic dendrites of motoneuron terminals...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesOur {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} in-hospital outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of chronic total occlusion (CTO) using contemporary techniques. BackgroundDespite its increasing popularity and technical complexity, clinical outcomes of PCI for CTO using contemporary techniques have not been adequately evaluated. MethodsThe J-CTO registry (multicenter CTO registry in Japan) is a large scale, multicenter registry enrolling consecutive patients undergoing PCI for CTO from 12 Japanese centers. In-hospital clinical outcomes were evaluated in 498 patients with 528 CTO lesions. ResultsMultiple <b>wiring</b> <b>strategies</b> were frequently attempted (parallel wiring 31 % and retrograde approach 25 %) with relatively long guidewire manipulation time (median 30 min). Utilizing these complex strategies, high procedural success rates (88. 6 % in the first attempt cases and 68. 5 % in the retry cases) were accomplished. In-hospital adverse event rates were strikingly low (cardiac death 0. 2 %, Q-wave myocardial infarction 0. 2 %, and stroke 0 %). Potential disadvantages of these procedures, including {{a large amount of}} contrast volume (median 293 ml) and long fluoroscopic time (median 45 min), were not associated with serious clinical sequelae (contrast induced nephropathy 1. 2 % and radiation dermatitis 0 %). Although coronary perforations were documented frequently by angiography (antegrade 7. 2 % and retrograde 13. 6 %), clinically significant perforation resulting in cardiac tamponade was rare (0. 4 %). ConclusionsMost CTO lesions can be safely and successfully treated with PCI utilizing contemporary advanced techniques. Invasiveness and potential risks of these strategies, which have been the greatest concerns of CTO treatment, may be acceptable in the majority of cases considering the actual incidences of related adverse events and the procedural success rates...|$|R

30|$|A {{remaining}} challenge, however, is {{the integration}} of such organic nanofibers into the necessary surrounding circuitry such as metal electrodes for electrical biasing. Essentially, two different strategies can be used: (1) an in situ growth approach, in which the nanostructure is self-assembled directly on the device platform to establish the required electrical connections, and (2) a controlled transfer approach, in which pre-fabricated nanostructures are transferred to a device substrate for electrical <b>wiring.</b> Both <b>strategies</b> have been demonstrated on a wafer scale for inorganic nanowires [22, 23], and we have recently demonstrated that the in situ growth approach is also possible for organic nanofibers [24], although with a nanofiber morphology that is inferior to epitaxially grown fibers.

40|$|Vision is the {{dominant}} human sensory modality. Due to the relative ease with which both visual input and visual brain areas can be studied and manipulated, vision has become an important window for enlarging {{our understanding of the}} biological sensory processing. Whether artificial or biological, visual processing systems must quickly and efficiently make sense of a large volume of noisy, high-dimensional input. To do this they construct statistical models of the input and utilise these models to efficiently encode visual scenes, detect features and construct a model of the world. In this thesis, we combine the study of natural scene statistics with mathematical models, experimental analysis and visual psychophysics to glean {{a deeper understanding of the}} development and function of the mammalian primary visual cortex. We start by considering functional models of receptive field development. We find, in agreement with previous work, that unsupervised learning models trained on natural scenes consistently learn that oriented "edges 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 (Gabor-like filters) are the basic features of natural scenes. The similarity between these filters and primary visual cortex receptive fields is strong evidence that primary visual cortex receptive fields are optimal encoders of visual input. We then significantly extend this work by comparing the prediction of unsupervised learning models with the receptive fields of animals reared in unusual visual environments. We find good agreement, which is evidence that aspects of receptive fields are learned during development, rather than innate. We also show that applying such unsupervised learning models to binocular visual input is not a simple extension of monocular visual input. Inter-ocular correlations change the optimal encoding strategy of binocular input so that it depends on edge orientation. Such functional models intriguingly predict an over-representation of vertically oriented receptive fields. After establishing that oriented edges are the basic feature of natural scenes and the unit of primary visual cortex receptive fields, we consider the statistics of edge arrangements in natural scenes. Sigman 2001 showed that edges in natural scenes over short distances tend to be tangent to a common circle, or co-circular. Edge arrangements which contain a dependence between edge position and orientation may be said to have "reduced symmetry 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 as they lack a symmetry in that the edge position and orientation cannot be rotated independently without modifying the statistics of the arrangement. Co-circularity is one specific type of reduced symmetry. We extend previous work on natural scene co-circularity using a noise-resistant measure of co-circularity we develop and show that natural scenes contain significant co-circularity over extremely large angular distances (> 14). We also discuss preliminary work into variations in co-circularity statistics by scene type. After establishing that co-circularity is found pervasively in natural scenes, even over large distances, we then return to the structure of the primary visual cortex, but this time at the network level. Previous work has shown that, like edges in natural scenes, V 1 orientation preferences maps also have reduced symmetry. However, the details of this dependence between orientation and position have not been examined in detail. We examine cat orientation preference maps from normal, stripe and blind-reared animals and find that, although orientation preference maps do contain reduced symmetry, it is not co-circularity. Moreover, the statistics of reduced symmetry in the maps are not affected by changes to visual input during development. Continuing our examination of V 1 network structure, we consider the statistics of lateral connectivity in tree shrew V 1. Previous work demonstrated that long-range V 1 lateral connections are more common between regions with similar orientation preferences Bosking 1997. We re-examine this connectivity data using our noise-resistance measure of co-circularity. We find evidence that lateral connections between cells in the primary visual cortex may use two opposite <b>wiring</b> <b>strategies</b> which simultaneously facilitate quick processing of co-circular visual input while increasing the salience of the less expected deviations from co-circularity. Finally, we use the psychophysics of binocular rivalry to test whether co-circularity statistics can affect the functional processing of visual input in humans. We show, using binocular rivalry dominance as an objective measure of salience, that randomly arranged edges are more salient than edge arrangements which contain co-circularity. This is evidence that early visual processing may be functionally utilising edge arrangement statistics. In concurrence with our findings about lateral connections, this may indicate a general strategy of increasing the salience of unexpected visual input. Overall, we demonstrate that early visual coding uses natural scene statistics extensively. We show that oriented edges are a key currency in early visual processing. We find that the arrangement of edges in natural scenes contain rich statistical structure which influences wiring in the primary visual cortex during development and produces measurable changes in the salience of visual stimuli...|$|R

In the {{chemical sensor}}s, the core is sensing body which reacts with analytes and converts to electric signal. Among the sensing materials, conducting polymers are known to show short response time, room temperature operation, excellent formability and good conductivity. In these reasons, the conducting polymers are adaptable to sensing materials for flexible chemical sensors. To enhance the flexibility in chemical sensor array, there are two strategies that are plastic substrates and 3 D conducting polymer <b>wire</b> array. The <b>strategies</b> are already applied to flexible electronics. The plastic substrates have already embodied for the flexible chemical sensors, but the construction of 3 D sensing material is still a challenge in conventional methods such as soft-lithography or direct writing techniques. In this thesis, we demonstrated a novel strategy to achieve 3 D PEDOTPSS wire array sensor on plastic substrates for flexible chemical sensor using direct writing of extensional deformed meniscus based on fountain pen. The diameter of wires could be controlled by pulling speed. We discovered the relationships the diameter with pulling speed through “coffee ring effect”. The model was answered to previous result. Using two point probe method, we demonstrated that the 3 D PEDOTPSS wire sensor was exhibited linear dependence of sensitivity on acetone concentration and the surface {{area to volume ratio}} of wires.

Out of these, the passively tuned liquid damper (TLD) class is wanted {{due to its}} broad applicability, extreme reliability, robustness, long life time and ease of manufacturability. In this PhD thesis, the theory, design, verification and validation of multi-mode TLDs in terrestrial and mainly spacecraft (S/C) applications have been studied. The most challenging TLD design of the type “tube-with-endpots” was the Chinese meteorological FY- 2 S/C nutation damper in the 90 s. The extreme performance requirements like the 0. 5 ” residual nutation damping angle implied an extended test program which led to refined insights in the recursive calibration method and limiting damping performance. The test analysis results and the involvement in the in-orbit analysis of the Ulysses S/C nutation anomaly in the same period, led the author {{to the idea of}} a multi-mode TLD system. The concept was proposed and successfully applied in the Cluster S/C for the effective damping of both nutation and coupled wire boom (antenna) oscillation modes. To come that far, the essentials of spacecraft dynamics and its control required an extension of the liquid flow models and an appropriate TLD design methodology to include multi-mode excitations. The TLD key performance parameters are the dissipation rate, residual damping angle and the resonance frequency which is directly related to the effective damping length. This parameter used to be obtained by an educated guess on basis of test heritage. The existing practical design rules, however, were overruled by new insights which are based on the latest scientific results from fluid mechanics. This knowledge and the extensive analysis of all available TLD damping performance tests resulted in a new refined methodology to estimate the effective damping length properly. The eventual value, however, must still be determined via recursive calibration cycles but better initial estimates reduce the required test times significantly. The residual damping angle is limited by the TLD endpot behavior which is determined by the physics of the liquid meniscus interaction with the endpot wall. Though the TLD design is characterized by a very low residual angle with almost zero dead-band, the very limit is not clear. This issue was investigated using multiple models and experiments whilst the state-of-the-art in the scientific literature from nano-tribology and wetting transitions on biomimetic surfaces was explored. Test refinements are proposed to decrease damping fluctuations and extend the low angular test range. Although, the limiting angle is not known, there is strong evidence that the limits can be extended beyond the 0. 1 ” flight value. The early design phase of the broadband Cluster TLDs in 1991 and the TLD developments up to 2012 were studied. Moreover, the spin-stabilized magneto-spherical S/C Bepi-Colombo, Cluster, RBSP, DICE, Themis and FAST are compared which confirm the applicability of the multi-mode TLD concept. The study of the generic theory of wire boom oscillations, gyroscopically coupled to the S/C hub spin and nutation modes, resulted in a new harmonized parameterization and derived equations. The Cluster TLD system with in addition the internal wire boom damping enable the boom deflection limit and its damping time constant to be design parameters. On basis of this knowledge, a recursive bottom-up TLD design methodology was developed. The stability study including the wire boom composition made clear where the limit of multi-mode modeling is reached and breadboard experiments and practical engineering trade-offs are required. The optimal <b>wire</b> boom deployment <b>strategy</b> using the multi-mode damping principle was analyzed. At small angular deflections, however, material artifacts and anelastic flexure dominate and only dedicated engineering tests can clarify these issues. The current status of the TLD design was investigated by comparing the RBSP S/C [2012] ring TLD and the Cluster S/C [2000] endpot TLD designs. The combination of the Cluster TLD bottom-up design methodology with the 9 degrees of freedom RBSP top-down model completed the model base for the design of multi-mode TLDs in flexible S/C. The RBSP TLD suffers with considerable angular off-sets and inrush time constants which are not accounted for in the RBSP model. The Cluster TLD design, however, lacks these artifacts. RBSP S/C flight validation data, however, are not yet available. The nutation related Cluster flight data validate the TLD model predictions firmly within the requirements. This renders an indirect but incomplete prove of the effectiveness of the TLD system design. It is hard, however, to trace and validate the designed multi-mode performance itself. It is, therefore, of great scientific value to obtain Attitude Determination and Control System flight data. A successful TLD development requires risk mitigation as an essential part of systems engineering (SE). An inventory of boundary conditions was made thinking ahead for production and project cost escalations. In the high-tech industry, however, there is little focus on a scientifically based bottom-up SE approach though such effort does pay off. It was one of the quests of this thesis to prove the added value of such an investment. As a result, the developed methodologies do contribute to a profound SE approach in the development of multi-mode TLDs. The space qualified broadband TLD design with endpots is an excellent choice for use in future spin-stabilized S/C with wire boom configurations. The results of the PhD thesis enable the extreme refinement of the given damper concept. Market research and the allocation of dedicated solutions are a way towards valorization. Terrestrial spin-offs in the engineering fields of refined (ultra) centrifuges, pulsating industrial piping systems, windmills, earthquake control of building structures, shipbuilding and bridge stabilization offer the best valorization opportunities in short terms.

40|$|Empathy {{translates}} the German einfühlungand it can {{be defined}} a “biological, cognitive, socialand spiritual phenomenon. In the studies about thought, it has been considered an “identification”(Freud), an emotional fusion with people and things in the aesthetic experience (Hender, Novalis,Lipps), an emotional intuition, perception of the values and of psychic background (Scheler), anintersubjective and transcendental relationship (Husserl), an optimal replyness in the constructiveinteraction (Kohut), other’s experience as the ego and the ego’s one as other (Ricoeur),syntonization, attunement (Stern), full immersion in the others’ subjective world (Rogers), processof sharing emotions (Bonino), phylogenetic tendency as a <b>strategy</b> <b>wired</b> in the deep cerebralcircuits strongly self-structured (Trevarthen, Brothers), that is a universal group of conditions andemotional innate expressions that makes the child already able to exchange empatically theemotions with another person. Empathy can be defined {{is a process of}} sharing of the emotions, a basic intra-psychic variable ofthe relationship, a getting hold of someone else’s conscience, the ability of immersion insomeone’s else world. So, empathy is the ability of seeing the world with other’s eyes, leavingown values, feelings, knowledge out of consideration in order to perceive not only the meaningsabout what we know, but also the meanings staying below the conscious surface. According to Trevarthen’s theory the emotions direct the knowledge (that is the attention, the behaviour and the learning) and give them a subjective and communicable valuation. They belong integrally to subject’s reasons and they present a strong innate adaptable organization. Human emotions preside over the regulations of the body, of the conscious self, ofthe intersubjectivity. The emotions resound among the subjects coupling their reasons and their consciousness andanimating them reciprocally. Human emotions are elaborated through socio-cultural and intersubjective learning, but their origin isn’t in it. The concept of empathy is strictly joined with that one of intersubjectivity that may be defined asthe act “to be attuned’ with others intentional states, ability of meta-representation of otherpeople’s mind (thoughts, emotions, intentions), meta-communication, because it transmits to theother confidence in the possibility to contact emotions, to value and formulate decisions, todiscover meanings and personal motives. The emotions, affection – modification of the soul (Aristotele, S. Tommaso, Cartesio), invisible principle of visible actions (Hobbes), confused obscure and involuntary thought (Leibniz),predominance of the feelings over the rationality (Kant), emotional expression functional to thecommunication and to the cohabitation (Darwin), visceral and neurovegetative reaction (James), or in actual terms, mental or affective state in which the subject realizes-perceives the value of asituation, is a complex subjective experience, less steady and strong than feeling and passion,cognitive–affective organizer, mediator between organism and environment, push made dynamicfrom the need according to the trajectory need – emotion – action. It’s, evidently, a very complexphenomenon. According to the theory of the evolution, fear, anger, sadness, joy are basic emotionsregulated from the neuronal programmes associated to the adaptation. Psychoanalysis reads the emotions as spies of conflicts and as openings from which the deniedlustful energy flows away, repressed or removed, interface between beat and action. For the cognitive psychology, on the contrary, the emotion is the interface between organism andenvironment and has got two functions: that one of the monitoring of the environment in order tograsp the meanings and the motivational one that pushes the subject to the action. The constructionism defines emotions as social construction associated to languages, techniquesand values of certain cultures. The neuroscientific searches of LeDoux have explained the iter of emotions: from the input of senses the route arrives at the thalamus that sends the signals to theamygdale that pushes immediately to the action and to the neocortex that, slower but more precise,works out an action plan not impulsive but aware. The reactions in the prefrontal lobes, in the amygdale and in the hippocampus activate moreoverthe immune, nervous autonomous, endocrine systems in a circuit where synergically actperception, emotion, physiological reaction, action. The emotions, therefore, seem to confirm the existence, in the man, of a rational mind and anemotional impulsive and immediate mind, having its own logic, and therefore not irrational. Thisis the demonstration that via rationis and via amoris may be integrated with reciprocal gain. The emotional competence, that is the capacity to be in touch, to monitor and to manage our ownemotions and to be empathic with others’ ones has been defined, by Goleman, emotional intelligence and, by Gardner, intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligence. We have shown as emotions may be defined a complex state of the ego including an increased perception of an object or a situation, deep physiologic modifications (tachycardia, paleness,blush, perspiration, gastro-enteric disorders), attraction and aversion (behaviour of an approach or of hesitation, push to the action). The emotional intelligence (empathy, vision of the heart) about which Goleman speaks, includes consciousness of himself and ability to monitor his own emotions recognizing dysfunctional anddestructive emotions (anger, wish, illusion). According to Paul Ekmann and Richard Davidson, the most important emotions are ten:hanger, fear, sadness, disgust, contempt, surprise (amazement, astonishment), amusement (happiness, joy, serenity), embarrassments, fault, shame. LeDoux’s neurophysiological studies and Goleman’s searches have noticed the existence of anarchives of an emotional memory, the amygdale, that is situated on the cerebral trunk, near thelower of limbic system. There are two amygdales, one {{on each side of the}} brain. The human amygdale is relatively voluminous compared to that one of the other primates (thespecies more similar to us according the evolutive point of view). The hippocampus and the amygdale were two basic parts of the rhinencephalon that, during the phylogeny, gave rise to primitive cortex, and then to neo-cortex. Today, these limbic structuresmake a large part of the work of learning and memorization performed by the brain; the amygdaleis specialized in the emotions: if it’s resected by the rest of the brain, the results is a very clearinability of valuing the emotional meaning of the events - a condition defined emotional blindness -. Without their emotional meaning, human relationships lose their importance. Life without amygdale is a life without a personal meaning. All passions, including love, are bound to the amygdale. The amygdale, because it receives the input before they are recorded by the neo-cortex, picks themicro-impressions and harmonizes the cerebral areas using neural connections and the samerational mind. So, our emotions have a mind that is able to have different opinions by the rationalmind’s ones. The empathy, according to Goleman, has got its roots in the self-consciousness. The emotionalwavelength is the result of the capacity to contact our emotions and to read tones, emotionalexpressions, gestures that reveals other’s feeling also when they aren’t verbal. The empathy, as we can see from this researches, is a very important component in child’sdevelopment. In very little children the sight of others’ suffering causes a kind of camouflage of the movement, a reaction to the other people’s agitation experienced like his own, that disappearsaround the two years. We have to add that the resound, or the lack of it, between mother and her child, shapes one’sfuture emotional expectations as concern the possibility that other people want and can share hisfeeling. The lack of tuning between parents and children has got as consequence the atrophy of theemotions, as we can see from criminals’ stories of life. According to Goleman the empathy has its source on physiological bases and it’s also the root of the morality: in fact, there’s a strict linkbetween empathy and altruism and the same fact to put oneself into others’ shoes makes the application of moral principles easier. Already in the childhood it’s possible to share sick persons and outcasts’ suffering but in the adolescence the empathic capacity becomes proactive and pro-social making more vigorous project directed to the justice and to peace. The emotional intelligence is, therefore, certainly, a basic aptitude of life, that may be shaped from family and school influences: it promotes healthy and durable relations and makes the school and work success easier. Just as plastic, the emotional intelligence must be cultivated in the childhood and in the adolescence. The neuroplasticity of the brain pens it to develop always new synaptical connections. RichardDavidson’s (8 B) search has shown that the functions of prefrontal lobes in relation with the limbicsystem let us mix thought and feelings, knowledge and emotion. Emotions involve anorchestration of the activity of the circuits of all brain, in particular of the frontal lobe in whichreside the executive functions (for ex. planning), in the amygdale, very active when we feelnegative emotions like the fear; and in the hippocampus that is involved in both explicit andimplicit memory processes. Besides, the frontal lobes, the left for the positive emotions, the rightfor those negative ones, the amygdale and the hippocampus are connected with the immune,endocrine, nervous autonomous system. The emotions, therefore, push over the mental health but also over that physical one. The lack of empathy exposes the subject to a range of risks that go from blues to troubles of thefeeding, to the violence, behaviours, unfortunately, in increase in the new generations. Conflicts, faults and suffering are the emotions that we cannot manage and that may destroy us: the hanger ismother of violence, the wish and the illusion produce dependence. It’s urgent to discover, to understand and to take care of those ones that Goleman calls destructive emotions: hanger, wish, illusion to cultivate positive emotions. The task of education in that is essential. Education that harmonize mind and heart, bringing intelligence into our life of relation, can enhance in children the growth of consciousness, empathy, self-control, cooperation, sociality...|$|R
