50|$|The blue <b>willow</b> <b>beetle</b> {{is found}} on aspen and various willow (Salix) species in fens, carrs and on river banks, but also often in willow short {{rotation}} coppice in agricultural landscapes. It often aggregates on host plants. On Salix cinerea, it prefers and is more common on female than male trees despite higher egg predation exerted by Anthocoris nemorum on the former. It is univoltine in Sweden but can produce multiple generations per year {{in other parts of}} its distribution range. Proliferation of larvae and egg production varies with vegetation. It overwinters under lichens on trees and under tree bark. Predators of blue <b>willow</b> <b>beetle</b> eggs are the common flowerbug (Anthocoris nemorum) and Orthotylus marginalis, and the adult is a vessel for larval development for the parasitoid wasp Perilitus brevicollis.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} the potential {{effects of climate}} change on the sub-alpine <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle,</b> the cold tolerance strategy and mechanisms involved in cold tolerance were investigated for all life stages. Microhabitat choice and microclimate temperatures within each microhabitat were related to median lethal temperature for each life stage. Summer active and quiescent adults are freeze tolerant, eggs and pupae are freeze avoidant and all larval stages are chill susceptible. Quiescent adults accumulated the highest concentration of glycerol (~ 24 mM) and haemolymph osmolality (875 mOsm). Haemolymph from pupae had angular crystals suggestive of antifreeze agent activity, but this was absent in the haemolymph of other life stages. Quiescent adults must move to a thermally buffered microhabitat in the soil to survive the winter in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. Low temperatures beyond the limits of the cold tolerance of the <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> occur often at the mid-willow, but the quiescent adults are protected from these cold exposures in the soil beneath the willow. Overall, the <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> uses both behavioural avoidance strategies and physiological mechanisms to survive cold exposures in its habitat...|$|R

Aux Chenes, PAC) and reared on host plants (Salix cordata) collected {{from each of the}} sites. Larval development (measured by molt frequency and length of larval stage) was significantly faster on PAC plants than on GB plants but did not differ for the two beetle populations. For both populations of beetles, mean pupal weight was also greater on PAC plants than on GB plants. Thus, there was no evidence for adaptation of beetle populations to local host plant populations. The greater performance of A. subplicata on PAC plants most likely resulted from a lower trichome density on leaves of plants from that site...|$|R
40|$|Plant sex {{effects on}} herbivores are well studied, but {{little is known}} about these effects on predators and predator-herbivore dynamics. Here we take a {{holistic}} approach to study, simultaneously, plant sex effects on herbivore and predator preference and performance, as well as population densities and predation pressure in the field. For dioecious Salix cinerea (grey willow) we found that male plants represented higher host plant quality than females for an omnivorous predator (Anthocoris nemorum, common flower bug), while host plant quality for its herbivorous prey (Phratora vulgatissima, blue <b>willow</b> <b>beetle)</b> was not sex-biased. The herbivore strongly preferred the host plant sex (female) that was suboptimal for the predator, which in turn followed its prey to female plants, leading to plant-sex-biased predation. These results provide new insight into the far-reaching effects of plant sex on insect communities, and open up novel opportunities for improving biocontrol of the herbivore in Salix short rotation coppice...|$|E
40|$|Group {{formation}} reduces individual predation risk {{when the}} proportion of prey taken per predator encounter declines faster than the increase in group encounter rate (a ack-abatement). Despite a ack-abatement being {{an important component of}} group formation ecology, several key aspects have not been empirically studied, that is, interactions with the hunting mode of the predator and how these relationships are modi ed by local habitat quality. In 79 cage trials, we examined individual egg predation risk in di erent-sized egg clutches from the blue <b>willow</b> <b>beetle</b> Phratora vulgatissima for two predators with di erent hunting modes (consumption of full group [Orthotylus marginalis] vs. part group [Anthocoris nemorum]). Because these predators also take nutrients from plant sap, we could examine how the quality of alternative food sources (high- vs. low-quality host plant sap) in uenced a ack-abatement pa erns in the presence of di erent hunting strategies. For the O. marginalis predator, individual egg predation risk was largely independent of group size. For A. nemorum, egg predation risk clearly declined with increasing group size. However, approximately one-third of the grouping bene t was lost to an increase in group detectability. There were clear di erences in a ack-abatement pa erns between plants with high- vs. low-quality sap. When O. marginalis was the predator, there was no clear change in a ack-abatement in relation to host plant quality. However, for A. nemorum there was a clear reduction in overall predation risk and a stronger a ack-abatement pa ern with increasing group size when plant sap quality increased. This implies that the relative bene ts of prey grouping behavior for any species might show diurnal or seasonal changes as other aspects of resource/habitat quality change for the focal predator. Modulation of a ack-abatement by bo om-up e ects such as plant-based food resources is yet to be incorporated into general theory, despite the ubiquity of omnivorous predators and with omnivory being important for shaping food webs, ecosystem functions, and in biological control. Thus, ongoing re nement of a ack- abatement theory by focusing on bo om-up vs. top-down processes could have signi cant impacts on many important contemporary elds of study...|$|E
40|$|Published by the University of Chicago PressUnderstanding how {{climate change}} impacts natural systems {{requires}} {{investigations of the}} effects of environmental variation on vulnerable species and documentation of how populations respond to change. The <b>willow</b> <b>beetle</b> Chrysomela aeneicollis is ideal for such studies. It lives in California???s Sierra Nevada on the southern edge of its worldwide range. Beetles experience elevated air temperatures during summertime egg laying and larval development. Exposure to these temperatures causes physiological stress, which may reduce reproductive success and endanger populations. The glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is a marker of temperature adaptation in C. aeneicollis. PGI allele frequency varies across a latitudinal gradient: allele 1 is common in Rock Creek (RC), which is cooler and to the north, and allele 4 is common in Big Pine Creek (BPC), which is warmer and to the south. In populations that are intermediate in geography and climate (e. g., Bishop Creek [BC]), PGI- 4 frequency increases from north to south such that alleles 1 and 4 are in relatively equal frequency in southern BC. Over the past decade, Sierra Nevada beetle populations have colonized high elevations and have become extinct at lower elevations where they were once common. In BC, the magnitude of PGI allele frequency fluctuations among lifehistory stages is related to maximal air temperature, with the frequency of PGI- 4 increasing after the hottest part of summer. To identify mechanisms that may cause shifts in PGI allele frequency, we measured metabolic rate and fecundity for beetles collected at BC. Metabolic rate of males and females was measured at 20 _ and 36 _C using flow-through respirometry. To measure laboratory fecundity, mating pairs were acclimated for 4 h each afternoon at a control temperature (20 _C) or at mildly elevated temperatures (26 _ or 32 _C) and number of eggs laid was counted daily for 24 d, after which tissue levels of 70 -kD heat shock proteins (Hsp 70) were determined. Previous studies had demonstrated differences in Hsp 70 expression among PGI genotypes at these temperatures. To measure field fecundity, mating pairs from BC were transplanted to similar elevations in BPC, BC, and RC and were monitored in situ for 24 d. Metabolic rate was higher for PGI 4 - 4 genotypes than for PGI 1 - 4 or PGI 1 - 1 individuals at 36 _C but not at 20 _C. In contrast, laboratory fecundity was greatest for females possessing PGI- 1, independent of acclimation temperature. At the end of the laboratory fecundity experiment, Hsp 70 expression was positively related to fecundity, suggesting minimal reproductive cost of upregulation of heat shock proteins in response to mild heat stress. In the field, fecundity was highest for PGI 1 - 1 and PGI 1 - 4 individuals in RC and PGI 4 - 4 individuals in BPC and was similar for all genotypes in BC. Thus, fecundity in nature was greatest for the genotypes that were most common in each area. Taken together, data reported here suggest that hot, dry summers in the Sierra Nevada may result in an increase in frequency of the PGI- 4 allele and shifts to higher elevations for C. aeneicollis populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{natural enemies}} attacking eggs (and young larvae) of the <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> Phratora vulgatissima were {{identified}} in the field. Three heteropterans were common natural enemies. The mirid Orthotylus marginalis was the most abundant and had an intermediate consumption rate in the lab, whereas the mirid Closterotomus fulvomaculatus was the least abundant but had the high-est consumption rate. The anthocorid Anthocoris nemorum was intermediate in abundance but had the lowest consumption rate. However, the experimental situation (in petridish or on shoot) affected the ranking of the predators and illustrates behavioral differences. The anthocorid was very mobile and could be characterized as a “run and eat ” predator, whereas the mirids were less mobile and behaved to a “find and stay ” principle. Possible consequences of interspecific variation in behavior, from a biological control perspective, are discussed.

40|$|Aggregation {{behavior}} of herbivorous insects is mediated {{by a wide}} range of biotic and abiotic factors. It has been suggested that aggregation {{behavior of}} the blue <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> Phratora vulgatissima is mediated by both host plant odor and by odor released by the beetles. Previous studies show that the beetles respond to plant odors according to their prior host plant experiences. Here, we analyzed the effect of the host plant species on odor released and perceived by adult P.  vulgatissima. The major difference between the odor of beetles feeding on salicin-rich and salicin-poor host plants was the presence of salicylaldehyde in the odor of the former, where both males and females released this compound. Electrophysiological studies showed that the intensity of responses to single components of odor released by beetles was sex specific and dependent on the host plant species with which the beetles were fed. Finally, behavioral studies revealed that males feeding on salicin-rich willows were attracted by salicylaldehyde, whereas females did not respond behaviorally to this compound, despite showin...|$|R
40|$|Rising {{fossil fuel}} prices, energy {{security}} and adherence to existing European Union (EU) climate/energy policies means that Ireland must look towards {{alternative energy sources}} to meet future demand. Woody biomass {{in the form of}} short rotation coppice willow (SRCW) is considered a viable option. SRCW is vulnerable to damage by a range of diseases and pests however. The blue (Phratora vulgatissima) and brown (Galerucella lineola) <b>willow</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) are identified economically as two of the most damaging insect pests of SRCW in Ireland. Policies which mandate levels of renewable energy use, to mitigate future climate change, fail to consider adaptation in the energy sector under increased levels of pestilence due to projected changes in the climate system. The effects of abiotic and biotic factors, mainly temperature and photoperiod, but also host plant, on beetle development were investigated. Constant temperature experiments showed that development time for all assessed life-cycle stages decreased as temperature increased. P. vulgatissima oviposition period and total fecundity were influenced by temperature also. Development was not found to vary considerably when P. vulgatissima larvae were reared on different host plant varieties (Tora, Resolution, Tordis and Inger) across a similar range of constant temperatures. A critical daylength (CDL) for P. vulgatissima facultative reproduction was calculated. The relationship between temperature and P. vulgatissima and G. lineola life-cycle stage development was represented by applying criteria satisfying non-linear deterministic and stochastic functions to development rates and development time distributions respectively. A combined phenology/voltinism model was constructed incorporating a Salix. viminalis degree-day budburst model, the temperature-dependent development rate and temperature-independent time distribution functions, and information regarding the reproductive diapause inducing CDL. Using observed temperature and statistically downscaled climate scenarios derived from different global climate models (GCMs) forced with different emission scenarios, model results suggested important spatio-temporal changes in the life cycle and voltinism of P. vulgatissima, including two annual generations for 5 % and 50 % beetle emergence proportions (E. P) at all observed locations nationally by the 2050 s and three annual generations for 5 % E. P for a percentage of years at certain inland and south-westerly observed locations by the 2080 s. The findings from this research may have implications for regional SRCW production, integrated pest and crop management and climate and energy policy in the future...|$|R
40|$|The Palaearctic leaf beetle Chrysomela lapponica usually feeds upon willows in the {{northern}} region of its occurrence. However, in Central Europe, some populations are known that have specialised on birch. In this study, we investigated the significance of other herbivores occurring together on the same host plants as possible exploitative competitors of C. lapponica. Two populations were studied: a population from Finland specialised on the willow Salix borealis, and a population from the Czech Republic, specialised on the birch Betula pubescens. Abundances of folivorous and suctivorous insects on both host plants were recorded at both population sites. The <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> Phratora vitellinae was the most abundant herbivorous insect at both study sites on willow. A field {{study was conducted to}} examine the effects of P. vitellinae on the performance of C. lapponica. The presence of P. vitellinae larvae on the same twig upon which C. lapponica larvae were feeding did not affect increase of body weight in C. lapponica larvae. Thus, the high resource availability of both willows and birches suggest that interspecific competition is unlikely to be a selection factor driving the evolution of host shift in C. lapponica...|$|R
40|$|Published by the Indian Academy of SciencesThe {{heat shock}} {{response}} {{is a critical}} mechanism by which organisms buffer effects of variable and unpredictable environmental temperatures. Upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) increases survival after exposure to stressful conditions in nature, although benefi ts of Hsp expression are often balanced by costs to growth and reproductive success. Hsp-assisted folding of variant polypeptides may prevent development of unfi t phenotypes; thus, some differences in Hsp expression among natural populations of ectotherms {{may be due to}} interactions between enzyme variants (allozymes) and Hsps. In the Sierra <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> Chrysomela aeneicollis, which lives in highly variable thermal habitats at the southern edge of their range in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, California, allele frequencies at the enzyme locus phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) vary across a climatic latitudinal gradient. PGI allozymes differ in kinetic properties, and expression of a 70 kDa Hsp differs between populations, along elevation gradients, and among PGI genotypes. Differences in Hsp 70 expression among PGI genotypes correspond to differences in thermal tolerance and traits important for reproductive success, such as running speed, survival and fecundity. Thus, differential Hsp expression among genotypes may allow functionally important genetic variation to persist, allowing populations to respond effectively to environmental chang...|$|R
40|$|Gregarious organisms need {{to handle}} the {{trade-off}} between increasing food competition and {{the positive effects of}} group living, and this is particularly important for ovipositing females. We hypothesized that insect females consider how many conspecifics previously visited a host plant. In a no-choice assay, we show that the gregarious blue <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> (Phratora vulgatissima) laid the most eggs and the largest clutches on plants where a sequence of few individual females was released, compared to plants where one or many different females were repeatedly released. Therefore, this species is more sensitive to the indirectly perceived number of conspecifics than the directly perceived number of eggs on a plant. We further hypothesized that females adjust their own intra-plant egg clutch distribution to that of conspecifics and discovered a new behavioral component, i. e., the modulation of distances between clutches. Females adjusted these distances in ways indicating the use of spatial memory, because the largest distance increases were observed on plants with their own clutches, compared to plants with clutches from conspecifics. However, adjustment of aggregation level and distance between clutches occurred only on a suitable, and not on an unsuitable, Salix genotype. We conclude that both behaviors should reduce competition between sibling and non-sibling larvae...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} soil {{moisture}} on the pupation {{behavior of a}} <b>willow</b> flea <b>beetle,</b> Attica subplicata, were studied with two laboratory experiments. To test the effect of soil moisture {{on the number of}} larvae pupating and pupal survival, we set up pupation chambers filled with sand with three different soil moistures: dry, moist, and wet. The number of larvae pupating was much greater in the moist sand and wet sand treatments than in the dry sand treatment. Pupal survival, as measured by the proportion of adults successfully emerging, was greater in the moist treatment than in the wet or dry treatments. Thus, overall pupation success (number of adults successfully emerging) was greater in the moist treatment than in the wet treatment and greater in the wet treatment than in the dry treatment. To examine the effect of soil moisture on choice of pupation site, we provided the larvae with a choice of two soil moistures in each pupation chamber. More larvae chose wet over dry conditions and more chose moist over dry conditions, but larvae did not discriminate between moist and wet conditions. The improved pupation in areas with higher soil moisture is consistent with the field distribution pattern of greater beetle densities on dunes with greater soil moisture...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} and realized niches of phytophagous insects constitute an important topic in contemporary ecology. Hutchinson (1965) formulized {{the concept of}} the {{fundamental and}} realized niche with regards to species responses to interspecific competition; and for the herbivore insects’ community the consequence of interspecific competition is a debatable and questionable from the very beginning to till now. This study investigated the fundamental and the realized niche of two <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetles,</b> Galerucella lineola and Phratora vulgatissima, on two different Salix host species, S. viminalis and S. dasyclados; and how plant species affect the fundamental and realized niches of these beetle species. To achieve the objective of this study, I focused on the egg-laying preference and placement of Phratora and Galerucella eggs in monospecific and mixed conditions. The results indicate that the fundamental niches of both beetle species are dissimilar to each other and that plant species affect their fundamental niches. The two leaf beetles affect each other’s realized niche. One mechanism behind the results may be that the beetles induce changes in their shared host plants, leading to indirect interactions between the two beetles. Females could adjust their egg-laying behavior to different host plant species {{as well as to the}} presence of the opposite beetle species while ovipositing...|$|R
40|$|Signal-based induced {{indirect}} defence {{refers to}} herbivore-induced production of plant volatiles that attract carnivorous natural enemies of herbivores. Relationships between {{direct and indirect}} defence strategies were studied using tritrophic systems consisting of six sympatric willow species, <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetles</b> (Plagiodera versicolora), and their natural predators, ladybeetles (Aiolocaria hexaspilota). Relative preferences of ladybeetles for prey-infested willow plant volatiles, indicating levels of signal-based induced indirect defence, were positively correlated with the vulnerability of willow species to leaf beetles, assigned as relative levels of direct defence. This correlation suggested a possible trade-off among the species, in terms of resource limitation between direct defence and signal-based induced indirect defence. However, analyses of volatiles from infested and uninfested plants showed that the specificity of infested volatile blends (an important factor determining the costs of signal-based induced indirect defence) {{did not affect the}} attractiveness of infested plant volatiles. Thus, the suggested trade-off in resource limitation was unlikely. Rather, principal coordinates analysis showed that this 'apparent trade-off' between direct and signal-based induced indirect defence was partially explained by differential preferences of ladybeetles to infested plant volatiles of the six willow species. We also showed that relative preferences of ladybeetles for prey-infested willow plant volatiles were positively correlated with oviposition preferences of leaf beetles and with the distributions of leaf beetles in the field. These correlations suggest that ladybeetles use the specificity of infested willow plant volatiles to find suitable prey patches...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{anticipated}} that extreme population events, such as extinctions and outbreaks, {{will become more}} frequent {{as a consequence of}} climate change. To evaluate the increased probability of such events, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms involved. Variation between individuals in their response to climatic factors is an important consideration, especially if microevolution is expected to change the composition of populations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we present data of a <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> species, showing high variation among individuals in oviposition rate at a high temperature (20 °C). It is particularly noteworthy that not all individuals responded to changes in temperature; individuals laying few eggs at 20 °C continued to do so when transferred to 12 °C, whereas individuals that laid many eggs at 20 °C reduced their oviposition and laid the same number of eggs as the others when transferred to 12 °C. When transferred back to 20 °C most individuals reverted to their original oviposition rate. Thus, high variation among individuals was only observed at the higher temperature. Using a simple population model and based on regional climate change scenarios we show that the probability of outbreaks increases if there is a realistic {{increase in the number of}} warm summers. The probability of outbreaks also increased with increasing heritability of the ability to respond to increased temperature. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: If climate becomes warmer and there is latent variation among individuals in their temperature response, the probability for outbreaks may increase. However, the likelihood for microevolution to play a role may be low. This conclusion is based on the fact that it has been difficult to show that microevolution affect the probability for extinctions. Our results highlight the urge for cautiousness when predicting the future concerning probabilities for extreme population events...|$|R

Since many animals spend a part of their life living in a group, the mechanisms involved in maintaining aggregations have been of interest to behavioral ecologists. The mechanisms of aggregation in vertebrates and social insects have been well studied; however, the mechanisms used by nonsocial insect larvae are poorly understood. Here I examine the roles that leaf quality, the presence of siblings, trails, vision, and touch play in reaggregation by imported <b>willow</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> larvae, Plagiodera versicolora (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). This study shows that larvae respond positively to the presence of siblings their secretions, and feces while reaggregating. Larvae do not have to see or touch siblings in order for reaggregation to occur and leaf quality {{does not appear to be}} involved in reaggregation. There were differences in behavior of four-day-old and eight-day-old larvae. Four-day-old larvae responded positively to the presence of siblings while eight-day-old larvae did not. Under natural conditions four-day-old larvae are found in aggregations while eight-day-old larvae are solitary. This is the first study to demonstrate that the change from being found in aggregations to becoming solitary is a result of behavioral changes in larvae. A second experiment was conducted to test for seasonal (brood) and group size effects on larval fitness. For each of the three broods, egg group sizes of 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 were established in the field and monitored for the first six days post-hatching. There was no effect of group size on larval weight, but there was a significant effect of group size on survival. Individuals from group size of 16 had the highest survival, which coincides with the mean natural cluster size of 15. 3 eggs. There were no significant interactions between brood and group size. The effect of larval weight on adult fitness was determined in the laboratory and the field. Larval weight was correlated with egg production in the laboratory but not in the field...|$|R
