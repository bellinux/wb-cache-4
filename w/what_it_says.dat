25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E
25|$|April 10, 2001: Pro-Moscow Grozny mayor Beslan Gantamirov {{announced}} that 17 bodies with gunshot wounds {{had been discovered}} {{in the basement of}} a bombed-out dormitory next to Oktyabrskoye city district police station, manned by the OMON special police troops from Siberia's Khanty-Mansiysk. The next day Gantamirov {{announced that}} his report was false and there were no bodies found. When explaining his change of heart, Gantamirov said that he learned of the discovery from the same source as the Russian envoy to the region Viktor Kazantsev, who also first confirmed the find, but later denied it. The OMON officer in charge of the station claimed the unit had nothing to do with the disappearance of local residents, adding that mass graves in Chechnya are commonplace. In March 2005, one of the unit's officers, Sergey Lapin, was convicted for the torture of a Chechen man who remains missing. In June 2006, Memorial produced <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> is documentary evidence of a secret torture center {{in the basement of a}} former school for deaf children in the Oktyabrsokye district of Grozny, which the Russian police allegedly used to hold, torture and murder hundreds of people.

500|$|He {{returned}} into non-League football {{after he}} signed for Conference National club Rushden & Diamonds in June 2006 on a two-year contract. He joined Torquay United of League Two on loan in September 2006 as {{cover for the}} injured Mickey Evans, but was recalled by Rushden due to an injury crisis in early November 2006. He had made five appearances for Torquay. Days later, he signed for another League Two club, Shrewsbury Town, originally on a two-month loan deal. His Shrewsbury debut came as a 60th-minute substitute in a 2–0 away defeat to Milton Keynes Dons on 18 November 2006, after hoping {{he would be able}} to play in the FA Cup tie against Hereford United. The loan was extended to the end of 2006–07 in January 2007. Following Shrewsbury's 2–0 home win over Notts County in February 2007, manager Gary Peters referred to Fortune-West as 'Ronseal', as he does [...] "exactly <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> on the tin". His final appearance for Shrewsbury came in the 2007 League Two play-off Final against Bristol Rovers at Wembley Stadium on 26 May 2007, coming on as a substitute in the 80th-minute, as Shrewsbury lost 3–1. With the season over, Fortune-West returned to his parent club Rushden, who he left by mutual consent in August 2007.|$|E
500|$|... "Bounce" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Eric Diep of XXL praised Azalea's [...] "rapid-fire rhymes" [...] {{and said the}} track [...] "will certainly burn up the dance floor". Lucy O'Brien of The Quietus called the song [...] "irrepressible". AllMusic's David Jeffries opined that [...] "Bounce" [...] was [...] "simple and infectious", and [...] "does just <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> on the tin". Jeffries' view was shared by Mark Beaumont of NME who also deemed the song [...] "infectious", and Matt Jost of RapReviews.com who called it [...] "simply fun". Rory Cashin of Entertainment.ie described its production as [...] "overwhelmingly busy in a good way". In a State publication, Cashin deemed it a [...] "warped earworm" [...] and a [...] "belter". Rap-Up hailed it as Azalea's [...] "new anthem", and felt it was timed for the summer to [...] " [...] up the dancefloor". Similarly, Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly opined that the song was [...] "thumping" [...] and [...] "a thoroughbred entry in the song-of-summer race", while Juliana June Rasul of The Straits Times said it was [...] "a perfect summer pop song". In a publication for The Atlantic, Nolan Feeney highlighted it as a [...] "colorful butt-shaker". Idolator's Sam Lansky called the track a [...] "twerk anthem" [...] and considered it to be Azalea's most impressive and most commercial single.|$|E
500|$|Before Pepper, it was {{impossible}} to use Parliamentary discussions as evidence in court cases; William Blackstone wrote in the 18th century that to allow judicial review of [...] "unreasonable" [...] legislation was to [...] "set the judicial power above that of the legislature, which would be subversive of all government". Historically, the courts had been more lenient; while this suggestion first appears in the 14th century, with the intention that legislation was best interpreted by those who had written it, the principle was not strongly followed. In the 1678 case of Ash v Abdy, Lord Nottingham chose to refer to the parliamentary history of the Statute of Frauds, and in Millar v Taylor, in 1769, the first case to explicitly state this principle (as [...] "The sense and meaning of an Act of Parliament must be collected from <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> when passed into law, and not from the history of changes it underwent in the House where it took its rise"), the court chose to depart from it. The principle was most used during the 19th and 20th centuries, with a noted example being Beswick v Beswick, where Lord Reid maintained that it would be inconvenient and expensive for lawyers to have to refer to Hansard when preparing cases. Both the English and Scottish Law Commissions agreed with the rule in their 1969 Report on the Interpretation of Statutes.|$|E

500|$|The Crows' {{insistence that}} reading is useless, even {{dangerous}} for Scarecrow because it only leads to discontentment takes on an especially haunting {{reminder of the}} ways in which the residues of slavery continue to injure contemporary African Americans. The Crows reinforce Scarecrow's subjection at their hands through a song whose refrain [...] "you can't win child, you can't get out of the game" [...] that aims to disabuse Scarecrow of any aspirations toward freedom... Their insistence that [...] "reading is stupid" [...] suggests that a Eurocentric education does not promise liberation from [...] "the game" [...] that race and racism create... The Crow's dismissal of education and western thought fails because they do not offer Scarecrow an alternative that will emancipate him. The Crow's attempt to discipline Scarecrow by displacing his hope with nihilism. For The Crow's so-called book of knowledge is less valuable than what they perceive to be real knowledge-street smarts. Though they are not tethered to a pole, they are seemingly unable or as their commandments and anthem suggests, unwilling to find opportunities than their present location provides. The Crow's chorus to Scarecrow's song is revealing for <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> about their loss of hope... The Crow's are even more disadvantaged than Scarecrow because, unlike him, they are hopeless. The Crow's chorus, like The Crow Commandments, reflects their disillusionment with their inability to realize the promise of upward mobility.|$|E
500|$|The Huffington Post {{published}} {{a response from}} practising Muslim Afroze Zaidi-Jivraj, a graduate in English who had recently begun a masters degree student in theology at the University of Birmingham. She remarked that Holland's methodology was flawed because he had neglected to study the corpus of material on early Islamic history found in libraries across the Islamic world, instead using only sources he had obtained in Western libraries. She argued {{that he did not}} consult a single Islamic scholar of Islamic history, instead choosing the more [...] "exotic" [...] option of interviewing a Bedouin, and that although he had consulted Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr– [...] "a token Muslim voice"– Nasr was a scholar of Islamic philosophy and not Islamic history. Asserting that Islam: The Untold Story was based on poor scholarship by assuming the superiority of secular Western historical inquiry over Islamic historical traditions, she argued that it would promote negative views of [...] "an already poorly-understood faith and its much-maligned adherents." [...] Abdullah al-Andalusi of the Muslim Debate Initiative sums Islam: the Untold Story as [...] "a missed opportunity to transcend an outdated Besserwissen approach to comparative religion, and to establish an inter-faith dialogue based on insightful mutual understanding and acceptance of who we are today. While informed revisionist readings of the history of all faiths, Islam included, is to be encouraged, Tom Holland’s TV show, an anti-Islamic polemic dressed up as history, does not do <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> on the tin.

[...] J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post praised the concert's fast pace and called it a [...] "pure pop spectacle" [...] further describing it as [...] "brilliant... fiery". He noted that the opening, was with a [...] "dramatic, over-the-top entrance about which every aspiring diva dreams", but however he was disappointed in the show's ending. He further wrote, [...] "Though Beyoncé owned the spotlight, this being her 'Experience' and all, her band co-starred in the show, playing hard and tight behind the singer and vamping expertly for sustained periods whenever Beyoncé left the stage to change." [...] The Daily Mail John Aizleman {{was impressed with the}} high energy Knowles showed during the performance, and lauded the dance choreography, particularly that of [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills". However, Aizleman criticized the appearance of a dancer dressed as an angel at the end of [...] "Flaws and All" [...] as being awkward, and wrote that that moment was reminiscent of a [...] "misguided school nativity play". He further added, [...] "Big, brave and bold, the Beyoncé Experience is how pop music would work if it were choreographed by Busby Berkeley... If anyone had the temerity to doubt Beyoncé's star quality and her place in the diva pantheon, they would doubt no more after last night." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote in her review that the tour title reminded her of a concert theme park rid and added [...] " [...] was an elaborate affair. It was part Vegas review, part hard-edged rock concert, part sweaty funk and soul revival, part diva concert hall performance, and almost all fun to watch as the singer threw herself into the various settings and costumes". Eamon Sweeney from the Irish Independent described Knowles' performance as [...] "the best pop show on the planet" [...] adding that the title of the tour [...] "does exactly <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> on the tin". David Schmeichel of Jam! wrote that the [...] "Splashy Beyonce 'experience' gives a lesson in diva-hood for pop princesses everywhere", further praising her [...] "goddess" [...] like entrance, vocals and performance which he desrcibed as [...] "tightly scripted as her film forays". Ashante Infantry of the Toronto Star noted that the concerts served as a testament to Knowles' talent and power and compared her with [...] Prince for the versatility and musicianship and Tina Turner for the sass and sheer power. Herald Sun Cameron Adams also compared Knowles' performing ability to that of Prince, and stated, [...] "Beyoncé is an old-fashioned, all- round entertainer." [...] Jim Harrington writing for San Jose Mercury News graded the tour as an A-plus affair. A writer of The StarPhoenix praised the show, writing that Knowles [...] "set the stage on fire" [...] for two hours. The writer also added that she had [...] "an honest, God-given talent she's not afraid to share. Her songs, ranging from sultry to soulful were performed with all her heart... With a clear passion for showmanship and a voice not easily matched, Beyonce simply bypassed the mediocrity of most concerts and took her performance to another level." [...] Arielle Castillo of Miami New Times heavily praised Knowles' performance, writing that [...] "B performed like her life depended on it; fresh to death choreography, flawless vocals, crazysexy wardrobe and her trademark lioness mane all in A+ form... Beyonce gave the crowd all that they expected, and multiplied that by 1000." [...] She concluded her review by writing that the concert was reminiscent of a Las Vegas show due to the elaborate costumes, sets, and [...] "over-the-topness of the whole thing" [...] further praising Knowles for acting, dancing and singing on stage.|$|E
