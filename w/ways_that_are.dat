Shaolin spear, Yezhan spear, Lanmen spear, and sword and stick exercises may be included. T'ai chi ch'uan also incorporates sword practise in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the public}} take part in Parliament in two <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not the case at Westminster: a public petitioning system, and cross-party groups on policy topics which the {{interested}} public join and attend meetings of, alongside MSPs. The Parliament is able to debate any issue (including those reserved to Westminster) but is unable to make laws on issues that are outside its legislative competence.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ways</b> <b>That</b> <b>Are</b> Dark {{is based}} on its author's {{experience}} of living in China {{for more than one}} year. Townsend had worked as a journalist and educator in New York before joining the United States Foreign Service on 16 December 1930. He served as a vice-consul in Shanghai between 10 December 1931 and 9 January 1932 and then in Fuzhou until 1 March 1933. The book was released on 10 November 1933 by G. P. Putnam's Sons.|$|E
5|$|The Barnes Review edition was {{subsequently}} translated into Japanese in 2004 {{by a pair}} of Japanese translators, Hideo Tanaka and Kenkichi Sakita, and became an instant success, selling out 10 successive re-printings before 2007 when it was reissued as a mass market paperback. Gregory Clark noted that the Japanese edition of <b>Ways</b> <b>That</b> <b>Are</b> Dark, which was entitled Ankoku Tairiku Chūgoku no Shinjitsu ("The Truth About the Dark Continent China"), had garnered widespread popularity among members of the Japanese right-wing.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E

25|$|Statistics {{can be used}} to predicatively create art, as in the {{statistical}} or stochastic music invented by Iannis Xenakis, where the music is performance-specific.

25|$|According to the {{researchers}} and scientists, 74% of the world's poultry meat, and 68 percent of eggs are produced in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> described as 'intensive'. One alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming using lower stocking densities. Poultry producers routinely use nationally approved medications, such as antibiotics, in feed or drinking water, to treat disease or to prevent disease outbreaks. Some FDA-approved medications are also approved for improved feed utilization.|$|E
25|$|Thought is {{a mental}} act that allows humans {{to make sense}} of things in the world, and to {{represent}} and interpret them in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> significant, or which accord with their needs, attachments, goals, commitments, plans, ends, desires, etc. Thinking involves the symbolic or semiotic mediation of ideas or data, as when we form concepts, engage in problem solving, reasoning, and making decisions. Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include deliberation, cognition, ideation, discourse and imagination.|$|E
25|$|Roman Catholic Marian art has {{expressed}} {{a wide range}} of theological topics that relate to Mary, often in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> far from obvious, and whose meaning can only be recovered by detailed scholarly analysis. Entire books, academic theses or lengthy scholarly works have been written on various aspects of Marian art in general and on specific topics such as the Black Madonna, Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos, Virgin of Mercy, Virgin of Ocotlán, or the Hortus conclusus and their doctrinal implications.|$|E

25|$|Historical examples, {{such as the}} {{hookworm}} {{campaigns in}} Mississippi and Florida from 1943 to 1947 {{have shown that the}} primary cause of hookworm infection is poor sanitation, which can be solved by building and maintaining toilets. But while these may seem like simple tasks, they raise important public health challenges. Most infected populations are from poverty-stricken areas with very poor sanitation. Thus, it is most likely that at-risk children {{do not have access to}} clean water to wash their hands and live in environments with no proper sanitation infrastructure. Health education, therefore, must address preventive measures in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> both feasible and sustainable in the context of resource-limited settings.|$|E
25|$|Although the Department {{recognizes that}} amparos are an {{integral}} aspect of Mexican law designed to protect individuals’ legal rights, the USCA is concerned that amparo appeals are being used excessively in Convention return cases, and that Mexico is allowing taking parents to use the amparo process to delay cases and influence the final outcome in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{not consistent with the}} principles of the Convention. The Department is encouraged by a recent decision by a Mexican federal judge, which overcame an amparo allowing a child to immediately return to the United States, and hopes this precedent will continue. By streamlining the amparo process in Convention cases, the Government of Mexico could better meet its treaty obligations.|$|E
25|$|Abstraction {{indicates}} {{a departure from}} reality in depiction of imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree {{can be said to}} be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is likely to be exceedingly elusive. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In geometric abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. Figurative art and total abstraction are almost mutually exclusive. But figurative and representational (or realistic) art often contains partial abstraction.|$|E
