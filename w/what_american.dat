5|$|The screenplay, {{written by}} Pintilie, {{was based on}} the Petru Dumitriu's novel Cronică de familie ("Family Chronicle"), and in {{particular}} on its chapter Salata ("The Salad"), which is often described as a stand-alone novella. Reportedly, the director wished to use Salata as the film's title, but the name was imposed on him during production. An Unforgettable Summer differs from the original story by adding an English education to Marie-Thérèse Von Debretsy's background, in <b>what</b> <b>American</b> film critic John Simon indicates is intended to explain the Oxford accent Scott Thomas uses in her Romanian-language lines, and to allow the actress to express herself in English during several scenes.|$|E
5|$|Einsatzgruppe B, C, and D did not {{immediately}} follow Einsatzgruppe A's example in systematically killing all Jews in their areas. The Einsatzgruppe commanders, {{with the exception of}} Einsatzgruppe A's Stahlecker, were of the opinion by the fall of 1941 {{that it was impossible to}} kill the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the killings should stop. An Einsatzgruppe report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them. Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west. Thus, an interval passed between the first round of Einsatzgruppen massacres in summer and fall, and <b>what</b> <b>American</b> historian Raul Hilberg called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942. During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.|$|E

25|$|As {{a student}} at the University of Texas School of Law in 1981, Garner began noticing odd usages in lawbooks—many of them dating back to Shakespeare. These became the source {{material}} for his first book, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage. That book was published by Oxford University Press in 1987 and is now in its third edition (published in 2011 and retitled Garner's Dictionary of Legal Usage). Since 1990, his main work has been teaching seminars such as Advanced Legal Writing and Editing, Advanced Legal Drafting, and The Winning Brief. Garner has also created many online seminars on writing and advocacy. Since 2006, Garner has interspersed in his lectures numerous video clips from the dozens of judges he has interviewed on the art of writing and on advocacy. In 2006–2007, he interviewed eight of the nine Justices of the United States Supreme Court. Since then, he has interviewed a ninth: Justice Elena Kagan. All his Supreme Court interviews are available online. When these interviews first appeared in print, they were featured {{on the front page of}} the New York Times. In addition, Garner has interviewed circuit judges on all the federal circuits. He has compiled an extensive archive of <b>what</b> <b>American</b> judges in the early 21st century say about effective writing and advocacy.|$|E

[...] In the opening scenes, Romanian authorities are shown to be frantically engaged in shutting down a brothel, whose presence they believe would embarrass local high society at a time when a grand ball is set to take place. This scandalized prostitutes include the Hungarian Erzsi, who is also a communist sympathizer, and who irritates the officials by shouting out insults and mooning them through a window. During the latter scene, John Simon notes, Land Forces officers are shown staring up [...] "in mixed horror and admiration at the familiar globe whose owner they promptly identify."

500|$|The {{negative}} {{initial reaction}} to Connotations {{has also been}} {{claimed to have been}} due to Bernstein's conducting.

His frequent programming of Copland's works during his tenure with the New York Philharmonic might, Adams suggests, have been partly in reaction against works of the twelve-tone school. Now he was confronted with <b>what</b> <b>American</b> composer John Adams terms a [...] "stridently dissonant, piss-n-vinegar" [...] work [...] "written in an idiom so alien to his own sensibilities," [...] the first performance of which he would not only conduct but would also be televised to a national audience.

500|$|As customary, {{the game}} {{began with the}} first of two rounds in which contestants {{answered}} questions to earn spins for the [...] "Big Board"; a correct buzz-in answer earned three spins, while a correct multiple-choice answer earned one spin.

500|$|The {{design for}} the $50 {{received}} contemporary criticism; some suggested {{that the presence of}} the dolphins on the octagonal coin implied that the canal had been constructed for cetacean convenience. A 1916 column in the American Journal of Numismatics contained the conclusion that [...] "the criticism often heard that 'there is nothing American about the coin except the inscription' is fully warranted." [...] Swiatek and Breen dismissed criticisms as [...] "numerous and mostly irrelevant, based on total misreading of the iconography. [...] with stupid claims that Pallas Athena meant nothing on a U.S. coin unless she could be identified with Liberty, and that Athena's owl would never mean anything to all of us". Vermeule deemed the $50 coins [...] "a tour de force, dated to be sure, but unusual enough in all respects to be worthy of <b>what</b> <b>American</b> numismatic art could achieve".

But as every oppressed teen in the right-wing orbit knows full well, they're not as garbled and simplistic as Armstrong's anthems insist." [...] Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic was the most critical professional reviewer of the album; he questioned the clarity of the lyrics by calling 21st Century Breakdown [...] "more conceptually vague/ridiculous than American Idiot", and {{he went on to say}} that it [...] "spirals out of control in its own heroic glory and never regains focus, thus ending with a product that Green Day couldn't afford to produce: an average record". Slant Magazine claims that [...] "...an uncanny sense of familiarity hangs over too much of the album. The melodies of several tracks suggest ghosts of older Green Day songs." [...] Kyle Ryan at The A.V. Club gave the album a B+, noting it as [...] "going [...] bolder" [...] than American Idiot.
