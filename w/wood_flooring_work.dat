40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to assess the suitability of multilayer wood flooring {{especially in terms of}} dimensional stability, which is the most important feature when combining flooring with underfloor heating. Part of the work is to describe the problems of floor heating {{from the perspective of the}} past and present point of view, mention types of flooring, including designs and flooring installations. The second part of the work is about issue of step layer suitable for underfloor heating, with a broader focus on wood materials, particularly engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring.</b> <b>Work</b> also includes measured values and processed to assess two three-layer flooring of different material composition. In conclusion of this work is indicated an assessment of available laminated wood flooring, which were examined in our test and also draft of new design flooring made of wood, which would improve the thermal effects of underfloor heating...|$|E
40|$|The United Automobile Workers International Union has {{established}} a system of epidemiologic triage to evaluate patterns of mortality among groups of union members. In response to worker concerns, the Union examined mortality at a metal stamping plant, using a method which linked pension records with the State of Michigan computerized death registry. The observed proportion of malignant neoplasms was nearly twice that expected (95 % Confidence Limits 1. 36, 2. 62). Two- to five-fold excess proportional mortality from cancer of the digestive organs, lung cancer, and leukemia accounted {{for most of the}} overall excess. Strong associations were found between lung and digestive organ cancer and employment as maintenance welders or millwrights in the plant (odds ratios greater than 10). High levels of six polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with mutagenic and carcinogenic properties were found during hot coal tar application to <b>wood</b> block <b>floors,</b> <b>work</b> conducted by the high-risk groups. These levels were substantially reduced following the purchase of new tar pots. The example demonstrates that epidemiologic tools can play a valuable role in occupational health decision making, but care must be taken to avoid mechanical reliance on quantitative testing and to acknowledge the important role of social and political value judgments in the establishment of responsible public policy...|$|R
40|$|Summary This research, {{based on}} the theory of market structure, is {{intended}} to discuss the market structure in Taiwan <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> industry. To decide the market structure, the market concentration ratio method was introduced. Also, the factors of the entry barriers that will affect the market structure on <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> industry was examined. As a result, {{there are two types}} of wood floorings, solid and laminated <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> in Taiwan market. The sales volume of solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> are 2 million 637 thousand square meters and laminated are 1 million 815 thousand square meters in 1997. The solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is mainly used in the residential area, and the laminated <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is mainly used in the public area. The characteristics of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> considered by consumer are stability, shallow color and no defective. The solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> two and three level of distribution channel are normally used. The laminated <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> three level of distribution channel are normally used. As for the market structure analysis, the laminated <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is identified as an oligopoly market. The market structure of solid <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is a competitive market. 摘 要 本研究主要目的在於以市場的背景現況及市場結構理論，來探 討臺灣木質地板的市場結構形態。研究中透過實地調查瞭解市場的 現況，並以市場集中度衡量臺灣木質地板市場結構，同時以市場進 入障礙來檢視國內木質地板市場結構之變化。經由調查得知，臺灣 木質地板市場主要分為實木地板與銘木地板兩類。目前木質地板 1997 年的銷售量，實木地板約為 81 萬坪，銘木地板約為 55 萬坪。以使 用場所而言，實木地板多用於一般家庭，而銘木地板多用於公共場 所。而在材種選擇的偏好上，消費者主要以材質穩定性、材面色淺 均勻無缺點為選擇重點。在配銷通路上，實木地板為二階與三階的 通路，而銘木地板為三階的通路。另外以市場結構分析臺灣木銘木 地板市場為大型製造商所形成之寡占市場，具高規模經濟性，因此 有高的進入障礙，而獲利性高，不過風險比較大；實木地板市場為 小型經銷商組成之競爭性市場，市場進入障礙低，產品差異性亦低， 因此獲利性也較低，但風險則相對較穩定...|$|R

Solid {{hardwood floors}} were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams of a building known as joists or bearers.

30|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the visual evaluations of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring.</b> The selected 12 species of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> were simulated by computer and combined with the 6 sets of visual image adjectives to design a questionnaire and survey the visual evaluations of consumers. Triangular fuzzy number of fuzzy theory was employed to obtain the scores of the 12 species of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> in the 6 visual image evaluations.

Furthermore, six groups with relative overall visual images were induced from the comparison of <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> by qualitative classification. For example, the overall visual images of Quercus rubra, Acer saccharum and Quercus alba were similar, and they were more “Elegant and Soft”,“durable and practical”,“close and comfortable”, and “tender and amiable”.

40|$|High-density wood is {{required}} in <b>wood</b> <b>flooring,</b> especially in engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> (EWF) designed for heavy-duty applications. However, high-density wood resources are limited and their cost is high. A densification treatment {{makes it possible for}} low- or moderate-density woods to replace harder species by modifying them into high-performance and high-value products, such as engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> for heavy-duty applications. The general objective {{of this study was to}} develop a prototype of engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> using sugar maple hygro-thermally densified surface layers. The results showed that thin sugar maple lumber densified at 200 °C under the combined effects of steam, heat, and pressure with a heat-resistant fabric had great potential for the manufacturing of engineered <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> for heavy-duty use. As a result of treatment, it acquired high density, improved mechanical properties, and it had a relatively high dimensional stability and an attractive color. Tests in conditioning rooms showed that the EWF with a densified sugar maple (Acer saccharum March.) surface layer presented the lowest amplitude distortion between the dry and humid conditions compared with the standard EWF (0. 15 mm vs. 0. 17 mm and 0. 25 mm) ...|$|R

It is thus obvious that <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> is the majority in terms of wood used in the living environment. According to Ren et al. [4], manufacturers consider that the colors and prices of flooring and the recommendations of relatives and friends are critical factors when consumers choose and purchase <b>wood</b> <b>flooring.</b> The dark-color floors and light-color floors are equivalently popular in Taiwan. In addition, the questionnaire survey result of Lin et al. [2] showed that Taiwanese prefer dark-color <b>wood</b> <b>flooring</b> probably because light-color flooring tends to more easily be eaten by moths and damped, and it tends to rise reversely after being used for 10 – 20  years. It is thus replaced by dark-color flooring.|$|R
