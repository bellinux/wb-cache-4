40|$|DE 19833159 A UPAB: 20000323 NOVELTY - The bar tube (12) and {{tube support}} (14) are {{manufactured}} in one piece, {{and the bar}} support accommodates with no clearance a bearing bush (40) which consists of a set-free material and is pressed into tube support with interference. The bearing bush has a circumferential toothing extending in the axial direction. A bush of sintered material or plastic may be pressed into the bearing bush, and a coating of plastic may be injected into the bearing bush. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a procedure for the manufactured of a tubular bar in which the tube support manufactured closed by an internal high pressure process is centrally slotted on the end face sides and the resulting lobes bent over inwards at least on one side. USE - The tubular bar is {{for the support of}} a windscreen <b>wiper</b> <b>drive</b> on a motor vehicle. ADVANTAGE - The bearing bush and tube support deform in an elastic range {{to such a degree that}} during the whole service life a clearance-free frictional connection is maintained...|$|E

50|$|Early <b>wipers</b> {{were often}} <b>driven</b> by a vacuum motor powered by {{manifold}} vacuum. This had the drawback that manifold vacuum {{varies depending on}} throttle position, and is almost non-existent under wide-open throttle, when the wipers would slow down or even stop. This problem was overcome somewhat by using a combined fuel/vacuum booster pump.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{innovation}} of DC motors with permanent magnets used in automotive technology to <b>drive</b> <b>wiper</b> mechanism to reduce the volume and weight of the active materials. Potential innovations is mainly using magnets of the magnetic rare earths, such as Neodym or samarium-cobalt. Another option {{is to reduce the}} rotor to decreases the number of threads (here, it's all about, what are the requirements for performance). The result is an innovative motor, wherein the volume of the permanent magnets is reduced by 65 % and total volume of the motor by 23 % while maintaining the rotor parts. Also slightly raised performance with Neodymium permanent magnets...|$|R
5000|$|The Ford Sidevalve is a {{side valve}} (flathead engine) from the British {{arm of the}} Ford Motor Company. The engine had its origins in the 1930s Ford Model Y, and were made in two sizes, 933cc or [...] "8 HP", and 1172cc or [...] "10 HP". The early engines were very basic {{and did not have}} a {{waterpump}} as standard relying on thermo-siphon effect to cool, as the Model T's engine had. A water pump was added in 1953 for the 100E models. The Sidevalve engine was used in many smaller Fords as well as farm vehicles, commercial vehicles and a marine version in boats. Production of the engine was stopped in 1962. Windscreen <b>wipers</b> were often <b>driven</b> by the vacuum generated in the inlet manifold.|$|R
40|$|The work {{deals with}} the methods of {{measurement}} of small DC motors, especially motors used for <b>drives</b> <b>wiper’s</b> mechanisms. Furthermore, describing the internal structure and function of wiper’s engines. Measurement of these engines is carried out mainly dynamometers which is described in more details in the work. However, measuring systems consist {{not only from the}} dynamometer but also many other components such as controllers, software for testing engines, various stands, temperature and speed testers, and many others. These components are taken into account, when selecting the most suitable measuring system. There are also various systems analyzed and compared in terms of both technical and economic parameters, but also in terms of measurement options, such as immediate viewing characteristics on a PC monitor of the system assembly, the possibility of measuring the friction torque, efficiency, heating, etc. In conclusion, there is a recommendation of measuring system which I chose as the best option according to its parameters...|$|R
5000|$|Nissan's Santana {{was changed}} for Japan with a right hand <b>drive</b> <b>wiper</b> layout (parking on the {{passenger}} side) which, {{as well as a}} new linkage mechanism, also required a new bonnet pressing as there were recesses in the trailing edge for the wiper pivots. VW-built cars, in common with some of the maker's other models at this time, such as the MKII Golf, had the same LHD wiper pattern regardless of steering wheel location. At introduction, the Nissan Santana was available with three different engines: A [...] 1781 cc four (Li, Gi), a [...] 1,994 cc five (Gi5, Xi5) and a [...] 1,588 cc turbodiesel four (Lt, Gt Diesel Turbo). All came with a five-speed manual transmission as standard, while the gasoline engines were also available with a three-speed automatic. The Nissan Santana was 5 mm narrower than its German counterparts, so as to avoid a massive Japanese tax on cars wider than 1690 mm. Additionally, the grille and headlights were unique to the M30 Santana.|$|R

Because of the extreme squareness of the bodystyle, NASCAR teams were forced to rely on the previous years (1974) sheetmetal for race-spec cars. In order for Dodge to be represented, NASCAR allowed the 1974 sheetmetal to be used until January 1978, when the new Dodge Magnum was ready for race use. In 1976 a Dodge Charger was one of two NASCAR stock cars to compete in the 24hrs at LeMans, having been modified with head-lamps, tail-lamps and windshield <b>wipers.</b> It was <b>driven</b> by Herschel and Doug McGriff and sponsored by Olympia Beer, earning the nickname [...] "Oly Express".|$|R

5000|$|In 1949, John Haven Emerson {{developed}} a mechanical assister for anesthesia {{with the cooperation}} of the anesthesia department at Harvard University. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of muscle relaxants during anesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyze the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon, but also paralyze the respiratory musclesIn the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples, the latter using an automotive <b>wiper</b> motor to <b>drive</b> the bellows used to inflate the lungs. [...] Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anesthetics such as ether and cyclopropane. In 1952, Roger Manley of the Westminster Hospital, London, {{developed a}} ventilator which was entirely gas driven, and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power, and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, who manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.|$|R
