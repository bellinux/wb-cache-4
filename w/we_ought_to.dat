5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E
5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

25|$|In three short papers {{published}} in the early sixties, Feyerabend sought to defend materialism against the supposition that the mind cannot be a physical thing.

25|$|Whereas Singer is {{primarily}} concerned with improving the treatment of animals and accepts that, in some hypothetical scenarios, individual animals might be used legitimately to further human or nonhuman ends, Regan believes <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> treat nonhuman animals as we would humans.

Singer is not a rights theorist, but uses the language of rights to discuss how <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> treat individuals. He is a preference utilitarian, meaning that he judges the rightness of an act by {{the extent to which it}} satisfies the preferences (interests) of those affected.|$|E

25|$|In {{the region}} of pure mathematics, De Morgan could detect easily the false from the true paradox; {{but he was not}} so {{proficient}} in the field of physics. His father-in-law was a paradoxer, and his wife a paradoxer; and in the opinion of the physical philosophers De Morgan himself scarcely escaped. His wife wrote a book describing the phenomena of spiritualism, table-rapping, table-turning, etc.; and De Morgan wrote a preface in which he said that he knew some of the asserted facts, believed others on testimony, but did not pretend to know whether they were caused by spirits, or had some unknown and unimagined origin. From this alternative he left out ordinary material causes. Faraday delivered a lecture on Spiritualism, in which he laid it down that in the investigation <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> set out with the idea of what is physically possible, or impossible; De Morgan did not believe this.|$|E

500|$|Aside from this, Adams {{generally}} stayed quiet.

They gathered documents written by others, {{as well as many}} of the Civil War books already being published. [...] They at rare times relied on memory, such as Nicolay's recollection of the moment at the 1860 Republican convention when Lincoln was nominated, but for much of the rest relied on research.|$|E
500|$|On 3 April, {{after days}} of {{difficult}} travel, Nansen privately {{began to wonder if}} the pole might, after all, be out of reach. Unless the surface improved, their food would not last them to the pole and then on to Franz Josef Land.

[...] After making camp on 7 April Nansen scouted ahead on snowshoes looking for a path forward, but saw only [...] "a veritable chaos of iceblocks stretching as far as the horizon". He decided that they would go no further north, and would head for Cape Fligely in Franz Josef Land. Nansen recorded the latitude of their final northerly camp as 86°13.6′N, almost three degrees (169.6 nautical miles, or 314km) beyond Greely's previous Farthest North mark.|$|E

[...] It is distinctly American, and very picturesque. [...] Couldn't you have just such a head as you have now, but with the feather headdress?" [...] Numismatic historian Walter Breen described this as [...] "the absurd addition of a feathered warbonnet, such as neither Ms. Liberty nor any Native American woman would ever have worn".

[...] Along with cosponsors Roach and Benton, Tim Eyman also is cosponsoring the legislation. In March 2013, Rivers reprimanded senate Democrats for taking advantage of Janéa Holmquist Newbry's departure from the senate floor to feed her newborn son, leaving the Democrats in temporary control of the senate floor. Immediately after she left, Democrat David Frockt attempted to pass a bill through the floor. As part of her duties, Rivers has also hosted high-school aged pages for the Washington State Senate Page Program.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{announced}} the first tuition freeze {{before the state}} had determined Purdue's funding for the next biennium.

This {{is the right thing}} to do and we are going to do it...the same way families do; the same way some governments do and all businesses do. [...] We are going to adjust our spending to what we believe is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue. [...] I know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend, and I just think we've reached the point where <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> break that pattern." [...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E
