5|$|In {{the early}} mid-2000s, Greece's economy {{was one of}} the fastest growing in the eurozone and was {{associated}} with a large structural deficit. As the <b>world</b> <b>economy</b> was hit by the financial crisis of 2007–08, Greece was hit especially hard because its main industries—shipping and tourism—were especially sensitive to changes in the business cycle.

5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the <b>world</b> <b>economy,</b> while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{currency}} devaluations and oil crises in the 1970s led most countries to float their currencies.

A series of financial crises in Europe, Asia, and Latin America followed with contagious effects due to greater exposure to volatile capital flows. The global financial crisis, which {{originated in the}} United States in 2007, quickly propagated among other nations and is recognized as the catalyst for the worldwide Great Recession. A market adjustment to Greece's noncompliance with its monetary union in 2009 ignited a sovereign debt crisis among European nations known as the Eurozone crisis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{on how the}} {{phenomenon}} of globalization affects or poses a challenge to organisations operating in the Third World countries, especially Nigeria. Building on environment- organisation analysis, this paper explores globalisation – business performance relationship. Globalization acts as a two – edged sword; it slashes the throat of the weak, while as Excalibur, it further strengthens {{the hand of the}} strong. Globalization affords all the opportunities that can help Third World countries transform from Third World to First World in one generation. However, Africa has been a marginal participant in the new global order, and watches globalisation as a paradox. As a result of some skewed and embarrassing features such as inadequate skilled manpower, lack of critical social, legal and economic structures, etc, and the challenging forces and propellants of globalization such as technological innovations, economic liberalisation, etc. Third <b>World</b> <b>economies</b> have not gained the advantage of global <b>world</b> <b>economies.</b> These have made Third <b>World</b> <b>economies</b> vulnerable to the manipulations and dictates of the rampaging economies of the First World. They have caused organisations operating in these Third Worl...|$|R
5|$|The {{effective}} capacity to exchange information worldwide through two-way telecommunication networks grew from 281 petabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, to 471 petabytes in 1993, to 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, and to 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007. This is the informational equivalent of two newspaper pages {{per person per}} day in 1986, and six entire newspapers {{per person per day}} by 2007. Given this growth, telecommunications play an increasingly important role in the <b>world</b> <b>economy</b> and the global telecommunications industry was about a $4.7 trillion sector in 2012. The service revenue of the global telecommunications industry was estimated to be $1.5 trillion in 2010, corresponding to 2.4% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP).|$|E

The British imperial territory with the largest economy in 1870 was British India (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh), followed by the United Kingdom. The territory with the largest economy in 1913 was the United Kingdom, followed by British India. The table does not include GDP estimates for British African territories other than British Egypt.|$|E

In a second step, we will address the issue synchronization.

5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real <b>world</b> <b>economy</b> with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important for}} the <b>world</b> <b>economy.</b> All species were exploited, and as one type's stock depleted, another type was targeted. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially through the 1960s as all whale stocks had been depleted, and practically stopped in 1988 after the International Whaling Commission placed a moratorium which banned whaling for commercial use. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, gray whales may be as numerous as they were prior to whaling, making it the first marine mammal to {{be taken off the}} Endangered species list. The Southern right whale was hunted to near extinction in the mid-to-late 20th century, with only a small (unknown) population around Antarctica. Because of international protection, the Southern right whale's population has been growing 7% annually since 1970. Conversely, the eastern stock of North Atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the coast of North Africa to the North Sea and Iceland; it is thought that the entire stock consists of only ten individuals, making the eastern stock functionally extinct.|$|E
