5|$|On 6 January 1966, Nell <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> {{family car}} with Harry as a passenger; {{they were going}} to the south coast of Queensland for a holiday. A tyre blew out and the car rolled on the Leichhardt Highway near Condamine. Murray was taken to Miles District Hospital with broken ribs. He had {{suffered}} heart trouble for some time, and the shock of the accident is believed to have caused his death the following day. Murray was interred at Mount Thompson Crematorium with full military honours after a funeral service at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|Desperate Housewives {{focuses on}} the lives of several {{residents}} in the suburban neighborhood of Wisteria Lane, as narrated by their deceased neighbor, Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong). In past episodes, a local hospital discovered that a nurse had accidentally switched two children at birth years earlier and that one of the involved families lives in town on Wisteria Lane. Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross) decided to confess to Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria) that her son, Andrew (Shawn Pyfrom), <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> car that killed Gabrielle's mother-in-law eleven years earlier. As a result, her husband Orson (Kyle MacLachlan) decided to leave her. Susan (Teri Hatcher) and Mike Delfino (James Denton) slipped into financial crisis and decided to move into a small apartment across town. Mary Alice's husband, Paul (Mark Moses), avenged her suicide by killing her blackmailer, Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook). In response, her sister, Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), framed Paul for her own death and fled town. Ten years later, Paul was released from jail and returned to Wisteria Lane.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disadvantage}} in numbers {{as well as}} attacking a fixed position, Williams' and Macdonell's small force <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> opposing force {{to the edge of}} the gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup and stand firm. The momentum of the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him to fall from the horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a wound to the head, and Dennis by a severe wound to the thigh (although he continued to lead his detachment throughout the action). Carrying Macdonnell and the body of Brock, the British fell back through Queenston to Durham's Farm, a mile north near Vrooman's Point.|$|E

5|$|In 1979 Tonelli {{failed to}} defend his US title in the 100m backstroke, but managed third in the event at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships in his final year of university. In his four years at Alabama, he was an eight-time All-American in the 100m and 200m backstroke. His triumph at the NCAA Championships came amid the {{backdrop}} of a teammate's death in a waterskiing accident during a social event {{with a group of}} fellow swimmers. Tonelli <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> powerboat when he did a U-turn that resulted in his teammate being thrown off his skis and into the water. The boat's propellor then struck the man, who died due to severe cuts and blood loss.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{advanced}} to the AAFC championship in 1946, but {{a week before the}} game, Rymkus and teammates Jim Daniell and Mac Speedie were arrested and held for several hours after a confrontation with Cleveland police. The men were drinking as they waited to pick up Speedie's wife, who was coming on a plane from Utah. Daniell, who <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> car the three men were in, honked at a police car that was blocking him, leading to an argument and the arrests. Rymkus and Speedie were charged with creating a disturbance and Daniell was charged with public intoxication. Daniell, the Browns' captain, was kicked off the team after the incident, but Rymkus and Speedie remained. The Browns {{went on to win the}} championship the following week, and Rymkus was named to a combined all-AAFC and NFL team.|$|E
5|$|When Nick, Jordan, and Tom {{drive through}} the valley of ashes on their way home, they {{discover}} that Gatsby's car has struck and killed Tom's mistress, Myrtle. Nick later learns from Gatsby that Daisy, not Gatsby himself, <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> car {{at the time of}} the accident but Gatsby took the blame. Myrtle's husband, George, falsely concludes that the driver of the yellow car is the secret lover he recently began suspecting she has, and sets out on foot to find him. After finding out the yellow car is Gatsby's, he arrives at Gatsby's mansion where he fatally shoots Gatsby and then himself. Nick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for Gatsby in which none of Gatsby's associates or partygoers attend. Later, Nick runs into Tom in New York and finds out that Tom had told George that Gatsby was Myrtle's secret lover and that Gatsby had killed her, then gave Gatsby's address to George. Nick breaks up with Jordan, and, disillusioned with the East, moves back to the Midwest.|$|E

5|$|Susan {{attempts}} to console Edie's husband, Dave Williams (Neal McDonough), following Edie's death. She explains the truth behind her own accident, completely unaware that Lila and Paige Dash were Dave's wife and daughter, respectively, {{and that he}} had been seeking revenge on Mike since moving to Wisteria Lane. Meanwhile, Jackson returns to Fairview and proposes to Susan, revealing that his visa has expired and he needs to marry an American citizen. When Susan learns that Mike, who is engaged to Katherine, will no longer have to pay alimony once she is married, she explains the false pretenses of her engagement. Dave, who now understands that Susan <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> car that killed his family, overhears this and reports Jackson to immigration officials. With Jackson out of the picture, Dave invites Susan and M.J. on a fishing trip, planning to kill M.J. just like Susan killed his own child. Mike discovers Dave's plans and is able to save Susan and M.J. After the ordeal, Susan and Mike share a brief, yet romantic kiss. Dave is sent to a psychiatric hospital in Boston and two months later, Mike marries an unidentified bride.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 Daytona 500 {{is known}} for the final lap battle between Pearson and Petty. In 2007, ESPN rated the race as the fourth most {{interesting}} Daytona 500. Petty was leading Pearson going into the last lap {{by a couple of}} car lengths. Pearson used the draft to attempt a slingshot pass against Petty {{at the end of the}} back stretch on the last lap, but his car pushed high into the final turn while going around another car. Petty edged under Pearson, and their cars crashed into each other on the frontstretch in the final turns. They both spun out into the infield grass approximately 100 feet (30 meters) short of the finish line. Benny Parsons who <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> third place car, was over a lap behind the disabled cars. With Petty unable to restart his car, Pearson slowly drove his Wood Brothers Mercury over the grassy infield past the finish line for his only Daytona 500 victory. He won a series-best ten races in 1976, but finished ninth in season points after competing in only 22 of 30 events. He won his only IROC race at the first race of IROC III in 1975/1976 at Michigan International Speedway and finished fifth in points.|$|E
25|$|On March 5, 1999, when Jeff was ten, {{his mother}} {{was in a car}} accident, in which a {{tractor-trailer}} crashed into the car that her cousin <b>was</b> <b>driving.</b> <b>The</b> women had been drinking.

25|$|When on {{the witness}} stand, Erickson gave a {{detailed}} description of Ferguson strangling Heitholt, despite apparently not remembering any details following the murders and during the interrogation. The defense countered that all of the evidence found at the crime scene pointed elsewhere. None of the hair, blood, or fingerprint samples collected at the crime scene were consistent with Ferguson or Erickson, and no traces of the victim's blood were found in the vehicle Ferguson <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> night of the murder. Ferguson was convicted of second-degree murder and robbery and sentenced to 40 years in prison.|$|E
25|$|In January 1948, Paul {{shattered}} {{his right}} arm and elbow in a near-fatal automobile accident on an icy Route 66 west of Davenport, Oklahoma. Mary Ford <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> Buick convertible, which plunged {{off the side of}} a railroad overpass and dropped twenty feet into a ravine; they were returning from Wisconsin to Los Angeles after visiting family. Doctors at Oklahoma City's Wesley Presbyterian Hospital told Paul that they could not rebuild his elbow. Their other option was amputation. Paul was flown to Los Angeles, where his arm was set at an angle—just under 90 degrees—that allowed him to cradle and pick the guitar. It took him nearly {{a year and a half}} to recover.|$|E

25|$|On 3 February 2012, Huhne {{resigned}} from the Cabinet when {{he was charged with}} perverting the course of justice over a 2003 speeding case. His wife at the time, Vicky Pryce, had claimed that she <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> car, and accepted the licence penalty points on his behalf so that he could avoid being banned from driving. Huhne denied the charge until the trial began on 4 February 2013 when he changed his plea to guilty, resigned as a member of parliament, and left the Privy Council. He and Pryce were sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on 11 March to eight months in prison for perverting the course of justice. He served 9 weeks of this sentence at HMP Leyhill before he was released.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Davis {{signed to}} drive for Kevin Harvick Incorporated in the #77 Dollar General Chevy for 13 races, sharing {{the car with}} Bobby Labonte and Kevin Harvick. Davis ran at Fontana {{starting}} 33rd but collided with Eric McClure who ironically <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> #0 car that Davis drove before. He recovered to finish 30th, last on lead lap. He then made his first road course start at Mexico where he started 37th and finished 31st one lap down. He was replaced by Ron Hornaday Jr. prior to the race at Milwaukee. Shortly after that, {{it was announced that}} had been released by KHI, due to Dollar General wanting only Cup drivers in the car. He ran {{the rest of the season}} in the #01 car fielded by his family team.|$|E

The next morning, as Bobby is leaving Pam's house, someone drives a car at high speed toward Pam. Bobby shoves her out of the way just before she is hit but cannot {{get out of the way}} of the car in time to save himself. We see that it is Katherine who <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> car, and that she was also killed when her car crashed after running over Bobby. Bobby is rushed to the hospital, where he later dies. Pam, Jenna, J.R., Miss Ellie, Clayton, Ray and Donna were the people present at the time of Bobby's death.|$|E

30|$|In section IV, we {{analyze the}} decline in gross worker flows (hires and separations), {{employing}} some helpful identities that relate gross worker flows to gross job flows (job creation and job destruction), {{as well as to}} job-to-job flows. We find that {{the decline in}} gross job flows can be described as a narrowing of the distribution of employer growth rates, but this change in the distribution of gross job flows only explains {{about a third of the}} decline in gross worker flows. This implies that whatever economic forces <b>are</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> declines in gross job flows, there are different forces that <b>are</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> declines in gross worker flows. Analyzing the relationship between gross worker flows and job-to-job flows, we find that declines in both short-duration jobs and job-to-job flows <b>are</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> declines in gross worker flows.|$|R
25|$|The mining theory {{behind the}} {{ultimately}} wasteful {{development of the}} Pottsville Twin Shaft operation was not well grounded in the geologic science even of that time. But that theory alone did not make up Gowen's rationale for the massive expenditures of the Coal & Iron Co. He believed that the Schuylkill Valley—which from colonial times until the Civil War had been the center of American iron-making—would, because {{of the importance of}} anthracite iron, continue to hold that preeminent position indefinitely. He stated this belief forthrightly in the Reading Railroad annual report for 1870; but already the use of lower-cost coke made from more widely available bituminous coal, together with expanding markets in the Midwest and West, <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> center of the iron industry (and soon, steelmaking) to Pittsburgh. Already the importance of anthracite as an indispensable industrial fuel was slipping.|$|E
25|$|An Iraqi {{survivor}} {{from the}} same boat, Zainab Abbas, who also lost two children from the disaster, told reporters that Abdullah had been presented to her as the 'captain', that he <b>was</b> <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> overcrowded boat too fast, causing it to flip over, and that he pleaded with her {{while they were still}} both in the water not to report him to anyone in authority. Abbas said her family escaped out of Baghdad from ISIS and she was angry because all the media attention was on Aylan Kurdi and Abdullah Kurdi and not on her family. She later returned to Baghdad and said her dead children's bodies had not been correctly prepared for burial and called on Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to grant her family asylum so they can escape Islamic State. The Reuters agency reported that interviews with two other passengers in the boat, Iraqis Ahmed Hadi Jawwad (Zainab Abbas's husband), and 22-year-old Amir Haider, corroborated Abbas's account.|$|E
25|$|At 3:07pm on 21 March 2002, Dowler left Heathside School in Weybridge {{and walked}} to Weybridge railway station with a friend. The girls got off at Walton-on-Thames railway station, one stop before Dowler's usual stop of Hersham, and went to eat at the station cafe. After Dowler telephoned her father at 3:47pm to say she would be home in half an hour, the girls left the cafe at 4:05, with Dowler walking home alone. She was last seen three minutes later, walking along Station Avenue, by a friend of her sister, who was waiting at a bus stop. A closed-circuit {{television}} camera located further along the road showed no images of Dowler.
