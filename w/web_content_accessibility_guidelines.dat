The analysis has been conducted using expert manual evaluation, automated tools and users with disabilities to identify both the <b>Web</b> <b>Content</b> <b>Accessibility</b> <b>Guideline</b> (WCAG) Version 2 compliance as well as the chief accessibility barriers identified by users with disabilities. While the results from the different aspects of the hybrid testing methods differ considerably in their ranking, the quantitative data suggest {{that at the time of}} writing, none of the libraries assessed meet WCAG 2. 0 Level A compliance. Unfortunately, it follows that people with disabilities would have problems accessing materials from the websites of all of the nine libraries tested. In view of the fact that one in five people have a disability that places restrictions on their mobility, employment and/or education, this is understandably significant. Despite the issue of non-compliance, however, many libraries had clearly considered and implemented elements of WCAG 2. 0 and would only require minimal improvements to reach the web standard, while others have considerable work to do before they meet the required inclusive website design advocated by both Australian and international standards...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the period}} of time {{technology}} has become indispensable for us. It may not be untrue to say that technology and Internet rule human’s life now. Many people cannot even visualize their lives without Internet these days. Internet makes available access to social networking, news, email, ecommerce business, and entertainment etc. According to the survey, there are almost 650 million people with diverse disabilities around the world. Only if developers make little more effort, most of the content of a website can be made accessible to people with disabilities like everyone else. This study shows that currently most websites in Pakistan have an accessibility barrier that makes it difficult for people with disabilities to use the websites. Though number of softwares are available to support special people in their daily web usage, lack of developers concern often seem to limit the use of these software.

In recognition of this ANTA, in conjunction with the Australian Flexible Learning Framework (AFL), has selected three of the toolboxes currently being developed to conform to the World Wide Web Consortium (W 3 C) <b>Web</b> <b>Content</b> <b>Accessibility</b> Priority 1 <b>Guidelines.</b> WestOne Services, in conjunction with Challenger TAFE and WestCoast College of TAFE, is currently developing two of these ANTA toolboxes.

40|$|Universal Design (UD) of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a {{fundamental}} principle that seeks to ensure accessibility for all. With an increasing digitalization of society, {{there is also a}} rapidly increasing need for ICT-solutions that are accessible to all. As a consequence, user-centered design and UD has gain popularity steadily over the last decades. <b>Web</b> <b>content</b> <b>accessibility</b> standards and <b>guidelines</b> have been created and UD legislation is in place in several countries. However, research suggests that there are limited insights into the practices regarding implementation of UD in ICT-projects. This study aims to provide insights into UD practices and verify a set of previously identified promoting and obstructing factors for UD. The study builds on an interview study with 31 individuals affiliated with 21 ICT-projects that have been successful in ensuring UD. The data from these interviews is analyzed in-depth through thematic content analysis, in search for theoretical interpretations that may generate the basis for a proposed best practice for UD in ICT-projects. Second, this study explores the predictability of compliance to the identified factors promoting UD success. The study identifies 13 promoting and 6 obstructive factors affecting the ability to promote, ensure and achieve UD in practice, spanning four levels external, organizational, project and individual. The findings coincide and expand previous research findings. This study highlights a link between user-centered design, usability and universal design. The main findings promoting UD practices can be summarized in the following six factors; UD Anchoring, Adequate Resources, UD competence and Motivation, UD and Usability Focus, Interdisciplinary Collaboration, and Quality Assurance. The four levels provide insight into factor relationships, and suggest that measures have to be taken at several levels to succeed, particularly how UD anchoring is an important influence on the other factors. The study prototypes and tests a self-assessment evaluation tool aiming to explore the measurability of ICT projects compliance to the identified promoting factors. The hypothesis being that projects affiliated with UD success will return higher test scores, and projects not affiliated with UD success lower scores. This hypothesis thus the evaluation form s tentative accuracy are as such confirmed, but will need extensive testing in order to be verified...|$|R
