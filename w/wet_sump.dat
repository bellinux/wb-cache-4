25|$|The no. 700316 6C 2300 tipo Turismo straight-six engine placed {{behind the}} driver was Alfa Romeo: 2,309cc, iron block, light alloy head, {{chain-driven}} dual overhead camshafts, spur gears, <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> lubrication.|$|E
25|$|The O-320 uses a {{conventional}} <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> system for lubrication. The main bearings, connecting rods, camshaft bearings, tappets and pushrods are all pressure lubricated, while the piston pins, cylinder walls and gears are all lubricated by spray. The oil system is pressurized by an accessory-drive mounted oil pump. A remotely mounted oil cooler is used, {{connected to the}} engine by flexible hoses.|$|E
50|$|Four-stroke engines, as {{for almost}} all cars, and large {{two-stroke}} engines used in locomotives and ships can both use either <b>wet</b> or dry <b>sumps.</b> Large two-stroke engines do not use crankcase compression; instead they use a separate blower or supercharger, either a mechanical blower such as a Roots blower or else a turbocharger.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, the {{production}} restarted {{with a larger}} two-cylinder 654 cc Lloyd-made engine with a bore of 70 mm and stroke of 85 mm producing 25 bhp at 2450 rpm. The twin-cylinder alloy unit was mounted transversely at the front and drove the front wheels through a four-speed gearbox with synchromesh on all speeds including reverse. It was still a two-stroke but the bearings were pressure lubricated. A third cylinder and piston which had a reciprocating and slightly rotating motion {{was connected to the}} carburettor with ports in the cylinder walls connecting to the engine's two cylinders. This was used to draw the fuel mixture from the carburettor and transfer the mixture to each engine cylinder. This double-acting fuel charging cylinder piston was hollow with ports located in the piston walls and ports located in the charging cylinder walls connecting to each of the engine's main cylinders. One engine cylinder was charged by the charging cylinder piston's down and slightly rotating stroke which allowed the piston and charging cylinder side wall port to uncover and allow the mixture transfer to the engine cylinder. The other engine cylinder was charged with mixture by the upwards stroke of the charging cylinder piston. The engine cylinders and the fuel charging cylinders were set in a triangular configuration with the fuel charging cylinder being located centrally and receiving gravity fed fuel from the bulkhead mounted fuel tank. This method of mixture input to the engine cylinders allowed for the engine <b>wet</b> oil <b>sump.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The S3 {{received}} the 2.2 L Type 912 engine. The Turbo Esprit had a <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> engine {{with the same}} power and torque output as its dry sump predecessor. Interior trim was revised which, when combined with changes to the body moulds, resulted in more headroom and an enlarged foot-well. The Turbo Esprit retained the aerodynamic body kit of the Essex cars and featured prominent 'turbo esprit' decals on the nose and sides. The S3 gained the new larger bumpers but kept the simpler sill line and glazed rear hatch of the S2.2 body. Both cars came with [...] BBS alloy wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The CB750A {{uses the}} same engine as the CB750, but detuned with lower 7.7:1 {{compression}} and smaller carburetors producing a lower output, [...] The same oil {{is used for the}} engine and transmission, and the engine was changed to a <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> instead of dry sump type. A lockout safety device prevents the transmission from moving out of neutral if the side stand is down. There is no tachometer but the instruments include a fuel gauge and gear indicator. For 1977 the gearing was revised, and the exhaust changed to a four-into-two with a silencer on either side. Due to slow sales the model was discontinued in 1978, though Honda did later introduce smaller Hondamatic motorcycles (namely the CB400A, CM400A, and CM450A). Cycle World tested the 1976 CB750A's top speed at , with a [...] time of 10.0 seconds and a standing [...] time of 15.90 seconds at [...] Braking from [...] was [...]|$|E

50|$|The {{crankshaft}} {{is geared}} {{directly to the}} clutch. No counter balancer shaft is used. Starting is by electric starter only. Lubrication is <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> using a trochoid pump.|$|E
5000|$|Lubrication: <b>Wet</b> <b>sump,</b> splash lubrication. A hook, {{attached}} {{onto the}} connecting rod, dips into {{the oil in}} the sump and splashes it around {{the inside of the}} engine.|$|E
50|$|The old splash {{lubrication}} was superseded by <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> lubrication. A three-speed gearbox was now {{attached to the}} engine and incorporated a heavy-duty clutch. Sales soared and new dealerships were established.|$|E
50|$|At the 1977 Frankfurt Motor Show, the targa topped 308 GTS was introduced. All GTSes used a <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> {{engine and}} were steel-bodied. European GTB models {{retained}} the dry sump lubrication until 1981.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> is a {{lubricating}} oil management design for piston engines which uses the crankcase as a built-in reservoir for oil, {{as opposed to}} an external or secondary reservoir used in a dry sump design.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{comes in}} two variants; the road version - <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> {{and the race}} version - dry sump. To ensure the best {{packaging}} of the engine it has been designed with a 72 degree V.|$|E
5000|$|The L1700 is a four-cylinder four-stroke, horizontally-opposed air-cooled, {{gasoline}} direct-dive engine design, {{based upon}} the Volkswagen air-cooled engine. It employs a single magneto ignition, one carburettor, is lubricated by a <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> and produces [...] at 3600 rpm.|$|E
50|$|The Boulevard S50's {{engine is}} {{carbureted}} by a Mikuni BDS36 in the front, and a Mikuni BS36 in the rear, and features <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> lubrication. It has a ground clearance of 125 mm (4.9 in), {{and comes in}} black, red or silver.|$|E
5000|$|The Honda CB550 was a [...] {{standard}} motorcycle {{produced from}} 1974 to 1978. It featured a four-cylinder SOHC air-cooled <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> engine. The first version, the CB550K, was a {{development of the}} earlier CB500, and like its predecessor, had 4 exhaust pipes, 4 silencers and wire-spoked wheels.|$|E
50|$|Another {{common use}} of the term {{parasitic}} loss is where a new or different design reduces parasitic loss, {{such as the use of}} a dry sump over a <b>wet</b> <b>sump.</b> The reason may be less friction or many other variables that cause the design to be more efficient.|$|E
50|$|The Maserati {{version has}} a crossplane {{crankshaft}} and <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> lubrication. Turbine housings and exhaust manifolds are integrated {{in a single}} piece.On the Quattroporte, the engine has an overboost function which raises maximum torque from 650 Nm between 2000 and 4000 rpm to 710 Nm between 2250 and 3500 rpm.|$|E
50|$|The 330 Colombo {{engine was}} {{enlarged}} with an 81 mm bore to 4390 cc for 1966's 365 California, retaining single overhead cams and <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> lubrication. A reworked engine with four camshafts {{was used in}} the GT/4 models.The 365 GTB/4 Daytona was the only 365 engined car featuring dry sump lubrication.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the earlier}} dry sump CB750, the smaller bike has a <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> engine. Also, the primary drives were different, the CB750 having a duplex chain, while the CB500 had a [...] "Hy-Vo" [...] Morse chain. The CB500 formed the design {{basis for the}} Benelli Sei, a 750 cc six-cylinder motorcycle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wet</b> <b>sump,</b> four-cam, 365 Colombo {{engine was}} {{enlarged}} again to 4823 cc for 1976's 400 {{with the same}} 81 mm bore and a 78 mm stroke. The carburetors were replaced with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection in 1979. In 1986 the engine was bored to 82 mm giving a displacement of 4943 cc.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> system, {{the main}} {{dipstick}} reaches to {{near the bottom}} of the crankcase. The oil filler cap covers a hole in the crankcase where oil can be added; it is typically located on the top of the rocker cover (or if two, the one closer to the front of the vehicle).|$|E
50|$|Lubrication of {{the engine}} was {{performed}} by the fuel itself, collected in a sealed <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> arrangement beneath the crankcase. The naphtha fuel was an acceptable lubricant and this avoided the problem of separating lubricating oil from condensed fuel vapour leaking past the piston ring seals. It did however require careful sealing of the crankcase.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> {{offers the}} {{advantage}} of a simple design, using a single pump and no external reservoir. Since the sump is internal, {{there is no need for}} hoses or tubes connecting the engine to an external sump which may leak. An internal oil pump is generally more difficult to replace, but that is dependent on the engine design.|$|E
50|$|In response, Coventry Climax {{designed}} an aluminium crossflow chain-driven SOHC {{cylinder head}} somewhat {{similar to the}} 5.3L V12 head, on FWMV Mk.4 block with a stroked crank and <b>wet</b> <b>sump.</b> Tecalemit-Jackson fuel injection {{was used for the}} development on this 2,496 cc CFA V8, and the engine was installed on Leonard Pelham Lee's personal Triumph 2000 Estate.|$|E
50|$|The O-320 uses a {{conventional}} <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> system for lubrication. The main bearings, connecting rods, camshaft bearings, tappets and pushrods are all pressure lubricated, while the piston pins, cylinder walls and gears are all lubricated by spray. The oil system is pressurized by an accessory-drive mounted oil pump. A remotely mounted oil cooler is used, {{connected to the}} engine by flexible hoses.|$|E
50|$|This liquid-cooled, four cylinder, boxer (horizontally opposed) engine had a {{belt-driven}} water pump. Its integrated {{cast iron}} cylinder block and crankcase had three main bearings. The two aluminum alloy crossflow cylinder heads {{had one or}} two overhead camshaft in each, driven by individual timing belts, and two valves per cylinder (four valves per cylinder in the 1700 16V version). <b>Wet</b> <b>sump</b> lubrication.|$|E
5000|$|Even in a <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> system, the {{crankshaft}} has minimal {{contact with}} the sump oil. Otherwise, the high-speed rotation of the crankshaft would cause the oil to froth, {{making it difficult for}} the oil pump to move the oil, which can starve the engine of lubrication. [...] Small amounts of oil may splash onto the crankshaft during rough driving, referred to as windage.|$|E
5000|$|The Honda CB650 was a [...] {{standard}} motorcycle {{produced from}} 1979 to 1985. It featured a four-cylinder SOHC air-cooled <b>wet</b> <b>sump</b> engine, with two valves per cylinder. The CB650 was a {{development of the}} CB550, itself derived from the even earlier CB500. The CB650 {{was the last of}} Honda's successful series of air-cooled SOHC fours that began in 1969 with the Honda CB750.|$|E
