5|$|The {{definitive}} {{discovery of}} the Uranian rings was made by astronomers James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink on March 10, 1977, using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory, and was serendipitous. They planned to use the occultation of the star SAO 158687 by Uranus to study the planet's atmosphere. However, when their observations were analyzed, {{they found that the}} star disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it was eclipsed by the planet. They deduced that a system of narrow rings was present. The five occultation events they observed <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> by the Greek letters α, β, γ, δ and ε in their papers. These designations have been used as the rings' names since then. Later they found four additional rings: one between the β and γ rings and three inside the α ring. The former was named the η ring. The latter were dubbed rings 4, 5 and 6—according to the numbering of the occultation events in one paper. Uranus's ring system was the second to be discovered in the Solar System, after that of Saturn.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} series, divisions in ship assignments <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> by shirt color; for the movie, these color codes {{were moved to}} small patches on each person's uniform. The Starfleet delta symbol, which previously indicated duty branches—command, science, medical, engineering, and so forth—was replaced with the command symbol for all branches, superimposed over a circle of color indicating area of service. The blue color of previous uniforms was discarded, for fear they might interfere with the blue screens used for optical effects. Three types of uniforms were fabricated: dress uniforms used for special occasions, Class A uniforms for regular duty, and Class B uniforms as an alternative. The Class A designs were double-stitched in gabardine and featured gold braid designating rank. It was felt that the traditional four gold sleeve stripes for the captain's rank was too blatantly militaristic. Povill had to send out a memo to Fletcher with the modified stripe rank system, as the designer continued to get the 20th and 23rd centuries confused. Fletcher designed the Class B uniform as similar to evolved T-shirts, with shoulder boards used to indicate rank and service divisions. Each costume had the shoes built into the pant leg to further the futuristic look. An Italian shoemaker decorated by the Italian government for making Gucci shoes was tasked with creating the futuristic footwear. Combining the shoes and trousers was difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, as each shoe had to be sewn by hand after being fitted to each principal actor. There were difficulties in communication, as the shoemaker spoke limited English and occasionally confused shoe orders due to similar-sounding names. Jumpsuits, serving a more utilitarian function, were the only costumes to have pockets, and were made with a heavyweight spandex that required a special needle to puncture the thick material. A variety of field jackets, leisure wear, and spacesuits were also created; as these parts had to be designed and completed before most of the actors' parts had been cast, many roles were filled by considering how well the actors would fit into existing costumes.|$|E

25|$|The {{number eight}} {{refers to the}} number of {{cylinders}} of Spyker's Ferrari engine – the same rationale as used with road-going Spykers. The VII (7) sub-designation refers to Spyker's days as an aircraft manufacturer where all models <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> by Roman numerals and stood for the year the aircraft was launched. Hence the F8-VII is the Spyker F line with eight cylinders in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The integer {{registers}} <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> by R0 to R31 and floating-point registers <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> by F0 to F31. The R31 and F31 registers were hardwired to {{zero and}} writes to those registers by instructions are ignored. Digital considered using a combined register file, but a split register file {{was determined to}} be better as it enabled two-chip implementations to have a register file located on each chip and integer-only implementations to omit the floating-point register file containing the floating point registers. A split register file was also determined to be more suitable for multiple instruction issue due to the reduced number of read and write ports. The number of registers per register file was also considered, with 32 and 64 being contenders. Digital concluded that 32 registers was more suitable as it required less die space, which improved clock frequencies. This number of registers was deemed not to be a major issue in respect to performance and future growth, as thirty-two registers could support at least eight-way instruction issue.|$|E
25|$|By 1991, Alexander Smirnov {{had taken}} some steps towards {{algebraic}} geometry over F1. He introduced extensions of F1 {{and used them}} to handle P1 over F1. Algebraic numbers were treated as maps to this P1, and conjectural approximations to the Riemann–Hurwitz formula for these maps were suggested. These approximations imply very profound assertions like the abc conjecture. The extensions of F1 later on <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> as Fq with q = 1n.|$|E

25|$|The {{instruction}} format used 3 bits for opcode, and 12 bits for address. Block I had 11 instructions: TC, CCS, INDEX, XCH, CS, TS, AD, and MASK (basic), and SU, MP, and DV (extra). The first eight, called basic instructions, were directly accessed by the 3-bit op. code. The final three <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> as extracode instructions {{because they were}} accessed by performing a special type of TC instruction (called EXTEND) immediately before the instruction.|$|E

Infantry Regiment Christ was a Swiss unit in Sardinian pay and Sardinian light units <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> Cacciatore.|$|E
25|$|For many film-goers, De Palma's gangster films, {{most notably}} Scarface and Carlito's Way, pushed the {{envelope}} of on-screen violence and depravity, and yet greatly vary {{from one another}} in both style and content and also illustrate De Palma's evolution as a film-maker. In essence, the excesses of Scarface contrast with the more emotional tragedy of Carlito's Way. Both films feature Al Pacino {{in what has become}} a fruitful working relationship. In 1984, he directed the music video of Bruce Springsteen's song Dancing in the Dark. The 1980s <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> by De Palma's other films Dressed To Kill, Blow Out, and Body Double.|$|E

25|$|The Asian tiger {{mosquito}} originally came from Southeast Asia. In 1966, parts of Asia {{and the island}} worlds of India and the Pacific Ocean <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> as the area of circulation for the Asian {{tiger mosquito}}. Ae. albopictus as a native to tropical and subtropical regions with warm and humid climate, is active all year long; however, it has been adapting successfully to cooler, temperate regions, where they hibernate over winter. Eggs from strains in the temperate zones are more tolerant to the cold than ones from warmer regions. The species can even tolerate snow and temperatures under freezing. Adult tiger mosquitoes can survive throughout winter in suitable microhabitats.|$|E
25|$|The ace of spades {{has been}} employed, on {{numerous}} occasions, {{in the theater}} of war. In the Second World War, the soldiers of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the American 101st Airborne Division were marked with the spades symbol painted {{on the sides of}} their helmets. In this capacity, it was used to represent good luck, due to its fortunate connotations in card playing. All four card suits were used for ease of identification of regiments within the airborne division following the confusion of a large scale combat airborne operation. Battalions within the regiments <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> with tic marks or dots, marked from top clockwise: headquarters at the twelve o'clock position, 1st Battalion at the three o'clock, etc.|$|E
25|$|The colour and {{alphanumeric}} {{codes for}} each {{direction of travel}} remained unchanged, except that {{with the opening of}} the Woodlands Extension (connecting Yishun station to Choa Chu Kang station), the Jurong East – Choa Chu Kang Branch Line ceased to exist. As such, the formerly Northbound Choa Chu Kang Branch Line services in khaki travelled southbound to Marina Bay & as such <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> as red while the formerly Southbound Choa Chu Kang Branch Line services in brown originated from Marina Bay, hence having travelled northbound it was denoted as yellow. The alphanumeric codes for these stations were also replaced. After Sembawang it is N14-N18, N20-N23, with the exception of N13 (Canberra) and N19 (Sungei Kadut). The B1-B3 was renumbered to N21-N23.|$|E

25|$|This basic {{educational}} necessity did {{not disappear}} {{with the advent}} of Protestantism; to the contrary, in Britain the Cathedrals and their schools were inherited by the Church of England, which continued to try to maintain New Latin as the language of the church. In this system the headmasters <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> by a variety of Latin terms: the custodes, the magistri scholarum, and the scholarum praefecti. The Renaissance and subsequent neoclassicist periods saw a revival of interest in ancient Greek culture, which resulted in a new overlay of Hellenic terms on the Medieval Latin surviving from the empire, recognizable today as the mixed Greek and Latin words of scientific terminology. In the linguistic environment of the cathedral schools, a new term appears: the scholarchus, the headmaster.|$|E
25|$|The honorific title civium Romanorum ("of Roman citizens", c.R. for short) was {{normally}} {{awarded by}} the emperor for valour to an auxiliary regiment as a whole. The award {{would include the}} grant of Roman citizenship to all the regiment's current members, but not to subsequent recruits to the regiment. The regiment, however, would retain the prestigious title in perpetuity. Until 212, {{only a minority of}} the empire's inhabitants (inc. all Italians) held full Roman citizenship. The rest <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> peregrini, a second-class status. Since the legions admitted only citizens, peregrini could only enlist in the auxilia. Citizenship carried a number of tax and other privileges and was highly sought-after. It could also be earned by serving the minimum 25-year term in the auxilia. In 212 all free inhabitants of the empire were granted full Roman citizenship.|$|E

500|$|A {{substantial}} number of auxiliary regiments (32, or about 1 in 12 in the 2nd century) <b>were</b> <b>denoted</b> sagittariorum, or archer-units (from sagittarii lit. [...] "arrow-men", from sagitta = [...] "arrow"). These 32 units (of which 4 were double-strength) had a total official strength of 17,600 men. All three types of auxiliary regiment (ala, cohors and cohors equitata) could be denoted sagittariorum. Although these units evidently specialised in archery, it is uncertain from the available evidence whether all sagittariorum personnel were archers, or simply a higher proportion than in ordinary units. At the same time, ordinary regiments probably also possessed some archers, otherwise their capacity for independent operations would have been unduly constrained. Bas-reliefs appear to show personnel in ordinary units employing bows.|$|E
