5|$|Dutch {{ichthyologist}} Pieter Bleeker {{first described}} the {{grey reef shark}} in 1856 as Carcharias (Prionodon) amblyrhynchos, in the scientific journal Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië. Later authors moved this species to the genus Carcharhinus. The type specimen was a -long female from the Java Sea. Other common names used for this shark around the world include black-vee <b>whaler,</b> bronze <b>whaler,</b> Fowler's <b>whaler</b> shark, graceful shark, graceful <b>whaler</b> shark, grey shark, grey <b>whaler</b> shark, longnose blacktail shark, school shark, and shortnose blacktail shark. Some of these names are also applied to other species.|$|E
5|$|Many early sources {{gave the}} {{scientific}} {{name of the}} dusky shark as Carcharias (later Carcharhinus) lamiella, which originated from an 1882 account by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert. Although Jordan and Gilbert referred {{to a set of}} jaws that came from a dusky shark, the type specimen they designated was later discovered to be a copper shark (C. brachyurus). Therefore, C. lamiella is not considered a synonym of C. obscurus but rather of C. brachyurus. Other common names for this species include bay shark, black <b>whaler,</b> brown common gray shark, brown dusky shark, brown shark, common <b>whaler,</b> dusky ground shark, dusky <b>whaler,</b> river <b>whaler,</b> shovelnose, and slender <b>whaler</b> shark.|$|E
5|$|At about 13:15, an {{air attack}} by German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters and Junkers Ju 88 bombers sank both destroyers within minutes. Wryneck {{launched}} her <b>whaler,</b> and each destroyer launched her three Carley floats. Survivors in the <b>whaler</b> set off east past Cape Maleas, towing two Carley floats and their occupants. In the evening the wind increased, causing the floats {{to strike the}} boat, so Waldron reluctantly cast them adrift.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Whalers</b> {{played their}} first ever National Hockey League game on October 11, 1979, against the Minnesota North Stars at the Met Center in Bloomington, Minnesota. Gordie Roberts scored the <b>Whalers</b> first goal in {{franchise}} history, as the <b>Whalers</b> {{lost to the}} North Stars 4-1. Two nights later, on October 13, the <b>Whalers</b> earned their first point, as they tied the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-3. The <b>Whalers</b> would end their season starting four game road trip with a 0-2-2 record.|$|R
50|$|He was the Head Coach of the Hartford <b>Whalers</b> from 1980-1983. He then {{coached the}} Binghamton <b>Whalers</b> of the AHL from 1984-1988. He was re-hired by the Hartford <b>Whalers</b> in 1987 and coached them until 1989.|$|R
5|$|The “sea-bittered sailors” {{were not}} pleased with these {{stringent}} regulations, and in 1825 the English <b>whaler</b> Daniel caused rioting {{in the town}} {{for three days and}} even gave out life threats to Reverend William Richards.|$|E
5|$|Bulteel's convoy {{continued}} on, pausing at Rio de Janeiro on 12 August to resupply. The East Indiamen {{then went}} on to Saint Helena on their way to Asia. The two Botany Bay ships sailed on to Australia and the <b>whaler</b> Seringapatam sailed for the South Seas.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's first task, on {{arriving}} at the Stromness station, was to arrange for his three companions at Peggoty Camp to be picked up. A <b>whaler</b> was sent round the coast, with Worsley aboard to show the way, and by the evening of 21 May all six of the James Caird party were safe.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Whalers</b> {{had been}} part of the Compuware Hockey program since 1990, which also {{includes}} the Compuware Ambassadors minor hockey program and the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes, who were formerly the Hartford <b>Whalers,</b> the namesake of the Detroit <b>Whalers.</b> The Carolina Hurricanes tended to give preference to players from the Plymouth <b>Whalers</b> in the NHL Entry Draft owing to common ownership (Karmanos owns both the Hurricanes and the OHL <b>Whalers),</b> and coaches and executives are promoted from within the Compuware Hockey affiliation. Chad LaRose is the only player to have played at every level of Compuware hockey; Compuware AAA Ambassadors, Plymouth <b>Whalers,</b> Florida Everblades, Lowell Lock Monsters, and the Carolina Hurricanes.|$|R

2500|$|On December 27, 2009, Danbury {{was named}} the first city to officially have a new team in the newly formed Federal Hockey League (FHL). The team {{was named the}} Danbury <b>Whalers,</b> {{bringing}} back the name [...] "Whalers" [...] to Connecticut {{for the first time}} since 1997 when Hartford <b>Whalers</b> of the WHA/NHL moved to North Carolina and became the Carolina Hurricanes. At the end of the 2014–15 season, the Danbury Ice Arena evicted the Danbury <b>Whalers.</b> The <b>Whalers</b> were announced as moving to neighboring Brewster, New York, and called the Stateline <b>Whalers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The creek <b>whaler</b> feeds {{predominantly}} {{on small}} teleost fishes (including threadfin breams and lizardfishes) and crustaceans (including penaeid prawns and mantis shrimps); cephalopods are also infrequently consumed. Known parasites {{of this species}} include the tapeworm Callitetrarhynchus gracilis, and a nematode in the genus Pulchrascaris.|$|E
5|$|The creek <b>whaler</b> {{is a minor}} bycatch of inshore gillnet {{fisheries}} {{operating in}} northern Australia; the meat is sold for human consumption. Given its relatively high reproductive rate, its population appears capable of withstanding present levels of fishing. Therefore, the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Pondicherry shark are uncertain. In a 1988 study based on morphological data, Compagno tentatively grouped {{it with the}} smalltail shark (C. porosus), blackspot shark (C. sealei), spottail shark (C. sorrah), creek <b>whaler</b> (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), Borneo shark (C. borneensis), and hardnose shark (C. macloti).|$|E
50|$|The 1990-91 Hartford <b>Whalers</b> {{season was}} the franchise's 19th season, 12th in the NHL. The <b>Whalers</b> placed {{fourth in the}} Adams Division {{to qualify for the}} playoffs. The <b>Whalers</b> were {{eliminated}} in the first round by their New England rival Boston Bruins.|$|R
50|$|The 1976-77 New England <b>Whalers</b> {{season was}} the fifth season of {{operation}} of the New England <b>Whalers</b> in the World Hockey Association.

5|$|The {{oceanic whitetip shark}} (Carcharhinus longimanus), {{also known}} as Brown Milbert's sand bar shark, brown shark, nigano shark, oceanic white-tipped <b>whaler,</b> and silvertip shark, is a large pelagic requiem shark inhabiting {{tropical}} and warm temperate seas. Its stocky body is most notable for its long, white-tipped, rounded fins.|$|E
5|$|After Prince of Wales {{return to}} Britain her owners {{deployed}} {{her as a}} <b>whaler</b> in the South Seas fisheries. She was later used as a privateer under a letter of marque, before performing a voyage as a slave ship. After a period under French control, she returned to Britain and was used to carry trade goods between London, the West Indies and the Mediterranean. The last records of her existence date to 1810; her fate thereafter is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Born at Rangiaowhia, near Te Awamutu, on 8 July 1874, Cunningham {{was the son}} of Hera (Sarah) Ngaihika Halbert and {{her second}} husband, James Cunningham. Hera was the {{daughter}} of Thomas Halbert, a <b>whaler</b> and trader who landed in Poverty Bay in about 1832, and his fifth wife, Keita Kaikiri, who belonged to the Rongowhakaata iwi. Hera later remarried Paratene Tatae, a cousin of Te Kooti: their daughters included Reremoana Hakiwai, and Keita Kaikiri Paratene, who married Reweti Tuhorouta Kohere.|$|E
50|$|On June 3, 2015, due the {{eviction}} of the Danbury <b>Whalers,</b> the Federal Hockey League {{announced a}} new team based in Brewster, New York, {{to be called the}} Stateline <b>Whalers,</b> and would play at the Brewster Ice Arena under former the Danbury <b>Whalers</b> CEO and managing partner Herm Sorcher. The Stateline <b>Whalers</b> were announced as being owned by Barry Soskin, who also owns the Port Huron and Danville teams and formerly owned the Dayton Demonz. The Danbury <b>Whalers</b> were officially considered to be on hiatus for the season by the FHL, but gave up their naming and territorial rights to Brewster.|$|R

50|$|New Bedford <b>Whalers</b> was {{the name}} of three United States soccer teams based in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The first <b>Whalers</b> played in the Southern New England Soccer League between 1914 and 1918. The second <b>Whalers</b> played in the American Soccer League between 1924 and 1931 before merging into Fall River F.C.. The third <b>Whalers</b> were then formed when Fall River merged with New York Yankees. They played in the ASL between 1931 and 1932.|$|R
5|$|Fatal attacks {{attributed}} to the copper shark (bronze <b>whaler)</b> include the 2014 death of a swimmer in Tathra, New South Wales, Australia, and the 1976 death of a swimmer in Te Kaha, New Zealand. Three out of ten shark attacks in New Zealand are {{attributed to}} Copper sharks. Witnesses also attributed a fatal attack on September 2011 in Bunker Bay, Western Australia to a copper shark.|$|E
5|$|Fredericton served {{during the}} Battle of the Atlantic from 1941 to 1945. During 1942 she escorted oil tankers from the Caribbean to New York City. From 1943 to 1945 she escorted convoys in the Western Atlantic {{and then later}} on across the Atlantic to Northern Ireland. She was {{decommissioned}} on 14 July 1945. Some question as to her final disposition lies with a possible error in Lloyd's Register. Either she was sold for scrap in 1946 or ended up as a Panamanian-flagged Japanese <b>whaler</b> which was used until 1979.|$|E
5|$|Rosenberg {{traveled}} from San Francisco to Hawaii, possibly on a <b>whaler,</b> arriving in Oahu sometime before December 1886. At that time, Hawaii was a predominantly Christian kingdom; Christian missionaries had successfully converted {{a large segment}} of the population after traditional Hawaiian religion was suppressed by the monarchy. In the 1880s, however, King Kalākaua encouraged the revival of Hawaiian traditions, hoping to inspire nationalistic sentiment. He revived traditional Hawaiian music and dance, including hula, and observed some practices of Hawaiian religion. Kalākaua became a powerful king, unconstrained by political factors.|$|E
50|$|Jeffrey Paul Brownschidle (March 1, 1959 - December 13, 1996) was an American {{ice hockey}} defenseman who played {{three games in}} the NHL for the Hartford <b>Whalers</b> during the 1981-82 NHL season. He also played in the American Hockey League for the Binghamton <b>Whalers</b> and the Central Hockey League for the Binghamton <b>Whalers.</b> His brother Jack Brownschidle also played in the NHL, played 494 games for the St. Louis Blues and the Hartford <b>Whalers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cunneyworth {{finished}} the 1989-90 {{season with the}} Hartford <b>Whalers,</b> where in 43 games, he scored nine goals and 18 points, helping the <b>Whalers</b> qualify for the playoffs. In four playoff games, Cunneyworth was held pointless, as the <b>Whalers</b> lost to the Boston Bruins in the Adams Division semi-finals.|$|R
50|$|Small {{numbers were}} {{taken off the}} Iberian Peninsula, {{beginning}} in the 1920s by Spanish <b>whalers,</b> off the Nova Scotian shelf in the late 1960s and early 1970s by Canadian <b>whalers,</b> and {{off the coast of}} West Greenland from the 1920s to the 1950s by Norwegian and Danish <b>whalers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The creek <b>whaler</b> was {{described}} by Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley in a 1943 volume of Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. He assigned the new species to the subgenus Uranganops of the genus Galeolamna, and gave it the specific epithet fitzroyensis because the type specimen, a 1.2-m-long female, was collected from Connor's Creek in the Fitzroy River estuary. Subsequent authors have synonymized Galeolamna with Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the creek}} <b>whaler</b> {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes and crustaceans. It is viviparous, with the unborn young being sustained through a placental connection. The defined mating season lasts from May to July. Females give birth to one to seven pups annually, following a gestation period of seven to 9 months. A small number of creek whalers are caught incidentally in inshore gillnets and used for food, but the effect of fishing on its population seems to be inconsequential. As a result, the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The table {{does not}} include the {{numerous}} whaling voyages that took place during this period, or sub-Antarctic expeditions such as that of Carl Chun in 1898–99, which did not penetrate the Antarctic circle. The abortive Cope Expedition of 1920–22, which collapsed through lack of funding, is likewise excluded, though two men were landed from a Norwegian <b>whaler</b> and spent a year on the Antarctic peninsula.|$|E
50|$|On April 3, 2015, the Danbury Ice Arena {{announced}} {{that it did not}} want to renew its contract with the Federal Hockey League's Danbury <b>Whalers</b> and gave them a notice to evict by April 17, leaving the team homeless. Prior to their eviction, the <b>Whalers</b> led the FHL home attendance for the league's first five seasons. On June 3, 2015, due to the eviction of the Danbury <b>Whalers,</b> the FHL announced a new team based in nearby Brewster, New York, to be called the Stateline <b>Whalers,</b> and would play at the Brewster Ice Arena under former Danbury <b>Whalers</b> CEO and managing partner, Herm Sorcher. The Danbury <b>Whalers</b> were then officially considered to be on hiatus for the season by the FHL, but gave up their naming and territorial rights to Brewster.|$|R
