5|$|The episode's story {{focuses on}} couple Nikki Fernandez (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro). The flashbacks reveal their lives before {{arriving}} on the island, and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing between day one and day eighty-one. Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) returned {{for the fifth}} time since his death late in the first season. Furthermore, Ethan (William Mapother) and Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) reprised their guest roles in flashbacks. The episode got a mixed response from critics and fans, with positive reception considering it an entertaining send-off to two unpopular characters, but negative reviews deeming it unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|Locomotive : This {{pattern is}} {{produced}} {{when all the}} planets are contained within 240 degrees or nine signs of the zodiac, so that a whole 120 degrees is completely unoccupied. The planet that rises clockwise following the empty space will significantly influence {{the life of the}} person with this pattern, no matter what is indicated by the sun sign. It will act as the 'locomotive' of the natal chart, driving the individual to achieve goals through determined and unrelenting effort, with an exceptional drive and fund of energy at their disposal. Such a person will often be a loner, waiting for the public to discover the truth of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> saying all along.|$|E
25|$|Bureaucratic {{structures}} {{have many}} levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, {{all the way}} to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organized process, and a strict command and control structure is present at all times.In bureaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve. Some disadvantages in bureaucratic structures are it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it hard for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.|$|E

500|$|Barbauld's brother, John Aikin, {{described}} their father as [...] "the best parent, the wisest counsellor, the most affectionate friend, every {{thing that could}} command love and veneration". Barbauld's father prompted many such tributes, although Lucy Aikin described him as excessively modest and reserved. Barbauld developed a strong bond with her brother during childhood, standing in as a mother figure to him; they eventually became literary partners. In 1817, Joanna Baillie commented of their relationship [...] "How few brothers and sisters have been to one another <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> through so long a course of years!" ...|$|E
500|$|Thoroughbred {{horses are}} {{primarily}} bred for racing under saddle at the gallop. Thoroughbreds are often {{known for being}} either distance runners or sprinters, and their conformation usually reflects <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> bred to do. Sprinters are usually well muscled, while stayers, or distance runners, tend to be smaller and slimmer. The size of the horse is one consideration for buyers and trainers when choosing a potential racehorse. Although there have been champion racehorses of every height, from Zenyatta who stood 17.2 hands, to Man o' War and Secretariat who both stood at 16.2 hands, down to Hyperion, who was only 15.1, the best racehorses are generally of average size. [...] Larger horses mature more slowly and have more stress on their legs and feet, predisposing them to lameness. [...] Smaller horses are considered {{by some to be}} at a disadvantage due to their shorter stride and a tendency of other horses to bump them, especially in the starting gate. Historically, Thoroughbreds have steadily increased in size: [...] the average height of a Thoroughbred in 1700 was about 13.3hands high. By 1876 this had increased to 15.3.|$|E
2500|$|... "To enable {{young people}} to grow into {{independent}} adults the Scout method encourages {{young people to}} question <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> taught. Scouts and Venture Scouts who question God's existence, their own spirituality or the structures and beliefs of any or all religions are simply searching for spiritual understanding. This notion of a search for enlightenment is compatible with belief {{in most of the}} world's faiths. It is unacceptable to refuse Membership, or question a young person's suitability to continue to participate fully in a Section, if they express doubts about the meaning of the Promise." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{soldiers}} were from peasant families {{who had never been}} to Beijing and did not understand the situation they were about to confront. [...] Many privately looked forward to their first trip to the capital and expected to be welcomed by residents. [...] The military units from other regions spoke a different northern dialect than the Beijing citizens, adding to the confusion. The soldiers were strictly prohibited from communicating with residents.

2500|$|Another {{criticism}} {{that was made}} of Dewey as governor lay in his treatment of New York legislators and political opponents. Dewey [...] "cracked the whip ruthlessly on (Republican) legislators who strayed from the party fold. Assemblymen have found themselves {{under investigation by the}} State Tax Department after opposing the Governor over an insurance regulation bill. Others discover job-rich construction projects, state buildings, even highways, directed to friendlier [...]" [...] Dewey [...] "forced the legislature his own party dominates to reform its comfortable ways of payroll padding. Now legislative workers must verify in writing every two weeks <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing to earn their salary; every state senator and assemblyman must verify that [...] are telling the truth. All this has occasioned more than grumbling. Some Assemblymen have quit in protest. Others have been denied renomination by Dewey's formidable political organization. Reporters mutter among themselves about government by blackmail." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart {{returns to}} the office and chats to his co-worker, Charlotte, with whom they share a very fond friendship, albeit a totally platonic one. Charlotte, openly a devout Christian {{frequently}} reading her Bible, lends Stewart a video of a programme she recorded, Songs That Changed My Life. Stewart agrees to please Charlotte, and returns home to the flat he shares with his sister, Imogen. After Imogen goes out for the evening, Stewart puts the video on. The programme is a religious one consisting exclusively of Christian songs that various obscure Christian figures find uplifting, and Stewart is barely interested – until the programme ends. Then the video returns to what was partly recorded over – a pornographic video – [...] and Stewart watches in amazement. Imogen, in the meantime, spends the whole evening waiting for a date from a dating agency who fails to turn up. When Imogen returns home, both she and Stewart lie about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing that evening.|$|E

In the end, Superboy-Prime is pulled into the core of a red sun by both Superman of Earth-Two and Superman (Kal-El) of the main DC Universe. They crash land on Mogo, the Green Lantern that is a living planet. Under a red sun, their powers rapidly vanish. On Mogo, Superboy-Prime beats the Earth-Two Superman to death before he is defeated by Kal-El. The Green Lantern Corps put Superboy-Prime in a maximum-security prison on their home world of Oa and guard him round-the-clock.

2500|$|Grohl {{described}} this song as such; [...] "Wind Up {{is about the}} press. It {{has to do with}} me reading about people that... I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, {{and then there is the}} prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's just talking [...] "about the hand you've been dealt." [...] Every time I hear about [...] "the hand you've been dealt," [...] it drives me fucking nuts, spare me your confessions. And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I've had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life - you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses - and it's a lot more fun to play music." ...|$|E
