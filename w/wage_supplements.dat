30|$|The {{policies}} that ensued—particularly those directed at lone parents—were largely aimed at meeting these goals. For example, tax credits {{were designed to}} ‘make work pay’ by providing enough incentive to work while meeting the increasing challenge of keeping low-paid workers’ standards of living in sync {{with those of the}} working majority who have higher earnings. In 1999, the Working Families Tax Credit was introduced, offering more generous <b>wage</b> <b>supplements</b> to low-income workers as well as help covering most of the formal cost of childcare. This reform was underpinned by the National Minimum Wage, which took effect in the same year, and which many believed was essential, in part, in order to prevent employers from reducing wages in the face of higher government-funded <b>wage</b> <b>supplements.</b> In 2003, the Working Families Tax Credit was replaced by the Working Tax Credit, which was the first major tax credit also available to low-paid workers without children, and the Child Tax Credit, which simplified support so that families with children could have a clearer idea of how much they could expect to receive in and out of work.|$|E

30|$|Our employee-level data provide {{not only}} total yearly wage {{but also its}} {{different}} wage components: basic wage, bonus, supplements, and overtime pay. Bonuses can differ between individuals and {{are based on the}} productivity of workers. Supplements are given to all workers with certain job characteristic, such as those who work night hours or who have more years of tenure in the firm. Information on pay is the yearly total. We divide this yearly total by 12 to construct a monthly pay variable. In comparing wages to the legal minimum wage it is important to use the correct measure of wages. Legally, the wage compared to the minimum wage should include the basic wage plus bonus plus some, but not all, supplements. Overtime pay, the employer contribution to social insurance, and some legally-mandated supplements should be excluded. Other <b>wage</b> <b>supplements</b> that should be excluded when comparing wages to the minimum wage include those for working the night shift and working under dangerous or uncomfortable working conditions. <b>Wage</b> <b>supplements</b> that should be included when comparing wages to the minimum wage are those that are not legally mandated, and include those for medical and health benefits, for tenure, meal allowances, transportation supplements, supplements for books and newspapers, and cost of living adjustments. However, our data only report total supplements paid to workers. That is, we cannot distinguish between supplements that are legally required {{to be included in the}} minimum wage and those legally excluded. Because we cannot distinguish which part of reported supplements should or should not be included when comparing to the minimum wage, when we calculate the proportion of full-time workers earning less than the monthly minimum wage, we present two estimates: the proportion earning less than the basic wage plus bonus (an upper bound) and the proportion earning less than the basic wage plus bonus plus supplements (a lower bound).|$|E

30|$|In recent years, as the Chinese {{economy has}} become more market and export oriented, Chinese central and {{regional}} governments have actively intervened {{in the labor market}} in attempts to ensure that low wage workers benefit from the resulting rapid economic growth.

In this paper we study minimum wages and two related labor market interventions to protect the pay of low wage workers in China: additional pay for overtime hours and legally-mandated <b>wage</b> <b>supplements</b> for dangerous work, night work, pensions and other social protections.

The emergence of employee benefits as a major source of income security and health insurance has reduced the aggregate need for public programs, but it has left those in lower-paying, less stable jobs-disproportionately women and minorities—both unprotected and with fewer political allies to press for improved protections.

40|$|The {{level at}} which {{collective}} bargaining takes place is usually considered important in determining wage levels and wage inequalities. Two different situations are considered: a first in which bargaining is only 'multi-employer', and a second {{in which it is}} 'multi-level', in the sense that workers can be covered by both a 'multi-employer' and a 'single-employer' contract at the same time. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the impact of these different institutional settings on pay dispersion. The study is carried out using the European Structure of Earnings Survey, which is a large dataset containing detailed matched employer-employee information for the year 1995. The countries analysed are Italy, Belgium and Spain. The empirical results generally show that wages of workers covered by only a 'multi-employer' contract are no more compressed than those of workers covered by both 'multi-employer' and 'single-employer' contracts. This implies that where workers are not covered by single-employer bargaining, they receive <b>wage</b> <b>supplements</b> paid unilaterally by their employers.

40|$|<b>Wage</b> <b>supplements</b> in {{the form}} of private fringe {{benefits}} and statutory contributions to social welfare account for around 25 per cent of the typical firm's total labour costs throughout OECD countries. Yet the relative emphasis on private and statutory payments differs from country to country. For example, the ratio of statutory contributions to private fringes (excluding holiday payments) was 5 0 in the FRG compared to 0. 9 in the USA in 1981. This paper critically assesses the economic arguments for and against both forms of non-wage payment. On the private side, the discussion concentrates on human capital anti union median voter explanations for private fringe payments. Attention is also given to the implications of favourable corporate and individual tax concessions with respect both to the demand for private fringes and to the evaluation of their human capital effects. On the statutory side, social security contributions are discussed in relation to general social welfare, government employment policy and employer-union relations. As part of the general assessment, it is argued that governments should provide a Fiscal framework in this area which is designed to stimulate more effective individual and firm-level choice between equivalent forms of private and statutory supplementary compensation...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we offer}} an {{alternative}} normative justification {{for the use of}} a minimum <b>wage</b> to <b>supplement</b> an optimal tax-and-transfer system. We consider the intensive-margin setting that captures the difference between wage and income and therefore provides a natural framework for examining the social desirability of a minimum <b>wage</b> as a <b>supplement</b> to the tax-and-transfer system. 4 Central to our argument is the distinction between the deserving and the undeserving poor, where deservedness refers to the society’s willingness to provide public support as reflected in the relative weights in the social welfare function. We capture this distinction by assuming that unskilled workers differ in their disutility from work, where those incurring a low disutility from work are referred to as deserving, while those incurring a high disutility from work are referred to as undeserving.|$|R
