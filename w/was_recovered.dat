5|$|Alabama {{opened the}} third quarter with a six-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a ten-yard Lacy {{touchdown}} run. On the kickoff that ensued, Demetrius Hart forced a fumble by Arkansas' Dennis Johnson that <b>was</b> <b>recovered</b> by Foster at the Razorbacks' 27-yard line. Two plays later, Alabama led 38–0 after T. J. Yeldon scored on a one-yard run. Arkansas responded with their longest drive of the game; however, it ended when Deion Belue forced a Knile Davis fumble that <b>was</b> <b>recovered</b> by Nick Perry at the Alabama 20-yard line. With {{the majority of the}} offensive starters pulled from the game, the Crimson Tide reserves led Alabama on a 15-play, 80-yard drive that ended with a 12-yard Kenyan Drake touchdown run early in the fourth quarter.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of two commercially available swab transport systems, Port-A-Cul (PAC; BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) and Anaerobic Specimen Collector (ASC; Becton Dickinson Vacutainer Systems, Rutherford, N. J.), {{in the recovery}} of organisms from clinical specimens was done. Fifteen abscesses were drained, and swabs of their contents {{were placed in the}} transport systems until they were inoculated for detection of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The swabs were plated immediately after collection and after delays of 4, 24, 48, and 72 h. A total of 70 bacterial isolates, 47 anaerobes and 23 aerobes, <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> from specimens inoculated immediately after collection. The survival of anaerobic bacteria was better in the PAC system than in the ASC system. This was evident as the length of delay in cultivation was extended. At 4 h, 46 anaerobic isolates <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in the PAC system, compared with 39 in the ASC system (P less than 0. 1). At 24 h, 45 isolates <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in the PAC system and 26 isolates <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in ASC (P less than 0. 001); at 48 h, 40 <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in PAC and 15 <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in ASC; and at 72 h, 32 <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in PAC and 6 <b>were</b> <b>recovered</b> in ASC. There were no differences between the systems in the recovery of aerobic bacteria. These data demonstrate the usefulness of the PAC system in the recovery of anaerobes and the need for quality control of all transport systems for anaerobic bacteria...|$|R
