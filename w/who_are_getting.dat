Rolling Stone published an article in which Madonna advocated [...] "intense personal exploration" [...] over drug use. While being asked if [...] "Devil Pray" [...] could run the risk of being misunderstood as a song encouraging drugs, Madonna replied: [...] "I'm certainly not judging people who take drugs or saying 'don't do drugs', however, I'm saying you can do all of these things to connect to a higher level, but ultimately you're going to be lost. People <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> high are instinctively also trying to connect to a higher level of consciousness, but are doing {{it in a way that}} will not sustain them." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's Justin Speer {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "a ridiculously violent, unbelievably profane game {{that lets you}} glorify {{yourself}} with virtual {{millions of dollars in}} hard-earned drug money, fast cars, boats, underlings, women and copious amounts of blood. It's a good feeling." [...] However, he noted that [...] "gamers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> used to the next-generation of console visuals aren't going to be impressed with either the PS2 or the Xbox version." [...] He also argued the game becomes somewhat repetitive towards the end. However, he concluded [...] "Scarface is a long-lasting experience that's simply a lot of fun. Part guilty pleasure, part blazingly successful experiment in game design, Scarface: The World is Yours is definitely worth a shot." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} met with {{controversy}} upon its release when retail chain Walmart refused to carry the album unless an edited version was made. Though initially hesitant, Zombie complied with the request as [...] "for some of these kids, {{it was the only}} place they can buy records. At the end of the day, it's these kids <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> fucked." [...] The edited version of the album removes the skull and crossbones, pentagram, and [...] "x" [...] from the album artwork; multiple pages are removed from the booklet, as are the album's lyrics. The title of [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore" [...] was shortened to simply [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe". Seven years after the release of the album, Zombie released a deluxe edition of Hellbilly Deluxe featuring a bonus DVD. The DVD included a music video for all thirteen of the album's songs, with Zombie being credited as the director for all of them. The project was officially released on November 22, 2005.|$|E

60|$|LUBIN. Quite so.

Take the mere question of the manufacture of the specific, whatever it may be! There are forty millions of people in the country.

6000|$|In {{contemporary}} life the existing ties are so various and so imperative that the detachment necessary as a preliminary condition to such new groupings is rarely found. This {{is not a}} period in which large numbers of people break away easily and completely from old connexions. Things change less catastrophically than once they did. More particularly is there less driving out into the wilderness. There is less heresy hunting; persecution is frequently reluctant and can be evaded by slight concessions. The world as a whole is less harsh and emphatic than it was. Customs and customary attitudes change nowadays not so much by open, defiant and revolutionary breaches as by the attrition of partial negligences and new glosses. Innovating people do conform to current usage, albeit they conform unwillingly and imperfectly. There is a constant breaking down and building up of usage, and as a consequence a lessened need of wholesale substitutions. Human methods have become viviparous; the New nowadays lives for a time {{in the form of the}} Old. The friend I quote in Chapter 2.10 writes of a possible sect with a [...] "religious edifice" [...] and ritual of its own, a new religious edifice and a new ritual. In practice I doubt whether [...] "real" [...] people, people who matter, people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> things done and who have already developed complex associations, can afford the extensive re-adjustment implied in such a new grouping. It would mean too much loss of time, too much loss of energy and attention, too much sacrifice of existing co-operations.|$|E
60|$|The same dualism {{underlies}} {{the nature and}} condition of man. Every excess causes a defect; every defect an excess. Every sweet hath its sour; every evil its good. Every faculty which is a receiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse. It is to answer for its moderation with its life. For every grain of wit there is a grain of folly. For every thing you have missed, you have gained something else; and for every thing you gain, you lose something. If riches increase, they are increased that use them. If the gatherer gathers too much, Nature takes out of the man what she puts into his chest; swells the estate, but kills the owner. Nature hates monopolies and exceptions. The waves of the sea do not more speedily seek a level from their loftiest tossing than the varieties of condition tend to equalize themselves. There is always some levelling circumstance that puts down the overbearing, the strong, the rich, the fortunate, substantially on the same ground with all others. Is a man too strong and fierce for society and by temper and position a bad citizen,--a morose ruffian, {{with a dash of}} the pirate in him?--Nature sends him a troop of pretty sons and daughters <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> along in the dame's classes at the village school, and love and fear for them smooths his grim scowl to courtesy. Thus she contrives to intenerate the granite and felspar, takes the boar out and puts the lamb in and keeps her balance true.|$|E
60|$|Now, it is unnecessary--it {{would be}} almost an impertinence--to enlarge on a spiritual destitution of which you are already well aware. There are, we shall all agree, many {{thousands}} in London who are palpably sick of spiritual disease, and need the physician. But I have special reasons for not pressing this point. If I attempted to draw subscriptions from you by painting tragical and revolting pictures of the vice, heathendom, and misery of this metropolis, I might make you fancy {{that it was an}} altogether vicious, heathen, and miserable spot: than which there can be no greater mistake. These evils are not the rule, but the exceptions. Were they not the exceptions, then not merely the society of London, and the industry of London, and the wealth of London, but the very buildings of London, the brick and the mortar, would crumble to the ground by natural and inevitable decay. The unprecedentedly rapid increase of London is, I firmly believe, a sure sign that things in it are done on the whole not ill, but well; that God's blessing is on the place; that, because it is on the whole obeying the eternal laws of God, therefore it is increasing, and multiplying, and replenishing the earth, and subduing it. And I do not hesitate to say, that I have read of no spot of like size upon this earth, on which there have ever been congregated so many human beings, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> their bread so peaceably, happily, loyally, and virtuously; and doing their duty--ill enough, no doubt, as we all do it--but still doing it more or less, by man and God.|$|E
