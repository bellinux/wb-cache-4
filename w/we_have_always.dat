25|$|The {{truth is}} there is more of Cubism in great {{painting}} than we dream, and the extravagances of the Cubists may serve to open our eyes to beauties <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> felt without quite understanding.|$|E
25|$|We AAs {{have never}} called {{alcoholism}} a disease because, technically speaking, {{it is not}} a disease entity. For example, {{there is no such thing}} as heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> called it an illness or a malady—a far safer term for us to use.|$|E

60|$|Clark pretended he {{was glad}} to see me. He really couldn't have been, because his Great Idea hadn't struck him then, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> disliked each other.|$|R
60|$|We are {{sorry to}} find an English {{dramatic}} critic misquoting Shakespeare, as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been of opinion {{that this was a}} privilege reserved specially for our English actors.|$|R

The staff of the paper remains united and our mission to enlighten and inform remains steadfast.

500|$|On July 23, {{the last}} night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a {{television}} broadcast in which Collins commented: ...The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly... <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears {{of a number of}} a people... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, [...] "Thank you very much." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 20, 2009, Lamoriello {{announced}} that the Devils would wear their classic red, white and green jerseys on their Saint Patrick's Day 2010 game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Lamoriello stated, [...] "The original red, green and white jerseys {{are a part of}} our history here in New Jersey. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been an organization that takes great pride in its tradition. This is something we believe our fans will enjoy for that one special night." [...] Martin Brodeur wore a special replica helmet of the one from his first NHL game, as the Devils defeated the Penguins, 5–2. The throwback jerseys were used seven more times, three of which took place on St. Patrick's Day. In 2014, they were used twice: January 26 against the Rangers in the 2014 NHL Stadium Series, and March 18 against the Bruins.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thus encouraged, Rosa {{threw up}} her head, and {{began with an}} air of pride which plainly proved, what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> suspected, that she belonged to a good family.|$|R
60|$|By {{this means}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> the same climate {{in all the}} rooms, and an equal heat was preserved; and how cold soever it was without, it was always warm within; and yet we saw no fire, nor were ever incommoded with any smoke.|$|R
6000|$|She held herself {{apart from}} him at her arm's length, and said, [...] "Wait! Let me say {{it before it}} seems as if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been engaged, and {{everything}} was as right then as it is now. Did you despise me for letting you kiss me before we were engaged?" ...|$|R
500|$|In December 1987, as news {{began to}} {{circulate}} about the commissioned work, local Assyrians accused Parhad of misrepresenting Ashurbanipal. Criticisms included {{the depiction of}} the king holding both a book and a lion, which they argued he [...] "wouldn't do", and for dressing him in a skirt, which they claimed {{he would never have}} worn. The critics thought the statue made a better portrayal of the Sumerian king Gilgamesh. One critic said: It's very simple. The statue represents Gilgamesh.... No Assyrian has a right to imagine things about our king. It's exactly like making a copy of the Statue of Liberty and saying it is George Washington.... Assyrian kings didn't wear miniskirts. They wouldn't have been holding a lion or a book. It's an insult to the Assyrians. Narsai David responded: They are entitled to their opinion.... We have never said this is a museum-quality reproduction.... <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> said this is a characterization of Ashurbanipal as done by a 20th-century artist. If they choose to think of this as Gilgamesh, they are free to do so.|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{revealed}} that captain Roy Keane {{would return to}} his midfield role after playing in central defence in their win over Juventus: [...] "It took Roy about 15 minutes to settle into Tuesday's game but once he started {{to make sure he}} could see his opponent, he grasped the role very quickly, in the end, he could have played with a bowler hat and white gloves on it was so easy for him. He is a marvellous player and choosing him in defence is certainly an option but Mikaël Silvestre and John O'Shea should be fit and I have a back four in my mind." [...] The final was United's first since the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final and Ferguson was determined to win: That is too long for us, and we are delighted. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> looked at the League Cup as an extra to blood young players, but the format now has encouraged teams to have a go. We've played Liverpool once in Cardiff – in the Charity Shield – and lost so I hope this time it will be a different result." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My {{people are}} not members of the Klan, but we agree {{with some of the}} things that they stand for to assert our American right of free speech. [...] <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> stood for one hundred percent Americanism and so does the Klan, so {{naturally}} we agree there." ...|$|E
50|$|Wes buys {{a number}} of old books at the auction {{including}} {{one of the most}} famous books of magick, The Red Compendium, which is infamous for absorbing those who read it. <b>Wes</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been a sucker for literature and soon finds he can't put it down even if he wants to.|$|R
5000|$|... "From the (often blind) {{viewpoint}} of instructors, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> viewed cooperative learning {{as an added}} {{advantage for the students}} - an opportunity to receive additional support while working closely with their peers. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> never really considered what a disastrous experience some frustrated students must endure, or why some students reported only positive experiences from classes utilizing group learning techniques." ...|$|R
6000|$|I came, as I was desired, where I {{had never}} been before, for <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> rested {{in the belief that}} the Alfy Valley was a nasty, damp, {{unhealthy}} place, with [...] "something always about," [...] and had contented ourselves with sending broth to the cottages whenever we heard of any unusual amount of disease. If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> ever been there! ...|$|R
2500|$|... “We {{have never}} called our {{traditional}} masquerades {{by the name}} “carnavales,” an improper name, {{the name of a}} religious festival which, according to the Catholic Church, is a period of time from the Day of the Kings until Ash Wednesday. [...] Accordingly, it is incorrect to call them by the name carnavales; they should be called what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> called them: Los Mamarrachos.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The HDP {{maintained}} {{talks with}} Abdullah Öcalan, from this talks Öcalan give {{a message to}} the congress stating that [...] "We have never considered our movement apart from Turkey's revolutionary and socialist movements. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> regarded ourselves {{as an integral part of}} this outcome" [...] and [...] "we have to consider the HDP as an integral part of the historical democratic dialogue and negotiation process. If socialism and an open democracy succeed in Turkey, it will be closely related to this democratic negotiation process.". Öcalan's niece Dilek Öcalan and Öcalan's nephew Öcalan Urfa'dan were among the HDP parliamentary candidates.|$|E
2500|$|Greenpeace {{responded with}} apologies, {{claiming}} that demonstrators {{took care to}} avoid damage, but this is contradicted by video and photographs showing the activists wearing conventional shoes (not special protective shoes) while walking on the site. The organization stated they were surprised that this resulted [...] "in some kind of moral offense." [...] Conversely, they stood by [...] "...history of more than 40 years of peaceful activism [...] clearly shows that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been most respectful with {{people around the world}} and their diverse cultural legacies." [...] Greenpeace members were allowed to leave Peru without being charged.|$|E
5000|$|Van Loon's Lives: Being a true and {{faithful}} {{account of a}} number of highly interesting meetings with certain historical personages, from Confucius and Plato to Voltaire and Thomas Jefferson, about whom <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> felt a great deal of curiosity and who came to us as dinner guests in a bygone year, 1942, Simon & Schuster ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is true that}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been {{prepared}} for winter, wherever <b>we</b> <b>had</b> lived; {{but this was a}} different case. In other days it did not matter much whether we were ready or not; but now our house, our cow, our poultry, and indeed ourselves, might have suffered,--there is no way of finding out exactly how much,--if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not made all possible preparations for the coming of cold weather.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> counted, {{and with}} good cause, on these Indians being {{friendly}} to our people who were struggling to throw off the yoke which the king had put upon us, yet {{the fact that they}} were in the encampment, apparently on friendly terms with our enemies, seemed to betoken still more trouble and misery for us of the valley.|$|R
2500|$|Haq's {{parents also}} issued a statement. It read, in its entirety, [...] "We are shocked and devastated with this tragic event. Our hearts and condolences {{go to the}} family of the {{deceased}} lady. Our deepest sympathies go to those who have been injured and we pray for their speedy recovery. We could not have imagined for a moment that our son would do this senseless act. This is utterly contrary to our beliefs and Islamic values. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> believed and practiced in fostering love, peace and harmony with everyone, irrespective of religion, race and ethnicity." ...|$|E
2500|$|King {{has also}} {{referred}} to author Shirley Jackson. Salem's Lot opens with a quotation from Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House, and a character in [...] references the Jackson book <b>We</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Always</b> Lived in the Castle. King's book 11/22/63 mentions the Jackson story [...] "The Summer People". King {{is a fan of}} John D. MacDonald, and dedicated the novella [...] "Sun Dog" [...] to MacDonald, saying [...] "I miss you, old friend." [...] For his part, MacDonald wrote an admiring preface to Night Shift, and even had his famous character, Travis McGee, reading Cujo in one of the last McGee novels and Pet Sematary in the last McGee novel, The Lonely Silver Rain.|$|E
2500|$|After 26 {{years of}} marriage, Mel and Robyn Gibson {{separated}} on July 29, 2006. In a 2011 interview, Gibson {{stated that the}} separation began the day following his arrest for drunk driving in Malibu. Robyn Gibson filed for divorce on April 13, 2009, citing irreconcilable differences. In a joint statement, the Gibsons declared, [...] "Throughout our marriage and separation <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> strived to maintain the privacy and integrity of our family {{and will continue to}} do so." [...] The divorce filing followed the March 2009 release of photographs appearing to show him on a beach embracing Russian pianist Oksana Grigorieva. Gibson's divorce was finalized on December 23, 2011, and the settlement with his ex-wife was said to be the highest in Hollywood history at over $400million.|$|E
6000|$|My mind flew to Sammy. Without doubt Sammy {{had stayed}} behind {{to carry out}} this terrible and masterly scheme, of which I am sure none of the Mazitu would have thought, since it {{involved}} the absolute destruction of their homes and property. Sammy, at whom <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> mocked, was, after all, a great man, prepared to perish in the flames in order to save his friends! ...|$|R
60|$|Maqueda and two {{or three}} of her ladies, one of them, I remember, her old nurse who had brought her up, for her mother died at her birth, took {{possession}} of some empty rooms, of which there were many in the palace, while we lay, or rather fell, down in the guest-chambers, where <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> slept, and never opened our eyes again until the evening.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was {{a letter}} from Elsa Doland, too. Bubbling over with affection. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been {{tremendous}} friends. Of course, she never knew anything about my being engaged to Gerald. I lent Fillmore {{the money to buy}} that piece, which gave Elsa her first big chance, and so she's very grateful. She says, if ever she gets the opportunity of doing me a good turn... Aren't things muddled? ...|$|R
2500|$|... "When we advert {{that the}} ancient {{classical}} languages are considered {{as the foundation}} preparatory for all the sciences; that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> had schools scattered over the country for teaching these languages, which often were the ultimate term of education; that these languages are entered on {{at the age of}} nine or ten years, at which age parents would be unwilling to send their children from every part of the State to a central and distant university, and when we observe that... there are to be a plurality of them, we may well conclude that the Greek and Latin are the objects of these colleges... and that they are intended as the portico of entry to the university."—Thomas Jefferson to Wilson C. Nicholas, 1816. ME 14:452 ...|$|E
2500|$|Lord Hawke famously {{said at the}} Yorkshire Annual General Meeting in 1925: [...] "Pray God, no {{professional}} shall ever captain England. I {{love and}} admire them all, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> had an amateur skipper and when the day comes when we shall have no more amateurs captaining England {{it will be a}} thousand pities." [...] In view of this, it is perhaps surprising that, when Arthur Lupton retired {{at the end of the}} 1927 season, Hawke was one of the sponsors of the suggestion that Herbert Sutcliffe should become Yorkshire captain. In the event, there was sufficient opposition to the idea amongst the Yorkshire committee and players (some of the latter felt that Wilfred Rhodes, as senior professional, had a prior claim), that the proposal was dropped.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2005 interview, Heap said of Frou Frou [...] "(it) {{was really}} {{like a kind of}} little holiday from my own work. Guy and I, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> worked together, and then over the years, it became clear that we wanted to do a whole album together. It was very organic and {{spontaneous}} — just one of those wonderful things that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from either of us, and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see what I could do on my own. But I'm sure in the future, Guy and I will get back together to do another record, or to record a few songs together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{could never}} have told, till I was obliged to betray myself,' said Laura. 'You know, Amy, it was no engagement. We never wrote to each other, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> but one walk; it was no {{business}} of his to speak till he could hope for papa's consent to our marriage. It would have been all confusion if he had told, {{and that would have}} been only that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> loved each other with all our hearts, which every one knew before.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so, uncle? Why, {{it seems to}} me that I know all about you, just the same as if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been together, and I am sure I always told you all about myself, even when I was bad at school and got into scrapes, because you said {{particularly}} that you liked me to tell you everything, and did not want to know only the good side of me." ...|$|R
60|$|The rapids were incidents; {{the gorge}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> with us, superb cleft that it was, hewn as by some giant axe, {{notching}} the mountain chain imperiously for passage. Hour followed hour {{with the same}} setting. How the river first took it into its head to come through so manifestly unsuitable a place is a secret for the geologist to tell. But I for one wish I had been by to see.|$|R
