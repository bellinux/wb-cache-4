2500|$|It {{was first}} {{brought to light}} by Clement Usill Kingston in 1847. Kingston was a {{schoolmaster}} and amateur painter living {{in the town of}} Ashbourne, Derbyshire, after which the portrait came to be named. He wrote to Abraham <b>Wivell,</b> an authority on Shakespeare portraits, explaining the circumstances in which he claimed to have found it. According to Kingston, [...] "a friend in London sent me word that he had seen a portrait of Shakespeare, that he was positive it was a genuine picture, and that the owner only valued it as being a very fine painting. Being too poor to purchase it himself, he advised me by all means to have it." [...] He immediately purchased it. Kingston told <b>Wivell</b> that the design on the book held in the subject's hand was a combination of [...] "the crest of the Shakespeare family and the tragic mask". After examining the work, <b>Wivell</b> enthusiastically endorsed it.|$|E

5000|$|Abraham <b>Wivell</b> (1786-1849) was a British {{portrait}} painter, {{writer and}} pioneer of fire protection, credited with inventing the first effective fire escape system. After {{working as a}} hairdresser, <b>Wivell</b> {{established himself as a}} society portrait painter before concentrating his efforts on fire safety measures.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1820s <b>Wivell</b> {{turned his}} {{attention}} to fire protection, arguing, along with others, that the private fire brigades of the time were more concerned with protecting property than human life. Several voluntary groups sprung up dedicated to solving this problem. In 1836 the [...] "Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire" [...] was created with <b>Wivell</b> in charge of developing techniques for helping people escape from burning buildings. <b>Wivell</b> designed a portable fire escape, which could be brought to buildings and erected rapidly.|$|E

50|$|After visiting Stratford-upon-Avon {{to make a}} {{study of}} the tomb {{sculpture}} of Shakespeare, <b>Wivell</b> decided to create an illustrated study of all known portraits of the poet. In 1827 <b>Wivell</b> published the work under the title An inquiry into the history, authenticity, & characteristics of the Shakspeare portraits. As well as a collection of prints, the book presented a detailed examination of purported Shakespeare portraits. The book also replied the arguments of an earlier work by James Boaden. Unfortunately, <b>Wivell</b> lost a great deal on money on the venture, as the cost of printing such a richly illustrated work far exceeded the sales. However, he was saved financially by the death of his uncle, Abram <b>Wivell</b> of Camden Town, who left him his house and furniture and an lifetime annuity of £100.|$|E

50|$|Initially {{an amateur}} artist, he advertised his skills by showing {{portrait}} miniatures he had painted in his hairdressing shop window. By this means he gained commissions for portrait drawings and paintings, {{aided by the}} support of Joseph Nollekens and James Northcote. A drawing he created of Caroline of Brunswick, wife of King George IV, appealed to the queen herself, who gave <b>Wivell</b> a personal sitting. His link to the queen soon helped him achieve fame as an artist. When she was put of trial for adultery in the House of Lords, <b>Wivell</b> sneaked in among the lawyers and made sketches of the leading figures involved. These were published to illustrate the sensational case. The popular feeling in favour of Caroline led to good sales. <b>Wivell</b> later depicted other figures in the news, including Arthur Thistlewood, {{a leader of the}} Cato Street conspiracy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wivell</b> {{subsequently}} {{became an}} established society portraitist, painting royalty and aristocracy. He also painted nearly 200 portraits of MPs for a view depicting the House of Commons in session, {{which was published}} as a print. Most of Wivell's portraits were highly finished works in pencil, though he did paint some oils and attempted to make some etchings.|$|E
5000|$|Born in Marylebone, London, <b>Wivell</b> {{was forced}} to work {{from an early age}} after his father died leaving his mother in poverty. He worked on a farm from the age of six, and did various jobs in London as a child. In 1799, he was apprenticed to a wigmaker, which at the time was part of normal hairdressing. After {{completing}} his seven-year apprenticeship, he set up his own hairdressing salon.|$|E

50|$|He created {{demonstration}} {{models of}} the design to illustrate a series of lectures on fire-fighting that he gave in 1836. The ladder was mounted on a wheeled chariot. Once at the scene, a fly ladder was swung into position with ropes. A rescued person could be quickly passed down through a canvas chute that hung below the ladder, allowing a rapid flow of escapees. 85 fire escape stations were established in London by the society containing escape ladders on the <b>Wivell</b> design. Other cities also acquired Wivell's design.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} fire escapes of any type was invented in 18th-century England. In 1784, Daniel Maseres, of England, invented a machine called a fire escape, which, being {{fastened}} to the window, would enable a person to descend to the street without injury. Abraham <b>Wivell</b> created an improved design, including an escape chute, after becoming superintendent of the [...] "Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire." [...] Henry Vieregg patented the first US fire escape in Grand Island, NE in November 8, 1898 , serial number 681,672, which was designed for traveling businessmen.|$|E
50|$|The present hall {{dates back}} to circa 1500; it was {{acquired}} by the Highmore family in 1540, by James Spedding (squire to Lord Egremont) in 1748 and then by Sir Frederick Fletcher-Vane (who had the courtyard and chapel added) in 1796. Ownership then passed to John Boustead (who owned tea plantations in Ceylon and who had the hall extensively enlarged) in 1850. It then passed to Thomas Hartley (a local mine owner who had the hall extended to the designs of Charles John Ferguson) in 1880, to the <b>Wivell</b> family (owners of the Keswick Hotel) in 1926 and to the Graves family (the current owners) in 1976. It is now a hotel.|$|E
50|$|He {{received}} from private tutors a thorough classical and modern education, and early showed a certain aptitude {{for the analysis}} of economic problems, but abandoned such pursuits for the more lucrative occupation of an equity draughtsman. He was admitted on 9 Feb. 1802 student at Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the bar on 2 May 1807, and elected bencher on 15 Jan. 1835, having taken silk in the previous Michaelmas vacation. He was a singularly conscientious as well as able equity practitioner, and took an active part in the administration of the affairs of his inn, particularly in the planning and promotion of the building of the new hall. He died without issue, though twice married, on 19 July 1846. His remains were interred on 24 July in Lincoln's Inn chapel. His portrait, engraved from a drawing by Abraham <b>Wivell,</b> is in the British Museum.|$|E
