5|$|Arbroath {{was made}} a royal burgh in 1178 by King William the Lion {{at the same time}} as the Abbey was established. The burgh of regality {{permitted}} the monks to hold a weekly market, dispense basic justice and to establish a harbour. In 1559, the town's burgh of regality was reconfirmed in 1599 by King James VI of Scotland. A provost and a town council were appointed and it <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> Aberbrothock became a fully fledged royal burgh.|$|E
5|$|If {{traditional}} Hunanese customs were adhered to, the baby's {{head would}} have been shaved after four weeks, with a small tuft of hair left on the crown and {{at the nape of}} the neck; it <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that the child {{would have been}} officially given its name. According to tradition, visitors probably would have gathered for this ceremony, bringing gifts of money, pork, fish, fruit, and decorated eggs.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would become less controversial {{and return to the}} focus on relationships and family dynamics. It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that the character of Declan was created and actress Jane Hall would play his on-screen mother Rebecca Napier. The characters were to create a family unit for then, already existing character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E
5|$|In {{between the}} birth of James and Reuben, Morris became {{severely}} ill. During his illness, a man named Gad Farnam moved into the Morris's home to care for him day and night. The two families became very close and Gad's daughter Rhoda, only five {{years old at the}} time of the illness, later became Morris's second wife. It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> in Morris's life that he accepted that he would never realize his early dream of becoming a minister.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> {{that the}} Non-Intervention Committee {{was created to}} uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent. It also removed {{the need for a}} {{declaration}} of neutrality (which would have granted the Nationalists and Republicans control over neutrals in the areas they controlled), and had little legal standing. In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E

5|$|After a {{successful}} first contest, the second faced several location problems. The event originally {{should have been}} organised by British broadcaster ITV in Manchester. ITV then announced that due to financial and scheduling reasons, the contest would not {{take place in the}} United Kingdom after all. It is also thought that another factor to their decision was the previous years' audience ratings for ITV which were below the expected amount. The EBU approached Croatian broadcaster HRT, who had won the previous contest, to stage the event in Zagreb; though it later emerged that HRT had 'forgotten' to book the venue in which the contest would have taken place. It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> with five months remaining until the event would be held, that Norwegian broadcaster NRK stepped in to host the contest in Lillehammer.|$|E
5|$|Glenn Hughes and Joe Bonamassa {{first met}} at the 2006 NAMM Show in Anaheim, California, after which they jammed {{together}} at Hughes's studio in Hollywood with the idea to make music together in the future. Bonamassa also worked with Jason Bonham that year, when the drummer performed on the guitarist's fifth studio album You & Me {{on the recommendation of}} producer and mutual friend Kevin Shirley. Hughes and Bonamassa reunited three years later in November 2009, performing together at the House of Blues in Los Angeles for Guitar Center. It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that the two decided to form a band. The idea of enlisting Bonham and keyboardist Derek Sherinian to complete the band's lineup was suggested by Shirley, after a second guitarist was briefly considered instead of a keyboardist.|$|E
5|$|In May 1098, Kerbogha of Mosul {{approached}} Antioch {{to relieve}} the siege. Bohemond bribed an Armenian guard named Firouz to surrender his tower, and in June the crusaders entered the city and killed most of the inhabitants. However, {{only a few days}} later the Muslims arrived, laying siege to the former besiegers. According to Raymond D'Aguilers, it <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that a monk named Peter Bartholomew claimed to have discovered the Holy Lance in the city, and although some were skeptical, this was seen as a sign that they would be victorious.|$|E

5|$|In September, the UN Forces {{launched}} another counteroffensive {{with the}} 24th Infantry Division {{at the center}} of the line, west of the Hwachon Reservoir. Flanked by the South Korean 2nd and 6th Divisions, the 24th advanced past Kumwha, engaging the 20th and 27th CPV Armies. In November, the Chinese attempted to counter this attack, but were unsuccessful. It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> after several successive counteroffensives that saw both sides fighting intensely over the same ground, that the two sides started serious peace negotiations. In late 1951, the 1st Cavalry Division, depleted after having suffered 16,000 casualties so far in the conflict, was relegated to the Far East reserve to rebuild. It was replaced by the 45th Infantry Division of the Oklahoma Army National Guard, which was newly arrived in the theater.|$|E

B. indicated that he understood and then proceeded to provide further details about the crime, including the location of the stolen property. J. D. B. wrote a statement at the investigator's request. He was allowed to leave to catch the bus home.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> {{that the}} team had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, {{who had worked with}} Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E

5|$|Towing two scows at {{the time}} of the collision, Stella Maris responded {{immediately}} to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6. The tug's captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized they were not equipped to fight the fire with their one small hose and quickly backed off from the burning Mont Blanc. They were approached by a whaler from HMS Highflyer and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS Niobe. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of Niobe agreed to secure a line to the French ship's stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire. The five-inch (127-millimetre) hawser initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten-inch (254-millimetre) hawser came down. It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that the blast occurred.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} 2004 season opener, the Giants, behind Warner, {{went on to}} win five of their next six games to stand at 5–2. The Giants then lost two close games, to the Bears and Cardinals, to drop to 5–4. It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that Coughlin {{announced}} that Eli Manning would become the starter {{for the rest of the}} season. Manning struggled in his first four starts, and the Giants did not score more than 14 points in any game. However, they played better in narrow losses to the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals. The Giants won their final game of the year against rival Dallas, to finish the season 6–10. Top performers on the season included Tiki Barber, who established a personal career high in rushing yardage with 1,518yards, and also contributed 52 catches and 15 touchdowns. Following the season Ron Dayne was released. Dayne had experienced several mediocre seasons while Shaun Alexander, who the Giants bypassed to draft Dayne, had developed into a consistent Pro Bowler.|$|E
5|$|Far more to Mao's liking {{were the}} {{accounts}} of war and banditry found in the Four Great Classical Novels, including Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, and Water Margin; while also steeped in Confucian morality, they emphasised the need to fight for justice in society, {{and it is possible}} that these texts inspired his interest in history. According to his later account, it <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that he attained a strong belief in justice; he began to divide his lunch in two to share with a poorer boy who could not afford food. On another occasion, he got into a physical fight with an older classmate; this greatly upset his mother, who held pacifist beliefs. According to his later account, at one point he rebelled when the teacher tried to punish him for disobedience; rather than permitting himself to be beaten with a rod, he marched out of the school and into the wooded mountains. He remained there for three days, until being discovered by a family member and brought home.|$|E

5|$|In September, the UN Forces {{launched}} another counteroffensive {{with the}} 24th Infantry Division {{at the center}} of the line, west of the Hwachon Reservoir. Three of I Corps divisions advanced behind the 24th Infantry Division in Operation Commando. Flanked by the South Korean 2nd and 6th Divisions, the 24th advanced past Kumwha, engaging the 20th and 27th CPV Armies. These attacks were fierce, though enemy resistance was not as strong as it had been in previous offensives. In November, the Chinese attempted to counter this attack, but were unsuccessful. It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> after several successive counteroffensives that saw both sides fighting intensely over the same ground, that the two sides started serious peace negotiations. In January 1952, IX Corps was again reorganized, now containing the 7th Infantry Division and the newly arrived 45th Infantry Division. Two months later, it was reorganized with the 2nd Infantry Division, the 40th Infantry Division, and the South Korean 2nd, 3rd, and Capital Divisions.|$|E
5|$|In late April, the Chinese {{launched}} a major counterattack. Though the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions {{were able to}} hold their ground against the Chinese 9th CPV Army Corps, the South Korean 6th Infantry Division, to the east, was destroyed by the 13th CPV Army Corps, which penetrated the line and threatened to encircle the 24th and 25th divisions. The 1st Marine Division and 27th British Commonwealth Brigade were able to drive the 13th Army Corps back while the 24th and 25th divisions withdrew on 25 April. The UN forces' line was moved back to Seoul but managed to hold. In September, the UN forces {{launched a}}nother counteroffensive with the 24th Infantry Division {{at the center of}} the line, west of the Hwachon Reservoir. Flanked by the South Korean 2nd and 6th Divisions, the 24th advanced past Kumwha, engaging the 20th and 27th CPV Armies.

5|$|Leo VI died in May 912 and was {{succeeded by}} his brother Alexander (r. 912–913), who reigned for {{little over a year}} before dying in June 913. Leo's empress, Zoe Karbonopsina, and his son and titular co-emperor, Constantine VII (r. 913–959), were sidelined during the reign of Alexander, who also {{restored}} Zoe's old adversary, Nicholas Mystikos, as Patriarch of Constantinople. Thus, at the death of Alexander (6 June 913), with Constantine VII not even eight years old, a power struggle ensued between Zoe and Patriarch Nicholas, who headed the regency council. It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that Constantine Doukas launched a rebellion aiming for the throne. The Life of Euthymius hagiography, a source hostile to Patriarch Nicholas, reports that the Patriarch was also involved, although the other Byzantine sources include this as a widespread rumour rather than a fact. According to these sources, unaware that he would be appointed regent (Alexander named him to the regency council on his deathbed), fearful of losing his pre-eminent position, and anxious about the military threat posed by the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon, which required a more experienced hand {{at the helm of the}} state, the Patriarch summoned Doukas to assume the throne.|$|E
