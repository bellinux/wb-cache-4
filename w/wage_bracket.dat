As employees of the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, the striking food workers violated the terms of their employment which prohibited the disruption of University functions because of contractual complaints. From the workers’ perspective, they were being subjected to exploitive working conditions because of their race and <b>wage</b> <b>bracket,</b> and for this reason, the Strike was necessary as a means of restoring human dignity. [...] While it did not result in national attention, the Lenoir Strike proved a controversial instance in which the state government was forced to draw the line between maintaining order at public institutions and protecting human rights under the law.|$|E

30|$|According to the Federal Holidays Act (Bundesurlaubsgesetz), {{the minimum}} {{entitlement}} to paid recreational holiday is 20 working {{days per year}} based on a five-day work week. Many collective or individual agreements, however, include more favourable regulations. Overall, the annual leave entitlement for workers covered by collective agreements in Germany is six weeks per year (cf. Schnitzlein 2011). The Collective Agreement Archive of the WSI reports this collectively agreed annual paid holiday leave of employees, distinguishing basic and actual total leave by industries. Collective agreements can determine basic leave for an employee, which is then raised {{in one or more}} stages to the actual total leave. Requirements for an increase can be age, duration of affiliation with the enterprise, <b>wage</b> <b>bracket,</b> etc. Based on details provided by the WSI, basic and actual total leave are weighted on a  40 / 60 basis to obtain the overall leave, which is a plausible proportion also according to analyses of the GSOEP.|$|E

It analyses the effects of these programmes and examines whether they can be transplanted to continental European countries. ...|$|R
40|$|Results of labour {{appraisal}} {{provide a}} foundation for determination of wages, and more precisely — they should be a basis for constructing pay schedules. There are various techniques of fixing basic wage rates according to results of appraisal, and their choice cannot be indifferent from the motivational point of view. The {{aim of this study}} is to present techniques of fixing one- and multi-level (<b>bracket)</b> <b>wage</b> rates. Multi-level wage rates, the application of which should be as wide as one-level wage rates, have received most attention in this study. The author analyzes four variants in construction of fork wage rates: 1) based on constant and equal scales of <b>wage</b> <b>brackets</b> for a given job and on constant difference in amounts of money between the lowest wage rates with regard to consecutive categories,- 2) based on constant scale of <b>wage</b> <b>brackets</b> and on constant percentage difference between the lowest wage rates for consecutive categories (work posts) 3) based on constant difference in amounts of money between the lowest wage rates for consecutive work posts and on constant percentage scale of wage-rate brackets at a given work post; 4) based on constant percentage difference between the lowest wage rates for consecutive work posts as well as on constant percentage scale of wage rates at a given post. The last-mentioned variant provides the strongest motivation and, therefore, the author recommends its application in relation to the managerial cadre.

40|$|AbstractStructuring an {{accurate}} wage management system is one {{the most important}} steps in managerial activities of human resource management. This is based on job evaluation {{which is used to}} determine the relative importance of each job in a company. Job evaluation can be defined as a multi-criteria decision making problem. However, the evaluation processes, being subject to the diversity of managers’ assessment are often resulting in pay inequity. This outcome can be circumvented by utilizing a fuzzy job evaluation system.

Job evaluation can be also defined as a multicriteria decision-making problem. However, according to the diversity of managers’ assessment, the evaluation processes are often resulting in pay inequity. This outcome can be circumvented by utilizing a fuzzy job evaluation system. In this study, one of the more robust multicriteria decision-making methods, Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), is performed in job evaluation system in order to rank predetermined 13 criteria. The fuzzy <b>wage</b> <b>brackets</b> are developed and inserted into the process which is obtained from the results of mathematical model to designate the bounds for predefined 86 jobs. Eventually an accurate payment system is proposed for a company in steel industry by using Fuzzy Regression Analysis (FRA) ...|$|R
3000|$|... 26 There are {{a number}} of other {{possible}} explanations for the lack of an obvious spike at the relevant minima for these sectors in South Africa. Firstly, the smoothing parameter used in the construction of the kernel density graphs may be obscuring a spike at the minimum. In order to control for the possibility that the bandwidth is too large and obscuring a spike, the bandwidth used in the construction of the Kernal plots was reduced to a fraction of the software default bandwidth (The bandwidth used in the plots presented here is the reduced bandwidth set to 0.02). Secondly, there may be an issue surrounding the reporting of <b>wages</b> in <b>brackets</b> versus point estimates in the Labour Force Survey. As noted above, around 12 to 16 percent of workers reported their <b>wages</b> in <b>brackets</b> in each wave of the survey. Estimation of the kernel density plots excluding wages that were reported in bands however, did not reveal a significant spike.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{begins with}} an {{overview}} of a field research project which {{has focused on the}} problem of land scarcity as it affects the people of one agricultural community in East Bunyore, Kakamega District. Data from a previous paper is briefly reviewed indicating a very strong reliance on non-farm income for households in the sample area. People in the sample community see their economic well-being tied to income not from their land but rather from wage employment or self-employment. The role of kinship and social networks as aids in securing employment is considered. For males in the sample, the pattern of job distribution both spatially and typologically suggests that such networks are very important at the clan and sub-clan levels in providing employment information, training, and physical and moral support in helping to secure jobs. At the same time, the people of the community place an extremely high value on education for they see it as the means of obtaining a good job. Despite this, data on educational achievement show a relatively small percentage of males receiving secondary schooling. The fact that secondary education is a prerequisite for essentially all white collar employment means that employment opportunities in these fields are limited only to {{a small portion of the}} sample population. The data point to a trend of widening income disparity among households in the sample community stemming from differential access to education and employment in the higher <b>wage</b> <b>brackets...</b>|$|R
30|$|Monthly <b>wages</b> {{reported}} in <b>brackets</b> in the LFS are transformed into point estimates by random allocation to a uniform distribution within the bracket to maintain variation. 7 This accounts for {{between five and}} {{ten percent of the}} sample in each wave, on average. All monthly wages are then combined and converted into hourly wages, which we use for analysis. Employed individuals reporting zero or missing wages are excluded.|$|R

The tax relief provided by the tax reform of 2016 will thus overcompensate the effect of bracket creep in 2016, but not the overall effect accumulated between 2009 and 2015.
