To many older homosexuals and {{many members of the}} Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing.

But {{at the same}} time, Spartan women had an unusual level of rights. It's a paradox that they <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> people who in many ways were fascist, but they were the bulwark against the fall of democracy. The closest comparison you can draw {{in terms of our}} own military today is to think of the red-caped Spartans as being like our special-ops forces. They're these almost superhuman characters with a tremendous warrior ethic, who were unquestionably the best fighters in Greece. I didn't want to render Sparta in overly accurate terms, because ultimately I do want you to root for the Spartans. I couldn't show them being quite as cruel as they were. I made them as cruel as I thought a modern audience could stand." ...|$|E

The adverb [...] "very" [...] has dropped from the language, and emphasis is created by reduplication ("bad bad" [...] instead of [...] "very bad"). Linguistic relativity has yet to set in, so that Family lacks words to describe much of their world ("Cold Dark" [...] instead of [...] "high, dark mountain wreathed in glaciers").
