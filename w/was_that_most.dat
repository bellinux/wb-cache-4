5|$|The American Stud Book, the {{registration}} book for American Thoroughbreds, was not founded until 1873, much {{later than the}} General Stud Book, and the rules for registration required only that a horse have five generations of ancestors in the American Stud Book or other national stud books, unlike the General Stud Book rules. In addition, many breeding records were destroyed during the American Civil War, as fighting during that conflict took place in noted American Thoroughbred breeding centers. The result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> American Thoroughbreds in 1913 were unable to show an unblemished pedigree according to the General Stud Book rules. Adding to the problem {{was the fact that}} American horses were beginning to win the big horse races in England, starting with Iroquois, who won the 1881 Epsom Derby.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the Civil War in 1865, the U.S. {{government}} {{auctioned off}} the hundreds of ships it had requisitioned during the war at firesale prices, depressing the market and leaving American shipyards with no work.

The shipbuilding industry in New York was particularly badly affected by the slump, being practically wiped out in the ensuing years.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{features}} of the band <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> members were talented at singing and at concerts the lead vocals were shared, between mainly Holden and Jones, although Jones sang the majority of the songs in 1977–1986. Jones with a falsetto and broad range was one of the under-rated vocalists in Australian rock music history. With Geoff's bass vocal talents, OL' 55 produced complex harmonies, sometimes managing four or five piece vocal arrangements.|$|E
25|$|One reason many First Lords {{chose not}} to live in Number 10 <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> were peers who owned homes {{superior}} in size and quality.

Most lent it to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, others to lesser officials, and still others to friends or relatives.|$|E

25|$|Siborne stats {{that the}} {{struggle}} at Ligny was undoubtedly of a most desperate and sanguinary character.

25|$|This {{provided}} a practical detection range of 100 miles, {{just enough to}} cover the Hanoi urban area and the main MiG base at Phúc Yên. A major disadvantage of this arrangement, however, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> MiG contacts were beyond the 70-mile range of the Big Eye's APS-45 Height Finder radar, so that they were unable to provide this crucial data to USAF strike forces. Furthermore, technical shortcomings in the EC-121D's systems precluded either controlling a fighter intercept or identifying a specific flight under attack.|$|E
25|$|An early {{problem for}} the escapees <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> were unable to find {{the way into the}} railway station, until {{daylight}} revealed it was in a recess of the side wall to an underground pedestrian tunnel. Consequently, many of them missed their night time trains, and decided either to walk across country or wait on the platform in daylight. Another unanticipated problem was that this was the coldest March for thirty years, with snow up to five feet deep, so the escapees had no option but to leave the cover of woods and fields and stay on the roads.|$|E

25|$|As part of {{this review}} process, Durban has now changed its {{implementation}} of the free basic water policy: Households living in properties that are valued above a certain threshold now must prove that their income is below the poverty limit, {{in order to continue}} to receive free basic water. The reason for the change <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of those benefiting from free basic water were not poor. They used less than amount of free basic water - 9 cubic meters per month in the case of Durban - {{for the simple reason that}} there were two or less residents in the household.|$|E
25|$|There is {{controversy}} {{about whether there}} was sufficient time for more effective emergency evacuation. The main problem <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the personnel who {{had the authority to}} order evacuation had been killed when the first explosion destroyed the control room. This was a consequence of the platform design, which did not include blast walls. Another contributing factor was that the nearby connected platforms Tartan and Claymore continued to pump gas and oil to Piper Alpha until its pipeline ruptured in the heat in the second explosion. Their operations crews did not believe they had authority to shut off production, even though they could see that Piper Alpha was burning.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, Bartow's {{growth was}} modest, {{especially}} {{in comparison to the}} rest of the county and state. While other cities in Polk County aggressively annexed adjacent land and allowed rapid growth, the government of Bartow generally took a more cautious approach. Another reason why Bartow's growth had been slow <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the land surrounding the city was owned by phosphate mining companies making residential growth impractical. Although Bartow had been the largest city in Polk county in 1900, by the 1910 U.S. Census Lakeland had surpassed Bartow in population. Bartow remained the second largest city in the county until sometime in the 1950s when Winter Haven become more populous than Bartow.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Did Southern African {{states have}} the {{developmental}} focus {{to make their}} countries rich? My hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a clear focus on making the country rich (with networked infrastructure, effective and functioning technology, functioning health and educational systems, high national income, diversified economy) would dictate that the priorities of the state be ordered in a certain way. My argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> Southern African states were historically not properly focused on making their countries rich. My other argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of them <b>are</b> slowly shifting their focus towards making their countries rich...|$|R

25|$|After {{the end of}} the Civil War in 1865, the U.S. {{government}} {{auctioned off}} the hundreds of ships it had requisitioned during the war at firesale prices, depressing the market and leaving American shipyards with no work. The result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> American shipyards, along with marine engine specialists, failed. Not only the Westervelt shipyard, but the whole shipbuilding industry in New York was badly affected by the slump, being practically wiped out in the ensuing years. As the demise of shipbuilding after the war afforded him little opportunity to recover from his losses, the firm was dissolved in 1868, with no large surplus of assets. By this time Westervelt had constructed 247 ships with his partners, more than any other American shipbuilder in his day.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} number of people inquiring after other people, the {{received}} wisdom of the wee morning hours <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most,</b> if not all, people had gotten out alive. Among the police and fire fighters, this idea stemmed largely from the last searches of District Engineer Farley: no one had been seen in the parquet or parquet circle. No one had been seen in the dress circle. It was true that no one had physically checked the gallery, but people had called up there and received no reply, nor were there sounds of movement. The inclination was to hope for the best. True, when Charles Vine dropped himself off the gallery there had still been hundreds of people struggling on the staircase, but Vine had sought medical assistance for his deep cuts, so what he knew was not general knowledge. When the morning papers went to press, none carried news of casualties.|$|E
25|$|There {{developed}} a split among UDF elected officials, between those such as Gilles de Robien and Pierre-Christophe Baguet, who favored closer {{ties with the}} UMP, and those such as François Bayrou who advocate independent centrist policies, while others such as Jean Dionis du Séjour tried steering for a middle course. The most likely reason {{for many of the}} UDF's elected officials favouring close ties with the UMP <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the UDF's elected positions are obtained through cooperative alliances with UMP. However, the party's base overwhelmingly favored independence. At the congress of Lyon, on 28–29 January 2006, 91% of the members voted to retain the independence of the UDF from the UMP and transform it into an independent centrist party. This outcome meant that the orientation of the evolving UDF would be that of a social-liberal party aiming for a balance between social-democratic and conservative policies.|$|E

25|$|Ralph Burger {{attempted}} to reverse downward tonnage figures by reintroducing trading stamps, creating A's Plaid Stamps. However, by late 1962, the initial sales gains evaporated {{and the six}} outside directors threatened to resign unless Burger retired. When Burger left in May 1963, the stock was trading in the $30s. Burger was replaced with a succession of presidents who were unable to stem the downward spiral. In 1971, the board turned to William J. Kane, who joined A in 1934 as a full-time store clerk. Kane believed that A could be turned around by focusing on basic store operations, including cleanliness, product availability, customer service, and courtesy. When his program stalled, Kane implemented a strategy to substantially cut prices by converting A to a warehouse store concept that became known as W.E.O. Warehouse Economy Outlet (or Where Economy Originates). The problem <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> A were not large enough to properly implement the program; losses quickly mounted. In early 1973, the stock dropped to $17, and Charles Bluhdorn of Gulf+Western made a tender offer at $20 per share. Kane rejected the offer, although some stockholders thought that the offer was attractive considering A's continuing difficulties. A exited California and Washington State in 1971 and 1974, respectively, making Missouri its westernmost reach. In 1974, the corporation also left its long-time headquarters in the Graybar Building, moving to Montvale, New Jersey.|$|E
500|$|Audio {{engineer}} Russell Elevado, who {{recorded and}} mixed Voodoo, along with Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun and Common's Like Water for Chocolate, used old school recording techniques and vintage mixing gear for the albums {{in order to}} achieve the distinct sounds found in classic recorded works. While mainstream recording techniques at the time often involved the use of hi-tech digital equipment, Elevado employed the use of analog equipment, enhancement plug-ins, and a blend of live instrumentation. Notable from the production <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of it, with the exception of [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)", was recorded live with no overdubbing of its instrumentation, in contrast to contemporary R production at the time.|$|E
500|$|The {{defense of}} Maine, however, proved problematic. [...] Strong's aide William H.

[...] Several units of local militia refused the perform their assigned duties. [...] One consequence of the dispute <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> militia in the state remained under state control, and were thus paid for from state coffers at a cost that ran to $200,000 per month. [...] This further strained the state economy, which was already suffering due to the British blockade.|$|E
