500|$|MITS was now $300,000 in {{debt and}} Roberts {{was looking for a}} new hit product. He decided to return to the kit market with a low cost computer. The target {{customer}} <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> [...] "some assembly required" [...] was a desirable feature. Roberts had looked at the Intel 4004 for calculators and thought the Intel 8008 was limited and difficult to work with. Intel had just released the 8080, their first microprocessor that could be a general purpose computer. The target price of this complete computer kit had to be under $400. To meet this price, Roberts agreed to order 1000 microprocessors from Intel for $75 each. Roberts and his head engineer, Bill Yates, began designing the computer. The company was down to 20 employees and a bank loan for $60,000 financed the design and initial production of the new computer.|$|E
500|$|Of his {{approach}} to directing the film, Lane explains, [...] "Thunderbirds Are Go was done like an episode but on a bigger scale. Whereas we <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it might be nice to do a particular shot on the series but couldn't afford to, with Thunderbirds Are Go we just did it because we had the money." [...] For the Swinging Star hall sequence, all the visual elements except Alan and Lady Penelope are displayed in black and white, with background characters appearing {{in the form of}} enlarged still photographs. On the surrealism of the Swinging Star scenes, aspects of which include pink space clouds made of dry ice and a giant guitar on which Cliff Richard and The Shadows perform part of [...] "Shooting Star", Anderson explains that the production team [...] "recreated a Busby Berkeley sequence", and that the appearance of puppet versions of real-life celebrities boosted the publicity value of the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} also {{intended to}} tease {{the audience that}} after the brutal killing of Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) from the previous episode, they <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> things could not get worse for the team, until the nuclear threat in the finale. The scene where the team breaks Connie out was intended to show the audience that the protagonists {{are willing to go}} to extreme measures to stop serious threats. Cross wanted to make it a very pure Spooks episode by setting up the entire plot in one scene, and then include a chase throughout London between FSB officers and the main characters. Cross enjoyed creating the FSB team featured in the episode, especially as he created them as a Russian version of the Spooks protagonists, but also make their base much more lit with windows. The bomb defusal scene was originally set at a graveyard, but the producers decided {{it would be best to}} set it underground. Though it took several rewrites, the script remained [...] "fundamentally the same" [...] throughout the writing process.|$|E

500|$|Executive Producer Sara Colleton {{said it was}} {{difficult}} to kill off a long-standing character, but they felt [...] "this is where Dexter needed to be taken".

Hall called the ending a [...] "really bold stroke" [...] that would reset the stage of the series just as the Dexter Morgan character began to feel he could live with an emotional connection to his wife and family.

500|$|Further into chapter 38, Gangleri asks if Odin consumes {{the same}} meals as the einherjar. High {{responds}} that Odin gives {{the food on}} his table to his two wolves Geri and Freki, and that Odin himself needs no food, for Odin gains sustenance from wine {{as if it were}} drink and meat. High then quotes another stanza from Grímnismál in reference. In chapter 39, Gangleri asks what the einherjar drink that is as plentiful as their food, and if they drink water. High responds that it is strange that Gangleri is asking if Odin, the All-Father, would invite kings, earls, and other [...] "men of rank" [...] to his home and give them water to drink. High says that he [...] "swears by his faith" [...] that many who come to Valhalla <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he paid a high price for a drink of water if there were no better beverages there, after having died of wounds and in agony. High continues that atop Valhalla stands the goat Heiðrún, and it feeds on the foliage of the tree called Læraðr. From Heiðrún's udders flow mead that fills a vat a day. The vat is so large that all of the einherjar are able to drink to their fullness from it.|$|E
500|$|Burke's {{law firm}} had {{employed}} Joseph A. Martinez, {{a real estate}} tax appeal attorney, as a full-time partner since about 1977, when in 1981 Mayor Jane Byrne appointed Martinez to replace the resigning 31st Ward Alderman Chester Kuta. Martinez served out the remainder of Kuta's term but declined to run for re-election when the ward committeeman endorsed a challenger. Between 1985 and 1992, Martinez received $91,000 in wages and benefits for doing little or no work for City Council committees, and was a target of Operation Haunted Hall. In April 1995, after the federal subpoena of Council committee personnel records, Martinez returned the $91,000, sending cash to City Hall in three installments. He was charged and pleaded guilty on January 23, 1997. In his plea agreement, he admitted he was a ghost payroller on City Council committees, starting with the Finance Committee in 1987, {{and said that he}} was employed in each committee job [...] "in order to receive health insurance". Martinez's attorney said Burke got Martinez the jobs because Burke's law firm did not provide health insurance. In a statement, Burke wrote, [...] "A memorandum filed in Mr. Martinez's case [...] asserted that I participated in a scheme that gave rise to these charges. This allegation is untrue. I have done nothing wrong in connection with this matter." [...] Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Mike Royko wrote, [...] "You <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a bright fellow such as Burke - whose father was a ward boss and an alderman - would know better..." ...|$|E

500|$|Just {{before midnight}} on 2 September, the mutineers messaged the Chilean {{government}} {{with a more}} [...] "sophisticated" [...] list of twelve demands. Meanwhile, further south, junior members of the navy in the main naval base of Talcahuano joined the mutiny, taking several vessels in the process. Several of these sailed north to join the other rebels, while two cruisers, a few destroyers and submarines remained to guard the base. Other bases joined the now-full-fledged rebellion as well, including the Second Air Group based in Quintero. With so many rebels appearing, it was feared by many that the plethora of unemployed workers would join. The government attempted to solicit aid from the United States {{in the form of}} military intervention or war materiel (including two submarines and bombs capable of penetrating the armor of Almirante Latorre), but they were rebuffed both publicly and privately. Acting Vice President Manuel Trucco now found himself in an undesirable position; he had to defeat the rebels before more units joined and bolstered their forces, but if he was too harsh, there was a risk that the populace <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> his policies were too similar to the former dictator Ibáñez del Campo. Trucco decided on a path of reconciliation. He sent a naval admiral, Edgardo von Schroeders, to negotiate with the mutineers. They met on board Almirante Latorre, where von Schroeders, seeing a potential split between sailors angry over their pay versus others with a more political agenda, tried to divide them along these lines and get them to surrender. However, a plea from the approaching southern fleet, asking for them to wait before any possible settlement, sealed the matter for the time being and von Schroders flew back to the capital.|$|E
500|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The plot of the production was criticized by a film reviewer The New York Dramatic Mirror because the boy grows up unaware that his stepfather had died or {{that her mother had}} moved to the city in search of work. The reviewer states, [...] "One <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he would have kept in communication with his mother if he loved her so much, but it appears he did not..." [...] The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast includes both Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane, two early leading actors of the Thanhouser Company. Carey L. Hastings, real name Carey Tidball, was a sister of Gertrude Thanhouser and was an actress that was featured in numerous Thanhouser productions. Hastings first and earliest known work was Thanhouser's St. Elmo adaptation. Hastings would not have another known credit until 1912. The Silent Era website states that Harry Benham and Maude Fealy had roles in the production. However, both of these credits are well-before those attributed by Bowers. Harry Benham is known to have joined the Thanhouser Company in 1910, but the first credit cited by Bowers is The Old Curiosity Shop in January 1911. Bowers also cites Maude Fealy having made only intermittent appearances with the first being The Early Life of David Copperfield in October 1911. Other credits amongst the cast are unknown, but most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions.|$|E
