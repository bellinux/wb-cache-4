Towards {{the end of the}} season, however, {{chairman}} Tony Fernandes identified the loss of Barton as a factor in the club's poor performance and relegation from the Premier League, saying: [...] "We missed Joey.

500|$|Starr's {{wife had}} a strong aversion to insects and McCartney {{recalled}} she was once [...] "trapped in her room {{because there was a}} fly over the door." [...] Spiders, mosquitoes and flies were present at the ashram and when Starr complained to the Maharishi he was told: [...] "For people travelling in the realm of pure consciousness, flies no longer matter very much." [...] Starr found the food [...] "impossible" [...] because he was [...] "allergic to so many different things" [...] and he and his wife left India on 1 March saying [...] "I wouldn't want anyone to think we didn't like it there;" [...] they returned home [...] "because <b>we</b> <b>missed</b> the children." [...] Their departure was precheduled by one account, but premature by others. McCartney and Asher departed in mid to late March as he needed to get back to London to supervise Apple Corps and she had a theatrical commitment. When he left he told another student, [...] "I'm a new man". Alex Mardas arrived after McCartney left, either at Lennon's invitation or on his own initiative.|$|E
500|$|The Ramones' loud, fast, {{straightforward}} musical {{style was}} influenced by pop music that the band members {{grew up listening to}} in the 1950s and 1960s, including classic rock groups such as the Beach Boys, the Who, the Beatles, the Kinks, Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones and Creedence Clearwater Revival; bubblegum acts like the 1910 Fruitgum Company and Ohio Express; and girl groups such as the Ronettes and the Shangri-Las. They also drew on the harder rock sound of the MC5, Black Sabbath, the Stooges and the New York Dolls, now known as seminal protopunk bands. The Ramones' style was in part a reaction against the heavily produced, often bombastic music that dominated the pop charts in the 1970s. [...] "We decided to start our own group because we were bored with everything we heard," [...] Joey once explained. [...] "In 1974 everything was tenth-generation Elton John, or overproduced, or just junk. Everything was long jams, long guitar solos.... <b>We</b> <b>missed</b> music like it used to be."

500|$|The xx started {{recording}} Coexist in November 2011, {{and used}} a photography studio in North London to record the songs they had put together. They later used the rehearsal space in East London to practice playing the songs live. They recorded for six months in London and intended to finish before their scheduled music festival appearances for 2012. The xx's direction for the album was partly inspired by the electronic dance scene that occurred while they toured for their first album, {{as well as the}} live DJ sets of Smith, who was mostly listening to dark Chicago house music at the time. According to him, [...] "We left [...] when we were 17 and <b>we</b> <b>missed</b> out on that chunk of our lives when everyone else was partying." [...] However, he insisted that [...] "we're not looking to make people dance." [...] They were also influenced by pop-reggae band UB40, folk act White Hinterland, and neo soul artist Van Hunt, all of whom they listened to while recording Coexist. Croft viewed the music as a continuation of their debut, [...] "developed, but [...] like completely a world away".|$|E

Following a series of tornados destroying homes and businesses throughout their state in 2011, Alabama assembled a benefit concert in Birmingham, called Bama Rising. Featuring the band's first set since 2004, alongside Luke Bryan, Sheryl Crow and Brad Paisley, the concert raised $2.1 million. [...] "I guess we realized that maybe <b>we</b> <b>missed</b> the playing... and five or six years had gone by and we were like, 'Maybe that wasn't as bad as we remember it being,'" [...] said Gentry. In celebration of the group's 40th anniversary, Alabama resumed touring in 2013 for the Back to the Bowery tour, referencing the Myrtle Beach club where they first became professional musicians. They also undertook a short cruise, The Alabama & Friends Festival at Sea, which left for the Bahamas on Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Pearl ship. In addition, the band released Alabama & Friends, a tribute album encompassing covers from newer artists such as Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line, in addition to two new tracks by Alabama.|$|E
500|$|During {{its initial}} run of episodes, Glee fans lobbied for the Broadway actress (Idina Menzel) to be {{cast as the}} {{biological}} mother of Rachel Berry, due to the strong resemblance between her and Michele. Series creator Ryan Murphy commented to the media that he had met with Menzel, by December 2009, the break in the first season, but had not yet decided upon a role for her. The actress was ultimately cast as the coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, with Murphy comparing her character to Faye Dunaway's character, Diana Christensen, in Network. Menzel makes her first appearance in [...] "Hell-O". On July 15, 2011, {{it was announced that}} Menzel would be returning to Glee in the third season [...] "for a major arc that could span as many as 10-12 episodes".

500|$|Although {{originally}} {{planned to be}} shown in cinema and television advertisements, 10:10 removed the film from their website and YouTube later on 1 October 2010. On Friday 2 October, 10:10 placed a notice on their website saying, [...] "Many people found the resulting film extremely funny, but unfortunately some didn't and we sincerely apologise to anybody we have offended. [...] At 10:10 we're all about trying new and creative ways of getting people to take action on climate change. Unfortunately in this instance <b>we</b> <b>missed</b> the mark. Oh well, we live and learn." [...] This was criticised as a non-apology apology by Michelle Malkin in the Litchfield County Register and Andrew Revkin in an opinion piece in the New York Times. [...] A spokesman for 10:10 also denied that the withdrawal had been planned from the beginning in order to generate publicity. After removing the video from YouTube, 10:10 issued a statement: [...] "We won't be making any attempt to censor or remove other versions currently in circulation on the internet". Then, on Monday 5 October 10:10 director Eugenie Harvey issued a second, more comprehensive apology, stating: [...] "We are... sorry to our corporate sponsors, delivery partners and board members, who have been implicated in this situation despite having no involvement in the film's production or release." ...|$|E

It was interesting to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that <b>we</b> <b>missed</b> a good opportunity". He further commented that [...] "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story when they got back to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{suggestion}} of manager Lenny Poncher and Hassinger, The Electric Prunes agreed to record a concept album that integrated Gregorian music into psychedelic pop, with the belief it would launch them into commercial success. Poncher recruited David Axelrod, a formally neo-classically trained musician, to compose all of the material for the project. The result, Mass in F Minor, was a complex arrangement of religious-based rock, which was sung entirely in Latin. Although the band did record the songs [...] "Kyrie Eleison", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Credo", the intricate orchestration proved to be too difficult and time-consuming for the group. As a consequence, Hassinger enlisted the Canadian group, The Collectors, among other session musicians, in completing the album, although Lowe, Tulin, and Weakley did contribute to every track. Mass in F Minor was released in January 1968 and reached number 135 on the Billboard 200. An eerie version of the opening track, [...] "Kyrie Eleison", became somewhat of an underground favorite when it appeared in the soundtrack for the counterculture film, Easy Rider. The Electric Prunes performed with the new songs in concert just once, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, which Tulin described: [...] "From the outset the performance was a disaster. <b>We</b> <b>missed</b> the intro on the first song and it never got any better. Amp speakers blew, charts fell off music stands and everyone was, in general, in a complete state of confusion. Ended up each song turned into one long jam. I think we were, at times, {{all in the same}} key. I made my way over to the four celli and four French horns and told them to 'jam in E.' Somehow we would hit a break and James would manage a vocal". As a result of financial and musical issues, Weakley and Lowe left the group in early 1968. Tulin and Williams finished a tour with a line-up that also included Kenny Loggins and Jeremy Stuart, but by mid-1968 they too departed the group.|$|E

2500|$|On 27 March 2007 a {{cryogenic}} magnet support {{designed and}} provided by Fermilab and KEK broke during an initial pressure test involving {{one of the}} LHC's inner triplet (focusing quadrupole) magnet assemblies. No one was injured. Fermilab director Pier Oddone stated [...] "In this case we are dumbfounded that <b>we</b> <b>missed</b> some very simple balance of forces". This fault had been present in the original design, and remained during four engineering reviews over the following years. Analysis revealed that its design, made as thin as possible for better insulation, was {{not strong enough to}} withstand the forces generated during pressure testing. Details are available in a statement from Fermilab, with which CERN is in agreement.

2500|$|Along {{with his}} five-second time penalty for forcing Grosjean off the track, Vergne was handed one penalty point on his super licence, his {{third of the}} season.
