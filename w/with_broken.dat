5|$|In {{this period}} Ruisdael started {{painting}} coastal scenes and sea-pieces, influenced by Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis. Among {{the most dramatic}} is Rough Sea at a Jetty, with a restricted palette of only black, white, blue and a few brown earth colours. However, forest scenes remain a subject of choice, such as the Hermitage's most famous Ruisdael, A Wooded Marsh, dated 1665, which depicts a primeval scene <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> birches and oaks, and branches reaching for the sky amidst an overgrown pond.|$|E
5|$|More than 300individuals {{were injured}} during the raid, {{including}} women and children; {{some of them}} in critical condition. Injured protesters were taken to the Salmaniya Medical Complex, many of them <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> limbs and open wounds. Four individuals were killed by police using shotguns, from close range. While two of them who were shot in the back, another protester was shot in the thigh and subsequently died at the SMC; the fourth {{was shot in the head}} later and died instantly. At least 25,000mourners took part at the funeral procession, which was held in Sitra on 18February for the three protesters originating from the island.|$|E

While Kiat Kun is running, Mrs Chew goes into labour, forcing Seow Fang to run across a long path littered <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> glass to find a midwife. Finally, Mrs Chew gives birth to a baby boy and Beng Soon gives Kiat Kun and Seow Fang new pairs of shoes before departing.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} {{was caused}} by a gas leak in a 30-year-old building. It severely damaged a nearby nine-story apartment building, causing it to collapse. Mónica Fein, mayor of Rosario, asked residents to avoid the area because of the risk that more buildings might collapse, and to ease the work of disaster management personnel. The streets were covered <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> glass from damaged buildings. Gas and electricity were immediately disconnected, and the national government sent an Argentine Federal Police task force to the scene.|$|E

Bishop Weig's tombstone shows obvious signs of defacement, being chipped around the edges, and <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> stonework at its base. The other tomb contains part of the ashes of Bishop of Qingdao Paul Han Xirang, OFM, the rest having been buried in his hometown, Han Village, Yucheng County, Shandong Province.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} lap {{a number of}} drivers were forced to retire <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> wheels. Both Darracq drivers, A.

Hancock crashed his Vauxhall into a tree, also breaking a wheel. Napier was once again the quickest driver around the circuit, followed by Percy Northey in a Rolls Royce, and Norman Littlejohn in the Vinot-Deguingand.|$|E
5|$|During this stage, Antoine Fauré lead {{close to}} his hometown, and 200 fans {{tried to stop the}} rest of the cyclists from {{following}} him. Garin hurt his hand during the incident, and Giovanni Gerbi was knocked unconscious, and had to give up <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> fingers. The situation was only solved after race officials fired shots in the air. Further on, nails and broken glass had been spread along the road, which caused many flat tires. Because of this help, Fauré was the first on top of the Col de la République, but was taken over by the favourites later. Aucouturier won the sprint. When the riders reached Marseille, they complained that there had been too many incidents in this stage, and the stage results should be cancelled. In the last part, they had been stopped by a large group of cyclists. Maurice Garin had been attacked, and his arm had been injured: he finished the stage steering with only one hand. There was so much confusion at the last controle post, that the exact arrival times of the cyclists were not recorded.|$|E

5|$|Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes doubled his patrol. Salovi {{was soon}} arrested, and {{informed}} on his shipmates. Hernández Morales led another sloop, intercepting Beagle off Vieques. After a battle, the pirate sloop was captured and Hernández Morales was transported to St. Thomas for trial. After being sentenced to death, he escaped from prison and disappeared for years. According to a St. Thomas resident, on February 12, 1825 the pirates retaliated by {{setting fire to}} a town on the island. That week, Neptune captured a Danish schooner belonging to W. Furniss (a company based in Saint Thomas) off the Ponce coast with a load of imported merchandise. After the assault, Cofresí and his crew abandoned the ship at sea. Later seen floating <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> masts, it was presumed lost. Some time later Cofresí and his crew boarded another ship owned by the company near Guayama, again plundering and abandoning her. Like its predecessor, it was seen near Caja de Muertos (Dead Man's Chest) before disappearing.|$|E
5|$|In the 1993–94 season, Linden scored 32 goals, {{the fifth}} time in six seasons he had scored at least 30, but his points total fell to 61 as the Canucks {{finished}} 12 points behind the division leader. Although they were the seventh seed in the playoffs, the Canucks reached the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time}} in 12 years and second time in team history. Considered the underdogs against the first place New York Rangers captained by Mark Messier, the Canucks initially fell behind three games to one but pushed the series to seven games. In game seven, Linden scored twice (the next player to get two goals in a game seven was Alex Tanguay in 2001) but the Canucks lost, 3–2. Linden finished second on the team in playoff scoring, with 12 goals and 25 points. It was revealed afterwards that Linden had played through the finals <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> ribs and torn rib cartilage.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a collision with Esteban Gutiérrez in the Australian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso was ruled out of the event <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> ribs and a pneumothorax, and as a result was replaced with McLaren reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne. Gutiérrez received a new chassis after his team found that his original chassis was too damaged to be repaired, mostly caused by the crane during the recovery process and not in the accident itself. Meanwhile, Ferrari were able to use the same engine in Kimi Räikkönen's car as they had done in Australia, even though it had caught fire following a failure of the turbo charger. Swift reactions by the team on the scene prevented damage to the combustion engine, with only the turbo changed for Bahrain. Alfonso Celis Jr. made his first appearance in a Formula One session during the first free practice for Force India.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{widening}} {{of the tower}} arches in 1270 and 1320 the tower of St.Mary's had been structurally weak. The subsequent addition of the bells and belfry and the lead-covered spire added to {{the weight of the}} tower, and the number of burials of local notables within the church and of parishioners immediately outside the church building weakened the structure further. By the 18th century the problems had become severe enough that the west arch of the south transept was blocked up in an effort the strengthen the structure, and a hollow pillar which housed the stairway to the rood loft was filled in. The tower continued to weaken, a situation made worse by the addition in 1812 of a new ring of six bells with a 17cwt(860kg) tenor bell, cast by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Iron bands were wrapped around the tower to strengthen it but these soon snapped, and by the 19th century large cracks, which had appeared in the tower, were filled <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> bricks and rubble and covered over with roughcast as an interim solution.|$|E
5|$|The 2008–09 {{season was}} a {{frustrating}} one for Phaneuf, as he recorded a career-low 11 goals and 47 points, and his poor plus-minus rating of –11 led fans to question his defensive commitment. His poor season and high salary {{also led to}} speculation that Phaneuf might be traded. In spite of his struggles, Phaneuf averaged 26 minutes and 31 seconds of ice time per game, the fourth highest in the League. He missed {{the final game of}} the Flames' 2009 Stanley Cup playoff Western Quarter-final series against the Chicago Blackhawks <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> ribs, after battling a hip injury during the regular season. Flames management defended Phaneuf, claiming that the injuries he battled affected his play.|$|E
5|$|The Gangadhara {{image is}} highly damaged, {{particularly}} {{the lower half}} of Shiva seen seated with Parvati, who is shown with four arms, two of which are broken. From the crown, a cup with a triple-headed female figure (<b>with</b> <b>broken</b> arms) to depict the three major rivers in Hindu texts. An alternate interpretation of the three bodied goddess in Gangadharamurti panel here and elsewhere is that it represents the regenerative powers of rivers in the form of Mandakini, Suradhani and Bhagavati. In this grotto scene, Shiva is sculpted and bedecked with ornaments, while gods gather to watch the cosmic source of earthly abundance. The gods and goddesses shown are identifiable from the vahana (vehicle) and icons, and they include Brahma (left), Indra (left), Vishnu (right), Saraswati, Indrani, Lakshmi, and others.|$|E

5|$|The second assault proved no more successful. The red-coated English and the blue-coated Dutch {{advanced}} {{side by side}} {{in perfect}} order for a second attempt. Requiring from them another concerted effort their general officers personally led the men from the front into a second torrent of musket-shot and grenades. Again the Allies left many dead and wounded at the enemy palisade including Marshal Count von Limburg Styrum who had led the second assault. <b>With</b> <b>broken</b> ranks, and in confusion, the attacking troops fell once more back down the hill. With the Allies repulsed for a second time the exultant Bavarian grenadiers, with bayonets fixed, poured over their breastworks to pursue the attackers and drive them to defeat. But English guardsmen, aided by Lumley's dismounted cavalrymen, prevented a total rout, compelling the Bavarians back behind their defences.|$|E
5|$|At West Palm Beach, the {{majority}} of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped, littering streets <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> trunks. Winds downed road signs on many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course. Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well. Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage, except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{left school}} to tour {{with a group}} led by Johnny Otis, but this job lasted for only four months, as Farmer's lip gave out. Performing for long periods {{seven days a week}} for this job put great {{pressure}} on his technique, which was insufficiently developed to cope with such physical demands. His lip eventually became lacerated, and he could no longer play. He then received technique training in New York, where he worked for a time as a janitor and played as a freelance musician during 1947 and 1948. An audition for Dizzy Gillespie's big band was unsuccessful, and Farmer returned to the West Coast in 1948 as a member of Jay McShann's band. Club and studio work was hard to get in Los Angeles from the late 1940s and into the 1950s, as it was dominated by white musicians. Farmer played and toured with Benny Carter, Roy Porter and Gerald Wilson, then played with Wardell Gray in 1951–52. The hazards of the touring jazz musician's lifestyle were also present: while travelling overnight by car between Phoenix and El Paso, to get to another Roy Porter-led gig, the car that Farmer was in overturned at high speed, leaving him concussed and Porter <b>with</b> <b>broken</b> ribs.|$|E
