40|$|Abstract: Tire {{deflection}} {{is a key}} parameter {{and many}} equations have been developed based on it to evaluate the tractive performance of bias-ply and radial-ply tires. As deflections for a given tire size, inflation pressure and vertical load are significantly different between bias-ply and radial-ply tires, {{this study was conducted}} to predict deflection () of radial-ply tire based on section <b>width</b> (b), <b>overall</b> unloaded diameter (d), inflation pressure (P) and vertical load (W). For this purpose, deflection of four radial-ply tires with different section <b>width</b> and/or <b>overall</b> unloaded diameter were measured at five levels of inflation pressure and five levels of vertical load. Results of deflection measurement for radial-ply tires No. 1, 2 and 3 were utilized to determine multiple variables regression model and results of deflection measurement for radial-ply tire No. 4 were used to verify selected model. The paired samples t-test results showed that the difference between the deflection values predicted by model and measured by test apparatus were not statistically significant and to predict deflection of radial-ply tire based on section <b>width,</b> <b>overall</b> unloaded diameter, inflation pressure and vertical 2 load the multiple variables regression model = 75. 67 + 0. 104 b- 0. 107 d- 0. 758 P + 3. 519 W with R = 0. 986 can be strongly recommended.
