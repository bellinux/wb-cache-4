40|$|Parent {{involvement}} in schools – {{what do you}} believe about it? Disparate groups, like front office staff at a school, preservice teachers, teachers, school administrators, and parents respond quite differently to focus questions, which might include: <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> important aspects of parent involvement? What parents do you think would probably not {{want to be involved in}} par-ent involvement activities at the school? Do you know enough about parent involvement? Is it important to be informed anyway? Survey questions queried teachers, classified staff, parents, administrators, and preservice teachers on their perceptions of parent involvement. The purpose of this study was to unravel common threads within the data, which revealed a very narrow understanding of parent involvement. This narrow understanding needs to be broadened if, indeed, we ever want to see parent involvement as a systemic, important foun-dation for student learning. The study discloses that each group had a disparate view of what constitutes parent involvement. The least vocal group in this dis-cussion is the parent; the most vocal is the teacher. The conclusion is that it is inherently important to provide training for preservice and current teachers to help broaden the often myopic vision of parent involvement...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{contemporary}} trends in higher education and declared mission of many universities is {{to prepare students for}} ‘employability’. Other outcomes are sometimes associated with this, notably entrepreneurship and other capabilities or attributes associated with preparing students for work and life. Allied to this, there is much talk attached to trans disciplinary teaching and the preparation of graduates and lifelong learners for a future that requires 21 st Century skills and capabilities. The formation of graduates will therefore require much more than a degree based on discipline content and conferral. It will require a radical rethinking of what we teach, what students learn and how that learning might be demonstrated for credentials and to potential employers.

40|$|For Aboriginal students, the {{involvement}} of Aboriginal community members inschools has long {{been seen as a}} contributing factor in valuing and promoting theirAboriginality and identity. Whilst non-Aboriginal students are given opportunitiesto interact with Aboriginal people within schools, for many, it could be their firstcontact with an Aboriginal person. An important aspect of the NSW HSCAboriginal Studies course is the links it provides to Aboriginal communities. Thispaper focuses exclusively on an element of a larger investigation into the benefits ofthe NSW HSC Aboriginal Studies course for Aboriginal students. Results presentedhere relate specifically to a research question into the strengths and limitations ofthe Aboriginal Studies course. Interviews were undertaken in three NSWDepartment of Education and Training secondary schools, located in rural, northcoast, and south coast areas of NSW. A total of 36 participants: 22 senior secondarystudents who were undertaking the HSC Aboriginal Studies course, 18 Aboriginalstudents and 4 non-Aboriginal students, Aboriginal Education Assistants (n = 3),teachers of the HSC Aboriginal Studies course (n = 5), and Principals (n = 3) andAboriginal parents (n = 3) of students undertaking Aboriginal Studies were involvedin individual interviews. Participants were asked, <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the strengthsof the Aboriginal Studies course? Across responses a significant finding was thebenefits derived for all involved in Aboriginal Studies; students, teachers, parentsand the community, from the continued involvement of Aboriginal community, bothin and outside of the classroom. Hence, the participation of Aboriginal communitiesgoes much further; it has become a meaningful exchange of knowledge andexperiences, engaging students and teachers in the lives of Aboriginal people...|$|E
30|$|Students {{enrolled}} in a 100 -level DE subject were offered the opportunity to voluntarily complete a survey containing open- and close-ended questions {{for the purpose of}} exploring students’ learning perceptions and lived-experiences. Opportunity was provided to complete the survey electronically or print/mail a hardcopy. Students received neither compensation nor educational privilege for research participation and the research design ensured participants’ identity could not be determined. All surveys were submitted to a third party for de-identification and anonymous ID codes were used for data analysis. Both the survey and distribution method received Human Ethics Committee approval by the university. Close-ended questions permitted collection of limited quantitative data which was entered into SPSS for the purpose of demographically describing participants, not to conduct quantitative statistical analysis or determine causality regarding degree perceptions. To identify student perceptions and lived-experiences, a range of open-ended questions were posed. This article presents key qualitative findings for the open-ended survey question, <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the major advantages and disadvantages of distance education as you have experienced it in this subject? Although participants’ perceptions of DE learning experiences may be illustrative and/or indicative of broader trends, qualitative epistemology restricts extrapolation of findings beyond the present sample and aims to examine emerging themes in-depth rather than be quantitatively representative of broader populations (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2007; Neuman, 2011; Ragusa, 2012). A key advantage of qualitative research is its capacity to advance collective understanding of insights generated by research participants, rather than predetermined by researchers using close-ended answer options, thereby permitting unanticipated ideas to emerge for future examination/verification if localised findings are exhibited more widely, why, and how (Creswell, 2014).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Priority setting, {{also known}} as {{rationing}} or resource allocation, occurs {{at all levels of}} every health care system. Daniels and Sabin have proposed a framework for priority setting in health care institutions called 'accountability for reasonableness', which links priority setting to theories of democratic deliberation. Fairness is a key goal of priority setting. According to 'accountability for reasonableness', health care institutions engaged in priority setting have a claim to fairness if they satisfy four conditions of relevance, publicity, appeals/revision, and enforcement. This is the first study which has surveyed the views of hospital decision makers throughout an entire health system about the fairness of priority setting in their institutions. The {{purpose of this study is}} to elicit hospital decision-makers' self-report of the fairness of priority setting in their hospitals using an explicit conceptual framework, 'accountability for reasonableness'. Methods 160 Ontario hospital Chief Executive Officers, or their designates, were asked to complete a survey questionnaire concerning priority setting in their publicly funded institutions. Eight-six Ontario hospitals completed this survey, for a response rate of 54 %. Six close-ended rating scale questions (e. g. Overall, how fair is priority setting at your hospital?), and 3 open-ended questions (e. g. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the goal(s) of priority setting in your hospital?) were used. Results Overall, 60. 7 % of respondents indicated their hospitals' priority setting was fair. With respect to the 'accountability for reasonableness' conditions, respondents indicated their hospitals performed best for the relevance (75. 0 %) condition, followed by appeals/revision (56. 6 %), publicity (56. 0 %), and enforcement (39. 5 %). Conclusions For the first time hospital Chief Executive Officers within an entire health system were surveyed about the fairness of priority setting practices in their institutions using the conceptual framework 'accountability for reasonableness'. Although many hospital CEOs felt that their priority setting was fair, ample room for improvement was noted, especially for the enforcement condition. </p...|$|E
