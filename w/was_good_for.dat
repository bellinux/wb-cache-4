5|$|In the off-season, Eugene Melnyk would {{purchase}} {{the club to}} bring financial stability and the team entered the 2003–04 season with high expectations. Head Coach Jacques Martin would guide the team to another good regular season, finishing with 102 points. This <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> only third in the tightly contested Northeast Division, as Boston would have 104 and Toronto 103.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 1977 tape of Lennon {{singing the}} song was recorded on a mono cassette, with vocals and piano on the same track. They were impossible to separate, so Lynne had to produce the track with voice and piano together, but commented that it <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> {{the integrity of the}} project, as Lennon was not only singing occasional lines, but also playing on the song.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E

In his sophomore campaign, Raymond led the Bulldogs in scoring with 14 goals, 32 assists and 46 points. Raymond's points total <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> second in league scoring behind Jonathan Toews.

5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E

However, Bickford broke a finger in 1951 after {{being hit by a}} line drive, missed most of the final three months of the season and never regained his prior form. In 1952, he was 7–12 with a 3.74 earned run average in 26 games, 22 of them starts. He played for the Braves when the team moved to Milwaukee before the 1953 season; however, he {{suffered}} from bone spurs in his pitching arm.

5|$|Overmars' first call-up to the Netherlands senior {{national}} squad came in February 1993 for a 1994 World Cup qualifier against Turkey. He scored {{five minutes}} into his debut, after good play from Wim Jonk. The team {{went on to}} win 3–1 and Overmars said the goal <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> his confidence. Dick Advocaat, the manager of the Netherlands, was complimentary of the debutant's performance. In April 1993, Overmars earnt the national team a penalty against England after Des Walker fouled him. Peter van Vossen converted the spot kick to complete a comeback for the Netherlands, who had been 2–0 down after 24 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Passage through Hull {{had long}} been difficult, {{because of the number}} of ships which used the river for loading and {{unloading}} goods. In 1794, the merchants of Beverley had advocated the building of docks at Hull, with a separate entrance, so that traffic to the upper river would not be impeded, while the Driffield Navigation had unsuccessful attempted to get a clause inserted into the Act of Parliament which the Hull Dock Company obtained in 1840, to ensure free passage for vessels, and the removal of tolls for boats not using the docks. The Navigation Company also received complaints from the Beverley and Barmston Drainage Commissioners, who believed that water levels were being kept at a higher level than <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> drainage.|$|E

On Islam, he stated how it <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> abolishing the disgrace in human relationship, based on one of his speeches to railway employees at Tiruchirapalli in 1947. Periyar also commended Islam for its belief in one invisible and formless God; proclamation of equal rights for men and women; and advocating of social unity.|$|E

5|$|Pinafore {{opened on}} 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique, before an {{enthusiastic}} audience, with Sullivan conducting. Soon, however, the piece suffered from weak ticket sales, generally ascribed to a heat wave {{that made the}} Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable. The historian Michael Ainger questions this explanation, at least in part, stating that the heat waves {{in the summer of}} 1878 were short and transient. By mid-August, Sullivan wrote to his mother that cooler weather had arrived, which <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the show. In the meantime, the four partners of the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the opera's viability and posted closing notices. Carte publicised the piece by presenting a matinee concert performance on 6 July 1878 at the enormous Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|The Flames {{followed}} up their {{run to the}} Finals with their best regular season to that point. Calgary's 46–31–3 record in 1986–87 <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> third overall in the NHL, behind the Oilers and Philadelphia Flyers. However, the Flames were unable to duplicate their playoff success of a year prior, losing their first-round match-up with the Jets in six games.

He led the league in shutouts with four and was second in games started with 34, second in innings pitched with 274.7, third in wins, and third in complete games with 21.

In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply. Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation. After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym. Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%, and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand. , a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (£2,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (£3,950).|$|E
5|$|That <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> {{first place}} in the AFC Central and a trip to the postseason {{for the first time since}} 1972. The Browns began their playoff run against the Oakland Raiders on January 4, 1981 in a bitterly cold Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The game started slowly: each team scored only a {{touchdown}} in the first half, although Cockroft missed Cleveland's extra point because of a bad snap. In the third quarter, Cleveland went ahead 12–7 on a pair of Cockroft field goals, but the Raiders came back in the final period, driving 80yards down the field for a touchdown. That put Oakland ahead 14–12. The ball changed hands five times with no scoring from either side, and with 2:22 on the clock, Cleveland had a final shot to win the game. Sipe and the offense took over at the Browns' 15-yard line. In eight plays, Cleveland drove down to Oakland's 14, leaving 56 seconds on the clock.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} in Telugu and Tamil versions, with a slightly different cast for each. Gemini Ganesan appeared as Abhimanyu in the Tamil version, which was portrayed by Akkineni Nageswara Rao in Telugu. Savitri was retained as the female lead in Tamil also, where her character was named Vatsala instead of Sasirekha. Sachu played the younger version of the character in Tamil. N. T. Rama Rao, hesitant to play Krishna after a negative response to his cameo appearance in Sontha Ooru (1956), agreed at Venkata Reddy's insistence and special care was taken with his costume and body language; Mayabazar {{was the first of}} Rama Rao's many appearances as Krishna. According to Rama Rao's widow Lakshmi Parvathi, Nagi Reddy and Chakrapani had initially rejected Venkata Reddy's proposal to cast Rama Rao as Krishna, but he persuaded them into believing that Rama Rao <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the role. As Rama Rao had a broad chest, Venkata Reddy suggested a slight narrowing to look apt as Krishna. In addition to following other suggestions by Venkata Reddy, Rama Rao read the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata and other puranas to understand Krishna's character and present it properly. S. V. Ranga Rao, described by Nageswara Rao as the film's male lead in interviews, played the character of Ghatotkacha.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. After the first race, Giovinazzi {{said he had been}} amazed at his first victory in the GP2 Series and thanked his team and his primary sponsor. He stated that he did not think that he would able to secure his first victory before the season was over, and was happy to score the points he earned for himself and his team. Sirotkin said the race was not easy for him because {{he did not have the}} start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not to be content finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated that he expected some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how many there were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> his team and revealed that he was not surprised when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw him close up to him under the safety car.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war the LSO had to face new competition. The BBC SO and the LPO {{had survived}} the war intact, the latter, {{abandoned}} by Beecham, as a self-governing body. All three were quickly overshadowed by two new orchestras: Walter Legge's Philharmonia and Beecham's Royal Philharmonic (RPO). To survive, the LSO played in hundreds of concerts of popular classics under undistinguished conductors. By 1948 the orchestra was anxious to resume promoting its own concert series. The players decided to accept the Arts Council's conditions for subsidy, and changed the LSO's constitution to replace profit-sharing with salaries. With a view to raising its playing standards it engaged Josef Krips as conductor. His commitments in Vienna preventing him from becoming the LSO's chief conductor until 1950, but from his first concert with the orchestra in December 1948 he influenced the playing for the better. His chosen repertoire <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the box office: cycles of Beethoven symphonies and concertos (the latter featuring Wilhelm Kempff in one season and Claudio Arrau in another) helped restore the orchestra's finances as well as its musical standards. With Krips and others the orchestra recorded extensively for the Decca Record Company during the early 1950s. The orchestra's workload in these years was second only to the other self-governing London orchestra, the LPO: the LPO played 248 concerts in the 1949–50 season; the LSO 103; the BBC SO 55; the Philharmonia and RPO 32 each. When the Royal Festival Hall opened in 1951 the LSO and LPO engaged in a mutually bruising campaign for sole residency there. Neither was successful, and the Festival Hall became the main London venue for both orchestras and for the RPO and Philharmonia.|$|E
