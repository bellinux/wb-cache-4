25|$|The {{problem of}} evil is often phrased in the form: Why {{do bad things}} happen to good people?. Christianity teach that all people are {{inherently}} sinful due to the fall of man and original sin; for example, Calvinist theology follows a doctrine called federal headship, which argues that the first man, Adam, was the legal representative of the entire human race. A counterargument to the basic version of this principle is that an omniscient God <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>predicted</b> this, when he created the world, and an omnipotent God could have prevented it.|$|E
25|$|Probably no one {{living in}} the eighth century <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>predicted</b> that the great Mercian empire would be {{destroyed}} and that the West Saxons with their poor track record for feuds and infighting within the royal house would emerge as the dominant kingdom in the ninth century. The nobility {{under the influence of}} Alfred became involved with developing the cultural life of their kingdom. As the kingdom became one they brought the monastic and spiritual life of the kingdom under one rule and stricter control. However the Anglo-Saxons believed in 'luck' as a random element in the affairs of man and so would probably have agreed that {{there is a limit to}} the extent one can understand why one kingdom failed while another succeeded. They also believed in 'destiny' and interpreted the fate of the kingdom of England with Biblical and Carolingian ideology, with parallels, between the Israelites, the great European empires and the Anglo-Saxons. Danish and Norman conquests were just the manner in which God punished his sinful people and the fate of great empires.|$|E
25|$|After her disappointing {{performances}} at the 1996 Olympic Games, and her relatively poor season in 1997, few <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>predicted</b> the remarkable comeback that Sonia O'Sullivan made in 1998. Her year {{got off to}} an amazing start at the World Cross-Country Championships at Marrakech in March. O'Sullivan entered both the short course (4km) and long course (8km) events, a double which few athletes even attempt, much less have any success at. On successive days, O'Sullivan won both events, and her 4km time of 12:20 was a massive 14 seconds ahead of her nearest rival. O'Sullivan continued this form into the track season, where her performances in the 1500 m, 3000 m and 5000 m were close to those she had produced at her peak in 1994 and 1995. At the European Athletics Championships in Budapest, the 1500 m and 5000 m finals, events at which O'Sullivan usually doubled at major championships, were scheduled to be run on the same day, thus denying her the opportunity of competing in both events. Undeterred, O'Sullivan entered the 5000 m and 10000 m, having never run the latter event before on the track. In the 10000 m final, on 19 August, she shadowed the leaders, and then produced an astonishing 28.1 second final 200 metres to win {{the gold medal in}} 31:29.33 in her debut at the distance. Four days later, in the more familiar territory of the 5000 m, the pace was set by Romanian Gabriela Szabo, but again, O'Sullivan produced an explosive finishing sprint to defeat Szabo in 15:06.50. At the World Cup held the following month in Johannesburg, O'Sullivan won her second major international 5000 m competition of the year, again sprinting clear of the opposition following a very slow pace. She concluded her year by winning the BUPA Great North Run.|$|E

Released in that market as Anna and the Snow Queen, the film increased its gross each week in its three first weeks of release, and only started to drop in the fourth; while other films usually peak in the opening week and decline in the latter ones. Frozen has received over 7 million admissions in Japan as of April 16, and nearly 18.7 million admissions as of June 23. Many cinemagoers were reported to have watched both the original and the Japanese-dubbed version. Japan Today also reported that the local dubbed version was [...] "particularly popular" [...] in the country. Gavin J. Blair of The Hollywood Reporter commented on the film's earnings in Japan: [...] "Even after its $9.6 million (￥986.4 million) three-day opening, a record bow for a Disney animation in Japan, few <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>predicted</b> the kind of numbers Frozen has now racked up."

60|$|Count Pateroff, Sophie's brother, {{was a man}} who, when he {{had taken}} a thing in hand, {{generally}} liked to carry it through. It may perhaps be said that most men are of this turn of mind; but the count was, I think, especially eager in this respect. And as he was not one who had many irons in the fire, who made either many little efforts, or any great efforts after things altogether beyond his reach, he was justified in expecting success. As to Archie's courtship, any one who really knew the man and the woman, and who knew anything of the nature of women in general, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>predicted</b> failure for him. Even with Doodle's aid he could not have a chance in the race. But when Count Pateroff entered himself for the same prize, those who knew him would not speak of his failure as a thing certain.|$|E

He acknowledged his purpose at once to his father; and the latter, who knew the force of his inclination, took him accordingly to the Carmelite monk, Fra Filippo, who was a most excellent painter of that time, with whom he placed him to study the art, as Sandro himself had desired. Devoting himself thereupon entirely to the vocation he had chosen, Sandro so closely followed the directions, and imitated the manner, of his master, that Fra Filippo conceived a great love for him, and instructed him so effectually, that Sandro rapidly attained to such a degree in art as none <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>predicted</b> for him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 1. Whispering {{and leaving}} seats. In {{regard to this}} subject, there are very {{different}} methods, now in practice in different schools. In some, especially in very small schools, the teacher allows the pupils to act {{according to their own}} discretion. They whisper and leave their seats whenever they think it necessary. This plan may possibly be admissible in a very small school; that is, in one of ten or twelve pupils. I am convinced, however, that it is very bad here. No vigilant watch, which it is possible for any teacher to exert, will prevent a vast amount of mere talk, entirely foreign to the business of the school. I tried this plan very thoroughly, with high ideas of the dependence which might be placed upon conscience and a sense of duty, if these principles are properly brought out to action in an effort to sustain the system. I was told by distinguished teachers, {{that it would not be}} found to answer. But predictions of failure in such cases only prompt to greater exertions, and I persevered. But I was forced at last to give up the point, and adopt another plan. My pupils would make resolutions enough; they understood their duty well enough. They were allowed to leave their seats and whisper to their companions, whenever, in their honest judgment, it was necessary for the prosecution of their studies. I knew that it sometimes would be necessary, and I was desirous to adopt this plan to save myself the constant interruption of hearing and replying to requests. But it would not do. Whenever, from time to time, I called them to account, I found that a large majority, according to their own confession, were in the habit of holding daily and deliberate communication with each other, on subjects entirely foreign to the business of the school. A more experienced teacher <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>predicted</b> this result; but I had very high ideas of the power of cultivated conscience; and in fact, still have. But then, like most other persons who become possessed of a good idea, I could not be satisfied without carrying it to an extreme.|$|E
