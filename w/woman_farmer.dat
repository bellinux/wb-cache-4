40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to find out how {{financial}} capital from rural banks is contributing to the livelihoods development of <b>women</b> <b>farmers</b> who constitute the most vulnerable and disadvantaged group in Ghana and other developing countries. Design/methodology/approach – <b>Women</b> <b>farmers</b> were randomly sampled, resulting in 100 beneficiary and 100 non-beneficiary <b>women</b> <b>farmers</b> who were used for the study. The incomes of <b>women</b> <b>farmers</b> were compared and the factors influencing income earnings estimated using simple regressing analysis. Findings – Financial capital from rural banks was found to have positive contributions to the livelihood development of the <b>women</b> <b>farmers</b> and the poor in general. Whereas, the beneficiary <b>women</b> <b>farmers</b> had significant improvement in their access to health care, education and increased income among others, the non-beneficiaries only had marginal improvements. Research limitations/implications – <b>Women</b> <b>farmers</b> do not keep accurate records on their production activities and had to rely on their memories to give costs of production and outputs obtained. This might have slightly affected the results. Practical implications – Governments and development partners in third world countries should integrate the provision of financial capital in their development policy formulations. This is critical for the attainment of the millennium development goals (MDGs), especially on the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger as well as gender equality and empowerment. Originality/value – This research paper brings to light the fact that financial capital is an important tool that can be used to turn life around for poor families and individuals in developing countries in Africa and elsewhere. It demonstrates how financial capital is critical for the attainment of the MDGs.

The study was carried out among <b>women</b> <b>farmers</b> in Ondo State, South-West Nigeria, to investigate their knowledge and attitude towards sustainable land management practices in arable food crop production. Multistage sampling technique was adopted in selecting a total of 160 <b>women</b> <b>farmers</b> drawn from 18 extension blocks in the state. Data was collected on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge/attitude towards land management practices and measures adopted by the women. The data was then analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. The results revealed that {{the mean age of}} the <b>women</b> <b>farmers</b> in the state was 45. 3 years, most of the farmers (about 58. 77 percent) were married and that majority of the farmers presently cultivated personal land. Also, it was observed that most of the farm lands were inherited or family-owned. Mixed cropping is the most dominant cropping system and the <b>women</b> were mainly <b>farmers</b> though about 12 percent of them are also involved in off-farm processing. The correlation analysis revealed that there is a strong positive (r = 0. 63; p< 0. 05) correlation between the attitude score and land management practices adopted by the <b>women</b> <b>farmers.</b> The study recommends increase in awareness campaigns on land use fertility and management practices, also that <b>women</b> <b>farmers,</b> through appropriate policy of land tenure and ownership be given equal assess to land resources.

The need for women involvement in agricultural training programs is crucial to make sure that their full potential is utilized in agriculture. The purpose of this study was to identify major factors that impact smallholder <b>women</b> <b>farmers</b> training programs in Njombe district in Tanzania. This study was made possible by identifying the current training programs for smallholder <b>women</b> <b>farmers</b> and identifying aspects that influence women participation in agricultural training programs. Also, for describing strategies that could enhance food security training of <b>women</b> <b>farmers.</b> The target population of the study was all <b>women</b> smallholder <b>farmers,</b> particularly rural <b>women</b> from Njombe Rural District. The descriptive cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data from 100 smallholder <b>women</b> <b>farmers.</b> The results indicated that very few <b>women</b> <b>farmers</b> participated in agricultural extension training. Results showed that the following factors interfered their participation in agricultural training: <b>women</b> <b>farmers</b> have less access and possession of land, very few have membership in farmer groups / associations.
