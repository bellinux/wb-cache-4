5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of traumatic brain injury. It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have produced as many casualties.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{with other}} waves, moving into shallow water causes the tsunami to slow but grow in height. Either the trough or {{the crest of the}} tsunami can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas unusually exposed. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, {{flooding}} all in its path. Much of the disaster's destruction can be produced by these flood waters, which drain back into the sea while pulling people and debris along. Several tsunamis can be caused by a single geological event. In such cases, it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and two hours after the first, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be the biggest or most destructive.

5|$|Usually males, {{mainly in}} {{polygynous}} species, have shorter lifespans than females. This {{can be attributed}} to several reasons: early dispersal of young males, aggressive male-male fights, vulnerability to predation (particularly when males are less agile, as in kudu), and malnutrition (being large in size, the male body has high nutritional requirements <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be satisfied). Richard Despard Estes suggested that females mimic male secondary sexual characteristics like horns to protect their male offspring from dominant males. This feature seems to have been strongly selected to prevent male mortality and imbalanced sex ratios due to attacks by aggressive males and forced dispersal of young males during adolescence.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{provided}} its Aurora Engine from Neverwinter Nights for the sequel. One of {{the decisions}} to use Aurora rather than build a new engine from scratch was the toolset—Obsidian wanted players {{to continue to be}} able to make content for the game, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have been possible with a new engine. BioWare made itself available to Obsidian with technical support on the engine, but Obsidian planned on completely overhauling Aurora, including its code. The designers wanted to improve the visuals of the first game with additions such as better lighting and textures, which required significant changes to the engine. The upgraded engine was referred to as Electron. Electron was designed to incorporate DirectX to make it compatible for a potential Xbox 360 release, but Obsidian eventually abandoned plans for a port to the system for financial reasons. The toolset that was used to create the game was also revamped, and included several additions like a customizable interface, a new dialogue format, and building assistants—similar to the wizards found in Microsoft Word and Excel. Like Neverwinter Nights, the toolset was included in the game's release for players to use.|$|E
5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E

5|$|The {{degenerate}} matter {{that makes up}} the bulk of a white dwarf has a very low opacity, because any absorption of a photon requires that an electron must transition to a higher empty state, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be possible as the energy of the photon may not be a match for the possible quantum states available to that electron, hence radiative heat transfer within a white dwarf is low; it does, however, have a high thermal conductivity. As a result, the interior of the white dwarf maintains a uniform temperature, approximately 107K. An outer shell of non-{{degenerate matter}} cools from approximately 107K to 104K. This matter radiates roughly as a black body. A white dwarf remains visible for a long time, as its tenuous outer atmosphere of normal matter begins to radiate at about 107K, upon formation, while its greater interior mass is at 107 K but cannot radiate through its normal matter shell.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E
5|$|IV. Allegro ma non troppo – Presto. The finale has {{the same}} {{structure}} {{as that of the}} previous sonata. Many elements of this movement imply large-scale resolution of harmonic and thematic conflicts established earlier in this and even the two previous sonatas. The main rondo theme opens with an 'empty' octave on G, which resolves to C minor, subsequently interpreted as ii of V in B-flat major. Brendel asserts that this theme, beginning in the ambiguous G/Cm, functions as a resolution of the troubling G trill presented in {{the very beginning of the}} sonata, using G to resolve to F major as V of B-flat. The second theme, in ternary form, is written in the traditional key of the dominant, with a central section in D major; it consists of an extended, characteristically Schubertian stepwise melody played over an uninterrupted flow of semiquavers. This second theme uses the same melodic contour (5-8-7-6-6-5-(5-4-4-3)) of the remarkable C major modulation in the final A section of the second movement, implying further connotations of conflict resolution. After an abrupt end to the second theme and a pregnant pause, a minor dotted-rhythm chordal theme in F-minor suddenly enters fortissimo, elaborating and modulating before sublimating into a pianissimo version of itself in the parallel major. This third theme is highly similar in rhythm and melodic contour as well as left hand pattern to the tarantella of the C minor sonata, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be a coincidence when considering the overall high level of cyclic connection between the sonatas. This theme evolves into a rhythmic segue that leads seamlessly back to the main theme of the rondo. The development section, based entirely on the rhythmic pattern of the main rondo theme, is characterised by juxtaposed eighth notes and triplets, reaching a climax on C-flat major, from which the bass descends in chromatic modulation eventually to G in an extended diminuendo to return to the main theme. In the coda, the main theme is fragmented in a manner also similar to the finale of the previous sonata; in a highly chromatic and unstable progression, the octave on G here descends through G-flat to F, in an extension of the G-G-F resolution of the theme. After finally reaching this dominant preparation for the final time, the movement closes with an exceedingly triumphant and affirming presto section that totally resolves all dramatic conflicts in the sonata and the series.|$|E
