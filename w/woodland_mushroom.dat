25|$|Note that Agaricus blazei Murrill is a {{perfectly}} valid name, but for a completely different mushroom. Agaricus silvaticus Schaeff. is also {{a perfectly}} valid name for a common, north temperate, <b>woodland</b> <b>mushroom.</b> Neither is a synonym of Agaricus subrufescens.|$|E
50|$|Hypholoma fasciculare, {{commonly}} known as the sulphur tuft, sulfur tuft or clustered woodlover, is a common <b>woodland</b> <b>mushroom,</b> often in evidence when hardly any other mushrooms are to be found. This saprophagic small gill fungus grows prolifically in large clumps on stumps, dead roots or rotting trunks of broadleaved trees.|$|E
50|$|Stropharia aeruginosa, {{commonly}} known as the verdigris agaric, is a medium-sized green, slimy <b>woodland</b> <b>mushroom,</b> found on lawns, mulch and woodland from spring to autumn. The edibility of this mushroom is controversial - some sources claim that it is edible, while others claim it to be poisonous, although effects are little known and its toxic constituents undescribed.|$|E
50|$|From {{this point}} into the 1930s, {{features}} of field guides were introduced by Chester A. Reed and others such as changing {{the size of}} the book to fit the pocket, including colour plates, and producing guides in uniform editions that covered subjects such as garden and <b>woodland</b> flowers, <b>mushrooms,</b> insects, and dogs.|$|R
50|$|Agaricus semotus is a <b>woodland</b> <b>mushroom</b> of the Agaricales {{order of}} fungi. It, {{like many of}} its relatives, can be found spread {{throughout}} wooded, moist areas in the southern United States, and {{has been found in}} areas ranging from California to Florida; it is also indigenous to Great Britain and Europe. A. semotus has also been collected in New Zealand. Although various authors disagree about its edibility, its modest size prevents it from being a significant source of nutrition.|$|E
50|$|Agaricus pocillator, a <b>woodland</b> <b>mushroom,</b> is {{distributed}} through southeastern North America in ranges {{at least as}} far north as Illinois. It can be distinguished in the field by its dark center, its small, bulbous base, which stains yellow, and its relatively slight stature. It is very similar to Agaricus placomyces, but is a slightly smaller mushroom with a scalier cap and a more northern range within the United States. Edibility is not certain for Agaricus pocillator, but several other yellow-staining Agaricus species are poisonous. Hikers are often warned to avoid eating it when spotted.|$|E
