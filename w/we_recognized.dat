500|$|Hamm was {{not allowed}} to perform rewrites during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. Warren Skaaren, who had also worked on Burton's Beetlejuice, did rewrites. Jonathan Gems and Charles McKeown rewrote the script during filming. Only Skaaren {{received}} screenplay credit with Hamm. Hamm criticized the rewrites, but blamed the changes on Warner Bros. Burton explained, [...] "I don't understand why that became such a problem. We started out with a script that everyone liked, although <b>we</b> <b>recognized</b> it needed a little work." [...] Dick Grayson appeared in the shooting script but was deleted, as the filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to the plot. Bob Kane supported this decision.|$|E
2500|$|... (a) Polish fan once sent us {{information}} about the battle of Wizna. When we read of the deeds of Captain Władysław Raginis and his friends, it was so incredible for us, a story that first we thought {{that it could not}} be true. Such incredible courage to 360 soldiers, 42 thousand resisted Germans! <b>We</b> <b>recognized</b> immediately that the battle is the most interesting history, and of course we wrote a song about it, [...] "40:1." ...|$|E

60|$|Dan was the oldest; {{he was my}} age--thirteen. He was a lean, {{freckled}} {{fellow with}} rather long, lank, brown hair and the shapely King nose. <b>We</b> <b>recognized</b> it at once.

60|$|These {{pleasant}} adventures with Dardo on {{the plain}} were suddenly {{put a stop to}} by the war. One morning a number of persons on foot and on horseback were seen coming to us over the green plain from the shepherd's ranche, and as they drew nearer <b>we</b> <b>recognized</b> our old Alcalde on his horse {{as the leader of the}} procession, and behind him walked Dona Nata, holding her son by the hand; then followed others on foot, and behind them all rode four old gauchos, the Alcalde's henchmen, wearing their swords.|$|E
6000|$|Presently we {{came upon}} half a dozen sheep {{nibbling}} grass in the spray of a stream of clear water that sprang from a rock wall a hundred feet high, {{and all at once}} our ears were startled with a melodious [...] "Lul ... l ... l l l llul-lul-LAhee-o-o-o!"

He was now, however, completely cowed and crestfallen, and his courage seemed to have quailed in the iron gripe of the lion-hearted Jack.|$|E

[...] There was just enough light in the streets to prevent us from getting utterly lost, and <b>we</b> <b>recognized</b> the dark mass of the Tuileries as we crossed the gardens.

6000|$|At last, a stir at {{the back}} of the {{platform}} announced the approach of the speaker. Three or four men suddenly appeared from some concealed door and entered upon the stage. One of them, a short man with a full red beard, <b>we</b> <b>recognized</b> at once,--"The prophet of San Francisco" [...] as he was then called (in fine derision) was not a noticeable man till he removed his hat. Then the fine line of his face from the crown of his head to the tip of his chin printed itself ineffaceably upon our minds. The dome-like brow was that of one highly specialized on lines of logic and sympathy. There was also something in the tense poise of his body which foretold the orator.|$|E
