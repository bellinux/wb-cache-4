5|$|I {{started doing}} {{different}} charity events <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{a combination of}} 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Richard Keller of TV Squad thought the finale's theme of Will and Grace's connection {{to each other}} was well-presented by director James Burrows. Keller added, [...] "While not as satisfying as, say, the Friends finale or as crushing as the Seinfeld finale, the series finale to Will & Grace did have its moments {{and came back to}} the original concept of friendship among a close group of people. There were some moments <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> laugh out loud, but they were few." [...] CHUD.com's David Oliver praised the finale for not having characters [...] "go on wild tangents that betray who they were during the entirety of the show's run." [...] He also commented that Messing and McCormack are [...] "affecting in their performances" [...] and the episode [...] "nicely summarizes [...] friendship {{over the course of the}} entire show." ...|$|E

60|$|None the less, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not usually}} speak of God even {{in regard to}} these moments, and <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> use that word it must be {{understood}} that I {{use it as a}} personification of something entirely different in nature from the personality of a human being.|$|R
6000|$|At the Last Day I'm sure I shall appear, [...] To {{meet with}} Jesus Christ my Saviour dear: [...] <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hope {{to live with}} Him in bliss. [...] Oh, what a joy at my last hour was this! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! well," [...] stammered {{the other}} {{blushing}} scarlet, [...] "I {{thought this was}} only a sort of form to go through; I don't like to tell <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> live, for <b>I</b> ain't {{in the habit of}} going to pawnbrokers." ...|$|R

60|$|He asked me, {{first of}} all, whether I conferred a charm and a {{distinction}} on London by residing in it? I {{did not think}} it necessary to reply that I was perfectly aware I should not do that, in any case, but merely told him <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> reside.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Stormont. [...] "Perhaps I'd better {{state that}} I'm pretty {{well known in}} Winnipeg, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{business}} in real estate and sometimes undertake the development of mineral claims. I've recently put over two or three big transactions in that line." ...|$|R

"If she was {{a goddess}} to me, should it be any affair of mine {{that she was not}} a goddess to herself; that she could hold all this that has been between us more cheaply than <b>I</b> <b>did?</b> It does not change one jot of it for me. At the time she did not hold it cheaply. She forgets <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not forget...." ...|$|R

60|$|They {{would not}} see it. Unpleasantness was in the air, and, living <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> at the time, I thought it best to part with Columbus.

60|$|It was sickening {{to stand}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> well aft, and look along the deck where were four of our fellows lying upon the planks as if lifeless, while as many more had a bandaged arm or leg telling of wounds {{which did not}} quench their ardor {{in the effort to}} prove {{themselves}} worthy of standing against the king's men as defenders of the Cause.|$|E

I do NOT stand <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I {{have spoken to}} Elizabeth--under what mad impulse I know not--on a theme which cannot be {{abandoned}} without touching every female feeling to the quick, and which yet I dare not and cannot prosecute. She can never, never forgive me for having caused and witnessed those yieldings to human passion." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Chairman, on {{the third}} {{position}} of the message the constitutional question--I have not much to say. Being the man I am, and speaking, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> feel that in any attempt at an original constitutional argument I should not be and {{ought not to be}} listened to patiently. The ablest and the best of men have gone over the whole ground long ago. I shall attempt but little more than a brief notice of what some of them have said. In relation to Mr. Jefferson's views, I read from Mr. Polk's veto message: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, sir," [...] Rupert said, [...] "I {{will be here}} in time; and as I am not a prisoner, and can {{go about}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> like, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think that even the king could object to my paying a visit of adieu." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not admit," [...] he protested. [...] "I {{understand}} even <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not sympathise. You make of {{life the}} greatest boon on earth. We of my race {{and way of}} thinking are taught to take it up or lay it down, if not with indifference, at any rate with a very large share of resignation. However, Jesson's life is spared. From what I {{have heard of the}} man, I imagine he will be very much surprised." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was I, sir," [...] Frank said {{rising in}} his place; [...] "I {{was there with}} Goodall. We ran on Mr. Gregson's ground after a butterfly. It was my fault, sir, for, of course, Goodall went <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> We ran among his wheat, and I really did not notice {{where we were going}} till he called to us. I was wrong, of course, and am ready to pay for any damage we may have caused." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thanked the}} great Doctor and {{returned}} home, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{as he had}} told me. For {{the last three days}} the necks of not only my children but of my wife and myself, as well, have been hanging on the bushes to be cured; so we could not possibly have eaten your plum-pudding. Indeed, it was only an hour ago when I finished putting the neck on the last of my children, and at that moment your soldiers came and arrested me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fifteen {{hundred men}} have joined me here <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> but expect a {{thousand}} at the most,' the King continued. 'If we had high hopes when we landed at Lyme Cobb with eighty at our back, {{what should we}} think now when {{we find ourselves in}} the chief city of Somerset with eight thousand brave men around us? 'Tis but one other affair like that at Axminster, and my uncle's power will go down like a house of cards. But gather round the table, gentlemen, and we shall discuss matters in due form.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{eventually}} {{grew tired}} {{of living in a}} prison without walls and ran away when I was 16. What transpired between then and now has been a roller coaster of alcohol, drugs, violence, failed relationships, despair and confusion. Who am <b>I?</b> <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> come from? <b>Where</b> is my family? <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> belong? When life's mystery has been shattered by strangers watching over you, a lot of these questions are lost." ...|$|R
2500|$|He rarely {{outlined}} a script, preferring {{to finish a}} story in his head, and then write the draft. Boam said, [...] "I don't {{have any kind of}} routine, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> notes or outlines or character sketches. I just try and live with it in my head, until it's ready to be spat out." [...] He wrote every weekday, from [...] to , without taking breaks.|$|R

People go to sleep every night, and of course I know it's the place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> the things <b>I</b> dream, but I want to know WHERE it is and how I get there and back without knowing anything about it [...] . and in my nighty too. Where is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAR BLYTH,--I {{begin to}} wish I {{had never been}} born; for I have got into another scrape--having been knocked on {{the head by a}} prize-fighter with a cheese-plate. It was wrong in me to go <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> I know. But I went to Mr. Strather, just as you told me, and stuck to my drawing--I did indeed! Pray do come, as soon as ever you get back--I send this letter to make sure of getting you at once. I am so miserable and lonely, and too weak still to get out of bed.|$|E
6000|$|And {{this was}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the fatal thing. It {{happened}} that, just before I took up [...] "Braid on the Push-Shot," [...] I had been dipping {{into the current}} number of a magazine, {{and one of the}} advertisements, I chanced to remember, might have been framed with a special eye to George's unfortunate case. It was that one, which I have no doubt you have seen, which treats of [...] "How to Become a Convincing Talker". I picked up this magazine now and handed it to George.|$|E
60|$|Of Hooker I saw {{but little}} during the war. I {{had known him}} very well before, however. <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> see him, at Chattanooga, his {{achievement}} in bringing his command around the point of Lookout Mountain and into Chattanooga Valley was brilliant. I nevertheless regarded him as a dangerous man. He was not subordinate to his superiors. He was ambitious {{to the extent of}} caring nothing for the rights of others. His disposition was, when engaged in battle, to get detached from {{the main body of the}} army and exercise a separate command, gathering to his standard all he could of his juniors.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Doen't fear {{me being}} any {{hindrance}} to you, I {{have no more}} to say, ma'am,' he remarked, as he moved towards the door. 'I come beer with no hope, and I take away no hope. <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> what <b>I</b> thowt should be <b>done,</b> but <b>I</b> never looked fur any good to come of my stan'ning <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> This has been too evil a house fur me and mine, fur {{me to be in}} my right senses and expect it.' ...|$|R
