40|$|We {{estimate}} {{fracture energy}} on extended faults for several recent earthquakes by retrieving dynamic traction evolution at each {{point on the}} fault plane from slip history imaged by inverting ground motion waveforms. We define the <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> (Wb) as the excess of work over some minimum traction level achieved during slip. Wb is equivalent to "seismological" fracture energy (G) in previous investigations. Our numerical approach uses slip velocity as a boundary condition on the fault. We employ a three-dimensional finite difference algorithm to compute the dynamic traction evolution in the time domain during the earthquake rupture. We estimate Wb by calculating the scalar product between dynamic traction and slip velocity vectors. This approach does not require specifying a constitutive law and assuming dynamic traction to be collinear with slip velocity. If these vectors are not collinear, the inferred <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> depends on the initial traction level. We show that <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> depends on the square of slip. The spatial distribution of <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> in a single earthquake is strongly correlated with the slip distribution. <b>Breakdown</b> <b>work</b> density and its integral over the fault, breakdown energy, scale with seismic moment according to a power law (with exponent 0. 59 and 1. 18, respectively). Our estimates of <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> range between 4 e+ 5 and 2 e+ 7 J/m 2 for earthquakes having moment magnitudes between 5. 6 and 7. 2.

40|$|Through {{historical}} research on hypertextual, collaborative writing {{software and hardware}} in the 1960 s and situated studies of writers??? digital memory and invention work in the present, this dissertation considers the emergent uses of technologies surrounding disruptive moments. Combining Bruno Latour???s actor-network theory with theories of mediated activity (Vygotsky, Wertsch, Engestr??m, Nardi), it uses historical and contemporary scenes to propose that the coordination of mediating technologies constitutes important rhetorical <b>work.</b> <b>Breakdowns</b> in literate practices lead {{to the opening of}} what Latour has called black boxes, which otherwise would conceal the mediating roles of artifacts, people, and ideologies. Thus, breakdowns provide opportunities to trace the connections between situated activity and wider social contexts. Reconsidering the history of Douglas Engelbart???s On-Line System (NLS) of the 1960 s and 70 s, I illustrate how the black-boxing of a specific group of technologies into the standard personal computer suppressed alternate configurations that were supported by writing theories strongly resembling those of the early process movement. Through interviews with, and observations of, writers today as they demonstrate their digital note-taking and bibliographic work, I explore the breakdowns they encounter in the course of adopting new technologies and examine how functional systems (consisting of institutions, conventions, people, and artifacts) shape and respond to these writers??? goals for their literate practices. The historical and contemporary case studies suggest that writers, teachers, and designers working within digital environments can benefit from increased consideration of the role of computing practices and artifacts in rhetorical work. unpublishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{study how}} {{enforcing}} self-consistency in the statistical {{properties of the}} preshear and postshear stress on a fault {{can be used to}} constrain fault constitutive behavior beyond that required to produce a desired spatial and temporal evolution of slip in a single event. We explore features of rupture dynamics that (1) lead to slip heterogeneity in earthquake ruptures and (2) maintain these conditions following rupture, so that the stress field is compatible with the generation of aftershocks and facilitates heterogeneous slip in subsequent events. Our three-dimensional finite element simulations of magnitude 7 events on a vertical, planar strike-slip fault show that the conditions that lead to slip heterogeneity remain in place after large events when the dynamic stress drop (initial shear stress) and <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> (fracture energy) are spatially heterogeneous. In these models the <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> is on the order of MJ/m^ 2, which is comparable to the radiated energy. These conditions producing slip heterogeneity also tend to produce narrower slip pulses independent of a slip rate dependence in the fault constitutive model. An alternative mechanism for generating these confined slip pulses appears to be fault constitutive models that have a stronger rate dependence, which also makes them difficult to implement in numerical models. We hypothesize that self-consistent ruptures could also be produced by very narrow slip pulses propagating in a self-sustaining heterogeneous stress field with <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> comparable to fracture energy estimates of kJ/M^ 2...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we attempt to}} {{reconcile}} a theoretical understanding of the earthquake energy balance with current geologic understanding of fault zones, with seismological estimates of fracture energy on faults, and with geological measurements of surface energy in fault gouges. In particular, we discuss the mechanical work absorbed on the fault plane during the propagation of a dynamic earthquake rupture. We show that, for realistic fault zone models, all the mechanical work is converted in frictional work defined as the irreversible work against frictional stresses. We note that the eff γ of Kostrov and Das (1988) is zero for cracks lacking stress singularities, and thus does {{not contribute to the}} work done on real faults. Fault shear tractions and slip velocities inferred seismologically are phenomenological variables at the macroscopic scale. We define the macroscopic frictional work and we discuss how it is partitioned into surface energy and heat (the latter includes real heat as well as plastic deformation and the radiation damping of Kostrov and Das). Tinti et al. (2005) defined and measured <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> for recent earthquakes, which is the excess of work over some minimum stress level associated with the dynamic fault weakening. The comparison between geologic measurements of surface energy and <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> revealed that 1 - 10 % of <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> went into the creation of fresh fracture surfaces (surface energy) in large earthquakes, and the remainder went into heat. We also point out that in a realistic fault zone model the transition between heat and surface energy can lie anywhere below the slip weakening curve...|$|R

40|$|We {{attempt to}} {{reconcile}} current {{understanding of the}} earthquake energy balance with recent estimates of fracture energy from seismological investigations and surface energy from geological observations. The complex structure of real fault zones suggests that earthquakes in such fault structures are dominated by scale-dependent processes. We present a model for an inelastic fault zone of finite thickness embedded in an elastic crust represented at a macroscopic scale by a mathematical plane of zero thickness. The constitutive properties of the fault zone are governed by physical processes controlling gouge and damage evolution at meso- and micro-scale. However, in order to model and interpret seismological observations, we represent dynamic fault weakening at the macroscopic scale in terms of traction evolution {{as a function of}} slip and other internal variables defining a phenomenological friction or contact law on the virtual mathematical plane. This contact law is designed to capture the main features of dynamic fault weakening during earthquake rupture. In this study we assume that total shear traction is friction and corresponds to shear resistance of the whole fault zone. We show that seismological observations, depending on finite and limited wavelength and frequency bandwidth, can only provide an estimate of breakdown stress drop and <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> (a more general definition of seismological fracture energy) representing a lower bound of the total intrinsic power of dissipation on the fault zone. We emphasize that geological estimates of surface energy can be compared with seismological estimates of <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> only if they are representative of the same macroscopic scale. In this case, it emerges that, contrary to surface energy, seismological <b>breakdown</b> <b>work</b> represents a non-negligible contribution to the earthquake energy budget...|$|R
