5|$|Daara J, {{formed in}} 1997, was {{originally}} a trio {{that consisted of}} Faada Freddy, N'Dongo D and Lord Alajiiman. Lord Alajiiman performed and toured throughout {{the world with the}} group until 2008 when the group split. Since then, Alajiman evolves in a solo career while contributing {{to the development of the}} music sector in Senegal. Daara J was formed when all of its members <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>school,</b> where they were studying accounting. The rappers were influenced by American hip hop artists such as Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa but also listened to their parents' music, which included artists such as Sly and the Family Stone and Aretha Franklin, and musical styles which included Cuban music. Faada Freddy cites the group's major inspiration as Das EFX. Originally, the members took instrumentals of hip hop tracks from the United States and France to rap over. Later they purchased a drum machine, but even with this equipment, a member of the group would have to imitate the other instruments in the song with his voice. Positive Black Soul, another Senegalese rap group, encouraged Daara J to record and perform.|$|E

500|$|Throughout October, {{the team}} mocked D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels), using {{phrases such as}} [...] "Are you 50?" [...] instead of DX's usual catchphrase [...] "Are you Ready?" [...] to mock their ages due to DX being formed in 1997, when both Morrison and Miz <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>school.</b> On the October 28 episode of ECW, their feud with DX {{continued}} as they mocked them after a live Dirt Sheet and then proceeded to attack two impostors playing Michaels and Triple H. On the 800th episode celebration of Raw, Morrison and The Miz competed in a match against DX, and were defeated. During the match, they mocked DX's signature moves, with Morrison successfully performing a superkick (mocking Michaels' Sweet Chin Music) on Triple H as well as The Miz attempting a Pedigree on Triple H.

Ross, {{who has had a}} crush on Rachel since the two of them <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>school,</b> constantly attempts to tell her how he feels about her. However, many obstacles stand in his way, such as {{the fact that he is}} expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol. Joey is shown to be a bachelor and struggling actor, while Phoebe works as a masseuse and portrays a sort of [...] "crazy" [...] attribute to her personality based on her troubles as a child after her mother committed suicide. However the rest of the group loves her regardless. Chandler breaks up with girlfriend Janice (Maggie Wheeler), who frequently returns in later seasons. At the end of the season, Chandler accidentally reveals that Ross loves Rachel, who realizes that she feels the same way. The season ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross’ arrival from a trip.|$|E
500|$|In October 1982, A Films, a newly {{established}} subsidiary of A Records, acquired the film rights and commissioned screenwriters Sandy Kroopf and Jack Behr {{to write the}} screenplay. Kroopf and Behr made various changes from the novel, opting to focus primarily on the friendship between Birdy and Al Columbato. They also decided to set the story during the Vietnam War, {{as opposed to the}} novel, which is set during World War II. [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> in the mid-1960's," [...] Behr explained, [...] "so growing up then was our experience." [...] Structuring the film required Kroopf and Behr to create a nonlinear narrative, and manufacture much of the film's action and dialogue from Al's narrative in the novel. Kroopf and Behr spent a year trying to sell their script to various film studios, without success. In 1983, A Films sent the script to Parker, who signed on to direct the film after reading the script. Parker discussed the project with executives at Tri-Star Pictures. After the studio agreed to produce the film, Parker traveled to Los Angeles and met with Kroopf and Behr to work on the script.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." [...] He then continued: [...] "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2008, Miz and Morrison {{were given}} a {{streaming}} segment on the WWE website named The Dirt Sheet in which they mocked other wrestlers and facets of pop culture, showing off their promo skills. Morrison and The Miz co-wrote each episode of The Dirt Sheet each week. As the duo continued to hold the titles, WWE downplayed the angle of Miz and Morrison disliking each other, and portrayed them as friends. Miz competed in a battle royal on the pre-show of WrestleMania XXIV but was unsuccessful in winning after being eliminated by Jamie Noble. The team of Miz and Morrison had many successful title defenses {{over the next few}} months, before dropping the championship to Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder at the Great American Bash in a Fatal Four-Way match which also featured Jesse and Festus and Finlay and Hornswoggle. Neither Miz nor Morrison were pinned, as Hawkins pinned Jesse to win the titles. Miz and Morrison soon followed a feud with Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG) as a battle of their webshows, [...] "Word Up" [...] and [...] "The Dirt Sheet". They were voted into a match with, and defeated, Cryme Tyme at Cyber Sunday. The team also feuded with D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels), using phrases such as [...] "Are you 50?" [...] instead of DX's usual catchphrase [...] "Are you Ready?" [...] to mock their ages due to DX being formed in 1997, when both Miz and Morrison <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>school.</b> On the 800th episode celebration of Raw, Miz and Morrison competed in a match against DX, and were defeated. During the match, they mocked DX's signature moves, with Morrison successfully performing a superkick (mocking Michaels' Sweet Chin Music) on Triple H. On December 13, 2008, Miz and Morrison defeated Kofi Kingston and CM Punk to win the World Tag Team Championship during a WWE house show in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The team then engaged themselves in a feud with The Colóns (Carlito and Primo). In a dark match at WrestleMania XXV, they lost the World Tag Team Championship to The Colóns in a Lumberjack match to unify the World Tag Team and the WWE Tag Team titles.|$|E

2500|$|Entering high school, Cotton's {{physical}} maturity {{provided him}} the size, speed, {{and power to}} dominate his opponents. [...] "He is {{a kid in a}} man's body," [...] said Toby Bailey, who faced a freshman Cotton in the Southern Section Division I-A semifinals in 1994. As a sophomore, Cotton was described by the Chicago Tribune as [...] "already a complete player with upper-body strength of a college senior." [...] However, he did not undergo a second growth spurt. As he grew older, his strength and size were no longer an advantage like they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> <b>school.</b> Cotton became too short to be a forward, but was not quick enough to defend guards. His jump shot and ball-handling ability were suspect by NBA standards. [...] "I never thought he could play," [...] said NBA scout Marty Blake.|$|E
2500|$|A {{book about}} the popular history of the 1970s {{introduces}} it as the decade of [...] "pet rocks, shag carpets, platform shoes and the AMC Gremlin."

Kiplinger's personal finance magazine, Changing Times, listed the AMC Gremlin as first among the best subcompact used cars as [...] "selected by top mechanics for good value, good service." [...] Five years after the Gremlin's introduction, the mechanics liked the six-cylinder engine and most preferred automatic transmission. Comments included, [...] "I have one. It's the greatest. I own one with a 304 V-8 engine. Have no trouble outside of normal maintenance." ...|$|E
