25|$|When {{analyzing}} {{an inverse}} problem, obtaining a maximum likelihood model {{is usually not}} sufficient, as we normally also wish to have information on the resolution power of the data. In the general case <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> large number of model parameters, and an inspection of the marginal probability densities of interest may be impractical, or even useless. But {{it is possible to}} pseudorandomly generate a large collection of models according to the posterior probability distribution and to analyze and display the models {{in such a way that}} information on the relative likelihoods of model properties is conveyed to the spectator. This can be accomplished by means of an efficient Monte Carlo method, even in cases where no explicit formula for the a priori distribution is available.|$|E
500|$|Historian Michael A. Bellesiles {{suggested}} that violence became {{a type of}} corporate tool rather than a civic last resort: [...] "management consistently refused to negotiate in any way with their workers and relied entirely on military force to settle the contest." [...] He notes a letter in which W.W. Scranton wrote to a friend, [...] "I trust when the troops come,--if they ever get here,--that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> conflict, in which the mob shall be completely worsted. In no other way will the thing end with any security for property in the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{is concern}} that cuts to legal aid {{prevented}} tenants and tenants' groups taking legal action over their safety concerns. Robert Bourns of The Law Society said, “There {{have been reports}} that tenants of Grenfell Tower were unable to access legal aid to challenge safety concerns because of the cuts. If {{that is the case}} then <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very stark example of what limiting legal aid can mean.” ...|$|E

2500|$|True to his {{empirical}} thesis, Hume {{tells the}} reader that, though testimony {{does have some}} force, it is never quite as powerful as the direct evidence of the senses. That said, he provides some reasons why <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> basis for trust in the testimony of persons: because a) human memory can be relatively tenacious; and b) because people are inclined to tell the truth, and ashamed of telling falsities. Needless to say, these reasons are only to be trusted {{to the extent that}} they conform to experience. (Hume 1974:389) ...|$|E

60|$|How long {{we slept}} I do not know.

50|$|Where such {{consistent}} deviations are identified, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{opportunity to}} apply an analogy. Typical events which bring about deviations from a trend are wars and depressions. Thus {{the purpose of}} combining analogies with a trend forecast is to predict deviations from the trend deviations which are associated with or caused by external events or influences.|$|R
40|$|There is {{presently}} disagreement {{between theory and}} experiment {{as well as between}} different theoretical calculations concerning the fine-structure splitting of the lowest P state of the neutral helium atom. We believe that we <b>have</b> found <b>a</b> minor error in the formulas used by Drake et al. (Can. J. Phys. 80, 1195 (2002)) in their calculations, and <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> explanation how the error has occurred.

30|$|Operating {{from the}} {{assumptions}} of complexity reduction, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> overly optimistic view {{of the role of}} prediction and of its effectiveness; “the Chinese strategist looks at the configuration and its potential and makes the most of its consequences as they unfold” (Aligica, 2007, p. 333), i.e., complexity absorption. Chinese strategic thinking is focused around two ideas: That of a situation (xing), as it evolves as a field of energy; and that of potential (shi), which is a potential in that situation that can be made to work to one’s benefit (Jullien, 1999).|$|R

Hello, Kansas! Northeastern Ohio hasn’t experienced one in 35 years.

40|$|To {{gauge the}} risk {{corresponding}} {{to a possible}} disaster, {{it is important to}} know both the probability of this disaster and the expected damage caused by such potential disaster (2 ̆ 2 expected shortfall 2 ̆ 2). Both these measures of risk are easy to estimate in the ideal case, when we know the exact probabilities of different disaster strengths. In practice, however, we usually only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> partial information about these probabilities: <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> interval (or, more generally, fuzzy) uncertainty about these probabilities. In this paper, we show how to efficiently estimate the expected shortfall under such interval and/or fuzzy uncertainty...|$|R

30|$|The Hypervisor block {{implements}} the abstraction of sensing and actuation resources, providing functionality at {{the level}} of a single node, explicitly defined as a management domain, either an SN controlled by a specific gateway, or a standalone/set of sensors within a device. In SNs, a node may be less easily identifiable with respect to the one-to-one relationship we have for smartphones and other personal smart devices: more specifically <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> SN made up of thousands of sensors, yet only exposing few sinks, where only part of the stack (i.e., nodal components) can be deployed. A modular architecture of the Hypervisor identifies the following three components: Adapter, Node Manager, Abstraction, and Virtualization Unit.|$|R
