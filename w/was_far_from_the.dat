5|$|It was {{academic}} suicide; Australia <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> centres {{where the}} latest research was being carried out, and communications were much poorer at that time. But Oliphant accepted, and in 1950 returned to Australia as the first Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the Australian National University. Within the school he created a Department of Particle Physics, which he headed himself, a Department of Nuclear Physics under Ernest Titterton, a Department of Geophysics under John Jaeger, a Department of Astronomy under Bart Bok, a Department of Theoretical Physics under Kenneth Le Couteur and a Department of Mathematics under Bernhard Neumann.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia was {{regarded}} as an ideal location for air training {{for a number of}} reasons. It <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hostilities, firmly pro-British and had excellent weather throughout the year. The British Air Ministry resolved to outsource training to the colony amid some urgency in late 1939 after EATS {{took a long time to}} get going in Canada. The RATG was the last EATS group to be formed, but the first to start training airmen; it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of the others, doing so for the first time in November 1940.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 58,000, the first half was goalless.

The score remained the same throughout the remainder of the match and Juventus won 1–0, achieving their first European Cup win.|$|E

5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the atrocities that Las Casas described were exaggerated or even invented, {{but this is not}} generally considered likely as Las Casas <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> only person to be deeply worried about abuse and mistreatment of the Indians. The Dominican friars Antonio de Montesinos and Pedro de Córdoba had reported extensive violence already {{in the first decade of}} the conquest of the Indies, and throughout the conquest of the Americas there were reports of abuse of the natives by friars and priests and ordinary citizens, and many massacres of indigenous people were reported in full by those who perpetrated them. Even some of Las Casas's enemies, such as Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, reported many gruesome atrocities committed against the Indians by the colonizers. All in all, modern historians tend to disregard the numerical figures given by Las Casas, but maintain that the general picture he presented of an intensely violent and abusive conquest did represent reality.|$|E
5|$|Playford {{became a}} wartime Premier in 1939 when Australia, {{as part of}} the British Empire, entered World War II. Later in the war, cut off from {{traditional}} suppliers of manufactures, the country was forced to create its own. Armaments and munitions factories needed to be created to supply the war effort, and Playford was vociferous in advocating South Australia as the perfect location for these. It <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> battlegrounds and had the most efficient labour force in the nation. British Tube Mills opened a mill in the inner-northern suburbs. Ammunition factories were built in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide, as well as in some smaller installations in regional centres, and construction on a shipyard began in Whyalla. Having strenuously opposed a construction of a pipeline to pump water from Morgan in the River Murray to Whyalla for the steelworks and blast furnace there before his ascension to the premiership, Playford oversaw approval of the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline in 1940 and its completion in 1944. He also reversed his previous opposition to Butler's pine plantation and sawmill program, authorising an expansion of the program in the state's southeast.|$|E

Agro pastoralism in India included threshing, planting crops in rows—either of two or of six—and storing grain in granaries.

As it <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mongolian heartland, members of the Ögedeid and Chagataid families refused to attend. The kurultai offered the throne to Batu, but he rejected it, claiming he had no interest in the position.|$|E
25|$|Bergen Airport, Sandviken was {{the first}} water airport to serve the city, with {{services}} commencing in 1934. Although {{it was close to}} the city center, this also meant that the airport's runway took up central parts of Byfjorden. With increased use of aircraft, they became a safety hazard on the fjord. The operations were distributed, as the air traffic control was located at Herdla Airport on Askøy. Herdla was considered, but its runway was too rudimentary and the airport <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city. Although closer, Bergen Naval Air Station on Flatøy also needed to be reached with a ferry.|$|E

The An Shi disturbances continued (as they were later called, since they lasted beyond the death of their instigator, carried on by Shi Siming, and others).

Although no battles were fought in the territory, the withdrawal of Union forces at the beginning of the war allowed the Indian tribes to start raiding the trails passing through Utah. As a result, units from California and Utah were assigned to protect against these raids. Mineral deposits found in Utah by California soldiers encouraged the immigration of non-Mormon settlers into Utah.|$|E
