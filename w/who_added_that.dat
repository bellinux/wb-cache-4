25|$|The Mawlid was not {{accepted}} by all scholars. Taj al-Din al-Fakihani (d. 1331), an Egyptian Maliki, considered Mawlid to be a blameworthy innovation that was either makruh or haram. This view {{was shared by}} fellow Egyptian Maliki Ibn al-Haj al-Abdari, <b>who</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> the celebration was never practiced by the Salaf. However Ibn al-Haj affirms the auspicious qualities of the month of the Mawlid in the most effusive terms and considers Muhammad's date of birth as a particularly blessed time of the year. The Maliki scholar Al-Shatibi considered Mawlid an illegitimate innovation. The Andalusian jurist Abu 'Abd Allah al-Haffar (d. 1408) opposed Mawlid, noting that had the Sahaba celebrated it then its exact date {{would not be a}} matter of uncertainty. The former Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz, along with Hammud ibn 'Abd Allah al-Tuwayjiri (d. 1992), another Saudi scholar, in their opposition also argued that there were many worthy occasions in Muhammad's life which he never commemorated, such as the revelation of the first verses of the Qur'an, the Night Journey and the hijra.|$|E

With a [...] "Schindlerian" [...] Theodore Rosier, a Dickensian Claude, a hinted romance between Rosier and Miss Lundi, and the clown-like Taloche, it added, Gatlif has [...] "weaved a tapestry out of the authentic and the chintzy". Joe Bendel at The Epoch Times stated that the film avoids simply depicting the Romani as victims, with its [...] "decidedly unsentimental" [...] central character, Taloche, who is [...] "wild {{almost to the point}} of being feral". Sophie Benamon at L'Express declared that the madness of Taloche is the pivotal element of the film. In Taloche's face, Nick Schager perceived that [...] "the film seethes with full-bodied fury and anguish". Arizona Reporters review lauded [...] "Taloche's manic antics" [...] as [...] "both the comic center of the film and a representation of the tragedy". Ronie Scheib (Variety) admired Taloche's characterisation, commenting on his acrobatic stunts and close-to-nature persona as gelling well with the film's title of [...] "Freedom".

Jim Farber from New York Daily News felt the song expressed [...] "great need in the lyrics while displaying only bravado in her delivery." [...] Bradley Stern from MuuMuse found the [...] "wailing piano ballad" [...] to be among the weakest tracks from Artpop. Kory Grow of Rolling Stone felt that the emotional high point of [...] "Dope" [...] is its chorus, and is a turning point for the song. While reviewing Artpop, Jerry Shriver from USA Today commented that amongst the loud music of the other songs, [...] "Dope" [...] sounded like [...] "too much of a slog" [...] to provide any change of pace while listening to the record. Leila Brilson from Refinery29 felt that with [...] "Dope" [...] Gaga allowed her [...] "operatic voice" [...] to soar; the song itself is a heart-aching ballad and an unforgettable moment on Artpop. This view was shared by Spencer Kornhaber from The Atlantic <b>who</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> the song was [...] "a histrionic piano ballad". London Evening Standards John Aizlewood criticized the song's lyrics for being submissive, instead of Gaga's empowerment themes. Another negative review came from Chris Bosman from Time, saying that although [...] "Dope" [...] was the most [...] "streamlined" [...] release of Gaga's discography, [...] "the effect would be more powerful if 'Dope' didn't hit every excruciating piano ballad cliché (and feature the hilariously clunky line 'I need you more than dope')." ...|$|E
