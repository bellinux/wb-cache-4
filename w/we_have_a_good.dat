5|$|Etruscan {{architecture}} {{was created}} between about 700 BC and 200 BC, when the expanding civilization of ancient Rome finally absorbed Etruscan civilization. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood {{and other materials}} of temples, houses, tombs and city walls, as well as bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in anything like their original condition are tombs and walls, but through archaeology and other sources <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of information on what once existed.|$|E
25|$|Çatalhöyük (Central Turkey) is {{considered}} the most advanced of these, and Çayönü in the east the oldest (c. 7250 - 6750 BCE). <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea of the town layout at Çayönü, based on a central square with buildings constructed of stone and mud. Archeological finds include farming tools that suggest both crops and animal husbandry as well as domestication of the dog. Religion is represented by figurines of Cybele, a mother goddess. Hacilar (Western Turkey) followed Çayönü, and has been dated to 7040 BCE.|$|E
500|$|I don't think it's {{important}} to take it too literally. I think the song, more than anything, is about having a sense of urgency; about how we are you know, living on borrowed time essentially and people are becoming much {{more aware of the}} environment and how we're destroying the planet. We can't just keep distracting ourselves we do have to educate ourselves and wake up and do something about it. You know {{at the same time we}} don't want to be boring and serious and not have fun so it's kind of like well if we're going to save the planet can <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time while we are doing it? ...|$|E

500|$|... 21st-place {{qualifier}} Casey Mears had his car lose {{power on}} his second warm-up lap after exiting the fourth turn and stopped in turn two; he was allowed one attempt to record a timed lap as a result. Dario Franchitti and Moreno qualified in the 22nd and 23rd positions, while Castroneves took 24th. Carpentier, who qualified in 25th, was observed speeding after he exited pit road and was limited to one lap time. On his run, he went up onto the track's dirty side in turn two and removed his foot from the accelerator pedal. Fernández qualified {{at the back of}} the grid in 26th position and turned off his engine on the backstretch while {{on his second}} warm-up lap and stopped at the bottom of turn three. After qualifying,Tagliani said: [...] "The car is very fast, the team was very quick earlier this year at Michigan and we're looking good right now. We didn't expect to qualify that fast actually, but the car was free and it was great. I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> shot to stay up front with that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|...We are {{slightly}} disappointed with this season, as we increased the playing budget," [...] he said. [...] "The highlight {{was getting to}} Wembley but we froze {{a little in the}} final. But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> team, no matter who the manager is. We are spending enough money and we should be getting to the play-offs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In France, Burgundy was {{the centre}} of monasticism. The {{enormous}} and powerful monastery at Cluny was to have lasting effect on the layout of other monasteries and the design of their churches. Unfortunately, {{very little of the}} abbey church at Cluny remains; the [...] "Cluny II" [...] rebuilding of 963 onwards has completely vanished, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea of the design of [...] "Cluny III" [...] from 1088 to 1130, which until the Renaissance remained the largest building in Europe. However, the church of St. Sernin at Toulouse, 1080–1120, has remained intact and demonstrates the regularity of Romanesque design with its modular form, its massive appearance and the repetition of the simple arched window motif.|$|E

2500|$|On December 4, 2007, {{school administrators}} were {{informed}} that an NWSS student {{had been diagnosed with}} infectious tuberculosis (TB). While the identity of the 9th grade student could not be released, over 200 peers and teachers who came into contact with the individual were notified, and voluntary testing was carried out in room 149 starting on December 11. Responding to the incident, superintendent John Woudzia stated: [...] "It's a significant issue, (but) I'm convinced <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> plan in place." [...] Most forms of TB are currently treatable with antibiotics, but drug-resistant strains are becoming more common. As a follow-up procedure, the school tested these students and teachers once again on February 13, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Harold Thimbleby of New Scientist {{gave the}} book a {{positive}} review, writing, [...] "Here at last is a sensible, thought-provoking and informative {{book about the}} complexity and challenges of the Net." [...] He compared Grossman's writing to other works on the subject matter, [...] "Most books are too enthusiastic about the technology, too American, too Utopian, too get-rich-quick—or just out of date. In Net.wars <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> profoundly challenging book, which rises above parochialism. It is full of insights—as much into bulletin boards as sexual stereotyping, rights to free speech and establishing global copyright." [...] Thimbleby concluded, [...] "Everyone, particularly police, lawyers, teachers, parents and scientists, can usefully read this book and consider what the Net really means for us all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Egyptian pharaohs {{were always}} {{regarded}} as deities, but other deities {{are much less}} common in large statues, except when they represent the pharaoh as another deity; however the other deities are frequently shown in paintings and reliefs. The famous row of four colossal statues outside the main temple at Abu Simbel each show Rameses II, a typical scheme, though here exceptionally large. [...] Small figures of deities, or their animal personifications, are very common, and found in popular materials such as pottery. Most larger sculpture survives from Egyptian temples or tombs; by Dynasty IV (2680–2565 BCE) at the latest {{the idea of the}} Ka statue was firmly established. These were put in tombs as a resting place for the ka portion of the soul, and so <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> number of less conventionalized statues of well-off administrators and their wives, many in wood as Egypt {{is one of the few}} places in the world where the climate allows wood to survive over millennia. The so-called reserve heads, plain hairless heads, are especially naturalistic. Early tombs also contained small models of the slaves, animals, buildings and objects such as boats necessary for the deceased to continue his lifestyle in the afterworld, and later Ushabti figures.|$|E
2500|$|Guadalajara, due to {{the ongoing}} Mexican Drug War, has seen {{escalating}} violence. Some countries, including the United States and Canada, expressed concerns about the safety and security of the region. Scott Backmun of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) raised concerns about the city's ability to host the games {{in light of the}} drug war. Due to the increased safety issues the USOC had its own security plan for the games. During a meeting of the USOC in March 2011, chief security officer Larry Buendorf gave a report {{to the rest of the}} committee in which he said, [...] "We’re going to prepare for Guadalajara like we would any other Games. A lot of that is just preparing your athletes for the individual environments that they’re going into. Everybody is quite aware of the violence that has happened. We’re obviously concerned about it, and at the end of the day, I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> security plan in place to try to protect our athletes". After grenades were thrown near a nightclub entrance in two separate incidents in February 2011, organizers said they were making security a priority and arranged for police and members of the armed forces to patrol in Guadalajara throughout the games.|$|E
2500|$|Bird {{said his}} {{victory in the}} sprint race felt [...] "fantastic", [...] "Being back in GP2 is already feeling very good, being back in the feeder series to Formula One {{is a great place}} to be. To win for RUSSIAN TIME after only four races of {{existence}} is a very good feeling." [...] He believed that he may have pushed too hard at the wrong time in the race, [...] "it was just a case of keeping it on the racing line and hoping they'd battle it out behind me. Felipe's car was like a rocket at the end. Big thanks to my new team: to win in our fourth race, with no pre-season testing, is amazing." [...] Nasr spoke about car management and maintaining the pace levels with the leaders and believed he could have won in an alternative situation, [...] "But anyway, it’s still a good result. We came here to score big points and it’s quite good to go back to Europe knowing that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> car, a good team. It keeps getting better and better. I’m feeling quite confident." [...] Coletti believed his third-place finish contributed towards [...] "a good weekend" [...] for himself. He stated that entering the European leg of the season as the points leader had gave him additional motivation and hoped to be competing at the front of the field in Barcelona, [...] "We’re still a few points ahead – ten I think. But like I said, we need to score big points in Race 1 and I think that in Barcelona we’ll be in the front." ...|$|E
