50|$|Lithium {{is mainly}} {{removed from the}} body through glomerular function, but some is then reabsorbed {{together}} with sodium through the proximal tubule. Its levels are therefore sensitive to <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>electrolyte</b> <b>balance.</b> Diuretics act by lowering water and sodium levels; this causes more reabsorption of lithium in the proximal tubules so that the removal of lithium from the body is less, leading to increased levels of lithium. ACE inhibitors have also been shown in a retrospective case-control study to increase lithium concentrations. This is likely due to constriction of the afferent arteriole of the glomerulus, resulting in decreased glomerular filtration rate and clearance. Another possible mechanism is that ACE inhibitors {{can lead to a}} decrease in sodium and water. This will increase lithium reabsorption and its concentrations in the body.|$|E

Therefore, the unquestionable progress in the pharmacological and radiotherapy may not allow these patients the option of radical {{surgical treatment}}, We report our experience with the transsphenoidal procedure for pituitary adenomas in aged patients {{in an attempt to}} contribute to a better definition of the actual role of surgery. METHODS Transsphenoidal surgery was performed in 11 patients over 70 years of age affected by various histological types of pituitary micro- and macroadenomas, ranging from Hardy Grade I through IIIc, Special care was dedicated to the postoperative treatment, in particular to <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>electrolyte</b> <b>balances,</b> <b>and</b> to the immediate treatment of any pathological variation of these parameters.

The first three factors probably elicit their effects via high- and low-pressure baroreceptors, while the mechanisms involved for the remainder are unknown. During exercise, the skin circulation is increased in response to the increasing core temperature. The magnitude of vasodilation is influenced by skin temperature, but core temperature is more important for reflex control of skin circulation. Furthermore, several non-thermal factors are determinants for skin blood flow in a given situation: exercise intensity, body posture during exercise, <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>electrolyte</b> <b>balance,</b> degree of acclimatization, and state of training.

40|$|Deterioration of renal {{function}} is typically slow but progressive, and therefore renal disease is often diagnosed in a late stage when already serious complaints occur. Ultimately when renal function has dropped below 10 %, renal replacement is required. Renal transplantation provides a long-term solution {{but due to}} shortage of donor kidneys most patients receive hemodialysis therapy. Although hemodialysis is an effect method to correct disturbances in <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>electrolyte</b> <b>balances</b> in the body, it does not substitute for the important endocrine and metabolic renal functions that are critical for homeostasis. Among these functions are, the renal production of renin which controls blood pressure, the secretion of erythropoietin which stimulates the synthesis of red blood cells, and the excretion of protein bound waste products. As a consequence, many dialysis patients remain in poor health. With the development of regenerative medicine, and particularly tissue engineering and novel drug delivery strategies, alternative routes for renal replacement are emerging. Increasing understanding of (stem) cells, growth factors and regeneration in the kidney has contributed {{to a whole new}} view on restoration and reconstruction of (parts of) renal tissue that may be used to improve current renal replacement therapies.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{renin-angiotensin system}} (RAS) has been {{associated}} with several biological processes of the human body, regulating, among others blood pressure <b>and</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>electrolytes</b> <b>balance.</b> Moreover, RAS also regulates connective tissue growth. Recently, {{studies have shown that the}} use of nandrolone modifies the angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) activity and increases collagen deposition in the heart. OBJECTIVE: The aim of study was to evaluate the Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the superficial flexor tendon (SFT) and in serum after load exercise in combination with anabolic androgenic steroid (AAS) administration after training session and six weeks of detraining. METHODS: Forty-eight Wistar rats were used into two groups (G 1 and G 2) subdivided into four subgroups: Sedentary (S); trained (T); AAS-treated (Deca-Durabolin(r), 5 mg/kg, twice a week) sedentary rats (AAS) and AAS-treated and trained animals (AAST). Trained groups performed jumps in water: four series of 10 jumps each, followed by a 30 sec interval between the series, for seven weeks. RESULTS: Training increased ACE activity in the SFT compared to the control group (p < 0. 05). Both AAS and AAST groups presented higher ACE activity levels (p < 0. 05). The AAST increased the ACE activity only compared to the trained animals. Only the AAST group presented significant higher levels of ACE in the serum. In the G 2 group, all experimental groups presented decreased ACE activity in the serum and in the tendon, as compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that AAS administration and its combination with exercise increased ACE activity of tendons. AAS abuse could compromise tendon adaptation causing maladaptive remodeling...|$|R

The main target organ of AVP in the process of osmoregulation is the kidney, which is composed of approximately one million nephrons, the functional units in kidney. In these nephrons, ultrafil-tration results in the formation of a daily volume of approximately 180 l of pro-urine.

Using solution state NMR spectroscopy and ultrafiltration we found that human ghrelin binds to membrane-mimetic environments via its octanoyl group as well as the aromatic moiety of Phe 4. Relaxation enhancements in a paramagnetic environment reveal that both the octanoyl group on Ser 3 and the aromatic group on Phe 4 are inserted deep into the hydrophobic core of phosphocholine assemblies while the remaining peptide is freely mobile in solution. In contrast, no binding was observed for des-octanoyl ghrelin. Thus, the octanoyl chain, together with the Phe 4 aromatic group of ghrelin, functions as a membrane anchor. Our results are in parallel with the previous finding that a bulky hydrophobic group on Ser 3 and Phe 4 of ghrelin are necessary for its function and thus indicate that membrane-binding is essential for ghrelin function...|$|R
