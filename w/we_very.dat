When {{asked why they}} chose [...] "Marionette" [...] and not the previous episode [...] "Entrada" [...] as the mid-season finale, co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman stated they {{were more interested in}} consequences, such as the repercussions of having both Olivias back in their own worlds. Pinkner explained, [...] "We're always more interested in the 'And then what?' After 'Entrada,' what are the consequences of what we witnessed for the first eight episodes? <b>We</b> <b>very</b> much wanted to play that before the break." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{lieutenant}} in the Gotham City Police Department {{and one of the}} city's few honest police officers, who forms a tenuous, unofficial alliance with Batman and Dent and is given the position of Police Commissioner by the city's mayor following the recent commissioner's assassination. Oldman described his character as [...] "incorruptible, virtuous, strong, heroic, but understated." [...] Nolan explained that [...] " [...] has a great, triangular relationship between Harvey Dent and Gordon and Batman, and that's something <b>we</b> <b>very</b> much drew from." [...] Oldman added that [...] "Gordon {{has a great deal of}} admiration for him at the end, but [...] is more than ever now the dark knight, the outsider. I'm intrigued now to see: If there is a third one, what he's going to do?" [...] On the possibility of another sequel, he said that [...] "returning to [...] is not dependent on whether the role was bigger than the one before." ...|$|E

On many occasions <b>we</b> have been <b>very</b> wrong indeed. <b>We</b> were <b>very</b> wrong indeed when we took part in preventing Europe from putting a term to the impious piracies of Frederick the Great. <b>We</b> were <b>very</b> wrong indeed when we allowed the triumph over Napoleon to be soiled with the mire and blood of Blucher's sullen savages. <b>We</b> were <b>very</b> wrong indeed when we allowed the peaceful King of Denmark to be robbed in broad daylight by a brigand named Bismarck; and when we allowed the Prussian swashbucklers to enslave and silence the French provinces which they could neither govern nor persuade. <b>We</b> were <b>very</b> wrong indeed when we flung to such hungry adventurers a position so important as Heligoland. <b>We</b> were <b>very</b> wrong indeed when we praised the soulless Prussian education and copied the soulless Prussian laws. Knowing that you will mingle your tears with mine over this record of English wrong-doing, I dedicate it to you, and I remain, ...|$|R

But whatever that element is or that aesthetic is, I guess it's worn a little thin for me these days.

Towers notes: [...] "We {{started out with}} an idea that the users {{are going to be}} fairly old, but then as we sort of made the game we focused it. We realized that lots of different people get fun out of the game in lots of different ways. We tested on young kids, we tested on adults, we tested on a mix of the two, and we {{came to the conclusion that}} anyone can play this game. <b>We</b> <b>very</b> much wanted the game to be accessible from the start so that you can play alongside your granny or with your kids.

2500|$|Foot's first {{stint at}} Private Eye lasted until 1972 when, {{according}} to Patrick Marnham, Foot was effectively sacked by Richard Ingrams {{who had come}} to the conclusion that Foot's copy was being unduly influenced by his contacts in the International Socialists. Ingrams has denied this: [...] "It was said at the time that he and I had fallen out over political issues. In fact, <b>we</b> <b>very</b> seldom disagreed about such things, the only tension arising from Paul's belief that whenever there was a strike he had to support the union regardless of any rights or wrongs." [...] In October 1972 he left to join the Socialist Worker, the weekly newspaper of the IS, [...] "confident that a revolution was coming", as he explained decades later. He became editor in 1974.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014 {{the house}} and grounds were {{purchased}} by the DFN Charitable Foundation ("DFN Foundation") for Stepping Stones School and are to be restored {{for use as a}} school for children with hemiplegia, physical, medical, anxiety, and autistic spectrum difficulties. [...] The DFN Foundation states [...] "we are totally committed to the restoration of this building to its unique status as the cradle of so much of Conan Doyle’s genius. Our restoration plans encompass all of the original buildings, including the stable block. The features which made Undershaw special, specifically the stained glass windows and our proposal to faithfully re-create Conan-Doyle’s study is very exciting and will be enjoyed by our children and visitors. [...] <b>We</b> <b>very</b> much hope the local community and Conan Doyle enthusiasts from around the world will join us in visiting Undershaw and use some of the facilities which will be created." [...] The DFN Foundation was established in 2014 by David Forbes-Nixon, and aims to support the areas of education, healthcare and conservation. [...] The Foundation's revised plans for the house's conversion have been supported by the Undershaw Preservation Trust.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on {{not just}} the {{situation}} in Tunisia and Egypt {{but also on the}} 2011 Yemeni protests, and the 2011 Jordanian protests, Clinton said at a February 5 meeting of the Quartet on the Middle East, [...] "The region is being battered by a perfect storm of powerful trends. ... This is what has driven demonstrators into the streets of ... cities throughout the region. The status quo is simply not sustainable." [...] She said that while transition to democracy could be chaotic – and free elections had to be accompanied by free speech, a free judiciary, {{and the rule of law}} in order to be effective – in the end [...] "free people govern themselves best". The transformations highlighted that traditional U.S. foreign policy in the region had sided with rulers who suppressed internal dissent but provided stability and generally supported U.S. goals in the region. When the monarchy's response to the 2011 Bahraini protests turned violent, Clinton urged a return to the path of reform, saying that violence against the protesters [...] "is absolutely unacceptable ... <b>We</b> <b>very</b> much want to see the human rights of the people protected, including right to assemble, right to express themselves, and we want to see reform." [...] At the same time, she said that the U.S. [...] "cannot tell countries what they are going to do [...] cannot dictate the outcomes." [...] As the situation in Bahrain lingered on and continued to have episodes of violence against protesters, Clinton said in mid-March, [...] "Our goal is a credible political process that can address the legitimate aspirations of all the people of Bahrain ... Violence is not and cannot be the answer. A political process is. We have raised our concerns about the current measures directly with Bahraini officials and will continue to do so." ...|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "Iron Man" [...] was {{originally}} entitled [...] "Iron Bloke"; upon hearing the main guitar riff {{for the first}} time, Osbourne remarked that it sounded [...] "like a big iron bloke walking around". The title was later changed to [...] "Iron Man" [...] as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. [...] The riff to [...] "Iron Man" [...] is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that [...] "...Tony Iommi {{turned out to be}} one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away." [...] Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. He is rendered mute, unable verbally to warn people of his time of the impending destruction. His attempts to communicate are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and have his revenge on mankind, causing the destruction seen in his vision. [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands [...] "it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life." [...] In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne concurs: [...] "It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, <b>we</b> <b>very</b> rarely went on holiday... And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet. [...] "You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world," [...] Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, [...] "and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that I wanted to talk about political stuff so that's what inspired me." ...|$|E
