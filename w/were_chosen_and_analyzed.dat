These plants face several technical problems and the inspection of components such as absorber tubes in parabolic trough concentrators (PTC), which are widely deployed, is necessary to guarantee plant efficiency. This article presents a system for real-time industrial inspection of CSP plants using low-cost, open-source components in conjunction with a thermographic sensor and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system, available in open-source hardware and software, is designed to be employed independently of the type of device used for inspection (laptop, smartphone, tablet or smartglasses) and its operating system. Several UAV flight missions were programmed as follows: flight altitudes at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 m above ground level; and three cruising speeds: 5, 7 and 10 m/s. These settings <b>were</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyzed</b> in order to optimize inspection time.

40|$|Background: Every {{year the}} number of young and middle-aged persons who receive stroke are increasing. Stroke is often {{considered}} as a disease of old people. A stroke often leads to changes in life. The consequences can be cognitive impairments and movement disabilities. These consequences can have a high impact of the person's life. Aim: The aim was to describe experiences of daily life after a stroke from the perspective of adults younger than 65 years old. Method: To analyze data, Friberg's (2012) method aimed to contribute to evidence-based care based on analyzing qualitative research, was used. Ten scientific articles <b>were</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyzed.</b> Results: The result showed that adults younger than 65 who suffered from a stroke experiences a lot of difficulties in life afterwards.

It {{has been argued}} that there is a serious need for {{intelligent buildings}} to be evaluated against the parameters of total sustainability (environmental, economic and social) so as to help the agenda of living in a technologically advanced, healthy and comfortable world. This paper reviews existing theoretical concepts of intelligence and sustainability in the built environment, through an exploration of various scientific literature and U. S Green Building Council’s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) databases. A systematic qualitative review approach has been employed to select an appropriate definition of sustainable development {{and use it as a}} theoretical framework to assess the technological impact of intelligent buildings on the environmental, economic and social front. Subsequently five case study buildings from around the world, which exemplify the use of intelligent technologies to achieve sustainable gains <b>were</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyzed</b> to further validate the literature findings.

Moreover, the comparison of the attributes of intelligent buildings and sustainable practices in buildings, illustrates the fact that there is a considerable overlap between the two and intelligence can aid sustainability in the built environment. Thus the research suggests that green technologies and intelligence in combination may be a pragmatic approach towards the sustainability aspect...|$|E

PEEK has replaced metals like Aluminum and brass for cost and weight saving reasons as well as “metallic reactions”. It is also the one polymer that can meet the needs of more demanding applications where very high or low temperatures or chemical resistance are key operational parameters PEEK is an ideal replacement for Aluminum alloy as well as other types of metal tubing, and even glass for weight reduction, comparable strength/mass, chemical resistance, hardness, and low extractable. PEEK is particularly useful in the automobile industry for its weight. In an application where 2 grams can make a difference and weight is directly correlated to fuel cost, light weight PEEK is superior material matches aluminum in mechanical properties, and is more resistant to fluids. In this project work the entire wheel design of two wheeler <b>was</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyzed</b> by applying different load and redesign the wheel again to minimize the deformation and material will be changed from aluminum to PEEK(polyether ether ketone) The following materials were chosen:...|$|R
