[...] "The story ... probably evokes for many readers a mental representation of a prototypical incident, perhaps an image of an exhausted bird, its feathers soaked in black oil, unable to escape," [...] and subjects based their <b>willingness-to-pay</b> mostly on that mental image.|$|E
50|$|In one study, {{respondents}} were asked how much {{they were willing to}} pay to prevent migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds by covering the oil ponds with protective nets. Subjects were told that either 2,000, or 20,000, or 200,000 migrating birds were affected annually, for which subjects reported they were willing to pay $80, $78 and $88 respectively. Other studies of <b>willingness-to-pay</b> to prevent harm have found a logarithmic relationship or no relationship to scope size.|$|E
50|$|Adverse {{selection}} {{models can}} be further categorized in models with private values and models with interdependent or common values. In models with private values, the agent's type has a direct influence on his own preferences. For example, he has knowledge over his effort costs or his <b>willingness-to-pay.</b> Alternatively, models with interdependent or common values occur when the agent's type has a direct influence on the principal's preferences. For instance, the agent may be a seller who privately knows {{the quality of a}} car.|$|E
50|$|NICE {{guidance}} {{supports the}} use of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) as the primary outcome for quantifying the expected health benefits associated with a given treatment regime. By comparing the present value (see discounting) of expected QALY flows with and without treatment, or relative to another treatment, the net/relative health benefit derived from such a treatment can be derived. When combined with the relative cost of treatment, this information {{can be used to}} estimate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is considered in relation to NICE's threshold <b>willingness-to-pay</b> value.|$|E
50|$|We {{consider}} an auction where {{a set of}} identical products are being sold. Bidders can {{take part in the}} auction by announcing the maximum price they are willing to pay to receive N products. Each buyer is allowed to declare more than one bid, since its <b>willingness-to-pay</b> per unit might be different depending on the total number of units it receives. Bidders cannot see other people's bids at any moment since they are sealed (only visible to the auction system). Once all the bids are made, the auction is closed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{economic}} terms, {{the rental}} value is the added value an individual contributes when goods are being exchanged or traded for profit. This additional quality is often fixed and is alone under the trader’s ownership. The characteristic can be tangible {{such as a}} signature method of use or intangible such as exclusive knowledge pertaining to a product; also known as intellectual property. The value arises from when the market or model is in equilibrium and it is advantages for an individual {{to take part in}} trading activities rather than not participate, considering profit or utility can be achieved. [...] Two separate but ideally identical exchange scenarios may occur but may have completely different values calculated. [...] This is explained by two classic examples, a consumer achieves a [...] or profit when buying goods if they are able to buy all quantities at a single price. The producer lacks knowledge concerning the relationship between an individual’s <b>willingness-to-pay</b> and quantity. This means the producer cannot price discriminate according to the consumer’s demand marginality. In this example the buyer has achieved a beneficial rent. If the seller were to discover the buyers <b>willingness-to-pay</b> at different quantities, the seller could maximize their profit by selling quantities at different prices. In most situations this is achieved by slightly lowering the price as more products are bought. In this example the seller achieves a beneficial rent. [...] Economic theories suggest that a free market would correct itself of rents. Considering the producer surplus example, if the gradual discounting of prices also attracted more consumers, the producer would have to re-evaluate their strategy. Often, consumers have different willingness’-to-pay for goods. Following this assumption, profit would not be maximized because the price strategy would not be applicable to all buyers. However, if analyzed in reality, through means such as market research, the producer can find a <b>willingness-to-pay</b> that represents most buyers. Consumer rent from the individuals who still pay for goods lower than willing and the producer rent from ability to price discriminate would then counter one another, resulting in market equilibrium.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the auction, {{the total}} utility has been maximized since all the goods have been {{attributed}} to the people with the highest combined <b>willingness-to-pay.</b> If agents are fully rational {{and in the absence of}} collusion, we can assume that the willingness to pay have been reported truthfully since only the marginal harm to other bidders will be charged to each participant, making truthful reporting a weakly-dominant strategy. This type of auction, however, will not maximize the seller's revenue unless the sum of bids of the second best combination of bids is equal to the sum of bids of the best combination of bids.|$|E
5000|$|Standard {{environmental}} economic {{methods are}} used to place a monetary value on ecosystem services {{where there are no}} market prices. These include [...] "stated preference" [...] methods and [...] "revealed preference" [...] methods. Stated preference methods, such as the contingent valuation method ask people for their willingness to pay for a certain ecosystem (service). Revealed preference methods, such as hedonic pricing and the travel cost method, use a relation with a market good or service to estimate the <b>willingness-to-pay</b> for the service. Applying such preference based approaches has been criticised as a means of deriving the value of ecosystems and biodiversity and for avoiding deliberation, justification and judgment in making choices.|$|E
50|$|A job {{security}} score is a numerical expression of an individual's unemployment risk {{based on a}} statistical analysis of a person's individual demographics, such as location, industry, and occupation, as well as external factors, such as technology, outsourcing, and overseas competition, which is captured in macroeconomic data and trends. Job Security Score also represents the creditworthiness of an individual based on their ability-to-pay by predicting an individual's probability of unemployment risk. It {{is similar to the}} Credit Score, which represents the creditworthiness of an individual based on their <b>willingness-to-pay</b> by evaluating an individual's probability of paying debts in a timely manner. The Job Security Score is a patent-pending payment risk scoring technology that was first developed by Scorelogix http://www.scorelogix.com/jss.asp, a pioneer in consumer risk analytics.|$|E
50|$|The third {{alternative}} {{explanation was}} that people have habitual bargaining behaviors, such as overstating their minimum selling price or understating their maximum bargaining price, that may spill over from strategic interactions where these behaviors are useful to the laboratory setting where they are sub-optimal. An experiment was conducted to address this by having the clearing prices selected at random. Buyers who indicated a <b>willingness-to-pay</b> higher than the randomly drawn price got the good, and vice versa for those who indicated a lower WTP. Likewise, sellers who indicated a lower willingness-to-accept than the randomly drawn price sold the good and vice versa. This incentive compatible value elicitation method did not eliminate the endowment effect but did rule out habitual bargaining behavior as an alternative explanation.|$|E
5000|$|Suppose buyers cannot {{distinguish}} between a high-quality car (a [...] "peach") and a [...] "lemon". Then {{they are only}} {{willing to pay a}} fixed price for a car that averages the value of a [...] "peach" [...] and [...] "lemon" [...] together (pavg). But sellers know whether they hold a peach or a lemon. Given the fixed price at which buyers will buy, sellers will sell only when they hold [...] "lemons" [...] (since plemon < pavg) and they will leave the market when they hold [...] "peaches" [...] (since ppeach > pavg). Eventually, as enough sellers of [...] "peaches" [...] leave the market, the average <b>willingness-to-pay</b> of buyers will decrease (since the average quality of cars on the market decreased), leading to even more sellers of high-quality cars to leave the market through a positive feedback loop.|$|E
50|$|The {{embedding}} {{effect is}} an issue in environmental economics and other branches of economics where researchers wish to identify {{the value of a}} specific public good using a contingent valuation or <b>willingness-to-pay</b> (WTP) approach. (Public goods are those goods and benefits which belong to society as a whole). The results can be unreliable and misleading because of the difficulty, for individual society members, of identifying the particular value that they attach to one particular thing which is embedded in a collection of similar things (e.g. The Tower of London within the set of all globally important historic monuments or Caernarvon Castle within the set of all Welsh Scheduled Monuments) or when embedded within choices between a wider selection of public goods (for example whether spending on preserving a specific wetland is more important than preserving a specific persons life {{for the next two years}} using taxpayers' money).|$|E
5000|$|... ==Pricing {{based on}} value or elasticity== Ideally, {{companies}} should ask {{the price for}} a product which {{is equal to the}} value a consumer attaches to a product. This is called value-based pricing. As this value can differ from person to person, it is difficult to uncover the perfect value and have a differentiated price for every person. However, consumer's <b>willingness-to-pay</b> {{can be used as a}} proxy for the perceived value. With the price elasticity of products, companies can calculate how many consumers are willing to pay for the product at each price point. Products with high elasticities are highly sensitive to changes in price, while products with low elasticities are less sensitive to price changes (ceteris paribus). Subsequently, products with low elasticity are typically valued more by consumers if everything else is equal. The dynamic aspect of this pricing method is that elasticities change with respect to product, category, time, location and retailers. With the price elasticity of products the margin of the product, retailers can use this method with their pricing strategy to aim for volume, revenue or profit maximization strategies.|$|E
5000|$|In modern {{contract}} theory, {{the term}} [...] "adverse selection" [...] is simply used to categorize principal-agent models {{in which an}} agent has private information already before a contract is written. For example, a worker may know his effort costs (or a buyer may know his <b>willingness-to-pay)</b> before an employer (or a seller) makes a contract offer. In contrast, the term [...] "moral hazard" [...] is used for principal-agent models, where there is symmetric information {{at the time of}} contracting. The agent may become privately informed after the contract is written. According to Hart and Holmström (1987), moral hazard models are further subdivided into hidden action and hidden information models, depending on whether the agent becomes privately informed due to an unobservable action that he himself chooses or due to a random move by nature. Hence, the difference between an adverse selection model and a hidden information (sometimes called hidden knowledge) model is simply the timing. In the former case, the agent is informed at the outset. In the latter case, he becomes privately informed after the contract has been signed.|$|E
50|$|The {{smart grid}} allows for {{systematic}} communication between suppliers (their energy price) and consumers (their <b>willingness-to-pay),</b> and permits both the suppliers and the consumers {{to be more}} flexible and sophisticated in their operational strategies. Only the critical loads will need to pay the peak energy prices, and consumers {{will be able to}} be more strategic in when they use energy. Generators with greater flexibility will be able to sell energy strategically for maximum profit, whereas inflexible generators such as base-load steam turbines and wind turbines will receive a varying tariff based on the level of demand and the status of the other generators currently operating. The overall effect is a signal that awards energy efficiency, and energy consumption that is sensitive to the time-varying limitations of the supply. At the domestic level, appliances with a degree of energy storage or thermal mass (such as refrigerators, heat banks, and heat pumps) will be well placed to 'play' the market and seek to minimise energy cost by adapting demand to the lower-cost energy support periods. This is an extension of the dual-tariff energy pricing mentioned above.|$|E
50|$|Hedonic damages, {{the loss}} of the value of life, are allowed in almost every state in a non-fatal injury case. Based on William Daubert et al. v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and other {{admissibility}} tests, many but not all jurisdictions allow economic expert witness testimony on hedonic damages. For example, the Nevada Supreme Court unanimously approved of such testimony in Banks v. Sunrise Hospital, 120 Nev. 822, 102 P.3d 52 (2004). Similarly, the 4th Appellate District in Ohio allowed such testimony based on Daubert in Lewis v. Alfa Leval,128 Ohio App.3d.200 (1998). The Court of appeals in the Lewis case held that the trial judge properly ruled that the testimony met the Daubert Standards, and that it was within the discretion of the trial court to have admitted hedonic damages testimony. The measurement of hedonic damages is based on some 40 years of extensive, well-accepted, peer-reviewed, economic research on the value of a statistical life (VSL). This measurement is controversial among forensic economists. The Value of Statistical Life literature is accepted by most forensic economists, including those economists few who oppose the admission of hedonic damages testimony. Many courts nationwide have allowed such testimony but judges have significant discretion as to its admissibility. Economists generally agree that the VSL is in the $4 million to $5 million range. This value is an average of many published results based on economic research using the <b>Willingness-to-Pay</b> model(WTP). Hedonic damages are not allowed in death cases in the great majority of the states. Some states do allow recovery in wrongful death cases, including New Hampshire, New Mexico, Georgia, Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, and in Federal Section 1983 civil rights violation actions.|$|E
5000|$|The ICER {{can be used}} as a {{decision}} rule in resource allocation. If {{a decision}}-maker is able to establish a <b>willingness-to-pay</b> value for the outcome of interest, it is possible to adopt this value as a threshold. If for a given intervention the ICER is above this threshold it will be deemed too expensive and thus should not be funded, whereas if the ICER lies below the threshold the intervention can be judged cost-effective. This approach has to some extent been adopted in relation to QALYs; for example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) adopts a nominal cost-per-QALY threshold of £20,000 to £30,000. [...] As such, the ICER facilitates comparison of interventions across various disease states and treatments. In 2009, NICE set the nominal cost-per-QALY threshold at £50,000 for end-of-life care because dying patients typically benefit from any treatment for a matter of months, making the treatment's QALYs small. In 2016, NICE set the cost-per-QALY threshold at £100,000 for treatments for rare conditions because, otherwise, drugs for a small number of patients would not be profitable. The use of ICERs therefore provides an opportunity to help contain health care costs while minimizing adverse health consequences. Treatments for patients who are near death offer few QALYs simply because the typical patient has only months left to benefit from treatment. They also provide to policy makers information on where resources should be allocated when they are limited. As health care costs have continued to rise, many new clinical trials are attempting to integrate ICER into results to provide more evidence of potential benefit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Empirical {{estimates}} {{of the value of}} a life based on the <b>willingness-to-pay</b> concept have been used in formulating public policy decisions involving safety and environmental regulations and by some state courts as a measure of the legal value of a human life in personal injury cases. The basic idea of the <b>willingness-to-pay</b> concept is that by examining how people value small risk changes we can estimate the value of the entire life. The paper argues that the use of the <b>willingness-to-pay</b> concept is theoretically inappropriate and demonstrates that because people are risk averse, <b>willingness-to-pay</b> {{estimates of}} the value of a life will generally overstate the relevant economic value.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we use data from an internet-based survey and {{estimate}} {{the benefits of}} an oyster consumption safety policy with the contingent valuation method. In addition to providing a context specific estimate of <b>willingness-to-pay</b> for oyster safety, we consider two unresolved issues in the contingent valuation health risk literature. First, {{a number of studies}} in the mortality risk reduction literature find that <b>willingness-to-pay</b> is not sensitive to the scope of the risk change. We present the scope test as a difference in the number of lives saved by the program, instead of small changes in risk, and that referendum votes are responsive to scope. Second, we identify those at risk respondents who would actually benefit from the policy and decompose <b>willingness-to-pay</b> into personal mortality risk reduction values and altruistic <b>willingness-to-pay.</b> We find that respondents are sensitive to the scope of the policy and most at-risk respondents are willing to pay even more. We find that <b>willingness-to-pay</b> per life saved is $ 1. 28 million for the pure private good of own-risk reduction.
