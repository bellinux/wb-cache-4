5|$|In 1993, Pelé {{publicly}} {{accused the}} Brazilian football administrator Ricardo Teixeira of corruption after Pelé's television company was rejected {{in a contest}} for the Brazilian domestic rights to the 1994 World Cup. Pelé accusations led to an eight-year feud between the pair. As {{a consequence of the}} affair, the President of FIFA, João Havelange banned Pelé from the draw for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Las Vegas. Criticisms over the ban <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> have negatively affected Havelange's chances of re-election as FIFA's president in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{individual}} murderers <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} so heinous that standard punishments like beheading or to be broken on the wheel were not regarded as sufficiently commensurate with their crimes, and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised. The case of Pavel Vašanský (Paul Wasansky in German transcript) may serve as an example here.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's work became {{increasingly}} controversial among literary critics, {{teachers and parents}} from the 1950s onwards, because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books, particularly the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> lack literary merit. Her books have been criticised as being elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic and {{at odds with the}} more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.|$|E

5|$|The 1945 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season produced multiple landfalling tropical cyclones. It officially began on June16 and lasted until October31, dates delimiting {{the period when}} a majority of storms <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> form in the Atlantic Ocean. A total of 11 systems were documented, including a late-season cyclone retroactively added a decade later. Five of the eleven systems intensified into hurricanes, and two further attained their peaks as major hurricanes. Activity began {{with the formation of}} a tropical storm in the Caribbean on June20, which then made landfalls in Florida and North Carolina at hurricane intensity, causing one death and at least $75,000 in damage. In late August, a Category3 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale struck the Texas coastline, with 3 deaths and $20.1 million in damage. The most powerful hurricane of the season, reaching Category4 intensity, wrought severe damage throughout the Bahamas and East Coast of the United States, namely Florida, in mid-September; 26 people were killed and damage reached $60 million. A hurricane moved ashore the coastline of Belize in early October, causing one death, while the final cyclone of the year resulted in 5 deaths and $2 million in damage across Cuba and the Bahamas two weeks later. Overall, 36 people were killed and damage reached at least $82.85 million.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, it was {{reported}} that none of Pennsylvania's 22 abortion clinics had been inspected by the government for more than 15 years.

25|$|In Ireland, {{the state}} retains laws {{that allow for}} censorship, {{including}} specific laws covering films, advertisements, newspapers and magazines, as well as terrorism and pornography.

25|$|Kassing (2001) {{found that}} {{articulated}} and latent dissenters were perceived differently. People perceived articulated dissenters {{to be more}} satisfied, more committed, possess higher quality relationships with their supervisors, and seen as employees who believed they have influence within their organizations than latent dissenters. Furthermore, articulated dissenters, compared to latent dissenters, <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be less verbally aggressive.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the federal}} government's denial that Malaysia is an Islamic state, the {{previous}} administration under Abdullah Badawi gradually furthered the agenda of Islamic supremacy {{at the expense of}} other religions.

25|$|In 1866, the Aliens Act {{imposed a}} {{naturalisation}} fee of £1 on all immigrants to New Zealand who <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be 'undesirable', which in effect meant most non-white immigrants.

25|$|The Boston Bypass Independent Party {{was formed}} in September 2006. The bypass issue had already {{generated}} two campaign groups, the Boston & District Bypass Pressure Group (BBPG) and the Boston Bypass & Economic Growth Pressure Group (BBEG), and the BBI hoped to give this campaign a political element. Additionally the party hoped to re-invigorate local politics in the town which <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> have stagnated with several councillors elected unopposed.|$|E
25|$|In Britain the {{negotiations}} that proceeded {{to the peace}} agreement proved hugely controversial. Strong opposition, led principally by Newcastle and Pitt, was raised against the terms which <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be exceedingly lenient towards France and Spain. A mob {{went so far as}} to attack a carriage carrying George III in protest at the alleged betrayal. Nonetheless Bute felt the war needed to be brought to an end, and the terms on offer were reasonable.|$|E
25|$|Intimidation {{was also}} prevalent, with Kurdish separatist PKK militants {{allegedly}} raiding shops and cafes in the Kurdish-majority south east and demanding {{votes for the}} HDP. It was also alleged that the state-owned Anatolia Agency press organisation marked a voter's house in Diyarbakır after {{they said they would}} not vote for the HDP. Controversies also arose in regards to the HDP's political adverts, which <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be threatening violence if the party didn't cross the 10% threshold and also regarding whether Recep Tayyip Erdoğan would invite the opposition to form a government should the AKP not win a parliamentary majority.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the rapid {{increase in the number}} of municipalities being converted into cities since the enactment of the Local Government Code in 1991, Senator Aquilino Pimentel authored what became Republic Act No. 9009 in June 2001 which sought to establish a more appropriate benchmark by which municipalities that wished to become cities were to be measured. The income requirement was increased sharply from 20 million to 100 million in a bid to curb the spate of conversions into cities of municipalities that <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> have not become urbanized or economically developed enough to be able to properly function as a city.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a period when the {{spelling}} of {{a small number of}} words was altered in what is now regarded as a misguided attempt to make them conform to what <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be the etymological origins of the words. For example, the letter b was added to debt (originally dette) in an attempt to link it to the Latin debitum, and the letter s in island is a misplaced attempt to link it to Latin insula instead of the Old English word īġland, which is the true origin of the English word. The letter p in ptarmigan has no etymological justification whatsoever, only seeking to invoke Greek despite being a Gaelic word.|$|E
25|$|The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, {{also known}} as the Taft–Hartley Act, in 1947 revised the Wagner Act to include {{restrictions}} on unions as well as management. It was a response to public demands for action after the wartime coal strikes and the postwar strikes in steel, autos and other industries that <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> have damaged the economy, as well as a threatened 1946 railroad strike that was called off at the last minute before it shut down the national economy. The Act was bitterly fought by unions, vetoed by President Harry S. Truman, and passed over his veto. Repeated union efforts to repeal or modify it always failed, and it remains in effect today.|$|E

25|$|Such {{treaties}} {{were regarded}} as grossly unfair by many Chinese. They had always considered themselves to be superior to foreigners, but their prestige was sorely damaged by the treaties, as foreigners <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> receive special treatment compared to Chinese. Rumours circulated of foreigners committing crimes {{as a result of}} agreements between foreign and the Chinese governments over how foreigners in China should be prosecuted. In Guizhou, local officials were reportedly shocked to see a cardinal using a sedan chair decorated {{in the same manner as}} one reserved for the governor. The Catholic Church's prohibition on some Chinese rituals and traditions were another issue of contention. Thus in the late 19th century such feelings increasingly resulted in civil disobedience and violence towards both foreigners and Chinese Christians.|$|E
25|$|Later {{in early}} 1944, the 7th Division {{returned}} to Australia in stages and, following a six-week period of leave, they toured the country conducting welcome home marches {{in a number}} of state capitals including Perth, Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne. In April, the division began to re-form in north Queensland, where they undertook a long period of training, including amphibious assault training as well as brigade and divisional level manoeuvres, in preparation for future operations. These operations <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> involve a possible commitment to the fighting in the Philippines in late 1944, but this did not eventuate. Finally, in May 1945, the division received orders to deploy overseas again and by 19 June they arrived on Morotai Island, where they began to prepare for operations in Borneo, as part of Operation Oboe.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds {{of people}} {{gathered}} on the route to pay their last respects to Swami Lakshmanananda. Riots erupted when the procession passed through localities with Christian populations. Christians, who <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> be Indian National Congress party supporters, were targeted everywhere; in some places many Hindu families were also attacked because they were Congress supporters. The attackers included activists of the VHP, the Bajrang Dal and other Sangh Parivar organisations, and workers of the BJP that was {{a partner in the}} government headed by Naveen Patnaik. The violence also saw attacks on Christians who belonged to the Scheduled Castes and on people who claimed tribal status {{on the grounds that they}} spoke the Kui language of the Kondha tribal people. The Kui Samaj, which unites members of the native Kondh tribe in Kandhamal, was found to be very much on the side of the VHP and the ruling alliance.|$|E
40|$|Social {{rejection}} {{can lead}} to a variety of emotions. Two studies show that specific emotional reactions to social rejection can be understood by relying on the fundamental distinction between competence and warmth. Rejection that <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due to incompetence leads to anger, whereas rejection that <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due to lack of warmth leads to sadness. Study 1 measures perceptions of competence and warmth judgments. Study 2 manipulates those perceptions. In both studies, rejection that <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the result of incompetence led primarily to anger, while rejection that <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the result of lack of warmth led primarily to sadness. These results show that the effects of rejection can be better understood if we take into account how rejection <b>is</b> <b>perceived.</b> Highlights ► Adaptive emotional reactions to social rejection ► Compare effects of rejection due to lack of competence and due to lack of warmth ► Rejection due to lack of competence primarily leads to anger ► Rejection due to lack of warmth primarily leads to sadness Keywords: Social rejection, Competence warmth, Social perception, Emotio...|$|R
