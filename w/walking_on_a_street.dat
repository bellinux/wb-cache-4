As a result of that injury, she was confined to bed for three months.

In 1920, aged 23, while <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> with her mother, a delinquent youth struck {{her in the back}} with an iron bar for no apparent reason.

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{was directed by}} Stefani's frequent collaborator Sophie Muller, who had previously directed the music videos of [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Wind It Up". Filming of the music video took place at destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague, where Stefani had been touring during The Sweet Escape Tour in October 2007. It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani {{lying on the ground}} in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown walking on the street under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, against the wall and talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-coloured feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring {{at herself in the mirror}} with her hair up and snow falling slowly down, with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen sitting on the ground and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani running out of the hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being [...] "acutely artful, immeasurably stylish" [...] and commented that [...] "Gwen’s managed to raise the bar on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video." ...|$|E

[...] At first, McGreavy denied any responsibility, but, several hours later said, [...] "It was me, but, it wasn’t me," [...] after which he described in graphic detail what he had done. He told police, [...] "I put my hand over her (Samantha's) mouth, and it went from there. It's all in the house. On Paul, I used a wire. I was going to bury him, but I couldn't.

5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed in late May, co-directed by the singer and her {{production}} team, Haus of Gaga. The video is simple in contrast to much of Gaga's previous work, and portrays her dancing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fire-escape and <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lonely <b>street.</b> Differences include the lack of intricate choreography and back-up dancers, as well as using only one outfit designed by Versace. Critics lauded {{the simplicity of the}} video, while comparing it to the works of Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson and Madonna. Gaga has performed the song in award shows, music festivals and her concert tours.|$|R

5000|$|When Franz, Arthur, and Odile are in {{a crowded}} café, Arthur and Odile decide to dance. Franz joins them as they perform a dance routine. The music is R&B or soul music {{composed}} for the film by Michel Legrand, but Anna Karina said the actors called it [...] "the Madison dance," [...] alluding to a novelty dance of the time. The Madison scene influenced the dance scene with Uma Thurman and John Travolta in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. It also influenced scenes in Hal Hartley's Simple Men and Martin Hynes' The Go-Getter. In Roger Michell's Le Week-End, the principal characters see the dance scene on a television in their Paris hotel room and briefly dance along with it. The final scene of the movie is a longer reenactment in a café {{after one of the}} characters plays the music on a jukebox. The entire dance scene was also used as the music video for the song [...] "Dance with Me" [...] by Nouvelle Vague from their 2006 album Bande à Part. The group took their name from a scene in the film, where Arthur and Odile are <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> and pass a business with Nouvelle Vague (New Wave or New Trend) in large letters over the door.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of my research}} is to design computational systems {{that are capable of}} analyzing and processing auditory scenes. I call this Computer Audition. Although humans can naturally analyze auditory scenes into meaningful events, and consciously or passively respond to them, computer audition remains a challenging problem and once it succeeds, it will represent a fundamental advance in Audio Signal Processing and Intelligent Systems. Successful computer audition systems will also improve our ability to access and manipulate audio data, enabling new multimedia applications and interactions for experts and novices alike. Auditory scenes are difficult to parse because source signals composing them overlap and interfere with each other {{at the same time and}} frequency. For example, when one is <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>street,</b> the auditory signal that he/she receives at any time and frequency may be a mixture of the rustle of leaves, people chatting, and a car passing by. Furthermore, the ways that these sources mix together and the source signals themselves are constantly changing. Imagine recognizing objects in a visual scene where every object is half-transparent (sound sources overlap), objects change their appearance (sound sources change over time) and even disappear or reappear unexpectedly (sound sources become silent and active). A successful computer audition system must be able to access source signals in spite of the other interfering sources. This challenge raises two fundamental questions: 1) How do we discover and separate a sound even...|$|E
5000|$|Years later, Yevgraf finds a {{sick and}} {{destitute}} Yuri in Moscow during the Stalinist era {{and gives him}} a new suit and a job. While riding a tram, Yuri spots a woman he surely thinks is Lara <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> nearby <b>street.</b> Unable to call her from the tram, Yuri struggles to get off at the next stop. Yuri runs after her but suffers a fatal heart attack before he can even signal to her, and the woman walks away oblivious to Yuri's presence. Yuri's funeral is well attended, a surprise to Yevgraf as Yuri's poetry was officially [...] "unattainable at the time". Lara approaches Yevgraf at the funeral and reveals she {{had given birth to}} Yuri's daughter, but lost her in the collapse of the White-controlled government in Mongolia. After vainly looking over hundreds of orphans with Yevgraf's help, Lara disappears during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge of the late 1930s, and [...] "died or vanished somewhere...in one of the labour camps," [...] according to Yevgraf.|$|R

5000|$|In 1766, Rousseau had {{impressed}} Hume {{with his}} physical prowess by spending ten hours {{at night on}} the deck in severe weather during the journey by ship from Calais to Dover while Hume was confined to his bunk. [...] "When all the seamen were almost frozen to death...he caught no harm...He {{is one of the}} most robust men I have ever known," [...] Hume noted. By 1770, Rousseau's urinary disease had also been greatly alleviated after he stopped listening to the advice of doctors; his general health had also improved. However, on 24 October 1776, as he was <b>walking</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> narrow <b>street</b> in Paris <b>a</b> nobleman's carriage came rushing by from the opposite direction; flanking the carriage was a galloping Great Dane belonging to the nobleman. Rousseau was unable to dodge both the carriage and the dog, and was knocked down by the Great Dane. He seems to have suffered a concussion, and also neurological damage after this incident. His health began to decline; Rousseau's friend Corancez described the appearance of certain symptoms which indicate that Rousseau started suffering from epileptic seizures after the accident.|$|R
