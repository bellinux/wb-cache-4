5|$|As Mars {{approaches}} opposition, {{it begins}} {{a period of}} retrograde motion, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> will appear to move backwards in a looping motion {{with respect to the}} background stars. The duration of this retrograde motion lasts for about 72 days, and Mars reaches its peak luminosity {{in the middle of this}} motion.|$|E
5|$|From Jupiter's surface—or rather, {{from just}} above its cloudtops—Amalthea would appear very bright, shining with a {{magnitude}} of −4.7, {{similar to that}} of Venus from Earth. At only 8 arcminutes across, its disc would be barely discernible. Amalthea's orbital period is only slightly longer than its parent planet's day (about 20% in this case), <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> would cross Jupiter's sky very slowly. The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29 hours.|$|E
5|$|The Clumber Spaniel is {{currently}} recognised as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the UK Kennel Club, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is a breed which fewer than 300 new registrations each year.

5|$|The Hawthorns is {{certificated}} {{under the}} highest UEFA pitch surfaces <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> {{is ready to}} host almost any competition if required. Its West Stand could be developed over the Halford's Lane road {{at the back of}} the stand to allow an upper tier, approximately adding around 5,000 to the capacity of The Hawthorns. Other developments can include the filling in of The Millennium and East-Rainbow corners if and when required.|$|E
5|$|From 1997, the 166th Aviation Brigade {{has trained}} other {{aviation}} units for front-line service. As such, {{it has never}} seen combat, and has thus never earned any campaign streamers or unit awards. As the only brigade in the First Army responsible for training aviation units, the 166th Aviation Brigade is the principal unit for training Army Reserve and Army National Guard assets preparing to deploy to contingencies around the world, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is responsible for 47 percent of all Army Aviation assets.|$|E
5|$|In September 2004, {{the school}} was {{designated}} a music and mathematics specialist school, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> receives additional funding for those subjects. In 2007, {{the school was}} invited to become a High Performing Specialist School, and in April 2008 was successful in attaining science specialism status. As mathematics is automatically included under a science specialism, the school selected English to be included under the first specialism. The Judd School is now a music with English and science with mathematics specialist school.|$|E

5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon dead wood, {{which can}} {{be attached to the}} tree or fallen, where it causes white rot. It favours oak, but can also be found on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is known to be a pioneer species on dead wood, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> can be the first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|The Nord Stage {{follows the}} success of earlier {{keyboard}} instruments from Clavia, and contains similar emulations of vintage electromechanical keyboards such as the Hammond Organ and electric pianos as found on the Nord Electro 2, with additional functionality including a weighted piano-like keyboard on certain models, a synthesizer section based on the Nord Lead, a more versatile organ section and extended effects processing. The Nord Stage is multitimbral, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> can play more than one sound at once, either by splitting the internal keyboard or connecting an external MIDI controller.|$|E
5|$|The clutch was {{described}} as consisting of a single egg; given the bird's large size, this led to proposals that the solitaire was K-selected, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required extensive parental care until maturity. The gathering of unrelated juveniles suggests that they formed crèches, that may have followed foraging adults {{as part of the}} learning process. A study of subfossil remains found that the carpal knob only developed after the bird reached skeletal maturity.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} {{renewable}} energy is an evergreen subject, especially, in a world dominated by fossil fuels. Renewable energy is widely discussed {{in the contemporary world}} because <b>it</b> is unlimited, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it’s</b> sustainable and does not emit greenhouse gasses that are harmful to the environment and human life.

5|$|The γ ring is narrow, {{optically}} {{dense and}} slightly eccentric. Its orbital inclination is almost zero. The {{width of the}} ring varies in the range 3.6–4.7km, although equivalent optical depth is constant at 3.3km. The normal optical depth of the γ ring is 0.7–0.9. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the γ ring disappeared, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. The width and normal optical depth of the γ ring show significant azimuthal variations. The mechanism of confinement of such a narrow ring is not known, {{but it has been}} noticed that the sharp inner edge of the γ ring is in a 6:5 resonance with Ophelia.|$|E
5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E
5|$|It {{is listed}} in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is not {{considered}} threatened with extinction, but hunting and trading must be closely monitored. The animal is regulated in all three of its range countries, and is found {{in a number of}} protected areas of the United States, its principal territory. Estimates from the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the US in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II. Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy. The IUCN lists it as a species of least concern, noting it is relatively widespread and abundant, but information from southern Mexico is poor.|$|E

5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, the candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is not possible for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, {{the legitimacy of the}} Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E

50|$|Plotinus {{speaks about}} the {{generation}} of Intellect from the One, and Intellect's attempt {{to return to the}} One in a thinking which is also a desiring. Proclus systematises this production through a threefold movement of remaining, procession, and return (mone, proodos, epistrophe). Intellect remains in the One, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> that <b>it</b> has the One as its origin. It proceeds from the One, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> that <b>it</b> comes to be as a separate entity. But it returns to the One, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> that <b>it</b> doesn't cut itself off from its source, but receives the good which is its identity from the One. This threefold motion is used by Proclus to structure all levels of his system below the One and above material reality, so that all things except those mentioned remain, proceed, and return.|$|R
