5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>mean,</b> or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E

25|$|George Lakoff, a {{professor}} of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use logic programming to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained biological neural network. Post modern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those who feel they know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>mean</b> and feel that their interlocutors know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>mean.</b> Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as {{to the meaning of}} one’s life should be straightforward.|$|E

25|$|Inspired by her {{assistant}} 's compassion, Twilight realizes {{that if she}} shows her friends their true destinies and reminds them of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>mean</b> to each other, she {{may be able to}} reverse the spell. One by one, she shows each of her friends what their true calling is, encouraging them to help each other fix things. Each friend becomes aware of her original life and regains her original cutie mark with help of her respective Element, and Ponyville is quickly restored to normal. Twilight realizes that her friendship with the other ponies is a factor that Star Swirl had not accounted for, and is able to complete the spell. Upon doing so, the Elements worn by her friends activate on their own, engulfing Twilight in a bright light and causing her to disappear.|$|E

25|$|As each {{character}} represents {{a single word}} (or, more precisely, a morpheme), many logograms are required to write all the words of language. The vast array of logograms and the memorization of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>mean</b> are major disadvantages of logographic systems over alphabetic systems. However, since the meaning is inherent to the symbol, the same logographic system can theoretically be used to represent different languages. In practice, {{the ability to communicate}} across languages only works for the closely related varieties of Chinese, as differences in syntax reduce the crosslinguistic portability of a given logographic system. Japanese uses Chinese logograms extensively in its writing systems, with most of the symbols carrying the same or similar meanings. However, the grammatical differences between Japanese and Chinese are significant enough that a long Chinese text is not readily understandable to a Japanese reader without any knowledge of basic Chinese grammar, though short and concise phrases such as those on signs and newspaper headlines are much easier to comprehend.|$|E

According to Lark, the characters in Lazarus rarely say <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>mean,</b> and some vital story beats are depicted by wordless art. Lark's ability to convey Rucka's story without supporting text led Henry Chamberlain, a reviewer for Comics Grinder, to say [...] "you can feel the chemistry" [...] between them. Arcas received notice for adding texture and depth to Lark's art and using pallette changes to help tell the story.|$|E

The pair acknowledged the particular complexity of the plot, with Pemberton saying [...] "If you missed two sentences in a row, you'd be like 'what?' Even I was thinking how are people following this? It's insane." [...] Pemberton also noted that not everyone enjoys crosswords, hence [...] "I always hated cryptic crosswords.

[...] Christian John Wikane from PopMatters commented that the album [...] "proved that Madonna, {{approaching}} 50 years-old, is a vital force in the ever-expansive landscape of popular music." [...] Joan Morgan from The Village Voice noted that [...] "ith Confessions on a Dance Floor, Madonna at long last finds her musical footing. Easily dance record of the year, Confessions is an almost seamless tribute to the strobe-lit sensuality of the '80s New York club scene that gave Madge her roots, which she explores with compelling aplomb." [...] Josh Tyrangiel from Time magazine commented that [...] "In dance music, words exist to be repeated, twisted, obscured and resurrected. How they sound in the moment {{is far more important}} than <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>mean,</b> and Madonna knows that better than anyone. Confessions on a Dance Floor is 56 minutes of energetic moments. It will leave you feeling silly for all the right reasons." ...|$|E
