5|$|Henry's son, George Herbert, {{maintained}} the lease and his wife, Henrietta, constructed gravel-laid public <b>walks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> castle, {{dug into the}} surrounding cliffs, and planted trees around the grounds to improve the castle's appearance. The castle walls and towers were given superficial repairs and tidied up, usually when parts threatened to collapse, and {{the interior of the}} inner bailey levelled, costing considerable sums of money. The landscape also required expensive maintenance and repairs.|$|E
5|$|Battles are turn-based, with random {{encounters}} {{taking place}} while exploring dungeons. At {{the end of}} a successful battle, experience points, money, and items are obtained. Experience points are shared by Nakajima and Yumiko; by gaining enough experience points, their levels raise, and they are given one ability point each, which can be given to one of five character attributes: strength, intelligence, attack, dexterity, and luck. During battles, the player can try to persuade enemy demons to join them, in exchange for magnetite, money, or items. The player can keep seven demons at a time, of which up to four can be summoned at the same time; summoned demons aid the player in battles with physical and magic attacks, but cost money to summon, and consume magnetite as the player <b>walks</b> <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> demons' attitude towards the player is governed by the moon phase, which cycles through eight phases from new to full. Demons do not level up; instead, the player can create stronger demons by visiting a special location and fusing two of their allied demons together into a new one.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} floor is the hall, with a kitchen occupying the jamb, and later {{passages}} connecting {{to the east and}} west ranges. The hall has a large carved stone fireplace of around 1500, and once had a timber ceiling, probably painted. The kitchen was replaced by a larger one in the 16th-century east range, and converted into a bedroom. A smaller fireplace was inserted into the large kitchen hearth, and larger windows added. The next storey, accessed via a spiral stair, contained a windowless room in the vault above the hall ceiling. Above the kitchen is the lord's bedroom, the only original private chamber in the building. The stairs continue to give access to parapet <b>walks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> stone-flagged roof. A further storey was added to the jamb in the sixteenth century, containing a single chamber. The exterior of the castle formerly had two timber balconies, or viewing platforms, one overlooking the gardens to the south, and one looking east across the Lothian countryside.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} chronicles two {{alternative}} time frames, {{with the first}} of Carey in the present, tearful and remorseful their separation, while the other of several different past memories in which she shared with her lover. The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, she stands up and <b>walks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> living room, while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears trickle down her cheek. As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field, they are seen together, caressing each other and holding {{each other in a}} tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her way into a heated pool, where she lays her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe's unreleased film, Something's Got to Give (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times. During the song's bridge, the scenes alternate from Carey at her home in the present, to the duo holding each other intimately in a car. The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.|$|E

25|$|While in {{residence}} the Queen often visited the Villa San Michele to join Munthe for morning <b>walks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> island.

Perhaps inevitably, given the small local population and their close friendship, it was rumoured that Munthe and the Queen were lovers, but this has never been substantiated.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, the National Park Service {{began using}} the Munson Valley complex year-around. This had a {{tremendous}} impact on the historic landscape. Many landscape features including curbing, planting beds, and walkways had to be removed in order to widen narrow road to accommodate snow plows. Some porches had to be removed and snow tunnels were added to buildings for winter access. In 1954, all of the planters, lawns, and <b>walks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> employee cottages were removed to facilitate snow removal. The traffic island near the upper group of cottages was also removed along with several utility buildings in the maintenance area to allow space for snow plows to turn around.|$|E

25|$|The {{video is}} {{shot in a}} grey room, where Yonezu wearing a flower wreath and long hair {{covering}} his face sits down to read a picture book. The picture book illustrates the song, showing pictures of two hands {{on top of each}} other, and a couple separated in every moment of their lives by a glass pane. Yonezu <b>walks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> room, and finds holes in the room, with light shining through them. Further along there is a barren tree, with the lyrics of the song hanging on it. Yonezu sits under the tree with the book. The girl in the picture book leaves the drawings, leaving the male character alone. Yonezu starts to frantically claw at the holes of light, and falls down. On {{the other side of the}} holes of light, Yonezu performs the song with a band and an orchestra.|$|E
25|$|Chimega, {{possessed of}} a warm and patient personality, soon became the university's beloved mascot. She resided in a large cage just {{to the south of}} the University Center that was topped with a {{geodesic}} dome designed by visiting professor R. Buckminster Fuller. She was cared for by a student organization aptly named the Cougar Guard, who accompanied her on her twice-daily <b>walks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> core campus and to a myriad of university activities, especially including athletic events. (In keeping with the times, the Cougar Guard was originally all-male, but eventually became co-ed.) Chimega mated in 1974 and bore two cubs, one stillborn, the second dying within hours. In the summer of 1982, having become less patient with people than she had always been, Chimega was retired from active mascot service. She died in March 1985 and was buried near the pond located east of the classroom building now known as Founder's Hall.|$|E
500|$|Despite its name, the Longfellow House {{was never}} {{home to the}} American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow; it was instead the home of Robert F. Jones, a Minneapolis philanthropist and entrepreneur. [...] Built in 1907, the house's facade was {{designed}} to resemble Longfellow's home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. [...] Originally the home was part of Jones' private 4.6-acre botanical garden and zoological park near Minnehaha Falls. [...] After Jones died, the home fell into disrepair. His will gave the property to the city which used the house {{as part of the}} Minneapolis public library from 1936 to 1967. The house was moved in 1994 and renovated. It opened as an information center in 2001. [...] Today the home serves as the home of a botanical art school and provides Park Board offices. [...] The Longfellow House and John H.

500|$|LaFace Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{to be directed}} by Bille Woodruff. The concept evolves around the ending of Braxton's relationship with her lover, played by model Tyson Beckford. As the video begins, Beckford is seen leaving their home, with Braxton giving him a goodbye kiss, then going to check the mailbox. After he leaves the garage, a fast car suddenly appears and causes an accident, leaving him lying on the street while Braxton cries over his body. She then <b>walks</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> house, remembering the good moments she had with him, such as swimming in the pool and playing Twister. During the bridge and final chorus, Braxton is seen singing the song during a live concert, an allusion to the film [...] "A Star is Born". As applause rises, the video fades to black. The music video premiered on September 10, 1996 on MTV.|$|E
500|$|The man who {{suggested}} that the underground facility have a public exhibition was a local personality, Billy Guldy. Guldy was born around 1940 in Kingston, and, by the 1970s, had become a leading figure in Rosendale Village's hippie movement. He declared himself a king, and frequently dressed as one. He owned a bar called [...] "The Well", and a hotel in the village, and his portrait was painted {{on the door of}} a local bar. He declared Halloween a national holiday, ran for president, and led 200 people in a parade down Main Street.
