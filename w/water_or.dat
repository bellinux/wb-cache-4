5|$|According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, sound biofuel {{production}} practices would not hamper food and fibre production, nor cause <b>water</b> <b>or</b> environmental problems, and would enhance soil fertility. The selection of {{land on which}} to grow the feedstocks is {{a critical component of}} the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions.

5|$|Although some guides {{indicate}} {{the species is}} edible with suitable preparation (such as boiling), it is generally not recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other toxic Gyromitra species that contain the compound gyromitrin. When boiled in <b>water,</b> <b>or</b> digested in the body, this compound is readily hydrolyzed to the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine—used as a propellant in some rocket fuels.|$|E
5|$|Defence from thermal {{weapons and}} fire attacks was usually <b>water</b> <b>or</b> other liquids such as urine; hides were soaked and draped over {{vulnerable}} wooden hoardings and siege engines, and vats and barrels of liquid were collected and stored by defenders and attackers.

5|$|Emulsions are {{a type of}} colloid {{in which}} surface tension plays a role. Tiny {{fragments}} of oil suspended in pure water will spontaneously assemble themselves into much larger masses. But {{the presence of a}} surfactant provides a decrease in surface tension, which permits stability of minute droplets of oil in the bulk of <b>water</b> (<b>or</b> vice versa).|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The {{most common}} cause is viruses.

5|$|Historically, {{especially}} aggressive rams {{were sometimes}} blindfolded or hobbled.

5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} stream {{that is totally}} condensed into a liquid product using <b>water</b> <b>or</b> air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the reflux drum must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some <b>water</b> <b>or</b> some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E
