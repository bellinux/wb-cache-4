25|$|Cultural {{differences}} between Muslim majority Turkey and predominantly Christian majority Europe {{play an important}} part in the entire debate on Turkish accession to the European Union. In an analysis, based on the World Values Survey, the social scientists Arno Tausch and Almas Heshmati {{came to the conclusion that}} a robust measurement scale of global economic, political and social values and Turkey's place on them wields only a very qualified picture of Turkey's place on the maps of global values. The study, which is based on 92,289 representative individuals with complete data in 68 countries, representing 56.89% of the global population, looks at hard-core economic values in the countries concerned. From nine dimensions for the determination of the geography of human values, based on a promax factor analysis of the available data, six factor analytical scores to calculate a new Global Value Development Index were used, which combines: avoiding economic permissiveness; avoiding racism; avoiding distrust of the army and the press; avoiding the authoritarian character; tolerance and respect; and avoiding the rejection of the market economy and democracy. Turkey is ranked 25, ahead of several EU member countries. But there are still considerable deficits concerning the liberal values components, which are very important for an effective democracy. The deficits, the study argues, suggest that the Turkish state, Turkish civil society and European decision makers would be <b>well</b> <b>advised</b> <b>to</b> continue to support civil society and secular democracy in Turkey.|$|E

500|$|There is some {{diversity}} of opinion {{as to the}} origin of the names Pleione and Pleiades. There are three possible derivations of note. Foremost is that both names come from the Greek word πλεῖν, (pr. ple'-ō), meaning [...] "to sail". This is particularly plausible given that ancient Greece was a seafaring culture and because of Pleione's mythical status as an Oceanid nymph. Pleione, as a result, is sometimes referred to as the [...] "sailing queen" [...] while her daughters the [...] "sailing ones". Also, the appearance of these stars coincided with the sailing season in antiquity; sailors were <b>well</b> <b>advised</b> <b>to</b> set sail only when the Pleiades were visible at night, lest they meet with misfortune.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis is the {{determination}} of syllable boundaries in English with respect to its perceptual relevance. The hypothesis is based on two different theoretical conceptions. The Maximum Onset Principle (MOP), a traditional approach widespread among linguists, assigns intervocalic consonants to neighbouring syllables {{in such a way}} that the longest possible onsets are created in the syllables that follow. An alternative view, advocated by John <b>Wells,</b> <b>advises</b> <b>to</b> utilize more complex parameters, such as morphological structure, prosodic structure or, most importantly, the allophonic realization of phonemes as determined by position within the syllable. A word monitoring experiment measuring reaction times, in which listeners pressed a key if they heard a given word in the auditory stimulus, yielded data about listeners' performance in two conditions: in one the items were divided into syllables according to the MOP, in the other according to Wells. The latter was associated with faster reactions, which might be interpreted as cognitively less strenuous. However, the difference between the two conditions was not robust, mainly because of the limited number of listeners...|$|R

2500|$|In 1991 the South West Water Authority {{was fined}} £10,000 {{and ordered to}} pay £25,000 costs at Exeter Crown Court for {{supplying}} water likely to endanger public health. The authority paid at least £123,000 to settle almost 500 initial compensation claims and in 1997 a further 148 victims accepted out-of-court damages totalling almost £400,000, approved by a High Court judge sitting in Truro. The settlements ranged from £680 to £10,000. Some later claimed they were [...] "railroaded" [...] into accepting the out-of-court settlements after being told that their legal aid funding would be withdrawn if they continued with the lawsuit.
