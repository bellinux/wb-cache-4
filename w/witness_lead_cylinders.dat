50|$|Estimation of {{pressure}} using CUP and LUP units is {{performed by a}} special crusher gun, which uses pressure applied to a piston to crush a carefully manufactured and calibrated copper or <b>lead</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The amount of deformation is compared {{to the amount of}} crushing produced by different pressures in pounds per square inch. Copper cylinders are used at high pressures, such as are generated by most handgun and rifle cartridges, and <b>lead</b> <b>cylinders</b> are used for low pressures such as are generated by shotgun shells. The crusher gun has a hole in the chamber that is linked to a piston, and upon firing, this piston is subjected to the pressure of firing. The piston then acts on the calibrated cylinder, crushing it slightly. The length of the crushed cylinder is measured and compared to a chart of lengths resulting from crushing cylinders with given amounts {{of pressure}}, and the corresponding force is the CUP or LUP pressure value.|$|R

5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre <b>lead</b> <b>cylinder</b> held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The <b>lead</b> <b>cylinder</b> was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|R
50|$|The test is {{performed}} by loading a 10-gram foil-wrapped {{sample of the}} explosive into a hole drilled into a lead block with specific dimensions and properties (a soft <b>lead</b> <b>cylinder,</b> 200 mm diameter and 200 mm high, with the hole 125 mm deep and 25 mm diameter). The hole is then topped up with sand, and the sample is detonated electrically. After detonation, the volume increase of the cavity is measured. The result, given in cm3, is called the Trauzl number of the explosive.|$|R

50|$|Although {{they would}} not be {{considered}} to be speaking, clocks have incorporated noisemakers such as clangs, chimes, gongs, melodies, and the sounds of cuckoos or roosters from almost the beginning of the mechanical clock. Soon after Thomas Edison's invention of the phonograph, the earliest attempts to make a clock that incorporated a voice were made. Around 1878, Frank Lambert invented a machine that used a voice recorded on a <b>lead</b> <b>cylinder</b> to call out the hours. Lambert used lead in place of Edison's soft tinfoil. In 1992, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized this as the oldest known sound recording that was playable (though that status now rests with a phonautogram of Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, recorded in 1857). It is on display at the National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, Pennsylvania.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPhononic {{crystals}} {{have received}} some {{attention in the}} last decade due to their intrinsic property of band gaps. A band gap is a frequency range that acoustic waves cannot propagate within the periodic structure. In this paper, we propose a two-dimensional hexagonal phononic crystal that is composed of <b>lead</b> <b>cylinders</b> embedded in a polyethylene matrix. Using the finite element method, the dispersion diagram is calculated to identify the existence of band gaps. In addition, when a coating layer is introduced between the inclusion and the matrix, we find that the bandwidth and values of the gaps can be adjusted. In our demonstration, the band gap appear to be within the audible range with frequency 15400 ∼ 18000 Hz. Thus, the present proposition may have potential applications in blocking high-frequency noise...|$|R

Hysteretic dampers made of steel and lead have been developed at our laboratory and tested over a wide range of conditions. In particular the lead extrusion damper and the lead-rubber bearing have been tested with satisfactory results at frequency of ~ 10 - 6 to ~ 50 Hz and at engineering strains as high as 200 %. The force-displacement hysteresis loop due to the lead is found to be rectangular and at ambient temperatures the lead is able to be "hot worked" over many cycles. At high cyclic strains, unrestrained <b>lead</b> <b>cylinders</b> are found to be unstable due to the application of "simple" shear rather than "pure" shear...|$|R
50|$|Until the {{invention}} of measurement transducers in the 1960s, crusher guns were the only reliable method for estimating chamber pressures. With the availability of inexpensive, reliable transducers since the 1960s for actually making chamber pressure measurements, the industry almost universally has begun {{to move away from}} crusher guns for estimating chamber pressures, towards favoring making actual measurements. Transducers are also faster to use in practice, as they do not require the careful measuring of the copper or <b>lead</b> <b>cylinders</b> after firing. Additionally, transducers are capable of recording instant-by-instant pressures through the entire firing cycle. Hence, in the long run, using a transducer is less expensive, as it does not require using expendable metal cylinders in a crusher gun, and also reduces the labor required to analyze test results.|$|R

50|$|Frank Lambert's <b>lead</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{recording}} for {{an experimental}} talking clock is often {{identified as the}} oldest surviving playable sound recording, although the evidence advanced for its early date is controversial.

The 1860 phonautogram had not until then been played, as it was only a transcription of sound waves into graphic form on paper for visual study.

His comments on proof powder in The Field, where he stated that the powder used in testing gun-barrels was fifty per cent below the proof required, led to an action, the Birmingham Proof-house Guardians v. Walsh On technical grounds, a verdict was decided against Walsh with damages of forty shillings (The Times, 3 July - 10 August 1885). As soon as the trial was over, he approached the Guardians with proposals for providing security for sportsmen, and ultimately succeeded in obtaining some useful changes.|$|R
40|$|Electric contacts, both {{stationary}} and moving, {{with lead}} contact members separated by an oxide layer are examined. The stationary contact {{results are consistent}} with earlier work and are used as preliminary data for the moving contact case. All stationary contacts were superconducting at low currents when the members themselves were superconducting. Two types of contacts were found; one whose abrupt resistance transition is accompanied by hysteresis, and the other whose transition is gradual. The difference may be connected with the properties of the contact surface. Moving contacts between superconducting lead brushes and a rotating <b>lead</b> <b>cylinder</b> exhibited resistance whose magnitude was 10 ^- 3 of the normal conduction resistance. The speed of rotation, current and temperature were varied.

In studying {{the properties of}} sliding superconducting contact resistance, contacts with their supérconducting members separated by {{a thin layer of}} copper, nickel or lead oxide were used. The contact resistance as a function of applied contact current, of contact sliding speed and of contact pressure has been measured in order to arrive at some definite conclusions in regard to obtaining a reproducible low loss contact with a long operating life. The sliding contact resistance was periodic in nature, the comparison of contact resistance was by their average values rather than their peak values; an integrator was employed to facilitate the averaging operation. The magnitude of sliding contact resistance was found to be approximately one-thousandth of the normal resistance at liquid air temperature. The main cause of sliding resistance was considered to be an effect of surface eddy current which quenched each microscopic contact. At very low applied contact current and slow sliding speed, no sliding contact resistance was detected. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxidation of a synthetic wastewater containing indigo carmine dye was investigated {{using a new}} cell with horizontally oriented electrodes. The study dealt with colour removal and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction using an array of Pb/PbO 2 cylinders as anode and stainless steel screen as cathode in a batch recycle electrochemical unit. Operating variables such as current density, initial dye concentration, NaCl concentration, pH, and solution flow rate were investigated. The results indicate that complete decolourization and 88. 2 % COD reduction can be achieved under the optimum operating conditions. Kinetic study at different flow rates has shown that decolourization takes place through a first order diffusion controlled reaction. Energy consumption was calculated at different operating parameters.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a pinhole collimator for small animal imaging using dual-isotopes, such as gamma and positron emitters. A <b>lead</b> <b>cylinder</b> containing a pinhole was placed around the subject (a small animal). The cylinder was equipped with a non-collimator gamma camera, and dual-isotope (99 mTc-MIBI and 18 F-FDG) SPECT was performed on a Wistar King Aptekman/hok (WKAH) rat. System planar sensitivity and Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM) were measured for each radionuclide. System planar sensitivities for 99 mTc and 18 F SPECT were 2 and 7 cps/MBq, respectively. FWHMs for 99 mTc and 18 F SPECT were 2. 0 ± 0. 5 and 2. 7 ± 0. 5 mm, respectively. The collimator is relatively light (23 kg), and thus SPECT projection data could be acquired by rotating the gamma camera while the object remained stationary. The pinhole collimator {{can be used with}} a conventional rotating gamma camera.

40|$|Richtmyer-Meskov (RM) {{instability}} is a {{well known}} phenomenon in hydrodynamics that occurs whenever a shock wave traverse the interface between two fluids. The LAPLAS (Laboratory of Planetary Sciences) experiment planned at GSI to be performed on the future FAIR facility {{for the study of}} high energy density states of matter, requires the low entropy implosion of a gold or <b>lead</b> <b>cylinder</b> driven by an intense ion beam in order to compress a material sample placed in the axial region. RM instability may occur during the implosion spoiling the experiment. Besides, RM determines the initial conditions for the later development of Rayleigh-Taylor instability. However, in the LAPLAS experiment the RM instability analysis must take into account that the media the process involve materials that remain in solid state during the implosion thus retaining its elastic and plastic properties. Here we have studied the RM dynamics of the interface between two perfectly elastic solids by means a simple analytical model and by two-dimensional simulation with the code ABAQUS and we find that because of the elastic properties of the material, the interface oscillates stably a characteristic period T and amplitude determined by the material properties and shock intensity...|$|R
