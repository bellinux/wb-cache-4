5|$|In the 1890s {{some people}} – {{including}} the young Calogero Vizzini – {{decided to do}} something about the absence of peace and security in the countryside. The state police at the time <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable social capital. It later transformed into a protection racket, victimizing villagers and landowners alike through violence, intimidation and omertà.|$|E
5|$|In England cannon {{were being}} used to besiege various {{fortified}} buildings during the English Civil War. Nathaniel Nye is recorded as testing a Birmingham cannon in 1643 and experimenting with a saker in 1645. From 1645 he was the master gunner to the Parliamentarian garrison at Evesham and in 1646 he successfully directed the artillery at the Siege of Worcester, detailing his experiences and in his 1647 book The Art of Gunnery. Believing that war <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> science as an art, his explanations focused on triangulation, arithmetic, theoretical mathematics, and cartography as well as practical considerations such as the ideal specification for gunpowder or slow matches. His book acknowledged mathematicians such as Robert Recorde and Marcus Jordanus as well as earlier military writers on artillery such as Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia and Thomas (or Francis) Malthus (author of A Treatise on Artificial Fire-Works).|$|E
5|$|The vitriolic {{campaign}} of Richard Wagner against Meyerbeer {{was to a}} great extent responsible for the decline of Meyerbeer's popularity after his death in 1864. This campaign <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> matter of personal spite as of racism – Wagner had learnt a great deal from Meyerbeer and indeed Wagner's early opera Rienzi (1842) was facetiously called by Hans von Bülow 'Meyerbeer's best opera'. Meyerbeer supported the young Wagner, both financially and in helping to obtain the premiere productions of both Rienzi and The Flying Dutchman at Dresden.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the design}} reformers {{of the mid}} 19th century did not {{go as far as}} the {{designers}} of the Arts and Crafts Movement: they were more concerned with ornamentation than construction, they had an incomplete understanding of methods of manufacture, and they did not criticise industrial methods as such. By contrast, the Arts and Crafts movement <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> movement of social reform as design reform and its leading practitioners did not separate the two.|$|E

After being on and off the team for three seasons, he played his first major innings against Delhi in the 1979 semifinal. Going in at No.6 after Bombay lost the first four wickets for 72, Patil hit 145 in 276 minutes with 18 fours and a six, none of his partners made more than 25. Patil played for Edmonton in the Middlesex league in 1979 and 1980, and for Somerset 'B' in the latter year.|$|E
25|$|Ribbentrop did not {{understand}} the limited role in government exercised by 20th-century British monarchs; he thought that King Edward VIII could dictate British foreign policy if he wished to. He convinced Hitler that he had Edward's support, but this <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> delusion as his belief that he had impressed British society. In fact, Ribbentrop often displayed a fundamental misunderstanding of British politics and society. During the abdication crisis of December 1936, Ribbentrop reported to Berlin that it had been precipitated by an anti-German Jewish-Masonic-reactionary conspiracy to depose Edward (whom Ribbentrop represented as a staunch friend of Germany), and that civil war would soon break out in Britain between the supporters of the king and those of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Ribbentrop's civil-war statements were greeted with incredulity by those British people who heard them.|$|E
25|$|In the 1840s, the Harlem Railroad {{made the}} first rail {{connection}} between Manhattan and what became the Woodlawn neighborhood, a connection that still exists via the Woodlawn station on what is now Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line. At that time, like much of the western Bronx, it was still rural and heavily farmed. Residential development did not start until after {{the opening of the}} cemetery in 1865. As a rural cemetery, {{at the time of its}} opening, it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> park as a burial ground, a popular place to visit for strolls and picnics. By the 1890s the surrounding neighborhood was well-populated with working-class Irish and Italian immigrants. Those residents had regularly been lobbying for a subway connection, which was constructed the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) was expanded via the Dual Contracts. The IRT created the Jerome Avenue, Pelham, and White Plains Road lines, opening many areas of the Bronx to residential development and making them desirable places for commuters to live.|$|E

25|$|Initially the tourism, {{service and}} {{hospitality}} sector in Dutch East Indies {{were developed to}} cater the lodging, entertainment and leisure needs of domestic visitors, especially the wealthy Dutch plantation owners and merchants during their stay in the city. In the 19th century, colonial heritage hotels equipped with dance halls, live music and fine dining restaurants were established in Dutch East Indies urban areas, such as Hotel des Indes (est. 1829) in Batavia (now Jakarta), Savoy Homann Hotel (est. 1871) in Bandung, Hotel Oranje (est. 1910) in Surabaya, and Hotel De Boer in Medan. Since the 19th century Dutch East Indies has attracted visitors from The Netherlands. The first national tourism bureau was the Vereeeging Toeristen Verkeer, established by Governor General of Dutch East Indies in early 20th century, and shared their head office in Batavia with Koninklijke Nederlansch Indische Luchtfahrt Maatschapijj (part of KLM) that began to fly from Amsterdam to Batavia in 1929. In 1913, Vereeneging Touristen Verkeer wrote a guide book about tourism places in the Indies. Since then Bali become known to international tourist with foreign tourist arrivals rose for more than 100% in 1927. Much of the international tourism of the 1920s and 1930s was by international visitors on oceanic cruises. The 1930s did see a modest but significant influx of mainly European tourists and longer term stayers to Bali. Many came for the blossoming arts scene in the Ubud area, which <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> two-way exchange between the Balinese and outsiders as it was an internal phenomenon.|$|E

[...] Ashbaugh was gleeful at the dilemma this would pose to librarians: in order to register the copyright of the book, he had to send two copies to the United States Library of Congress, who, in order to classify it had to read it, and in the process, necessarily had to destroy it. The creators had initially intended to infect the disks with a computer virus, but declined to after considering the potential damage to the computer systems of innocents.|$|E
500|$|Beaumaris Castle {{was never}} fully built, but {{had it been}} {{completed}} it would probably have closely resembled Harlech Castle. Both castles are concentric in plan, with walls within walls, although Beaumaris is the more regular in design. Historian Arnold Taylor described Beaumaris as Britain's [...] "most perfect example of symmetrical concentric planning" [...] and for many years the castle was regarded as the pinnacle of military engineering during Edward I's reign. This evolutionary interpretation is now disputed by historians: Beaumaris <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> royal palace and symbol of English power {{as it was a}} straightforward defensive fortification. Nonetheless, the castle is praised by UNESCO as a [...] "unique artistic achievement" [...] for the way in which is combines [...] "characteristic 13th century double-wall structures with a central plan" [...] and for the beauty of its [...] "proportions and masonry".|$|E

500|$|Kenilworth Castle was {{the centre}} of Leicester's ambitions to [...] "plant" [...] himself in the region, and he {{substantially}} transformed the site's appearance through comprehensive alterations. He added a 15th-century style gatehouse to the castle's medieval structures, {{as well as a}} formal garden and a residential wing which featured the [...] "brittle, thin walls and grids of windows" [...] that were to become the hallmark of Elizabethan architecture in later decades. His works completed, the Earl staged a spectacular 19-day-festival in July 1575 as a final, allegorical bid for the Queen's hand; it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> request to give him leave to marry someone else. There were a Lady of the Lake, a swimming papier-mâché dolphin with a little orchestra in its belly, fireworks, masques, hunts, and popular entertainments like bear baiting.

500|$|From infancy Robert Dudley {{grew up as}} a Protestant. Presumably {{conforming}} {{in public}} under Mary Tudor, he was counted among the [...] "heretics" [...] by Philip II's agent before Elizabeth's accession. He immediately became a major patron to former Edwardian clerics and returning exiles. Meanwhile, he also helped some of Mary's former servants and maintained Catholic contacts. From 1561 he advocated and supported the Huguenot cause, and the French ambassador described him as [...] "totally of the Calvinist religion" [...] in 1568. After the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572 this trait in him became more pronounced, and he continued as the chief patron of English Puritans and a champion of international Calvinism. On the other hand, in his household, Leicester employed Catholics like Sir Christopher Blount, who held a position of trust and of whom he was personally fond.

500|$|Neither Greek nor Latin had a word {{corresponding}} to modern-day [...] "family". The Latin familia must be translated to [...] "household" [...] rather than [...] "family".

Where it differed from its medieval equivalent was in the use of slaves rather than paid servants for the performance of menial tasks. Another difference was that, due to the relative security and peacefulness within the borders of the Roman Empire, there was little need for fortification.
