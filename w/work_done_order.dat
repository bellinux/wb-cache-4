In an ideal thermodynamically reversible process, the energy from work performed by or on the system would be maximized, and that from heat would be minimized; heat cannot fully be converted to work and will always be lost to some degree (to the surroundings). The phenomenon of maximized work and minimized heat can be visualized on a pressure-volume curve, as the area beneath the equilibrium curve, representing <b>work</b> <b>done.</b> In <b>order</b> to maximize work, one must follow the equilibrium curve closely.|$|R

By then, shop tailors had begun to build more sophisticated organizations, which were then joined by custom tailors, a move which was vocally supported by John Brown Lennon, the future general secretary of the Journeymen Tailors' Union. A critical concern was the scabbing of custom tailors on shop tailors and vice versa during strikes, which could only be prevented by a more unified form of organization.|$|R

40|$|Anytime {{inference}} is inference performed incrementally, {{with the}} accuracy of the inference being controlled by a tunable parameter, usually time. Such anytime inference algorithms are also usually interruptible, gradually converging to the exact inference value until terminated. While anytime inference algorithms for specific domains like probability potentials exist in the literature, our objective in this article is to obtain an anytime inference algorithm which is sufficiently generic to cover a wide range of domains. For this we utilise the theory of generic inference as a basis for constructing an anytime inference algorithm, and in particular, extending <b>work</b> <b>done</b> on <b>ordered</b> valuation algebras. The novel contribution of this work is the construction of anytime algorithms in a generic framework, which automatically gives us instantiations in various useful domains.
