60|$|The others stood bewildered. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> to do? He {{turned to}} Hans and {{his blue eyes}} shone like steel.|$|E
6000|$|It needed all Cecilia's subtlety to {{hide her}} consternation. End to <b>what?</b> <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> that he and B. were going to separate? ...|$|E
60|$|Joan flushed. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by cross-examining {{her in this}} way? She was not at {{all used}} to {{impertinence}} from the opposite sex.|$|E
60|$|Warn. Heaven! <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> to <b>do?</b> It is {{not fair}} writ out, sir.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will {{you remain}} there, Sir!' {{repeated}} Mr Dombey, turning {{a little more}} round towards him. 'What <b>do</b> you <b>mean?</b> <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean,</b> Carker?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother speaks strangely to-day," [...] {{replied the}} chief. [...] "His words are hidden from his Indian friend. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by `her'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{watched him}} as he moved away into the crowd, with {{powerful}} erect body--the deskman's droop almost gone out of his shoulders. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|She was {{a little}} piqued at his {{unexpected}} attitude of aloofness. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by a [...] "noble marriage"--to a Duke, or something of that sort? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was silent}} again. She brooded. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> He was so wearying. There was {{something}} he would not yield. Yet she must be patient with him.|$|E
6000|$|VERA (aside). One more blow! <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> Oh, impossible! {{but why is}} he {{not with}} us? Alexis! Alexis! why are you not here? ...|$|R
60|$|DUCHESS OF BERWICK. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>Do,</b> as a {{concession}} to my poor wits, Lord Darlington, just explain to me what you really mean.|$|R
6000|$|... "Man, {{it would}} be {{absolute}} nonsense if it wasn't that anything else is even worse!" [...] cried MacDonald. [...] "Somebody killed the man, and whoever it was I could clearly prove to you that <b>he</b> should have <b>done</b> it some other way. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by allowing his retreat to be cut off like that? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape? Come, Mr. Holmes, it's {{up to you to}} give us a lead, since you say Mr. White Mason's theory is unconvincing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by that?" [...] thought I to myself, as I {{departed}} to make {{my report}} to Seti. But no {{answer to the question}} rose in my mind.|$|E
6000|$|She did {{not quite}} understand. His {{protective}} manner, and his sureness, and his intimacy, puzzled her. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> If he was her equal, why did he behave so without formality? ...|$|E
6000|$|TENCH. It's {{all been}} so violent! <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by: [...] "Done us both down?" [...] If {{he has lost}} his wife, poor fellow, he oughtn't to have spoken to the Chairman like that! ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Note 19: Association {{is turned}} against itself. It is seldom that Stevenson uses an {{expression}} that is not instantly transparently clear. Exactly <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by this phrase?] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't let {{the matter}} drop. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> when <b>he</b> says that <b>he</b> isn't <b>doing</b> {{anything}} that <b>he</b> shouldn't? I've {{never said anything}} {{about what he was}} doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Treat him so? Why shouldn't I {{treat him}} so? Confound his impudence! <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by {{thrusting}} himself {{in here and}} taking possession of my library? Why didn't he wait in the hall?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "I {{remember}} hearing about him. The {{man who took}} off the schooner's skipper? But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by saying that there were excuses for his not seeing you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{one thing}} in Guy's telegram," [...] she said, [...] "I didn't quite understand. 'Coming home {{immediately}} to repay everything.' <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by that? What has {{that got to do}} with Mr. Nevitt's disappearance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those fellows are {{certainly}} up to something," [...] our hero told himself. [...] "Link said that I was not Dave Porter. Now, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by that? Those fellows must be hatching up some plot against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One sandal! One sandal!" [...] {{they kept}} saying. [...] "The man with one sandal! Here {{he is at}} last! Whence has <b>he</b> come? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> to <b>do?</b> <b>What</b> will the king say to the one-sandaled man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whose {{fault is}} that? Why {{do you not}} speak? Father Marty, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> when <b>he</b> tells my girl {{that there must be}} {{disappointment}} for her? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> dare to tell me that he hesitates to make her his wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by 'a modest price'? The Pelton {{place is}} expensive. The rent is sixty dollars a month, while a {{comfortable}} house {{like that of}} the Widow Harrington rents for fifteen dollars, with good, solid furniture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Where's--where's Dennis?' said Hugh, {{coming to}} a stop, and {{checking}} Barnaby with his strong arm. 'Where has he been all day? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by leaving me as he did, in the jail, last night? Tell me, you--d'ye hear!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed! I {{considered}} it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked of his future wife dying with him. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by such a pagan idea? I {{had no intention of}} dying with him--he might depend on that." ...|$|E
60|$|Mackintosh {{looked at}} him savagely. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by talking of him in that fashion? To a half-caste trader he was Mr Walker. It was on his tongue to utter a harsh rebuke for the impertinence. He {{did not know what}} held him back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "it {{seems to}} me that I have arrived opportunely. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> this mean? Who are these people? Miss Sinclair, is this man your companion? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by {{speaking}} in such a tone to a dying man?" ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{being able}} to ascertain, after a moment's self-examination, <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>he</b> relapsed into silence.|$|R
6000|$|One morning John {{received}} a letter from Constantinople, which he had scarcely opened before <b>he</b> exclaimed, 'Ha! <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> Given up his appointment! Coming home! It is just like him. I must read you what he says, it is, so characteristic.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> In {{spite of}} myself, an {{agreeable}} warmth spread over me. I {{am not a}} vain man where women are concerned, but I remembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time, perhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate---- ...|$|E
6000|$|Honora was silent. She was, indeed, not unmoved by his voice, {{into which}} there was {{creeping}} a vibrant note of passion. She was a little frightened, but likewise puzzled and interested. This was all so different from what she had expected of him. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean?</b> Was she indeed like that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I do. It's so hard {{to knock}} any fire out of you, that when one does find {{the place where the}} flint lies, one can't help {{hammering}} at it. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by saying that I shouldn't get up on Sunday? Of course I shall get up if I like it." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{why does}} Baxter every where assert the {{identity}} of the new light with the light of nature? Or <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> exclusively by the latter? The source must be the same in all lights as far as it is light.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{speech of}} Muxbee is {{still full of}} mystery. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by {{breaking}} news? When Big Otter has got news to tell, he tells it. When people have got something to hear, why should they not hear it at once?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Who is the speaker? What is the cause? Why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> {{not wish}} the [...] "lost leader" [...] to return? How <b>does</b> <b>he</b> judge him? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> expect for his cause? <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>mean</b> by lines 29-30? lines 31-32? Point out the climax {{in the second}} stanza.|$|R
