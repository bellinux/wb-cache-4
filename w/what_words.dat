25|$|Mezuzah: Deuteronomy 6:9 is {{sometimes}} interpreted {{to mean that}} a mezuzah needs {{to be placed on}} the doorposts of a house. However, there are no details regarding where on the doorpost, if it is all doorposts or just one, <b>what</b> <b>words</b> go in it, how the words should be written or how the mezuzah should be constructed. As with the passage from which the rabbis derive the tradition of teffilin Karaites state this passage is also intended to be understood metaphorically and not literally.|$|E
500|$|The {{traditions of}} Texas A University {{are a key}} aspect {{of the culture of}} Texas A University. Some of the school traditions date to the 1890s, shortly after the opening of the school, while others have been {{introduced}} more recently. These traditions encourage current students and alumni (Aggies) to cultivate the Aggie Spirit, a sense of loyalty and respect for the school, and dictate many aspects of student life, including how to greet others, how to act at an A sporting event, and <b>what</b> <b>words</b> a student may use in conversation. The most visible tradition among senior class students and alumni (more commonly referred to as [...] "former students") is the wearing of the Aggie Ring, whose design has been relatively unchanged since its introduction in 1894. Not all Aggie traditions are recognized by the university, and some, like Bonfire, have been discontinued for safety reasons. Texas Monthly states that the students' respect for school traditions and values is the university's greatest strength.|$|E

500|$|Johnson's {{thoughts}} on biography and on poetry coalesced in {{his understanding of}} what {{would make a good}} critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism. This was especially true of his Dictionary of which he wrote: [...] "I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France, for the use of such as aspire to exactness of criticism, or elegance of style". Although a smaller edition of his Dictionary became the standard household dictionary, Johnson's original Dictionary was an academic tool that examined how words were used, especially in literary works. To achieve this purpose, Johnson included quotations from Bacon, Hooker, Milton, Shakespeare, Spenser, and many others from what he considered {{to be the most important}} literary fields: natural science, philosophy, poetry, and theology. These quotations and usages were all compared and carefully studied in the Dictionary so that a reader could understand <b>what</b> <b>words</b> in literary works meant in context.|$|E

2500|$|Because, for Kennedy, {{the text}} of the statute was not clearly {{susceptible}} to two different interpretations, {{there was no need to}} invoke the principle of constitutional avoidance as the majority did. [...] In any event, the constitutional rule the Court articulated could too easily be circumvented, simply by rewriting the statute using slightly different words. [...] The requirements imposed by the Sixth Amendment should not depend on the vagaries of Congress's choice of words when it drafts a statute. [...] And if that should be so, the Court should more clearly spell out <b>what</b> <b>words</b> and phrases Congress should use in order to trigger certain constitutional protections. [...] Furthermore, Kennedy saw no difference of constitutional significance between recidivism, which the Court had already held was excluded from the set of facts to which the jury-trial requirement applies, and [...] "serious bodily injury"; the mere [...] "tradition" [...] of doing so might justify this difference, if it were more clear that the carjacking statute were consistent with that tradition.|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{writes in}} his article, {{through the use of}} Richard Lanham’s The Electronic World: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts, how “discursive text is in the center of {{everything}} we do," [...] going on to say how students coexist in a world that “includes blogs, podcasts, modular community web spaces, cell phone messaging…”, urging for students to be taught how to compose through rhetorical minds in these new, and not-so-new texts. “Cultural changes, and Lanham suggests, refocuses writing theory towards the image”, demonstrating how there is a change in alphabet-to-icon ratios in electronic writing. One of these prime examples can see through the Apple product, the iPhone, in which “emojis” are seen as icons in a separate keyboard to convey <b>what</b> <b>words</b> would have once delivered. Another example is Prezi. Often likened to Microsoft PowerPoint, Prezi is a cloud-based presentation application that allows users to create text, embed video, and make visually aesthetic projects. Prezi’s presentations zoom the eye in, out, up and down to create a multi-dimensional appeal. Users also utilize different media within this medium that is itself unique.|$|E
