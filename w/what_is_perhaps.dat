One suspects that the Royal Navy recaptured her in the West Indies, but so far evidence for the conjecture is lacking.|$|E
5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through the Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E

25|$|For {{ordinary}} Romans, {{religion was}} a part of daily life. Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported Vestals, who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under Christian domination. It is the best religion along with the cult of Sol Invictus.|$|E
25|$|After {{the conquest}} {{and during the}} colonial period, many other spices and {{ingredients}} were brought and have had a greater influence in the cooking here than {{in other parts of}} the country. From Europe, the Spanish brought saffron, parsley, thyme, marjoram, bay laurel, and cilantro as well Asian spices such as cloves, cinnamon, and black pepper. The Spaniards also brought wheat, rice, almonds, olives and olive oil, garlic, and capers. The latter three are essential ingredients in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> the most famous specialty of the region, huachinango a la veracruzana, red snapper in a spicy tomato sauce. Caribbean imports such as sugar cane and pineapple were adapted as well as the peanut, brought from Africa by the Portuguese via Brazil.|$|E
25|$|In 1565, the Spanish {{defeated}} an Ottoman {{landing on}} the strategic island of Malta, defended by the Knights of St. John. Suleiman the Magnificent's death the following year and his succession by his less capable son Selim the Sot emboldened Philip, and he resolved to carry the war to the sultan himself. In 1571, Spanish and Venetian warships, joined by volunteers across Europe, led by Charles's illegitimate son Don John of Austria annihilated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto, in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> the most decisive battle in modern naval history. The battle ended the threat of Ottoman naval hegemony in the Mediterranean. This mission marked {{the height of the}} respectability of Spain and its sovereign abroad as Philip bore the burden of leading the Counter-Reformation.|$|E

25|$|Archaeological {{research}} {{has determined that}} {{the site of the}} present ruin of the temple of Apollo was in continuous use since the archaic period, the existing temple is the last of four on the site and designated Apollo IV. Pausanias records that this last sanctuary was dedicated to Apollo Epikourios (helper or succourer) by the Phigalians in thanks for delivery from the plague of 429 BC. The architecture of the temple {{is one of the most}} strikingly unusual examples of the period, departing significantly from the norms of Doric and Ionic practice and including <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> the first use of the Corinthian order and the first temple to have a continuous frieze around the interior of the naos. From the style of the frieze it belongs to the High Classical period, probably carved around 400 BC. Nothing is known of its authorship: despite an ascription of the metopes to Paionios (since refuted), the frieze cannot be associated with any sculptor, workshop or school. Instead Cooper identifies the artists of the frieze on morellian evidence as a group of three anonymous masters.|$|E
25|$|Studies led by Holly Woodward, Jack Horner, Freedman Fowler et al. {{have given}} {{insight into the}} life history of Maiasaura, {{resulting}} in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> the most detailed life history of any dinosaur known, and to which all others can be compared. From a sample of fifty individual Maiasaura tibiae, {{it was found that}} Maiasaurs had a mortality rate of about 89.9% in their first year of life. If the animals survived their second year, their mortality rate would drop to 12.7%. The animals would spend their next six years maturing and growing. Sexual maturity was found to occur in their third year, while skeletal maturity was attained at eight years of age. In their eighth year and beyond, the mortality rate for Maiasaura would spike back to around 44.4%. The studies that followed also found that Maiasaurs were primarily bipedal as juveniles, and switched to a more quadrupedal stance as they aged. It was also found that Maiasaura also included rotting wood in its diet, as well that its environment had a long, dry season prone to drought. The results of the study were published in the journal Palaeobiology on September 3, 2015.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his release}} by Gloucestershire, Dawson {{returned}} to playing Minor counties cricket for his home county Devon. His first senior match for them {{upon his return}} came in the 2000 NatWest Trophy 3rd round against Staffordshire. In the 2003 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy 2nd round against Cumberland which was played in 2002 to avoid fixture congestion, Dawson scored his only List A century, making 138 runs. A mainstay of the Devon line-up, where he often opened the batting, Dawson was made county captain in 2003 and the following season he led Devon to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> considered their most famous victory. The match in question was a 2nd round 2004 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy match against first-class opponents Leicestershire at The Maer Ground in Exmouth. Put into bat, Leicestershire were all out for 156 inside 50 overs, with Dawson himself claiming the wicket of John Sadler. In reply, Dawson contributed a score of 42, helping Devon to be tied on scores with Leicestershire, but winning due to being 9 wickets down, therefore winning by losing fewer wickets. In the 3rd round there were heavily defeated by Yorkshire, with Dawson scoring 52 runs, before being dismissed by Anthony McGrath. He played his final List A match the following season against Essex in the 1st round of the 2005 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. Devon, {{along with the rest}} of the Minor counties were not permitted to play in domestic List A matches after this season.|$|E

[...] Taylor also highlighted that the track [...] "is an inspired recording and a showcase for all that this artist can accomplish when she lets the voice precede that offputting image." [...] Josh Kun from Spin labelled it a [...] "swoony Celine-for-teens ballad". Sal Cinquemani for Slant Magazine gave the song a very positive review, naming it an [...] "inspirational" [...] ballad and praised her powerful vocals. CD Universe also praised Aguilera's [...] "rich, throaty style" [...] vocals on the track and compared the song to works by Mariah Carey. Sputnikmusic's critic Amanda Murray commented that the song is [...] "tacky" [...] yet [...] "powerful all the same". Rachel McRady of Wetpaint complimented the song's inspiration melody, declaring that it [...] "basically reduces us to tears every time we hear it".|$|E
