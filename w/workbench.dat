5|$|In {{addition}} to finding weaponry {{out in the}} wastelands, the player can also create their own. To craft such weapons, the player must use a <b>workbench,</b> possess either the necessary schematics or the right Perk, and scavenge for the items needed to make them. These weapons usually possess significant advantages over other weapons of their type. Each weapon's schematic has three copies that can be found, and possessing additional copies improves the condition (or number) of items produced at the <b>workbench,</b> while a higher repair skill {{will result in a}} better starting condition for the related weapon. Weapon schematics can be found lying in certain locations, bought from vendors, or received as quest rewards.|$|E

The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a <b>workbench</b> further increases chances of survival.|$|E

25|$|Employees {{were given}} 14 minutes between each shift to punch the time clock, walk to their {{respective}} <b>workbench</b> and prepare for work. It took a minimum of eight minutes for all the employees to get by the time clock. The estimated walking time for employees ranged from 30 seconds to three minutes, but some workers needed {{as many as eight}} minutes to reach their workbenches. Upon arriving at their <b>workbench,</b> employees were required to put on aprons or overalls, removed shirts, tape or grease arms, put on finger cots, prepare equipment, turn on switches, open windows, and/or assemble or sharpen tools. Such preparatory activities consumed three to four minutes.|$|E

Conserved Region 1 contains mostly nonpolar amino acids. Conserved Region 2 contains mostly nonpolar and basic amino acids. Conserved Region 3 contains both polar and nonpolar amino acids. Conserved Region 5 contains mostly nonpolar and basic amino acids.|$|E
25|$|This {{traditional}} tail vise {{also uses}} one large screw, either wooden or metal.

The two main varieties of this vise depend on whether the screw nut is mounted in the bench or on the dog hole block. When the screw nut is mounted on the dog hole block the installation is more complicated and expensive, but the screw does not move in and out as the vise is used.|$|E

25|$|A <b>workbench</b> is a table used by woodworkers to hold {{workpieces}} {{while they}} are worked by other tools. There are many styles of woodworking benches, each reflecting the type {{of work to be}} done or the craftsman's way of working. Most benches have two features in common: they are heavy and rigid enough to keep still while the wood is being worked, and there is some method for holding the work in place at a comfortable position and height so that the worker is free to use both hands on the tools. The main thing that distinguishes benches is the way in which the work is held in place. Most benches have more than one way to do this, depending on the operation being performed.|$|E

His wealthy parents moved to a mansion in Point Piper, a harbourside suburb east of Sydney in the district of Vaucluse, New South Wales. (The mansion, [...] "Altona", is one of Australia's most expensive homes.) Jackson first expressed an interest in electronics at age 13 when he set up a basement <b>workbench</b> and small lab under his parents' mansion. While at Vaucluse Boys' High School, Jackson was discovered by investigators of the Postmaster-General's Department, along with a group of his electronics-minded schoolmates, Phillip Storey, Wally Pearce, Bruce Morrison and Adrian Wood operating a pirate radio station [...] "2VH", with a too-powerful AM transmitter—which the boys operated during and after school, and on the weekends, tuned to 1350kHz in {{the upper end of the}} commercial AM band to avoid more powerful commercial radio station signals. The boys did not know that their tube transmitter and very long, very efficient full wavelength antenna were so well crafted that their unlicensed signal was broadcasting all over Sydney and parts of the state of New South Wales 600km away, at night time.|$|E
