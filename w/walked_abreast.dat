60|$|J. J. O'Molloy {{pulled a}} long face and walked on silently. They {{caught up on}} the others and <b>walked</b> <b>abreast.</b>|$|E
60|$|If {{we could}} have had any doubts as to our dog's {{guidance}} they would all have been removed now, for in the soft, black, oozing soil we could distinctly trace the tracks of the whole party. From these we could see that they had <b>walked</b> <b>abreast,</b> and, furthermore, that each was about equidistant from the other. Clearly, then, no physical force had been used in taking the general and his companion along. The compulsion had been psychical and not material.|$|E
60|$|While {{these events}} were {{occurring}} in the neighbourhood of Bevan's Gully, three red men, in all the glory of vermilion, charcoal, and feathers, were stalking through the forest {{in the vicinity of}} the spot where poor Tom Brixton had laid him down to die. These children of the wilderness stalked in single file--from habit we presume, for there was ample space for them to have <b>walked</b> <b>abreast</b> if so inclined. They seemed to be unsociable beings, for they also stalked in solemn silence.|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{breathe the}} word of the {{prudence}} that <b>walks</b> <b>abreast</b> with time, [...] space, reality, [...] That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.|$|R
60|$|Alric followed, and {{for some}} time these two walked in silence, as the path was very steep, and so narrow for a {{considerable}} distance, {{that they could not}} <b>walk</b> <b>abreast.</b>|$|R
60|$|After {{they had}} breakfasted, packed their dried meat, and sallied {{forth on the}} journey of another day, they walked in silence {{until they reached the}} edge of the plain, where there was room to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast.</b>|$|R
6000|$|We had <b>walked</b> <b>abreast</b> of {{the year}} from the very beginning, {{and that was when}} the first blood-root came up between the patches of April snow, while yet the big drift {{at the bottom of the}} meadow held fast. In the shadow of the woods and under the blown pine-needles, clots of snow lay till far into May, but neither the season nor the flowers took any note of them, and, before we were well sure Winter had gone, the lackeys of my Lord Baltimore in their new liveries came to tell us that Summer was in the valley, and please might they nest at the bottom of the garden? ...|$|E
60|$|For {{four months}} {{there had been}} neither sight nor sound of water in that river. It was frozen to the bottom, except in the middle where its dark unseen waters flowed silently under six feet or more of solid ice through many a river-channel and lake to the distant sea. In fact, save for the suggestive form of its banks, the river might have been mistaken for an {{elongated}} plain or piece of open land. The surface of the snow here was, from exposure to wind and sun, as hard as pavement. We therefore took off our snow-shoes, and, the necessity for maintaining the Indian-file position being removed, we <b>walked</b> <b>abreast.</b>|$|E
60|$|The wheat was now tall, and {{the path}} was narrow; thus the way was quite a sunken groove between the embowing thicket on either side. Two persons could not <b>walk</b> <b>abreast</b> without {{damaging}} the crop, and Oak stood aside to let her pass.|$|R
50|$|Fifteen {{young ladies}} {{in a school}} <b>walk</b> out three <b>abreast</b> for seven days in succession: it is {{required}} to arrange them daily so that no two shall <b>walk</b> twice <b>abreast.</b>|$|R
5|$|Around 6:30pm the {{soldiers}} of the 6th Regiment began assembling. Their armory, located on Front Street across from the Phoenix Shot Tower, consisted of {{the second and third}} floors of a warehouse, with the only exit being a narrow stairway through which no more than two men could <b>walk</b> <b>abreast.</b>|$|R
60|$|Austen smiled, and as {{she went}} on slowly, he {{followed}} her, the path not being wide {{enough for them to}} <b>walk</b> <b>abreast,</b> his eyes caressing the stray hairs that clustered about her neck and caught the light. It seemed so real, and yet so unrealizable, that he should be here with her.|$|R
60|$|And {{into the}} straits of Royd Lane they {{accordingly}} defiled. It was very narrow--so narrow that only two could <b>walk</b> <b>abreast</b> without {{falling into the}} ditch which ran along each side. They had gained the middle of it, when excitement became obvious in the clerical commanders. Boultby's spectacles and Helstone's Rehoboam were agitated; the curates nudged each other; Mr. Hall turned to the ladies and smiled.|$|R
60|$|There were no paths, for a {{rubble of}} small stones covered the ground everywhere. Between {{some of the}} huge rocks the passage was so narrow she could {{scarcely}} squeeze through; between others there was ample space for two people to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast.</b> The girl paused frequently to listen, taking care the while to make no sound herself, but an intense silence pervaded the place.|$|R
60|$|We issued at last upon {{a country}} by-road {{where we might}} <b>walk</b> <b>abreast</b> and without precaution. It was nine miles to Aylesbury, our {{immediate}} destination; by a watch, which formed part of my new outfit, it should be about half-past three in the morning; and as we did not choose to arrive before daylight, time could {{not be said to}} press. I gave the order to march at ease.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{roads in}} Singapore, after {{its founding in}} 1819, were {{laid out in the}} Jackson Plan of 1822 in keeping with Sir Stamford Raffles's directions. A grid system was adopted for the town with roads for carriages being [...] wide, and those for horses four yards wide. Pedestrian paths along the roadsides were two yards wide, allowing room for two people to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast</b> and giving rise to the five-foot ways that came {{to be associated with the}} sheltered walkways along roadside shops.|$|R
60|$|Frank {{followed}} Dominique, George keeping {{beside him}} {{where there was}} room for two to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast,</b> at other times falling just behind. Then came the sailors, and the four black boatmen were in the rear. They had been told that, in case they were halted, and heard Dominique in conversation, they were to pass quietly through the others, {{and be ready to}} join him and help him if necessary. With the exception of Dominique, Frank and George Lechmere, all carried muskets. The pilot declined to take one.|$|R
60|$|So on they wended {{their way}} in silence through the deep {{tropical}} jungle, along a pathway just wide enough for three to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast,</b> till they emerged suddenly upon a large cleared space, in whose midst grew a great banyan-tree, with arms that dropped and rooted themselves like buttresses in the soil beneath. Under the banyan-tree a raised platform stood upon posts of bamboo. The platform was covered with fine network in yellow and red; and two little stools occupied the middle, as if placed there on purpose and waiting for their occupants.|$|R
60|$|Reaching the {{entrance}} {{they began to}} mount the stone stairs. They went up ten stairs and then down five stairs, following a passage cut from the rock. The stairs were just wide enough for the two girls to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast,</b> arm in arm. At {{the bottom of the}} five stairs the passage turned to the right, and they ascended ten more stairs, only to find {{at the top of the}} flight five stairs leading straight down again. Again the passage turned abruptly, this time to the left, and ten more stairs led upward.|$|R
60|$|The man {{dropped his}} hand and turned again. They went over the brow and to the {{headland}} beyond Penally, with the sleepless man gesticulating ever and again, and speaking fragmentary things concerning his whirling brain. At the headland they stood by the seat that looks into the dark mysteries of Blackapit, and then he sat down. Isbister had resumed his talk whenever the path had widened sufficiently for them to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast.</b> He was enlarging upon the complex difficulty of making Boscastle Harbour in bad weather, when suddenly and quite irrelevantly his companion interrupted him again.|$|R

50|$|From time to {{time during}} the reign of Henry II and {{succeeding}} kings the quarrel broke out again, until Pope Innocent VI (1352-62) settled it. He did so by confirming an arrangement that the Archbishop of Canterbury should take precedence with the title 'Primate of All England', but that the Archbishop of York should retain the style of 'Primate of England'. Each prelate was to carry his metropolitical cross in the province of the other, and if they were together their cross-bearers should <b>walk</b> <b>abreast.</b> The Archbishop of York also undertook that each of his successors should send an image of gold to the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury.|$|R
50|$|In 1850, Kirkman {{observed}} that his 1846 solution to Woolhouse's problem had an additional property, which {{he set out}} as a puzzle in The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary: Fifteen young ladies in a school <b>walk</b> out three <b>abreast</b> for seven days in succession: it is required to arrange them daily, so that no two shall <b>walk</b> twice <b>abreast.</b> This problem became known as Kirkman's schoolgirl problem, subsequently to become Kirkman's most famous result. He published several additional works on combinatorial design theory in later years.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no! It is the Wall. Along the top are towers with guard-houses, small towers, between. Even on {{the narrowest}} {{part of it}} three men with shields can <b>walk</b> <b>abreast,</b> from guard-house to guard-house. A little curtain wall, no higher than a man's neck, runs {{along the top of}} the thick wall, so that from a {{distance}} you see the helmets of the sentries sliding back and forth like beads. Thirty feet high is the Wall, and on the Picts' side, the North, is a ditch, strewn with blades of old swords and spear-heads set in wood, and tyres of wheels joined by chains. The Little People come there to steal iron for their arrow-heads.|$|R
6000|$|... “Some paved causeways {{lead from}} the colonnades towards the Kaabah, or Holy House, in the centre.[FN#9] They are of {{sufficient}} breadth to admit four or five persons to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast,</b> and they are elevated about nine inches above the ground. Between these causeways, which are covered with fine gravel or sand, grass appears growing in several places, produced by the Zem Zem water oozing out of the jars which are placed in the ground in long rows during the day.[FN#10] There is a descent of eight or ten steps from the gates {{on the north side}} into the platform of the colonnade, and of three or four steps from the gates on the south side.” ...|$|R
60|$|So, Mr. George {{leading the}} way, {{and the others}} following, they all passed round the gallery towards the other side. The gallery was not very wide, the space being only {{sufficient}} {{for two or three}} persons to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast.</b> There was a high balustrade on the edge of it, {{and on the other side}} a continuous seat against the wall. First Rollo and Jennie, running forward a little way, sat down on the seat to try it. Then, going forward again a little in advance of Mr. George and Mrs. Holiday, they stopped to look over the balustrade. Rollo could look over it down upon the floor of the church far below. Jennie was not tall enough to look over the balustrade, and so she looked through.|$|R
60|$|The Emerald City, {{which is}} the most splendid as well as the most {{beautiful}} city in any fairyland, is surrounded by a high, thick wall of green marble, polished smooth and set with glistening emeralds. There are four gates, one facing the Munchkin Country, one facing the Country of the Winkies, one facing the Country of the Quadlings and one facing the Country of the Gillikins. The Emerald City lies directly in the center of these four important countries of Oz. The gates had bars of pure gold, and on either side of each gateway were built high towers, from which floated gay banners. Other towers were set at distances along the walls, which were broad enough for four people to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast</b> upon.|$|R
60|$|It {{was still}} {{daylight}} in the open, {{but under the}} spreading cottonwoods shadows were obscuring the lanes. Venters drew Jane off from one of these into a shrub-lined trail, just wide enough for the two to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast,</b> and in a roundabout way led her far from the house to a knoll {{on the edge of}} the grove. Here in a secluded nook was a bench from which, through an opening in the tree-tops, could be seen the sage-slope and the wall of rock and the dim lines of canyons. Jane had not spoken since Venters had shocked her with his first harsh speech; but all the way she had clung to his arm, and now, as he stopped and laid his rifle against the bench, she still clung to him.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} popular and longest-running {{participant}} groups is the Marching Fidels, a group dressed like Fidel Castro who take siestas along the parade route and conscript bystanders into the Cuban army, dressing them in camouflage and [...] "forcing" [...] them to march in the parade. Also featured are the Emperor of the Short North and the King and Queen of DooDah. In recent years, participants have included groups such as the Fishnet Mafia, the Wilber Hills Country Club, Feature Creatures Haunted Acting Troupe of Central Ohio, Four Men <b>Walking</b> <b>Abreast</b> (four men carrying a pink balloon adorned with a brighter pink spot in the middle), Deri Air, the Ohio Roller Girls, and the Doo Dah Band. At one time, the parade featured a limosine: a stretched Yugo. Judging takes place along the route and participants bribe judges to vote for their entries. Prizes for Best and Worst Entries are rewarded with gift certificates to Short North businesses.|$|R
6000|$|... ... December 7th, this Winter, Carnival being come or just coming, Friedrich {{opens his}} New Opera-House, for behoof of the {{cultivated}} Berlin classes; a fine Edifice, {{which had been}} diligently built by Knobelsdorf, while those Silesian battlings went on. [...] "One {{of the largest and}} finest Opera-houses in the whole world; like a sumptuous Palace rather. Stands free on all sides, space for 1,000 Coaches round it; Five great Entrances, five persons can <b>walk</b> <b>abreast</b> through each; and inside--you should see, you should hear! Boxes more like rooms or boudoirs, free view and perfect hearing of the stage from every point: air pure and free everywhere; water aloft, not only for theatrical cascades, but to drown out any fire or risk of fire." [...] [Seyfarth, i. 234; Nicolai, Beschreibung von Berlin, i. 169.] This is Seyfarth's account, still capable of confirmation by travelling readers of a musical turn. I have seen Operas with much more brilliancy of gas and gilding; but none nearly so convenient to the human mind and sense; or where the audience (not now a gratis one) attended to the music in so meritorious a way.|$|R
40|$|After the Japanese {{had learned}} that Port Arthur could not be taken by a furious assault that lasted seven days and cost them 25, 000 {{precious}} lives, they settled down to do in six months or a year, what {{they had come to}} do. They began a vast system of sapping, digging trenches, parallel to the Russian lines or fortifications, and one always a little closer to the enemy than the one before and connected by a zigzag trenches, so well planned and executed, that even the turning angles could not be discovered by the Russians. Living in these trenches, just wide enough for four men to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast,</b> was a terrible task. The men were not allowed to leave the trenches for any purpose. Here they had to watch and wait, eat, sleep and drink. The filth was sickening, the cold intense, and a bursting Russian shell might at any moment maim or kill them, while it was certain death to show a head above the protecting wall of the trench, only fifty or a hundred yards from the muzzle of a Russian sharpshooter's gun.

60|$|We found a {{side door}} of the church admitting us into the great cloister, which has a walk of {{intersecting}} arches round its four sides, paved with flat tombstones, and broad enough for six people to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast.</b> On the walls, in the semicircles of each successive arch, are frescos representing incidents {{in the lives of}} the seven founders of the church, and all the lower part of the wall is incrusted with marble inscriptions to the memory of the dead, and mostly of persons who have died not very long ago. The space enclosed by the cloistered walk, usually made cheerful by green grass, has a pavement of tombstones laid in regular ranges. In the centre is a stone octagonal structure, which at first I supposed to be the tomb of some deceased mediaeval personage; but, on approaching, I found it a well, with its bucket hanging within the curb, and looking as if it were in constant use. The surface of the water lay deep beneath the deepest dust of the dead people, and thence threw up its picture of the sky; but I think it would not be a moderate thirst that would induce me to drink of that well.|$|R
5000|$|Martha J. King was in Bauer's butcher shop, {{next door}} to the O.K. Corral's rear entrance, when she saw the Earp party <b>walk</b> by four <b>abreast,</b> headed towards Fry's Boarding House and Photography Studio. She saw Holliday, nearest to the building, {{carrying}} [...] "a gun, not a pistol" [...] under his overcoat on the left side.|$|R
60|$|He walked at the other's heels with a {{swing to}} his {{shoulders}}, {{and his legs}} spread unwittingly, as if the level floors were tilting up and sinking down to the heave and lunge of the sea. The wide rooms seemed too narrow for his rolling gait, and to himself he was in terror lest his broad shoulders should collide with the doorways or sweep the bric-a-brac from the low mantel. He recoiled {{from side to side}} between the various objects and multiplied the hazards that in reality lodged only in his mind. Between a grand piano and a centre-table piled high with books was space for a half a dozen to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast,</b> yet he essayed it with trepidation. His heavy arms hung loosely at his sides. He {{did not know what to}} do with those arms and hands, and when, to his excited vision, one arm seemed liable to brush against the books on the table, he lurched away like a frightened horse, barely missing the piano stool. He watched the easy walk of the other in front of him, and for the first time realized that his walk was different from that of other men. He experienced a momentary pang of shame that he should walk so uncouthly. The sweat burst through the skin of his forehead in tiny beads, and he paused and mopped his bronzed face with his handkerchief.|$|R
6000|$|If {{our young}} men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart. If the young {{merchant}} fails, men say he is ruined. If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining {{the rest of his}} life. A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it,[225] peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He <b>walks</b> <b>abreast</b> with his days, and feels no shame in not [...] "studying a profession," [...] for he does not postpone his life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred chances. Let a Stoic[226] open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh,[227] born to shed healing to the nations,[228] that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but thank and revere him,--and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor, and make his name dear to all history.|$|R
60|$|We {{found this}} noble room divided, by a low railing, into three compartments. The centre, {{an area of}} some thirty feet by forty, {{contained}} the table, and was otherwise prepared for the reception of the court. On one side of it were raised benches for the ladies, who were allowed to be seated; and, on the other, a vacant space for the gentlemen, who stood. All these, you will understand, were considered merely as spectators, not being {{supposed to be in}} the presence of the king. The mere spectators were dressed as usual, or in common evening dress, and not all the women even in that; while those within the railings, being deemed to be in the royal presence, were in high court dresses. Thus I stood for an hour within five-and-twenty feet of the king, and part of the time much nearer, while, by a fiction of etiquette, I was not understood to be there at all. I was a good while within ten feet of the Duchesse de Berri, while, by convention, I was nowhere. There was abundance of room in our area, and every facility of moving about, many coming and going, as they saw fit. Behind us, but at a little distance, were other rows of raised seats, filled with the best instrumental musicians of Paris. Along the wall, facing the table, was a narrow raised platform, wide enough to allow of two or three to <b>walk</b> <b>abreast,</b> separated from the rest of the room by a railing, and extending from a door at one end of the gallery, to a door at the other. This was the place designed for the passage of the public during the dinner; no one, however, being admitted, even here, without a ticket.|$|R
