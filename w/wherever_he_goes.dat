5|$|Sullivan is a {{business}} partner of Drake's. He was meant to act, {{not only as a}} partner, but as a mentor to the main character, and to provide insight into his criminal activities. In all games, Sullivan wears a bowling-style shirt, dockers pants, and chews on a cigar <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b> He is constantly in enormous debt, but is likable enough to pull people into investing in his ventures.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{feature in}} many highly dramatized films. Hollywood {{was quick to}} exploit the {{possibilities}} of deadly disease, mass infection and drastic government reaction, starting as early as 1922 with Nosferatu, in which a Dracula-like figure, Count Orlok, sleeps in unhallowed ground contaminated with the Black Death, which he brings with him <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b> Another classic film, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal, deals with the plague theme very differently, with the grim reaper directly represented by an actor in a hood. More recently, the 1971 The Andromeda Strain, based on a novel by Michael Crichton, portrayed an extraterrestrial microbe contaminating the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Strange {{travels to}} Venice and meets Flora Greysteel. They become fond {{of each other}} and Strange's friends believe he may marry again. However, after experimenting with {{dangerous}} magic that threatens his sanity to gain access to Faerie, he discovers that Arabella is alive and being held captive in Lost Hope. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair curses him with Eternal Night, an eerie darkness that engulfs him and follows him <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b> Thereafter, Strange's strenuous efforts to rescue Arabella take their toll, and his letters to his friends appear crazed. At Strange's request, Flora moves with her family to Padua and secludes herself within her home, along with a mirror given to her by Strange. Drawlight is sent by Lascelles and Norrell to Venice {{to find out more about}} Strange's activities and Strange uses his magic to bring Drawlight before him. Strange instructs Drawlight to deliver messages to Norrell, Childermass and the magical community within England before dismissing him. Strange then re-invokes the old alliances that exist in England between the forces of nature and John Uskglass. This sparks a magical renaissance, but Norrell fails to grasp its significance.|$|E

25|$|Another {{parallel}} is {{the tale}} of Sir Balin in the Arthurian Legend. Though he knows he wields an accursed sword, Balin nevertheless continues his quest to regain King Arthur's favour, though he unintentionally causes misery <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b> Fate eventually catches up {{with him when he}} unwittingly kills his own brother, who in turn mortally wounds him.|$|E
25|$|Another {{parallel}} is {{the tale}} of Sir Balin in the Arthurian Legend with that of Túrin Turambar. Though Balin knows he wields an accursed sword, he nevertheless continues his quest to regain King Arthur's favour; yet he unintentionally causes misery <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b> Fate eventually catches up {{with him when he}} unwittingly kills his own brother, who in turn mortally wounds him. Similarly, Turin accidentally kills his friend Beleg with his sword.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{marginalization}} in {{the mainstream}} US media, Chomsky {{is one of the}} most globally famous figures of the left, especially among academics and university students, and frequently travels across the United States, Europe, and the Third World. He has a very large following of supporters worldwide as well as a dense speaking schedule, drawing large crowds <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b> He is often booked up to two years in advance. He was one of the main speakers at the 2002 World Social Forum. He is interviewed at length in alternative media. Many of his books are bestsellers, including 9-11.|$|E
25|$|Brian Braddock has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, reflexes, senses, and {{the ability}} to fly at {{supersonic}} speeds. He also possesses enhanced perceptions that allow him to be aware of things others may miss (such as objects cloaked by spells of illusion). When he and Meggan destroyed the Otherworld energy matrix at Roma's prompting, the energies that allowed him to retain his power within the UK without his costume were dissipated. Hence, to retain his powers anywhere on Earth, he must wear the costume at all times. His costume acts as an antenna and battery, allowing him to retain his powers <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Leigh Fermor {{translated}} the manuscript The Cretan Runner written by George Psychoundakis, a dispatch runner on Crete during the war, and helped Psychoundakis get his work published. Fermor also wrote a novel, The Violins of Saint-Jacques, which was adapted as an opera by Malcolm Williamson. His friend Lawrence Durrell, in Bitter Lemons (1957), recounts how, during the Cypriot insurgency against continued British rule in 1955, Leigh Fermor visited Durrell's villa in Bellapais, Cyprus: After a splendid dinner {{by the fire}} he starts singing, songs of Crete, Athens, Macedonia. When I go out to refill the ouzo bottle...I find the street completely filled with people listening in utter silence and darkness. Everyone seems struck dumb. 'What is it?' I say, catching sight of Frangos. 'Never have I heard of Englishmen singing Greek songs like this!' Their reverent amazement is touching; {{it is as if}} they want to embrace Paddy <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{wind had}} triumphed and swept all the clouds from heaven. Only a few vapours, {{as thin as}} moonlight, fleeted rapidly across the stars. It was bitter cold; and by a common optical effect, things seemed almost more {{definite}} than in the broadest daylight. The sleeping city was absolutely still: a company of white hoods, a field full of little Alps, below the twinkling stars. Villon cursed his fortune. Would it were still snowing! Now, <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>went,</b> <b>he</b> left an indelible trail behind him on the glittering streets; <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>he</b> was still tethered to the house by the cemetery of St. John; <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>he</b> must weave, with his own plodding feet, the rope that bound him to the crime and would bind him to the gallows. The leer of the dead man {{came back to him}} with a new significance. He snapped his fingers as if to pluck up his own spirits, and choosing a street at random, stepped boldly forward in the snow.|$|R
2500|$|In Hindu Puranas, Durvasa (Sanskrit: दुर्वासा) {{also known}} as Durvasas (Sanskrit: दुर्वासस्), was an ancient Rishi, the son of Atri and Anasuya. [...] He {{is known for his}} short temper. Hence, <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>went,</b> <b>he</b> was {{received}} with great reverence from humans and devas alike.|$|R

2500|$|As {{someone who}} would never {{consider}} an acting career, Boesch felt challenged with the scripted lines given to him both on JAG and Combat Missions. Citing his inability to memorize dialogue, he explained [...] "anything over five words, I'm mumbling." [...] He expressed that people recognized him <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes,</b> {{and that he was}} surprised his 15 minutes of fame had lasted this long.|$|E
2500|$|In a man-to-man defence system, {{a single}} defender follows his {{opponent}} <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b> Extremely tight marking {{can be achieved}} in this way and star players can often be neutralised in a game by use of a dedicated [...] "shadow". Since the man-to-man defence will take defenders {{in any part of}} the field, interceptions and broken plays will often offer opportunity for quick counter-attack. The Italian teams of the 1970s and 1980s often used this approach with impressive results.|$|E
2500|$|Finlay, {{known as}} [...] "Finn" [...] or [...] "Jules", is a blood-spatter {{specialist}} {{who worked for}} Russell in Seattle; Russell asks her to leave Seattle to join the Las Vegas CSI crew. Finlay is hired following the departure of Willows, and acts as a foil to D.B.'s laid-back management style. She is later attacked by the Gig Harbor Killer and left in a car trunk. After a short time in coma, she succumbs to her injuries. Russell states that she will remain with him <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Rabana is a flat faced {{circular}} {{drum and}} comes in several sizes. The large Rabana has {{to be placed on}} the floor like a circular short-legged table and several people (especially the womenfolk) can sit around it and beat on it with both hands. This is used in festivals such as the Sinhalese New Year and ceremonies such as weddings. The resounding beat of the Rabana symbolizes the joyous moods of the occasion. [...] The small Rabana is a form of mobile drum beat, since the player carries it <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Variety critic Todd McCarthy {{describes}} Chigurh's modus operandi: [...] "Death walks hand in {{hand with}} Chigurh <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes,</b> unless he decides otherwise... f everything you've done in your life has led you to him, he may explain to his about-to-be victims, your time might just have come. 'You don't have to do this,' the innocent invariably insist to a man whose murderous code dictates otherwise. Occasionally, however, he will allow someone to decide his own fate by coin toss, notably in a tense early scene in an old filling station marbled with nervous humor." ...|$|E
2500|$|... The poem {{opens with}} the poet's {{invocation}} of the muses, his address to Proteus, and {{his commitment to}} sing the various episodes of Dionysus' life in a varied style (stylistic concept of ( [...] poikilia). The narrative starts with the origins of Dionysus: Zeus kidnaps Europa and her father orders Cadmus (Dionysus' maternal grandfather) to search for her. While Zeus is distracted making love to the nymph Plouto, the monster Typhon, following orders of his mother, the Earth, steals Zeus' weapons (the thunderbolts) and tries to dominate the world causing chaos and destruction <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b> Zeus is now making love to Europa, but when he realises the dire situation calls Pan, Eros and Cadmus for help: Pan provides Cadmus with a pastoral disguise and {{he is supposed to}} charm Typhon with a pastoral song and Eros' help, while Zeus recovers his weapons. Typhon is so charmed by Cadmus' song that he promises him whatever he wants in exchange for it, not understanding that Cadmus is actually singing how he is defeated by Zeus.|$|E

2500|$|For {{more than}} half a century Sir Neville Cardus was the undisputed king of cricket writing. His style {{influenced}} more than one generation of cricket writers. Moorhouse was no exception. Of course, he had a few things in common with the great Cardus: they both came from North-West England, Cardus from Manchester, Moorhouse from Bolton, both spent a considerable amount of their professional career at the Manchester Guardian, and most importantly, both greatly loved the game of cricket. [...] The greatest thing about this book is that Moorhouse covers the matches as a cricket writer, not as a cricket reporter, and the difference can be enormous. Following the style of the great man, Moorhouse cares less about the statistics (although the scorecards are provided in details at the end of every match report). Instead, in the spirit of Cardus, he gives characters to the players, describes the scenario, talks about the past heroes of cricket, and even talks about his own emotions. He starts “The Roses Match” recollecting his family connection with the Red Roses. <b>Wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes,</b> he tries to fathom the spirit of the particular match. Thus, this book describes the spirit of the game more than anything else.|$|E
2500|$|In 1815, {{the prisoners}} work at hard labour ("Work Song"). After 19 {{years in prison}} (five for {{stealing}} bread for his starving sister's son and her family, and the rest for trying to escape), Jean Valjean, [...] "prisoner 24601", is released on parole by the policeman Javert. By law, Valjean must display a yellow ticket-of-leave, which identifies him as an ex-convict ("On Parole"). As a convict, Valjean is shunned <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> and cannot find regular work with decent wages or lodging, but the Bishop of Digne offers him food and shelter. Desperate and embittered, Valjean steals the Bishop's silver and flees. He is captured by the police, but rather than turn him in, the Bishop lies and tells the police that the silver was a gift, giving Valjean a pair of silver candlesticks in addition. The Bishop tells Valjean that he must use the silver [...] "to become an honest man" [...] {{and that he has}} [...] "bought (Valjean's) soul for God" [...] ("Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven"). Ashamed and humbled by the Bishop's kindness, Valjean resolves to redeem his sins ("Valjean's Soliloquy" [...] / [...] "What Have I Done?"). He tears up his yellow ticket, breaking his parole but giving himself a chance {{to start a new life}} free from the stigma of his criminal past.|$|E
2500|$|Dennis Mitchell — an importuning but lovable, freckle-faced five-and-a-half-year-old {{boy with}} a famous blond cowlick and a penchant for mischief. His long-suffering parents can only shake their heads and try to explain their son's antics to others. Despite this, they really do love him very much. Dennis's wide-eyed curiosity, his well-meaning {{attempts}} to help, his innocent, matter-of-fact bluntness, his youthful energy and enthusiastic nature always seem to lead to trouble <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> (most often at Mr. Wilson's expense). He wears a blue/black striped shirt, tennis shoes, and red overalls with pockets that are sometimes filled with snakes, frogs, or his slingshot. He hates carrots and baths, loves root beer (especially with cookies), ketchup, water pistols, his teddy bear [...] "Teddy", getting into fights with other boys his age, mud puddles, and TV Westerns (especially those starring Cowboy Bob), and has occasionally been depicted wearing a cowboy costume. Dennis has a poster and an autographed picture of Cowboy Bob as well. In fact, {{he is such a}} fan that once a week he goes to the local theater to watch a Cowboy Bob western. A favorite TV show of Dennis's is [...] "Uncle Earl." [...] Among the running gags: Dennis has a soft spot for kittens and puppies, which he is always taking home to feed; Dennis loves loud instruments—such as horns and drums; Dennis ruins Christmas songs with shouts of cowboy songs or annoys adults by shouting out loud. Whenever Dennis is in the local department store trying out toys, such as tricycles, he ends up breaking them and his parents have to buy them. In fact Dennis nearly causes kindergarten teachers, Librarians [...] department store Christmas Santas, department store saleswomen, Drugstore salesmen, Hardware store salesmen, shoe salesmen, barbers, and the local post office workers to have nervous breakdowns when he comes around. Dennis also believes in the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus; another running gag is Dennis on Christmas Eve dreaming that he meets Santa Claus, and causing chaos for everyone else.|$|E
