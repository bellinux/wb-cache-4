Whatever it's called, I dig it." [...] and GameSpot wrote that [...] "fundamentals of the Age of Empires II engine are so intact in Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds that veterans of that game can jump right in."

500|$|Andrew Perala from Anchorage Daily News complimented the video, saying [...] "If {{you have}} a secret fondness for pop singer Madonna, you would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> her Ciao Italia, the singer's concert film from Italy. You can be pleasantly {{surprised}} at how amazing she is." [...] Heather Phares from Allmusic said: [...] "Madonna's Ciao Italia: Live From Italy captures a performance from her 1988 world tour and features hits like 'Lucky Star', 'True Blue', 'La Isla Bonita', 'Like a Virgin', and 'Material Girl'. A much simpler, less choreographed performance than her later extravaganzas like The Girlie Show World Tour, Ciao Italia is still entertaining in its own right, and will definitely please fans nostalgic for some old-school Madonna hits." [...] Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times gave a positive review, saying [...] "A festive Italian stadium show featuring the Material Girl, who's turned into a first-rate entertainer, strutting and singing in flashy production-number renditions of her recent most Billboard topping songs, is indeed a delight. The video captures the enormity of Madonna as a performer, and her theatrics, oomph and chutzpah." [...] Tom Shales from The Washington Post said that [...] "Ciao Italia works wonderful because it makes Madonna look like she's at home, with her Italian family all around her. [...] A Turin soccer stadium became the sexual {{center of the universe}} last year when Madonna, one of our naughtiest superstars, taped this concert there before 75,000 gyrating Italians. Ebullient and insouciant, Madonna sings her hits-including the darkly beautiful 'Live to Tell'—in cavernous stereo; dances engagingly with 14-year-old Chris Finch, the quintessential Lucky Little Boy; and crowns herself queen of teases, bending over to reveal 'Kiss' printed on her underpants [...] Sheer showmanship is present in her performances as well as the camera work of this video." [...] Jim Farber from Rolling Stone said that [...] "this version of Madonna's Who's That Girl Tour returns the star to the medium where she excels best. On videocassette, however, Madonna makes manipulation seem like an exciting message indeed." [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide however, gave a negative review of the album, saying [...] "Possibly the biggest problem with Ciao Italia regarded the sloppy manner in which the program was assembled. I can’t recall if Italia appeared as a TV special that aired live or if it was taped and edited specifically for future broadcast screenings, but it certainly looked like something that was created on the fly. Sloppy camerawork and editing abound, as those two factors don’t flow together terribly well. It felt as though they tried their best to get appropriate material at the time but that they failed to massage it after the fact." ...|$|E
2500|$|Back to the Future: The Game {{received}} generally positive reviews. The first episode, [...] "It's About Time", {{was praised}} by several reviewers {{as an effective}} start to the series. IGN's Greg Miller gave the episode a score of 8.5/10, writing, [...] "it's a movie-inspired game that doesn't suck. Instead, it pushes the characters in interesting directions and whips up a good story." [...] Miller praised Telltale Games for recreating the Back to the Future universe with attention to detail and for the iteration's witty dialogue. Nathan Meunier of GameSpot gave the episode a 7.5/10 score, saying the series [...] "shows a lot of promise with its debut installment". The review added that [...] "The entertaining story that follows is enhanced by believable character interactions, imbuing the adventure with {{a great sense of}} authenticity." [...] Meunier did note that the installment was [...] "surprisingly light on challenge and content." [...] Ben PerLee from GameZone summarized his praise of the game by saying it is a [...] "feel good cinematic experience that any fan of Back to the Future will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out,</b> and everyone else would do well to check it out." [...] PALGN gave the installment a 7/10, saying that fans of the films [...] "will find plenty to love with all of the callbacks and nostalgic moments", but calling the game's pace slow and the 1930s setting uninspiring. The review concluded, [...] "Fans will delight in the more nostalgic and clever moments of [...] "It's About Time", but it's a short, easy and somewhat bland introduction to the series, which we hope still has time to get a lot better." [...] In a 2/5 stars review, The Escapist said the first episode of the game [...] "doesn't quite get the tone [...] right and fails to offer up much compelling gameplay." [...] The reviewer called the setting, situations, and characters [...] "bland", further describing the characters as [...] "cardboard nobodies", and did not review the rest of the series. The consensus among critics was that the voice acting was exceptional, with particular praise directed at A.J. Locascio's impersonation of Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly. Most reviewers were critical of the episode's puzzles as being too simplistic and easy. Review aggregator Metacritic assigned the episode an average review score of 74/100.|$|E

The Chilean battleships began to fire upon the Peruvians trying to ease the pressure. Cáceres saw the chance to destroy Lagos' division and sent the Guardia Chalaca and Guarnición de Marina battalions against Barceló, while a fraction of Col. Suárez' Corps engaged Urriola, who wasn't formed yet. The strength of the attack forced the Chileans to retreat. At this time, Lynch wasn't yet in position, so the cavalry and the artillery withdrew from the front line.|$|R

We took deep X-ray (XMM-Newton), far-ultraviolet (HST), and optical (HET, SALT telescopes) spectra of PG 0043 + 039 simultaneously in July 2013. We just detected PG 0043 + 039 in our deep X-ray exposure. The steep α_ox = - 2. 37 ± 0. 05 gradient is consistent with an unusual steep gradient F_ν∼ν^α with α = - 2. 67 ± 0. 02 seen in the UV/far-UV continuum. The optical/UV continuum flux has a clear maximum near 2500 Å. The UV spectrum is very peculiar because it shows broad humps in addition to known emission lines.
