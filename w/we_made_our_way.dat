60|$|<b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{down into}} the garden, which they searched last. At the creek's side the boat was gone, and there were {{footsteps}} in the mud.|$|E
60|$|In {{a minute}} I {{was out of}} the house. Kate was close on my heels, and {{together}} <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to the orchard, followed by the others.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to the {{hospital}} after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> had <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{about half}} the {{distance}} across {{one end of the}} great apartment when a low growl from the far end brought us to a startled halt.|$|R
6000|$|... "God has {{certainly}} fought {{on our side}} today," [...] said he {{to one of his}} Mends: [...] "with barely two hundred men, all dripping like drowned rats, <b>we</b> have <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> almost without opposition, through the town, and thousands of soldiers are even yet flying before us." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{was quiet}} within, {{and we went}} upstairs with the lantern. Everything seemed clean and in order, and it is {{impossible}} to convey any idea of the element of comfort which seemed to pervade the house, as <b>we</b> quietly <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> upstairs, in <b>our</b> wet boots and heavy, damp clothes.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{across the}} sand of the beach, among the rocks and through the close matted scrub, beyond which an {{eminence}} of rugged boulders shut out the further view.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{back to the}} drawing-room, I {{was hoping}} for a talk with Dolly (alas! I should not have many more), when I heard a voice which sounded strangely familiar.|$|E
60|$|At length {{we reached}} the {{outskirts}} of the town. Judge Penfold lived at the top of what was termed the Hill, the aristocratic district of the place, and thither <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have taken}} the rope with them," [...] he said, [...] "and it is well, for when they have searched the valley tomorrow, were it hanging there, it might occur to them that <b>we</b> have <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> up. Now that it is gone they can never suspect that we have {{returned}} here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank goodness!" [...] Jack exclaimed fervently. [...] "We are two {{officers}} belonging to an English ship that was wrecked {{in the storm}} two days ago. We believe all the rest have been drowned. <b>We</b> have <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> on foot across the country, {{and you are the}} first person we have met who can speak English." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the seventeenth}} {{we set out}} with the {{determination}} of examining more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which <b>we</b> had <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> in the first search. We remembered {{that one of the}} fissures in the sides of this pit had been but partially looked into, and we were anxious to explore it, although with no expectation of discovering here any opening.|$|R
60|$|Winter {{seemed to}} know {{more than half the}} company, and when <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to the bar a little fat man in spectacles, who was {{standing}} by himself, offered him a drink.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you think," [...] said George, [...] "that if <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{back to the}} village, {{and hired}} a boy for a mark to guide us, it would save time in the end?" ...|$|E
60|$|Gerard {{had already}} sprung from his horse, and was leading {{him through the}} bushes. I {{followed}} his example, and in {{a minute or two}} <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> down a winding path into a deep chalk quarry.|$|E
60|$|He {{proposed}} a theater, and <b>we</b> accordingly <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> toward the Strand. Our friend, in {{closing the door}} behind him, said he could not tell us what a relief it was to get away from those children. He said he loved children very much indeed, but that {{it was a mistake to}} have too much of anything, however much you liked it, and that he had come to the conclusion that twenty-two hours a day of them was enough for any one.|$|R
50|$|As far as I'm concerned, {{this was}} the turning point {{of the civil rights}} movement. I'm {{absolutely}} convinced of that. Until then, despite every setback and disappointment and obstacle we had faced over the years, the belief still prevailed that the system would work, the system would listen, the system would respond. Now, for the first time, <b>we</b> had <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to {{the very center of the}} system. We had played by the rules, done everything we were supposed to do, had played the game exactly as required, had arrived at the doorstep and found the door slammed in our face.|$|R
6000|$|Just then Mackenzie {{asked about}} Flossie, {{and we were}} all greatly {{relieved}} when one of the men said he had seen her flying towards the house with the nurse. Then bearing such of the wounded as could be moved at the moment with us, <b>we</b> slowly <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> towards the Mission-house, spent with toil and bloodshed, but with the glorious sense of victory against overwhelming odds glowing in our hearts. We had saved the life of the little maid, and taught the Masai of those parts a lesson that they will not forget for ten years -- but at what a cost! ...|$|R
60|$|A wail of fear went up {{from the}} wreck and was echoed from the beach, but by the blessing of Providence she kept afloat until <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> under her {{bowsprit}} and rescued every man of the crew.|$|E
60|$|Together <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{down the}} precipitous slope and {{approached}} the body, black and clear against the silvered stones. The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with tears.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> as best {{we could}} through the crowd of people, who all seemed moving in the same direction, the count, evidently a prey to the gravest anxiety, talking as if to himself and imprecating his own carelessness.|$|E
5000|$|Remarking on the album's {{themes in}} 2008, Grace said: [...] "you get to {{an age where}} you get {{discouraged}} with dreams like in a band and you're told you're {{never going to be}} able to do anything like that, and you start to feel like there's a closed door, and when I started to feel that way, I went ahead and started doing my own thing. <b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> own <b>way</b> and that was kind of just what the title of the album and a lot of the album was about, really, was just doing it yourself and not taking 'no' for an answer, and reclaiming your dreams." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{scrambled}} {{from rock}} to rock, until {{in a few}} moments <b>we</b> had <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to a point from which we could see {{the front door of the}} inn. Wilder's bicycle was leaning against the wall beside it. No one was moving about the house, nor could we catch a glimpse of any faces at the windows. Slowly the twilight crept down as the sun sank behind the high towers of Holdernesse Hall. Then, in the gloom, we saw the two side-lamps of a trap light up in the stable-yard of the inn, and shortly afterwards heard the rattle of hoofs, as it wheeled out into the road and tore off at a furious pace in the direction of Chesterfield.|$|R
6000|$|... [125] Rydal first, the {{smallest}} lake, [...] Famous for great Wordsworth's sake; [...] Grasmere next appeared in sight, [...] Grim Helvellyn on the right, [...] Till <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> downward <b>way</b> [...] To {{the streets of}} Keswick gray. [...] Then amid a weary waste [...] On to Penrith Town we raced, [...] And for many a flying mile, [...] Past the ramparts of Carlisle, [...] Till we crossed the border line [...] Of the land of Auld lang syne. [...] Here we paused at Gretna Green, [...] Where many curious things were seen [...] At the grimy blacksmith's shop, [...] Where flying couples used to stop [...] And forge within the smithy door [...] The chain which lasts for evermore.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> still onward {{across the}} open plain without one word towards Salisbury. The mare was giving out. She strode with a will; but her flanks were white with froth; her breath came short; foam flew from her nostrils.|$|E
60|$|Down the {{corridor}} at some distance I saw the faint {{reflection of a}} light, and toward this <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way.</b> At {{the point where the}} light shone was a sharp turn, and a little distance beyond this a brilliantly lighted chamber.|$|E
60|$|Found {{comfortable}} saloon awaiting us at Bayonne, and {{so under}} weeping skies <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to Pau. The landscape must be pretty, weather permitting. As it was, we saw but little. Mr. G. dozed and read Max Müller’s book on Anthropological Religions.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was three}} o'clock in the morning when the houses outside London did at last begin to exclude the country and to close us in with streets. <b>We</b> had <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> along roads in a far worse {{condition}} than when we had traversed them by daylight, both the fall and the thaw having lasted ever since; but the energy of my companion never slackened. It had only been, as I thought, of less assistance than the horses in getting us on, and it had often aided them. They had stopped exhausted half-way up hills, they had been driven through streams of turbulent water, they had slipped down and become entangled with the harness; but he and his little lantern had been always ready, and when the mishap was set right, I had never heard any variation in his cool, [...] "Get on, my lads!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, having {{carried out}} our plans so successfully, it only {{remained}} to leave no trace behind us. Our little band of {{workers at the}} other end had already ripped up the rails and disconnected the side line, replacing everything as it had been before. We were equally busy at the mine. The funnel and other fragments were thrown in, the shaft was planked over as it used to be, and the lines which led to it were torn up and taken away. Then, without flurry, but without delay, <b>we</b> all <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> out of the country, most of us to Paris, my English colleague to Manchester, and McPherson to Southampton, whence he emigrated to America. Let the English papers of that date tell how throughly we had done our work, and how completely we had thrown the cleverest of their detectives off our track.|$|R
60|$|What {{with this}} noise {{on the part}} of Mr. Commissioner Pordage, and what with the cries of Sergeant Drooce on the raft astern (which were {{sometimes}} more than Tom Packer could silence), <b>we</b> often <b>made</b> <b>our</b> slow <b>way</b> down the river, anything but quietly. Yet, that it was of great importance that no ears should be able to hear us from the woods on the banks, could not be doubted. We were looked for, to a certainty, and we might be retaken at any moment. It was an anxious time; it was, indeed, indeed, an anxious time.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to the galleried {{porch and}} sat down, {{there being a}} lull in the figures just then. We each took out a cigar and lighted a match; and then looked across at the other. We solemnly blew our matches out.|$|E
60|$|The Okarian nobles now {{submitted}} to arrest, since nothing but death faced them should they resist, and, escorted by the warriors of Talu, <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> {{to the great}} audience chamber that had been Salensus Oll's. Here was a vast concourse of warriors.|$|E
60|$|At last I {{turned away}} from them--rather disheartened, for I had hoped {{to be able to}} enlist a {{considerable}} force of them in an attempt to rush Hooja's horde and rescue Dian. Back along the beach toward the hidden canoe <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Reverting to her {{original}} name, Newport lay idle in the Pacific Reserve Fleet until recommissioned on 27 July 1950 for {{service in the}} Korean War. Lieutenant Commander P.A. Lilly became her recommissioning Commanding Officer. She patrolled off Inchon, Korea, from 15 to 26 September 1950, screening United Nations ships during the Inchon landings. Lilly recalled, [...] "The extreme tides made for extreme currents and rip tides. When I went alongside an anchored tanker, I had to keep engines turning to stay alongside until fully moored. After the troops were safely ashore, <b>we</b> (escort ships) <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> back to Japan with the newly empty troop ships." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So am I," [...] said she, as if {{struck by}} the same {{convictions}} that had been impressed on me. <b>We</b> turned, and <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> along the leeward quarter, to a seat by the bulwarks. I stood holding on by the railrope, {{and every now and}} then addressing a few incoherent and rather guttural, not to say pectoral, remarks to the green and gloomy sea, as I leaned over the rail. After every paroxysm of communicativeness, (for in seasickness the organ of secretiveness gives way,) I regained my perpendicular, and faced the foe, with a determination that I would stand it through--that the grinning, howling brine should get no more secrets out of me. And, in fact, it did not.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Being a fine night,' said he, 'we {{chose to}} walk back to our lodgings; but never shall I forget the wicked scenes {{wherewith}} we were encountered on the way. Good Master Bunyan, of Elstow, might have added some pages to his account of Vanity Fair had he been with us. The women, be-patched, be-ruddled, and brazen; the men swaggering, roistering, cursing--the brawling, the drabbing, and the drunkenness! It was a fit kingdom to be ruled over by such a court. At last <b>we</b> had <b>made</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> to more quiet streets, and were hoping that our adventures were at an end, when {{of a sudden there}} came a rush of half-drunken cavaliers from a side street, who set upon the passers-by with their swords, as though we had fallen into an ambuscade of savages in some Paynim country. They were, as I surmise, of the same breed as those of whom the excellent John Milton wrote: [...] "The sons of Belial, flown with insolence and wine." [...] Alas! my memory is not what it was, for at one time I could say by rote whole books of that noble and godly poem.' ...|$|R
