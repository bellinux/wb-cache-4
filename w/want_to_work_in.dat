In 2010, Sega's community manager, Aaron Webber, returned from a vacation to find his cubicle redecorated to resemble Green Hill; IGN's Levi Buchanan claimed that [...] "everyone wants to come back to" [...] this, and Owen Good of Kotaku exclaimed [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> Green Hill Zone, too!"

2500|$|The Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement {{is seen as}} {{a failure}} by most since only 7% of {{applicants}} or 200 nurses a year has been accepted on average.

2500|$|Tucker {{expected}} that his plan would meet strong resistance from Virginia's elite planter society, and expected several objections from the Virginia Assembly. Abolishing slavery in Virginia would effectively eliminate {{a large portion}} of the wealth of Virginia's slaveholders, many of whom also served on the Assembly; as a side effect, a considerable share of the taxable property in Virginia would also disappear. Members of Virginia's ruling class, including Tucker, were afraid of the changes emancipation would have on their society, possibly with events such as the Haitian Revolution in mind. Many Virginians also worried that freed slaves would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> the commonwealth's fields, leaving plantations with too few workers. Furthermore, Tucker noted that white Virginians' [...] "habitual arrogance and assumption of superiority[...] [...]unfit (them)[...] [...]for equality." ...|$|E

For her role, Kidman learned to round up cattle. In May 2006, due to Crowe's demanding personal script approval before signing onto the project, Luhrmann sought to replace the actor with Heath Ledger. Crowe said he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> an environment that was influenced by budgetary needs. About this casting issue, Luhrmann said, [...] "it was hard pinning [...] down. Every time I was ready, Russell was in something else, {{and every time he}} was ready, I would be having another turmoil". The following June, Luhrmann replaced Crowe with actor Hugh Jackman. In January 2007, actors Bryan Brown, Jack Thompson, and David Wenham were cast into Australia. In November 2006, Luhrmann began searching for an actor to play an Aboriginal boy of 8–10 years old and by April 2007, 11-year-old Brandon Walters was cast into the role of Nullah. Academic D. Bruno Starrs has written about how this casting choice and the decision to have the character of Nullah narrate the film reinforce its [...] "left-leaning" [...] message regarding the 'Stolen Generations'.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} {{localized}} into multiple languages, {{but all the}} lip syncing was for the English dialogue: this was done partly to show western audiences appreciation for their support of the title, and also because Japanese audiences had grown used to out-of-sync dialogue with dubbed Western films. English voice recording was done in Los Angeles. Localization was handled by Microsoft: initially, different departments in each region handled localization for their region. The need to translate and then include the material at long distance proved problematic, so the main development team brought the localization team into the main production, introducing them to easy-to-use development tools so changes could be made easily without direct consultation with Feelplus. The story segments written by Shigematsu were translated by Jay Rubin, a noted American academic and translator from Harvard University noted for translating the works of Haruki Murakami. Microsoft chose Rubin as they wanted Shigematsu's material treated and translated with the utmost respect possible. When first approached, Rubin was skeptical, as he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> a medium that generally seemed to glorify violence. However, he eventually agreed {{to have a look}} at the material, and was shocked by the anti-violence message present throughout all the stories while remaining family-friendly. He referred to the messages within Shigematsu's stories as [...] "essentially Buddhistic", and was surprised that Microsoft had contacted him in the first place given the stories' visual novel medium within the context of Lost Odyssey.|$|E
