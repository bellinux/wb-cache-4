25|$|Gretta Conroy, in James Joyce's {{short story}} The Dead, remembers her lover Michael Furey {{throwing}} stones against the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grandmother's house on Nun's Island, in the city. The poem, She Weeps Over Rahoon by James Joyce, {{tells of the}} grief of Joyce's wife, Nora Barnacle, {{over the death of}} her onetime boyfriend Michael Bodkin. Both Bodkin and Nora were from Galway and Bodkin is buried in Rahoon Cemetery in the western suburbs of the city.|$|E
25|$|After {{suffering}} from mental disorders for several years, Kiki committed suicide {{on the night}} of December 23, 1946, jumping out of a <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fifth-floor apartment in the Stanhope Hotel of New York City and landing in a courtyard of the hotel. According to her companion, Lillian Turner, Kiki had been in poor health, depressed and nervous. Turner had just given Preston a glass of milk and then went into {{the living room of the}} apartment to read. When she heard no sounds coming from Kiki's bedroom, she entered it, only to find a window open and Kiki gone. Kiki's pajama-clad body was soon discovered in an areaway behind the hotel. Preston's mother, Helen Steele, was also living at the same hotel at the time. Today, Kiki's home on Lake Naivasha is inhabited by the 7th Earl of Enniskillen.|$|E

25|$|He {{responded to}} these criticisms by attacking his detractors {{in the pages}} of Murray's Magazine, {{supporting}} vigilante activity, which the police on the streets knew was a bad idea, and publicly complaining about his lack of control of CID, which brought an official Home Office reprimand for discussing his office publicly without permission. Warren finally had enough and resigned – coincidentally right before the murder of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November 1888. Every superintendent on the force visited him at home to express their regret. Warren's resignation hindered the investigation. He had given an order that if another murder occurred, nobody was to enter the scene – a strange turn of phrase as the four previous victims had all been found in the open street – until he arrived to direct the investigation. Consequently, when the murder of Kelly was discovered by a rent collector who looked in through the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> room in a Spitalfields lodging house, the police did not enter the room for some three hours because, unaware of his resignation, they were waiting for Warren to arrive. He returned to military duties.|$|E
500|$|When Berlin was {{a divided}} city, the Berlin Wall ran along Bernauer Straße. [...] The street itself {{belonged to the}} French sector of West Berlin and the East German {{authorities}} declared that the windows and doors that led out onto Bernauer Straße should be bricked up. [...] In the early morning of 22 August 1961, Ida Siekmann {{was the first of}} 98 people to die while attempting to escape. [...] She was living on the fourth floor of number 48 (third floor, 3te Stock, by German standards), threw bedding and some possessions down onto the street, and jumped out of the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> apartment. She fell on the sidewalk and was severely injured, dying shortly afterwards {{on her way to the}} Lazarus Hospital. [...] On 8 March 1989, Winfried Freudenberg became the last person to die in an attempt to escape from East Germany to West Berlin across the Berlin Wall by falling from his balloon.|$|E
500|$|In 1947, Bence won the Writers Association {{award for}} Best Actress and the inaugural prize for the Hispanoamericano de Cinematografía in Madrid {{for her role}} as a wealthy but weak and {{vulnerable}} lady, mistreated by an evil nephew in Daniel Tinayre's murder drama, A sangre fría. For her role in Momplet 's La otra y yo (1949), which co-starred Enrique Álvarez Diosdado and Fernando Lamas, she dyed her hair blond to play two different characters—the film star [...] "Dora Nelson" [...] and the clothing designer [...] "Matilde García". It amused and surprised the public, as there is a scene where the two characters talk {{to each other in the}} same frame. La Opinión praised her acting and the magazine El Hogar reported that she [...] "soared beyond the script and the director". Bence again starred opposite Diosdado in Danza del fuego, in which played Elena Valdez, a successful concert pianist who died on her wedding night after falling out the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> home, tortured and believing herself guilty of a crime. Her performance earned her the award for Best Actress in 1949 from both Writers Association and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences of Argentina.|$|E

60|$|NURSE. On those heathens. Don't {{your own}} hearth and home come first? Your wife, that {{was born in}} time <b>of</b> war, with <b>her</b> own father fighting, and her {{grandfather}} killed for his country. A bitter thing, to have the <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house broken, and be pointed at by {{the boys in the}} street.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Zane glanced {{again at}} her, and {{knew what had}} happened. Despite her self-possession those {{tell-tale}} eyes told her secret. Ever-changing and shadowing with a bounding, rapturous light, they were indeed the <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> soul. All the emotion of a woman's heart shone there, fear, beauty, wondering appeal, trembling joy, and timid hope.|$|R
500|$|At French {{television}} show Taratata Gaga appeared while {{hanging out of}} the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> limousine. She later went on the show to perform [...] "Hair", but changed her outfit once more. The recorded performance was released to her YouTube channel by Gaga. Air Productions, which produces the program Taratata, detected the posting of the video and notified YouTube of supposed copyright infringement on Gaga's part. YouTube was forced to close Gaga's official channel with the statement: [...] "YouTube ladygagaofficial account was closed, because we have received, several instances, third-party notifications informing us that many people, including the following, filed a claim for infringement of copyright: Air Productions." [...] Later, Air Productions issued a statement that the notification was sent in error, and they had asked Google and YouTube to rectify this; Gaga's account was re-opened, and Taratata apologized to the singer: [...] "Really sorry for the problem with YouTube. Everything works again!" [...] During her promotional performances of the songs from Born This Way in Taiwan, Gaga sang [...] "Hair" [...] and played the piano in a black bra, {{against the backdrop of}} many red lanterns and a red arch, a set created specially for the Taiwan show. She later explained in a press conference the inspiration behind the performance: [...] "Like the gentleman [...] just mentioned, that lantern means prosperity and it's about the future. I'm always thinking about the future of my generation and the voice of my generation when I write music." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Crawford, Hughes has {{requested}} on [...] "numerous" [...] occasions {{to see her}} breasts. Hughes also, {{in response to the}} question [...] "What's up?" [...] grabbed his crotch and replied [...] "You know what's up." [...] On several occasions, Crawford continued, Hughes had pressed his crotch against the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> office. On one occasion, when Crawford asked Hughes what she could do for him, he grabbed her head and pulled it towards his crotch. Other allegations were made by two other women who worked with Hughes.|$|E

2500|$|At about 12:40p.m., Oswald {{boarded a}} city bus but (probably due to heavy traffic) {{requested}} a transfer {{from the bus}} driver and got off two blocks later. Oswald took a taxicab to his rooming house, at 1026 North Beckley Avenue, arriving at about 1:00p.m. He entered {{through the front door}} and, according to his housekeeper, Earlene Roberts, immediately went to his room, [...] "walking pretty fast." [...] Roberts said that Oswald left [...] "a very few minutes" [...] later, zipping up a jacket he was not wearing when he had entered earlier. As Oswald left, Roberts looked out of the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house and last saw him standing at the northbound Beckley Avenue bus stop in front of her house.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{incidents}} in 1989 and 1990 were {{described by the}} movement as false flag operations. In February 1989, an explosion damaged the Senate House bar in Bristol University, an attack claimed by the unknown [...] "Animal Abused Society". In June 1990, two days apart, bombs exploded in the cars of Margaret Baskerville, a veterinary surgeon working at Porton Down, a chemical research defence establishment, and Patrick Max Headley, a professor of physiology at Bristol University. Baskerville escaped without injury by jumping through the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mini-jeep when a bomb using a mercury-tilt device exploded next to the fuel tank. During the attack on Headley—which New Scientist writes involved the use of plastic explosives—a 13-month-old baby in a push-chair suffered flash burns, shrapnel wounds to his back, and a partially severed finger.|$|E
2500|$|Elements of Sir Launfal that {{borrow from}} Marie de France's Lanval {{can be found}} in other Breton lais as well, {{particularly}} the land of [...] "Fayerye". Marie de France's Yonec, for example, describes a woman following a trail of blood left by her lover; a man who was accustomed to arriving at the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> room {{in the form of a}} hawk. She follows the trail of blood into the side of a hill and out into an Otherworld where all the buildings are made of solid silver, into a town where ships are moored. Marie's lai Guigemar, sees the wounded hero set sail in a mysterious boat with candelabra at its prow and with only a bed on deck, upon which he lies, the only living soul on board. He arrives safely at the mysterious castle of a lady who heals him of his wound, and becomes her lover. Sir Orfeo follows a company of ladies into the side of a cliff and through the rock until he emerges into an Otherworld, in a Middle English Breton lai, where he rescues his wife who had been abducted, from amongst those who have been beheaded and burnt and suffocated. Many ancient Irish tales involve a hero entering a hill of the Sidhe, or crossing a sea to a Land of Youth, or passing down through the waters of a lake into an Otherworld.|$|E

5000|$|Manji has {{received}} numerous death threats.

50|$|When Anna {{learned in}} December 1575 <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{upcoming}} transferral to Saxony, she attempted suicide. After a long stay in Zeitz, {{she was taken}} to Dresden in December 1576. There, the <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> room was walled up and fitted with additional iron bars. At the door was a square hole in the top panel that provided a narrow grid, which was closed off outside. Through this hole food and drinks were served to her. At the door there was also another iron gate, virtually guaranteeing no chance of escape.|$|R
2500|$|From 1983 onwards, {{a series}} of fire bombs {{exploded}} in department stores that sold fur, {{with the intention of}} triggering the sprinkler systems in order to cause damage, although several stores were partly or completely destroyed. In September 1985, incendiary devices were placed under the cars of Sharat Gangoli and Stuart Walker, both animal researchers with the British Industrial Biological Research Association (BIBRA), wrecking both vehicles but with no injuries, and the ARM claimed responsibility. In January 1986, the ARM said it had placed devices under the cars of four employees of Huntingdon Life Sciences, timed to explode an hour apart from each other. A further device was placed under the car of Andor Sebesteny, a researcher for the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, which he spotted before it exploded. The next major attacks on individual researchers took place in 1990, when the cars of two veterinary researchers were destroyed by sophisticated explosive devices in two separate explosions. In February 1989, an explosion damaged the Senate House bar in Bristol University, an attack claimed by the unknown [...] "Animal Abused Society". In June 1990, two days apart, bombs exploded in the cars of Margaret Baskerville, a veterinary surgeon working at Porton Down, a chemical research defence establishment, and Patrick Max Headley, a physiologist at Bristol University. Baskerville escaped without injury by jumping through the <b>window</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mini-jeep when a bomb using a mercury-tilt device exploded next to the fuel tank. During the attack on Headley—which New Scientist writes involved the use of plastic explosives—a 13-month-old baby in a push-chair suffered flash burns, shrapnel wounds, and a partially severed finger. A wave of letter bombs followed in 1993, one of which was opened by the head of the Hereford site of GlaxoSmithKline, causing burns to his hands and face. Eleven similar devices were intercepted in postal sorting offices.|$|E

60|$|The Duchess half {{closed her}} eyes. For {{a moment she}} was silent. She seemed to be {{listening}} to something a long way off. Through the open <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> softly shaded drawing-rooms, odourous with flowers, came the rippling of water falling from a fountain in the conservatory, the lazy hum of a mowing machine on the lawn, the distant tinkling of a hansom bell in the Square. But these were not the sounds which for a moment had changed her face.|$|R
60|$|The {{position}} of the moon cast {{the whole of the}} narrow passage which flowed beneath the <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> private apartments into shadow. In a balcony which overhung the water, stood the youthful and ardent girl, listening with a charmed ear and a tearful eye to one of those soft strains, in which Venetian voices answered to each other from different points on the canals, in the songs <b>of</b> the gondoliers. <b>Her</b> constant companion and Mentor was near, while the ghostly father of them both stood deeper in the room.|$|R

60|$|Years passed away, {{and months}} were {{spent at the}} villa, in which a {{thousand}} anxious looks were cast upon the ocean. Each morning, during {{the early months of}} summer, did Alida hasten to the <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pavilion, in the hope of seeing the vessel of the contraband anchored in the Cove:--but always without success. It never returned;--and though the rebuked and disappointed Alderman caused many secret inquiries to be made along the whole extent of the American coast, he never again heard of the renowned 'SKIMMER OF THE SEAS' or of his matchless WATER-WITCH.|$|R
60|$|I frowned, {{but before}} I could frame an answer she touched me {{lightly on the}} arm {{and pointed to the}} Queen. A change had come upon her: her hands were clenched, and about her face, all rosy with the hue of sleep, {{gathered}} a cloud <b>of</b> fear. <b>Her</b> breath came quick, she raised her arms as though to ward away a blow, then with a stifled moan sat up and opened the <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes. They were dark, dark as night; but when the light found them they grew blue as the sky grows blue before the blushing of the dawn.|$|R
5|$|Josephine toured Britain in 1870, {{travelling}} 3,700 {{miles to}} attend 99 {{meetings in the}} course of the year. She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Josephine gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape. Although she persuaded many members <b>of</b> <b>her</b> audiences, she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting pimps threw cow dung at her; at another, the <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting.|$|R
