5|$|Ticks are parasitic, {{and some}} {{transmit}} micro-organisms and parasites {{that can cause}} diseases in humans, while the saliva of a few species can directly cause tick paralysis {{if they are not}} removed <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two.|$|E
5|$|The nest, {{built from}} plant {{material}} and unlined, is placed among dense vegetation or {{in a tree}} hole. The typical clutch is around ten whitish eggs. The breeding adults, which pair for life, take turns to incubate, and the eggs hatch in 24–29 days. The downy grey ducklings leave the nest <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> so of hatching, but the parents continue to protect them until they fledge around nine weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} {{in a series}} of slits usually cut by the mother's {{ovipositor}} in live branches or twigs of their food plants. On average about sixteen eggs, among a total batch of a few hundred, are laid in each slit. The batch all hatch around 70 days later – usually <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two of one another – but take longer in cold or dry conditions. Oviposition has been observed {{on a wide range of}} native and introduced plant species and can weaken the branches of young orchard trees such that they cannot sustain the load of their fruit.|$|E
50|$|Prolong {{exposure}} to {{a very high level}} of nitrogen dioxide in micro meter-size range, may have an inflammatory effect that principally targets the respiratory tracts leading to chronic nitrogen dioxide poisoning which can occur <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks after the threshold limit value is excessively exceeded.|$|R

5|$|While {{the storm}} was passing near Dominica, the San Juan, Puerto Rico Weather Bureau warned about {{the threat of the}} {{hurricane}} which would strike the island <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two. The advisory was sent via telegraph to 75police districts and was broadcast from the naval radio station every two hours; this was the first hurricane warning broadcast by radio. Warnings were also posted for 12ports along the southern coast, causing ships to avoid the island or remain at port. Effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312, and not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of Puerto Rico. By comparison, the weaker 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane killed approximately 3,000people.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics {{in several different}} ways. One such way is if it moves over land, thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength. Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two, or evolve into extra{{tropical cyclone}}s. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water, such as with Hurricane Ivan. If it remains over mountains for even a short time, weakening will accelerate. Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall. This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides, {{as was the case}} with Hurricane Mitch around Honduras in October 1998. Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Helen passed through, cleanup efforts began as power crews had to remove downed trees before fixing power lines. The main power {{lines in the}} city were {{restored}} within 24hours and rural areas were stated to have their power back <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two. Two days after the storm, 500 homes remained without electricity and frustrated residents were further angered after discovering that the Power and Water agency was in control of tree removal and not emergency services. With the power company in charge of clearing downed trees, they stated that their crews would only be dealing with cases involved power lines. Residents with trees in their yards or even on their homes were told to contact private contractors to remove them. By 9January, more than 100 homes were still without power in northern Darwin, resulting in angry outcries from those still left in the dark. Cleanup efforts dragged {{on for more than}} two months as debris was still present in Darwin in March. Removal of tree stumps took through at least mid-April as the cost to remove downed trees exceeded A$1million (US$882,000). Due to the damage wrought by Helen, its name was retired following its usage. However, it was not replaced by any particular name as a new naming scheme was implemented the following season.|$|E
50|$|Not all acute {{diseases}} or {{injuries are}} severe, and vice versa. For example, a mild stubbed toe is an acute injury. Similarly, many acute upper respiratory infections and acute gastroenteritis cases in adults are mild and usually resolve <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{muscles in the}} low back that assist with rotation, {{flexibility}} and strength. These muscles are susceptible to injury, especially while lifting heavy objects, or lifting while twisting. A low back muscle strain can be extremely painful but will usually heal <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks.|$|R
25|$|During labour and birth, the infant's skull changes {{shape to}} fit through the birth canal, {{sometimes}} causing {{the child to}} be born with a misshapen or elongated head. It will usually return to normal on its own <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks. Special exercises sometimes advised by physicians may assist the process.|$|R

25|$|However, {{there was}} a limited revolt in Batavia (as Jakarta was then known), which broke out on 12 November. Similar actions took place in Padang, Bantam and Surabaya. In Batavia, the revolt was crushed <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two, {{and after a few}} weeks it had been {{comprehensively}} defeated throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|Up to the 4th century CE, these tables {{give the}} day of the Jewish month to <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> so and the number of the month to within a month or so.

30|$|Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) {{disease is}} a granulomatous panuveitis, usually {{involving}} both eyes {{at the same time}} <b>or</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks. Acute and chronic diseases are characterized by distinct clinical features, treatment modalities, and visual outcomes. We report an atypical case of probable VKH disease, with features of acute disease in one eye and chronic disease in the fellow eye.|$|R
25|$|After {{the tick}} is removed {{pruritus}} may recur {{at the site}} of attachment at intervals over some weeks, and a small firm lump usually forms <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> so of the tick's removal. This again may persist for many weeks. There may be some discoloration of the area of the bite. In other cases the skin reactions may be severe with marked pruritus and considerable erythema, oedema and induration. People also report headaches.|$|E
25|$|On 23 June 1942, Major General Henry Gibbins, sailing unescorted with a {{cargo of}} coffee, was {{attacked}} and sunk by U-158 about 375 {{miles west of}} Key West, Florida. The ship was hit {{on the port side}} by two torpedoes fired about twenty minutes apart, and sank shortly thereafter. The ship's crew of 47 along with her 21 army guards survived the attack, and were rescued <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two and taken to Pensacola, Florida.|$|E
25|$|Nymph {{mortality}} in captivity is high—about 38%—especially {{within the first}} two days of life. In the wild, mortality may instead be highest in the third instar. Nymph hazards are numerous. Failure to completely hatch from the egg is invariably fatal and may be dependent on the humidity of the egg's environment. Death during molting can also occur, although it is reportedly uncommon. During feeding, the nymph gut can rupture, dispersing the host's blood throughout the insect. This results in death <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two. Whether the high mortality recorded under experimental conditions is representative of conditions in the wild is unclear.|$|E
30|$|Parents {{were shown}} the {{following}} question: “When {{making decisions about}} your child’s health, how concerned are you about the following issues related to prescription medications your child is taking?” and asked to select their top two concerns {{from a list of}} issues that spanned concerns with drug formulation, the potential for related psychosocial distress, immediacy/latency of harm. The list of items, which was informed by input from experienced pediatric rheumatologists’ who drew on their clinical experiences of the most commonly voiced family concerns, included: correct dose and schedule of medication, safety of medication, serious short-term side effects (happen <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks), most likely short-term side effects (happen <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks), serious long-term side effects (happen within months or years), most likely long-term side effects (happen within months or years), number of medications the child is taking, possible interactions among medications, the child’s discomfort or anxiety about taking a medication, and the partner’s discomfort or anxiety about giving the child medication.|$|R

25|$|These {{spots are}} often {{followed}} <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks by <b>a</b> much greater leakage of blood, which blurs the vision. In extreme cases, {{a person may}} {{only be able to}} tell light from dark in that eye. It may take the blood anywhere from <b>a</b> few <b>days</b> to months <b>or</b> even years to clear from the inside of the eye, and in some cases the blood will not clear. These types of large hemorrhages tend to happen more than once, often during sleep.|$|R
25|$|While {{significantly}} {{resistant to}} heat and radiation, endospores can {{be destroyed by burning}} or by autoclaving at a temperature exceeding {{the boiling point}} of water, 100°C. Endospores are able to survive at 100°C for hours, although the longer the number of hours the fewer that will survive. An indirect way to destroy them is to place them in an environment that reactivates them to their vegetative state. They will germinate <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two with the right environmental conditions, and then the vegetative cells, not as hardy as endospores, can be straightforwardly destroyed. This indirect method is called Tyndallization. It was the usual method for a while in the late 19th century before the introduction of inexpensive autoclaves. Prolonged exposure to ionising radiation, such as x-rays and gamma rays, will also kill most endospores.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{presentation}} (in 40–50% of the cases) is episodic hematuria, {{which usually}} starts <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> {{two of a}} non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (hence synpharyngitic), as opposed to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which occurs some time (weeks) after initial infection. Less commonly gastrointestinal or urinary infection can be the inciting agent. All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production. Groin pain can also occur. The gross hematuria resolves after a few days, though microscopic hematuria may persist. These episodes occur on an irregular basis every few months and in most patients eventually subsides, although it can take many years. Renal function usually remains normal, though rarely, acute kidney failure may occur (see below). This presentation {{is more common in}} younger adults.|$|E
25|$|As first American carrier planes, then long-distance {{land-based}} planes began {{raids on}} the Philippines, the guerrillas became important {{for yet another}} reason. As American pilots bailed out when their planes were hit by Japanese anti-aircraft fire, they often found Filipino guerrillas waiting for them even before they hit the ground. Pilots who landed in the water were picked up quickly by Filipinos in small, swift boats. Often the pilots would be expressing their appreciation of the guerrillas to their ships' debriefing officers <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two. Fertig soon issued orders that pilots {{were not allowed to}} go on patrol with the guerrillas, as some of the more enthusiastic pilots were doing. He knew they were more important flying missions against Japanese targets. Besides, Colonel Fertig now had a good supply of experienced, battle-hardened American and Filipino leaders for his combat patrols.|$|E
30|$|Five {{small plates}} for [Experiment I] and five test pieces for [Experiment II] had been {{pre-heated}} to 100  °C during the optical contact process.

25|$|On October 1, 1764, Bouquet held {{meetings}} with Shawnee and Delaware leaders at Fort Pitt. The Indians {{tried to convince}} Bouquet that their numbers were great, {{and that he should}} not move into their territory because his army could not survive. Apparently the Indians were bluffing, because <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two, they had agreed to give up their white captives to Bouquet and his forces. On October 3, Bouquet and 1,500 soldiers departed Fort Pitt, arriving at a place called Tuscarawas on October 13. The next day, Bouquet met with leaders of Native American groups including those of the Delaware. The meetings lasted until October 20, when Bouquet issued an ultimatum and demanded the return of captives. Captives were turned over to Bouquet's forces at different times during and after these proceedings, Mary Campbell was among those who returned.|$|E
25|$|From the {{evidence}} that could be gathered, it appeared Waterhouse and Connolly became lost in a rainstorm and hugged the coast of Baja California southward, thinking they were headed north along the Pacific Coast. They landed safely on the beach about twenty miles north of Bahia de Los Angeles. Their sole chance for survival seemed to be staying with the plane until found. Tortured by heat, thirst, and hunger, they waited seventeen days, but the search never reached that far south. Finally two fishermen came along and took them in a canoe to Bahia de Los Angeles. There the Americans were murdered, apparently for the little money they had. Their bodies, buried in the sand, were discovered <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two by an American geological survey party and rediscovered a week later by an American mining engineer. The news, however, did not reach Rockwell Field until 13 October. Three days later, a Navy ship, USS Aaron Ward, sailed from San Diego {{with a group of}} Army officers to recover the bodies.|$|E
500|$|Sirenomelia, {{also called}} [...] "mermaid syndrome", {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} disorder in which a child is born {{with his or her}} legs fused together and small genitalia. This condition is about as rare as conjoined twins, affecting one out of every 100,000 live births and is usually fatal <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> two of birth because of kidney and bladder complications. Four survivors were known as of July 2003.|$|E
50|$|Phantom limb {{pain and}} phantom limb sensations are linked, {{but must be}} {{differentiated}} from one another. While phantom limb sensations are experienced by those with congenital limb deficiency, spinal cord injury, and amputation, phantom limb pain occurs almost exclusively {{as a result of}} amputation. Almost immediately following the amputation of a limb, 90-98% of patients report experiencing a phantom sensation. Nearly 75% of individuals experience the phantom as soon as anesthesia wears off, and the remaining 25% of patients experience phantoms <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> weeks. Of those experiencing innocuous sensations, a majority of patients also report distinct painful sensations.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} sources have quoted Maximos V as having said [...] "the Arab League had issued orders exhorting the people to seek a {{temporary}} refuge in neighboring countries." [...] For example, Israel's Abba Eban told the U.N. Special Political Committee in 1957 that Hakim had said: The refugees had been confident that their absence from Palestine would not last long; that they would return <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>within</b> <b>a</b> week or two; their leaders had promised them that the Arab armies would crush the 'Zionist gangs' very quickly and {{that there would be}} no need for panic or fear of a long exile.|$|R
50|$|Caching {{behavior}} is typically {{a way to}} save excess edible food for later consumption - either soon to be eaten food, such as when a jaguar hangs a partially eaten prey in a tree to be eaten <b>within</b> <b>a</b> few <b>days,</b> <b>or</b> long term where the food is hidden and retrieved many months later. Caching is a common adaptation to seasonal changes in food availability. In regions where winters are harsh, food availability typically becomes low, and caching food during the times of high food availability in the warmer months provides a significant survival advantage. This phenomenon is referenced in the fable The Ant and the Grasshopper.|$|R
