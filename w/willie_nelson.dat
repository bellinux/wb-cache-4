5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as <b>Willie</b> <b>Nelson</b> and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics that focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was made}} aware of the new deal, Waylon was not sure if he should quit his gig at JD's.

But Desai won the judges over again the next week, when he sang <b>Willie</b> <b>Nelsons</b> classic country ballad [...] "Always On My Mind" [...] for [...] "Grand Ol Opry Week." [...] Even Cowell was impressed, and retracted his remarks about Desai not deserving to be in the Top 13. Desais rendition of Cyndi Laupers [...] "True Colors" [...] three weeks later, which also garnered praise from the judges, prompted Cowell to compare the contestant to a [...] "yo-yo", going back and forth between good and weak performances.|$|R

He was born on April 29, but his birth was {{recorded}} by doctor F. D. Sims on April 30. He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother. His parents moved from Arkansas in 1929, to look for work.

5|$|Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, George Strait, and <b>Willie</b> <b>Nelson</b> are Black's biggest musical influences. His {{style is}} {{traditional}} country. His voice {{is described as}} a smooth baritone and was initially compared to Merle Haggard. Black was self-taught on harmonica, guitar and bass at an early age. On his studio albums he plays acoustic and electric guitars as well as harmonica. In concert he plays primarily guitar, but does play drums and harmonica. Today, Clint Black is still an inspiration to new, up and coming country artists, as expressed by performers such as Jon Pardi and Aaron Watson.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the songs}} {{included}} on the album are further recorded in a country pop style, including [...] "The Nightingale" [...] and [...] "Lying to the Moon."

In addition, Nelson also contributed his vocals to another track on the album, [...] "Here Comes Temptation." [...] Matraca Bergs [...] "Lying to the Moon" [...] (originally recorded by Berg on her 1990 album of the same name) was considered by McAlley to be, [...] "the hit-bound title track so undeniably sad that songs intended to offer reconciliation and uplift." [...] He further stated that [...] "The Nightingale" [...] and [...] "I Dont Fall In Love So Easy" [...] to also possess what [...] "Lying to the Moon" [...] has, stating they, [...] "buckle under their own ambivalence and the albums cumulative weight." ...|$|R

5|$|<b>Willie</b> Hugh <b>Nelson</b> (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The {{critical}} {{success of}} the album Shotgun Willie (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978), made Nelson {{one of the most}} recognized artists in country music. He {{was one of the main}} figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound.

5|$|Since 2001, Hamar Olympic Amphitreatre {{has hosted}} the annual Idrettsgallaen, a {{television}} show that honors the past year's Norwegian sports and athlete achievements. Hamar was selected to host the event because its main sponsor, the national lottery company Norsk Tipping, has its head office in Hamar. Idrettsgallaen is held in early January, when many of winter sports athletes are home and the summer athletes are off season. In 2010, Idrettsgallaen was hosted in Lillehammer because the weekend crashed with the 2010 European Speed Skating Championships in Vikingskipet and Hamar lacks sufficient hotel capacity to host both simultaneously. Concerts hosted at the arena since the opening concert with Fats Domino on 25 November 1992 include Little Richard in 1993, Vamp in 2005, <b>Willie</b> <b>Nelson</b> in 2008 and José Carreras in 2010.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} part of the 1960s, however, the Nashville sound had become {{perceived}} as too watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Bakersfield sound. A few performers retained popularity, however, such as the long-standing cultural icon Johnny Cash. The Bakersfield sound began in the mid to late 1950s when performers like Wynn Stewart and Buck Owens began using elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, in their music. In the 1960s performers like Merle Haggard popularized the sound. In the early 1970s, Haggard was also part of outlaw country, alongside singer-songwriters such as <b>Willie</b> <b>Nelson</b> and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was rock-oriented and lyrically focused on the criminal antics of the performers, in contrast to the clean-cut country singers of the Nashville sound. By the middle of the 1980s, the country music charts were dominated by pop singers, alongside a nascent revival of honky-tonk-style country with the rise of performers like Dwight Yoakam. The 1980s also saw the development of alternative country performers like Uncle Tupelo, who were opposed to the more pop-oriented style of mainstream country. At the beginning of the 2000s, rock-oriented country acts remained among the best-selling performers in the United States, especially Garth Brooks.|$|E

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, one of their members was a teen-aged David Ruffin, who would later go on to find fame as lead singer of The Temptations.|$|R

Willie informs the group that American military forces were withdrawn from the Middle East to help contain the outbreak, and that there is no Middle East to fight over anymore, as it is completely overrun by vampires. He {{goes on to say that}} The Brotherhood was partially responsible for the fall of America, ramming cars filled with vampires through blockades and crashing airplanes filled with vampires into cities. Overwhelmed as the plague spread across the U.S., the Armed Forces collapsed and no longer exist. The four decide to go after Jebedia, whom they successfully ambush, then tie to a tree and leave for the vampires.|$|R
