50|$|A model {{surface is}} painted with the PSP coating with an {{airbrush}} or automotive type paint gun. The PSP {{consists of an}} oxygen sensitive probe suspended in an oxygen permeable binder. The model is then placed in an oven so the PSP layer can cure. Once cured, the model is placed in a wind tunnel or appropriate test environment. LED lamps of a specific wavelength are used to excite the pressure-sensitive probe within the paint. Once excited, the pressure-sensitive probe is transitioned to a higher energy state where is may either emit a photon or be quenched by local oxygen present. This competing process of emission and quenching determines the intensity response of the paint layer. The result is a dimmer fluorescence where there is higher pressure and brighter response at lower pressures. The intensity emitted from the surface is then recorded through a long-pass filter by a CCD or scientific grade camera and stored for conversion to pressure using a previously determined calibration. Images of the paint layer are recorded at three conditions. A <b>wind-off</b> image at a known reference condition which is typically standard atmospheric conditions with the tunnel turned off. A wind-on image at a loaded condition where the wind tunnel is running at condition. And lastly a background image where the ambient light present is captured without the illumination source. The background image is then subtracted from the <b>wind-off</b> reference and the wind-on condition image in data processing. Photographs of the surface {{can be obtained from}} outside the wind tunnel's test section, which means that the model need never be disturbed or touched in order to obtain the pressure distribution. Computer-aided photography can be used to produce false-color images, where the color range corresponds to the pressure variations.|$|E

The models were geometrically similar but one was 2. 75 times {{as large as the}} other. Deformation measurements were made by simultaneously imaging the upper surfaces of the models from two directions by calibrated cameras that were mounted behind windows of the test section. Bending and twist were measured at discrete points using conventional circular targets that had been marked along the leading and trailing edges of the wings and tails. In addition, continuous distributions of bending and twist were measured from ink speckles that had been applied to the upper surfaces of the model. Measurements were made at wind-on (M = 1. 6) and <b>wind-off</b> conditions over a range of angles of attack between 2. 5 deg. and 5. 0 deg. At each condition, model deformation was determined by comparing the <b>wind-off</b> and wind-on coordinates of each measurement point after transforming the coordinates to reference coordinates tied to the model. The necessary transformations were determined by measuring the positions of a set of targets on the rigid center-body of the models whose model-axes coordinates were known. Smoothly varying bending and twist measurements were obtained at all conditions. Bending displacements increased in proportion to the square of the distance to the centerline. Maximum deflection of the wingtip of the larger model was about 5 mm (2 % of the semispan) and that of the smaller model was 0. 9 mm (1 % of the semispan). The change in wing twist due to bending increased in direct proportion to distance from the centerline and reached a (absolute) maximum of about - 1 at the highest angle of attack for both models.

The objective of the flapping wing investigation is to improve the under- standing of the unsteady aerodynamics of flapping flight. The work con- sists of designing and building a flapping and pitching bird-like mechanical model and testing it in a low speed wind tunnel. The model’s size is sim- ilar to that of a goose. The wind tunnel tests involved the measurement of forces, power, kinematics and local flow velocities using Particle Im- age Velocimetry (PIV). The mechanical model was tested at four different frequencies and three airspeeds. In addition, three different wing profiles were tested. The kinematic modes included pure flapping and combined flapping and pitching. It was shown that pure flapping and pitch-lagging combined motion can lead to interesting aerodynamic phenomena, such as flow separation and dynamic stall. Dynamic stall can cause significant increases in instantaneous lift production, although it also generates a lot of drag. On the contrary, pitch leading combined motion can generate a net propulsive force over the entire cycle. In the stall flutter study, a 6 degree of freedom NACA 0018 wing was sus- pended by springs in the wind tunnel. The wing was then exposed to an airflow at a number of airspeeds and <b>wind-off</b> angles of attack. The wing was instrumented with pressure sensors and accelerometers. In addition, PIV flow measurements were carried out on the wing’s upper surface. The work demonstrates that stall flutter {{is the result of a}} combination of dy- namic stall with the elastic properties of the system. The dynamic stall mechanism was studied using the PIV measurements and was found to be different to the classical stall mechanisms that are reported in the litera- ture.

Sixty test conditions, consisting of combinations of five angles of attack, four dc applied voltages, and three tunnel velocities, were studied in a tabletop wind tunnel. Results indicated that larger magnitudes of applied voltage produced larger wafer displacements. <b>Wind-off</b> displacements were also consistently larger than wind-on. Higher velocities produced larger displacements than lower velocities because of increased upper surface suction. Increased suction also resulted in larger displacements at higher angles of attack. Creep and hysteresis of the wafer, which were identified at each test condition, contributed to larger negative displacements for all negative applied voltages and larger positive displacements for the smaller positive applied voltage (+ 102 V). An elastic membrane used to hold the wafer to the upper surface hindered displacements at the larger positive applied voltage (+ 170 V).

Most earlier approaches for alignment employed an image warping approach prior to ratioing and thereafter the two-dimensional image data was mapped on to three-dimensional model space.

40|$|The current {{pressure}} sensitive paint (PSP) technique assumes a linear relationship (Stern-Volmer Equation) between intensity ratio (I(sub 0) /I) and pressure ratio (P/P(sub 0)) {{over a wide}} range of pressures (vacuum to ambient or higher). Although this may be valid for some PSPs, in most PSPs the relationship is nonlinear, particularly at low pressures (less than 0. 2 psia when the oxygen level is low). This non-linearity can be attributed to variations in the oxygen quenching (de-activation) rates (which otherwise is assumed constant) at these pressures. Other studies suggest that some paints also have non-linear calibrations at high pressures; because of heterogeneous (non-uniform) oxygen diffusion and c quenching. Moreover, {{pressure sensitive}} paints require correction for the output intensity due to light intensity variation, paint coating variation, model dynamics, <b>wind-off</b> reference pressure variation, and temperature sensitivity. Therefore to minimize the measurement uncertainties due to these causes, an in- situ intensity correction method was developed.

These ports were angled outboard 30 deg from the vertical impart of a splay angle to the reverse exhaust flow. This splaying of reverser flow was intended to prevent impingement of exhaust flow on empennage surfaces and to help avoid inlet reingestion of exhaust gas when the reverser is integrated into an actual airplane configuration. External vane boxes were located directly over {{each of the four}} ports to provide variation of reverser efflux angle from 140 deg to 26 deg (measured forward from the horizontal reference axis). The reverser model was tested with both a butterfly-type inner door and an internal slider door to provide area control for each individual port. In addition, main nozzle throat area and vector angle were varied to examine various methods of modulating thrust levels. Other model variables included vane box configuration (four or six vanes per box), orientation of external vane boxes with respect to internal port walls (splay angle shims), and vane box sideplates. Nozzle pressure ratio was varied from 2. 0 approximately 7. 0...|$|E
40|$|The Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel (UPWT) was modernized {{to improve}} performance, capability, productivity, and reliability. Automation systems were {{installed}} {{in all three}} UPWT tunnel legs and the Auxiliaries facility. Major improvements {{were made to the}} four control rooms, model support systems, main drive motors, and main drive speed control. Pressure vessel repairs and refurbishment to the electrical distribution system were also completed. Significant changes were made to improve test section flow quality in the 11 -by 11 -Foot Transonic leg. After the completion of the construction phase of the project, acceptance and checkout testing was performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the modernized facility. A pneumatic test of the tunnel circuit was performed to verify the structural integrity of the pressure vessel before wind-on operations. Test section turbulence, flow angularity, and acoustic parameters were measured throughout the tunnel envelope {{to determine the effects of}} the tunnel flow quality improvements. The new control system processes were thoroughly checked during <b>wind-off</b> and wind-on operations. Manual subsystem modes and automated supervisory modes of tunnel operation were validated. The aerodynamic and structural performance of both the new composite compressor rotor blades and the old aluminum rotor blades was measured. The entire subsonic and supersonic envelope of the 11 -by 11 -Foot Transonic leg was defined up to the maximum total pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{modeling}} of aircraft wing flutter using statically determined aerodynamic derivatives may not accurately represent the actual aeroelastic system. This paper presents an experimental method for estimating the transient aerodynamic derivatives {{relative to the}} airspeed for four 3 D airfoil models. The transient aerodynamic derivatives are used to represent the aerodynamic damping and stiffness in aeroelastic equation of motion to determine the flutter speed of the models. An oscillating dynamic aeroelastic test rig with constraint to pitch motion is developed for the wind tunnel test. A set of wing models with NACA 0010, NACA 0012, NACA 0014 and NACA 0018 airfoils respectively, with a wing span of 0. 36 m and chord of 0. 16 m (i. e. AR= 2. 25) are tested in UTM Low Speed Tunnel with the reduced frequencies range from 0. 04 to 0. 4. From the experiment, the time responses of the wing models during <b>wind-off</b> and wind-on conditions allow the transient aerodynamic damping and stiffness of the wing aeroelastic system to be determined. By varying the stiffness of the mechanical springs attached to the test rig, the effects of dynamically determined aerodynamic damping and stiffness on aircraft wing flutter speed prediction are observed. It is discovered that the aeroelastic equation of motion gives more realistic flutter speed estimation of the models with the inclusion of aerodynamic damping and stiffness {{with respect to the}} airspeed which can not be determined from static test. The differences between the computed wing flutter speeds and the referred wing flutter speeds show that this method gives better estimation of aircraft wing flutter speed for both thin and thick airfoils compared to Theodorsen’s method...|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests have}} been made on a 70 ° Cropped Delta Wing with slot blowing from all edges in {{the plane of the}} wing. The tests include six-component force and moment {{measurements}} and the distribution of pressure at four chordwise stations on the upper surface. Some results are also given with slot blowing from one wing-tip. At a constant incidence blowing increases the size and strength of the leading edge vortices and moves the vortex cores outboard. It also eliminates the secondary separation. Extra non-linear lift is obtained from the increased vortex strength and the lift coefficient at a = 25 o is increased from 0. 98 without blowing to 1, 16 and 1. 25 for C values of 0. 123 and 0. 278 respectively with blowing from all edges. The corresponding movement of the centre of pressure is less than one per cent of the root chord. If allowance is made for the <b>wind-off</b> jet drag due to the poor blowing distribution, the values of drag obtained with blowing at all edges are lower than those for the unblown case at a given lift and the resultant lift-to-drag ratios are much improved. Without blowing the maximum ratio is 6. 5 at a CT of 0. 13 but blowing from all edges with Ca's of 0. 123 and 0. 278 increases-this value to 13. 8 and 18. 7 respectively at approximately the same lift coefficient. At incidence, with blowing at all edges, the jet sheets roll up o form stable leading edge vortices but near zero incidence (a < 0. 25 °) the jet sheets oscillate from one surface to the other, due to a downwash lag effect, producing a sinusoidal lift...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{estimation}} of transient aerodynamic data from dynamic wind tunnel tests has been developed and employed {{in the study of}} the unsteady response of simple automotive type bodies. The experimental setup consists of the test model mounted to the oscillating model facility such that it is constrained to oscillate with a single degree of freedom of pure yawing motion. The yaw position is recorded from a potentiometer and the time response provides the primary measurement. Analysis of the <b>wind-off</b> and wind-on response allows the transient aerodynamic loads to be estimated. The frequency of oscillation, (synonymous with the frequency of disturbing wind input) is modified by altering the mechanical stiffness of the facility. The effects of Reynolds number and oscillation frequency are considered and the model is shown to exhibit damped, self-sustained and self-excited behaviour. The transient results are compared with a quasi-steady prediction based on conventional tunnel balance data and presented in the form of aerodynamic magnification factor. The facility and analysis techniques employed are presented and the results of a parametric study of model rear slant angle and of the influence of C-pillar strakes is reported. The results are strongly dependent on shape but for almost all rear slant angles tested the results show that the transient response exceeds that predicted from steady state data. The level of unsteadiness is also significantly influenced by the rear slant angles. The addition of C-pillar strakes is shown to stabilise the flow with even small strakes yielding responses below that of steady state. From the simulation results the self-sustained oscillation is shown to occur when the aerodynamic damping cancels the mechanical damping. The unsteadiness in the oscillation can be simulated by adding band-limited white noise with an intensity close to that of the turbulence intensity found in the wake. From vehicle crosswind simulation results the aerodynamic yaw moment derivative and its magnification factor are shown to be the important parameters influencing the crosswind sensitivity and path deviation.

40|$|Registration of {{test and}} {{reference}} images {{is a key}} component of nearly all PSP data reduction techniques. This is done to ensure that a test image pixel viewing a particular point on the model is ratioed by the reference image pixel which views the same point. Typically registration is needed to account for model motion due to differing airloads when the <b>wind-off</b> and wind-on images are taken. Registration is also necessary when two cameras are used for simultaneous acquisition of data from a dual-frequency paint. This presentation will discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} several different image registration techniques. In order to do so, it is necessary to propose both an accuracy requirement for image registration and a means for measuring the accuracy of a particular technique. High contrast regions in the unregistered images are most sensitive to registration errors, and it is proposed that these regions be used to establish the error limits for registration. Once this is done, the actual registration error can be determined by locating corresponding points on the test and reference images, and determining how well a particular registration technique matches them. An example of this procedure is shown for three transforms used to register images of a semispan model. Thirty control points were located on the model. A subset of the points were used to determine the coefficients of each registration transform, and the error with which each transform aligned the remaining points was determined. The results indicate the general superiority of a third-order polynomial over other candidate transforms, as well as showing how registration accuracy varies with number of control points. Finally, it is proposed that image registration may eventually be done away with completely. As more accurate image resection techniques and more detailed model surface grids become available, it will be possible to map raw image data onto the model surface accurately. Intensity ratio data can then be obtained by a "model surface ratio," rather than an image ratio. The problems and advantages of this technique will be discussed...|$|E
