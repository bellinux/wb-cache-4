25|$|A <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> is a {{mechanical}} device that extracts milk from the breasts of a lactating woman. <b>Breast</b> <b>pumps</b> may be manual devices powered by hand or foot movements or electrical devices powered by mains electricity or batteries. The first <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> was patented by O.H. Needham on June 20, 1854.|$|R
25|$|Mechanically, a <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> is {{analogous}} to a milking machine used in commercial dairy production. A misconception is that the <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> suctions milk out of the <b>breast.</b> A <b>breast</b> <b>pump's</b> job is to trigger the milk ejection response or letdown. Pumps achieve this by using suction to pull the nipple into the tunnel of the breast shield or flange, then release, which counts as one cycle. Thirty to sixty cycles per minute can be expected with better-quality electric <b>breast</b> <b>pumps.</b> The <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> is not as efficient at removing milk from the breast as most nursing babies. Most manufacturers have multiple sizes of nipple tunnels available. These tunnels {{range in size from}} 24mm to 36mm.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} design and {{development}} of a manual <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> with an ergonomic approach. This project is the further study of the previous project which is the preliminary design of the manual <b>breast</b> <b>pump.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to prevent the musculoskeletal disorder problems among mothers who expressed the breast milk using manual <b>breast</b> <b>pump.</b> The objectives of this study is to design a manual <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> with ergonomics approach using Solidworks, to make a prototype of the designed manual <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> using Rapid Prototyping machine and to validate the designed manual <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> using simulation process and manual calculation. The scope of this project is that the developed manual <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> is only a prototype and is not readily functional as a commercial product. While the validations of the manual <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> through the simulation software is considered precise. The strategy of validation of finite element analysis was developed for this project. The finite element analysis was then performed using ALGOR and the bottle part of the design was analyzed using the static stress with linear material model. The other part of the design which is the pressure pump was also manually calculated. The obtained results indicate that the maximum value of the result shows in the bottom of the bottle due to the surface boundary condition. The manual calculation of the pressure pump shows that the design just can produce the maximum pressure of about 4, 000 Pa. While a good manual <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> should produce at least about 2, 000 Pa. However the area is not suitable to be reducing in a great number due to the ergonomics condition...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{breastfeeding}} {{rates would}} improve maternal and child health, but multiple barriers to breastfeeding persist. <b>Breast</b> <b>pump</b> provision {{has been used}} as an incentive for breastfeeding, although effectiveness is unclear. Women’s use of <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> is increasing and a high proportion of mothers express breastmilk. No research has yet reported women’s and health professionals’ perspectives on <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> as an incentive for breastfeeding. In the Benefits of Incentives for Breastfeeding and Smoking cessation in pregnancy (BIBS) study, mixed methods research explored women’s and professionals’ views of <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> as an incentive for breastfeeding. A survey of health professionals across Scotland and North West England measured agreement with ‘a <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> costing around £ 40 provided for free on the NHS’ as an incentive strategy. Qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted in two UK regions with a total of 68 participants (pregnant women, new mothers, and their significant others and health professionals) and thematic analysis undertaken. The survey of 497 health professionals found net agreement of 67. 8 %(337 / 497) with the <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> incentive strategy, with no predictors of agreement shown by a multiple ordered logistic regression model. Qualitative research found interrelated themes of the ‘appeal and value of breast pumps’, ‘sharing the load’, ‘perceived benefits’, ‘perceived risks’ and issues related to ‘timing’. Qualitative participants expressed mixed views on the acceptability of <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> as an incentive for breastfeeding. Understanding the mechanisms of action for pump type, timing and additional support required for effectiveness is required to underpin trials of <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> provision as an incentive for improving breastfeeding outcomes...|$|R

30|$|While {{this young}} woman’s {{experiences}} in breastfeeding were particularly difficult, and her {{level of commitment}} is particularly deep, elements of her story appeared in many other women’s accounts. For example, numerous women we interviewed had relied entirely upon <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> to supply their babies with breast milk, often because they struggled to get their newborns to nurse properly, using the pump to zhui nai (literally, to “pursue milk”), to bring in and maintain their milk supply. Zhang Fei (interviewee 9 a), described {{at the beginning of}} the paper, had given birth to her baby prematurely, at 33  weeks gestation, and so, she had used a <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> to bring in her milk supply. She was still <b>pumping</b> <b>breast</b> milk when her baby was 11  months old, though she was gradually shifting to infant formula. Wang Ping (interviewee 8 a) struggled to nurse her baby after a C-section, despite ample milk supply and the use of a lactation consultant (kai nai shi), relying in the end upon a <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> for many months. Although many of these physical challenges associated with breastfeeding were reported in Gottschang’s (2007) research among urban mothers in the 1990 s, the reliance upon <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> is entirely new (see Blum 1999 on the rise of the <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> in the USA).|$|R

2500|$|Women use <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> {{for many}} reasons. Many women use <b>breast</b> <b>pumps</b> to {{continue}} breastfeeding after {{they return to}} work. They use the <b>pump</b> to express <b>breast</b> milk, which is later bottle fed to their child by a caregiver. A <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> may {{also be used to}} stimulate lactation for women with a low milk supply or those who have not just given birth. However, {{it is important to note}} that the amount of milk a woman is able to pump should not be compared to how much milk a baby can get; efficiency greatly varies. A <b>breast</b> <b>pump</b> may be used to relieve engorgement, a painful condition whereby the breasts are overfull, possibly preventing a proper latch by the infant. A mother may also choose to pump exclusively if her baby does not latch properly, is hospitalized after birth, or cannot nurse for physical reasons (such as cleft palate). If the mother needs to take medication that affects the breast milk and may be harmful to the infant, which is a very rare instance, the mother may [...] "pump and dump" [...] the breast milk to keep up her milk supply during the time period that she is on the medication and may resume nursing after the course of medication is completed. Pumping may be desirable to continue lactation and its associated hormones to aid in recovery from pregnancy even if the pumped milk is not used.|$|R
