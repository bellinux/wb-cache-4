5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E

In one interview with NME in October 1981 he told the paper, [...] "The politics have moved from an essentialist and reductionist position in which we believed in a history of science which could {{make sense of the}} future to one that realized that what you've got is needs, demands, and desires, and you go out and you fight for them. Which means that your music will at points be indexed fairly clearly to Politics with a big 'P' and at other points will cut across it completely." [...] In another interview with The Face the following year Gartside said, [...] "My loss has been political conviction, the idea of a correct understanding of the past, present and future (Marxism). I've always been obsessively concerned that my understanding of political truth should be scientifically grounded. Many songs [...] are about <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> anchor points of political, moral or religious understanding fall away."

2500|$|Bryant Frazer of Studio Daily {{wrote that}} Godard breaks the {{conventional}} [...] "rules" [...] of 3D in five ways: [...] "he does not keep a clean frame" [...] in his screen compositions, [...] "he embraces low-quality cameras", [...] "he gravitates toward deep focus" [...] cinematography, [...] "he rips the 3D image apart and then restores it {{in a single}} shot" [...] and [...] "he uses stereo to elevate the mundane" [...] instead of spectacular subjects like superhero or fantasy films. Frazer said that Godard [...] "wants to experiment with the technology, draw attention to it, test its boundaries, and see <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> image falls apart completely." [...] Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote that [...] "rather than using 3-D as an effect to create a sensation of flight or to make a viewer feel like the target of propelled objects, Godard uses 3-D to emphasize the materiality, the physical properties, of the world at hand." [...] Bordwell said that, other than [...] "to awe us with special effects", 3D's purposes are typically to be realistic in its enhancement of the depth of objects and [...] "advancing {{our understanding of the}} story", which is usually achieved with only one part of the screen in 3D while the rest is out of focus and in 2D. In Goodbye to Language Godard uses 3D in deep focus shots with images that allow the audience to scan the entire frame. Bordwell wrote that Godard's use of 3D [...] "is aiming to make us perceive the world stripped of our conceptual constructs (language, plot, normal viewpoints, and so on)." ...|$|E
