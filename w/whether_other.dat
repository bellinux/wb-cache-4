5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{documented}} cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a sharklet on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the sharklets had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is <b>whether</b> <b>other</b> species have this capability. Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the tenets}} of {{population}} genetics since its inception has been that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the species level and above) was solely {{the result of the}} mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating {{over an extended period of}} time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about <b>whether</b> <b>other</b> factors, such as punctuated equilibrium and group selection operating on the level of entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between the environment and the developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution.|$|E
5|$|Once {{satisfied}} with his reorganisation of Thessaly, Philip marched south to the pass of Thermopylae, the gateway to central Greece. He probably intended to follow up his victory over the Phocians by invading Phocis itself, a prospect which greatly alarmed the Athenians, since once he had passed Thermopylae, he could also march on Athens. The Athenians therefore dispatched a force to Thermopylae and occupied the pass; there is some debate as to <b>whether</b> <b>other</b> contingents may have joined the Athenians at Thermopylae. The Athenians were certainly there, since the Athenian orator Demosthenes celebrated the defence of the pass {{in one of his}} speeches. Cawkwell suggests that the Athenian force was the one that Diodorus says was dispatched under Nausicles consisting of 5000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and that they were joined by the remnants of the Phocians and the Pheraean mercenaries. However, Buckler argues that Diodorus never mentions Thermopylae, and the force under Nausicles was sent to help the Phocians the following year; instead, he believes that another Athenian force held the pass unassisted. Although it might have proved possible to force the pass, Philip did not attempt to do so, preferring not to risk a defeat after his great successes in Thessaly.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the leading}} {{theories}} {{for the cause of}} the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that included the dinosaurs is a large meteorite impact.

Ptolemy mentioned the catalogue in connection with Hipparchus' discovery of precession.

25|$|The {{nature of}} the case led to accusations that coaches and school {{officials}} knew about the rape and failed to report it. For example, several texts entered into evidence during the trial implied that Steubenville head coach Reno Saccoccia was trying to cover for the players, which led to nationwide outrage after he received a new contract as the district's administrative services director. In response, shortly after the sentences were handed down Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced he would empanel a special grand jury to determine <b>whether</b> <b>other</b> crimes were committed—specifically, whether coaches and other school officials failed to report the rape even though Ohio law makes them mandated reporters.|$|E

25|$|In 1883 {{the most}} {{prominent}} trustee, Sheridan, regarding the ground as {{the responsibility of the}} trustees, began to act independently of the NSWCA, resulting in the NSWCA losing control of the ground.

One conflict in 1904, over the Trust's plan to hold a cycling event which clashed with a cricket match, ended up in court.

25|$|The {{other form}} of {{activity}} during sleep is reactivation. Some electrophysiological {{studies have shown that}} neuronal activity patterns found during a learning task before sleep are reactivated in the brain during sleep. This, along with the coincidence of active areas with areas responsible for memory have led to the theory that sleep might have some memory consolidation functions. In this relation, some studies have shown that after a sequential motor task, the pre-motor and visual cortex areas involved are most active during REM sleep, but not during NREM. Similarly, the hippocampal areas involved in spatial learning tasks are reactivated in NREM sleep, but not in REM. Such studies suggest a role of sleep in consolidation of specific memory types. It is, however, still unclear <b>whether</b> <b>other</b> types of memory are also consolidated by these mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|The northernmost {{subspecies}} C. c. bromia is migratory, {{subject to}} necessity. It may withdraw several hundred kilometres {{south in the}} northernmost parts of its range. Thousands of blue jays have been observed to migrate in flocks along the Great Lakes and Atlantic coasts. It migrates during the daytime, in loose flocks of 5 to 250 birds. Much about their migratory behavior remains a mystery. Some are present throughout winter {{in all parts of}} their range. Young jays {{may be more likely to}} migrate than adults, but many adults also migrate. Some individual jays migrate south one year, stay north the next winter, and then migrate south again the next year. To date, no one has concretely worked out why they migrate when they do. Likely, it is related to weather conditions and how abundant the winter food sources are, which can determine <b>whether</b> <b>other</b> northern birds will move south.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{there is}} debate {{as to whether}} {{outlying}} neighborhoods of Jerusalem are obliged to observe Purim on the 14th or 15th of Adar. Further doubts have arisen as to <b>whether</b> <b>other</b> cities were sufficiently walled in Joshua's era. It is therefore customary in certain towns including Hebron, Safed, Tiberias, Acre, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Beersheva, Beit She'an, Beit Shemesh, Gaza, Gush Halav, Haifa, Jaffa, Lod, Ramlah and Shechem to celebrate Purim on the 14th and hold an additional megillah reading on the 15th with no blessings. In the diaspora, Jews in Baghdad, Damascus, Prague, and elsewhere celebrate Purim on the 14th and hold an additional megillah reading on the 15th with no blessings. Since today we are not sure where the walled cities from Joshua's time are, the only city that currently celebrates only Shushan Purim is Jerusalem; however, Rabbi Yoel Elizur has written that residents of Bet El and Mevo Choron should observe only the 15th, like Jerusalem.|$|E
