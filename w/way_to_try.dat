5|$|In 1996, {{cannabis}} was legalized in California for {{the aid of}} {{chronically ill}} residents. The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 allowed people to have and use cannabis but only when prescribed by a doctor/physician. Cannabis was prescribed to people who had trouble with cancer, AIDS, and other medical inflictions such as glaucoma. It was implemented as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and help those who needed cannabis for their medical illnesses to find a source and safe way to use the drug. However, this did not protect patients with medical cards to redistribute any of the cannabis they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E
5|$|At first, the laborers {{walked the}} seven {{kilometers}} from Auschwitz I {{to the plant}} each day, but as this meant they had to rise at 03:00, many arrived exhausted and unable to work. The camp at Monowitz (also called Monowitz-Buna or Auschwitz III) was constructed and began housing inmates on 30 October 1942, the first concentration camp to be financed and built by private industry. In January 1943 the ArbeitsausbildungLager (labor education camp) was moved from the parent camp to Monowitz. These prisoners were also forced {{to work on the}} building site. The SS charged IG Farben three Reichsmarks per hour for unskilled workers, four for skilled workers. Although the camp administrators expected the prisoners to work at 75 percent of the capacity of a free worker, the inmates were only able to perform 20 to 50 percent as well. Site managers constantly threatened inmates with transportation to Birkenau for death in the gas chambers as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to increase productivity. Deaths and transfers to the gas chambers at Birkenau reduced the prisoner population of Monowitz by nearly a fifth each month; numbers were made up with new arrivals. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. Though the factory had been expected to begin production in 1943, shortages of labor and raw materials meant start-up had to be postponed repeatedly. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Podemos' {{referendum}} among {{party members}} aroused interest {{as it was}} seen as critical for any PSOE-led government to be formed before the 2 May deadline. Party leaders expected to use the vote as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to pressure the PSOE into {{coming to terms with}} them, but the unexpectedly high turnout in the 14–16 April period attracted media attention as it exceeded the one obtained in the 27 February PSOE referendum and even Podemos' turnout records in similar internal votes.

25|$|When {{the crisis}} loomed, one <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to avert {{it was to}} simply start {{reducing}} the interest paid on discretionary and demand deposits.

The fact that it {{seems to have been a}} common practice for Florentine banks to operate with as little as 5% of their deposits held in reserve lends further support to the idea that collapses could happen abruptly when bad loans were discovered. In addition to all of that, Lorenzo the Magnificent was not at all concerned about the bank. Instead, he chose to concentrate his time and his family's resources on patronizing artists and pursuing his own poetic and political interests.|$|E

In 2009, a new Belle and a new Beast were cast, Lissah Martins and Ricardo Vieira, as the musical came back to Brazil, Kiara Sasso was playing Maria in The Sound of Music. Beauty and the Beast remained for six months at Teatro Abril.

In the end after a surprising turn of events Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) and Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) get married. In the final moments the series speeds forward five years later where Chuck and Blair are revealed to have had a child and Nate Archibald appears successful and is rumored to be running for Mayor of New York. The show ends with the wedding of Serena van der Woodsen and Dan Humphrey. It's a small ceremony, in what looks like Blair and Chuck's home together, where Lily is with Serena and Eric's father, William, and Rufus seems to be happy with another woman (musician Lisa Loeb, who guest-starred in the first season) along with Dorota, Nate, Jack Bass and Georgina (who are now together), Jenny and Eric.

500|$|While {{the first}} five seasons of the series were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, {{production}} of the show's sixth season was based in Los Angeles, California. The scenes {{taking place in the}} hangar were filmed at the Marine Corps Air Station Tustin in Tustin, California. The hangar, constructed in 1942 as an airship base, {{is one of the largest}} all-wooden hangars in the United States. Bill Roe, director of photography, and Rob Bowman were tasked with lighting the entire structure for the episode's teaser and climax, a job that Spotnitz later called [...] "amazing". He noted that, after the series' move to Los Angeles, production costs had risen, forcing the show to cut down on its [...] "astonishing production values". However, he applauded the use of the hangar, noting that it [...] "was a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and create that cinematic scale and still keep [...] affordable". The episode also revisits trains as a setting, something that had previously been done in the third season episodes [...] "731" [...] and [...] "Nisei". However, for budgetary reasons, the scenes taking place on the trains did not take up much screen time. To give the effect that the train carrying Cassandra Spender is moving at a high speed, Manners utilized [...] "sound effects, music, clever camera angles and quick cutting". In reality, the train was never moving faster than eight miles an hour.|$|E

2500|$|The Japanese {{went out}} of their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to ensure that Manchukuo was the {{embodiment}} of modernity in all of its aspects as Manchukuo was intended to prove to the world what the Asian peoples could accomplish if they worked together. Manchukuo's legal system was based upon the Organic Law of 1932, which featured a 12 article Human Rights Protection Law and a supposedly independent judiciary to enforce the law. The official ideology of Manchukuo was the wangdao ("Kingly Way") devised by a former mandarin under the Qing turned Prime Minister of Manchukuo Zheng Xiaoxu calling for an ordered Confucian society that would promote justice and harmony that was billed at the time as {{the beginning of a new}} era in world history. The purpose of the law in Manchukuo was not the protection of the rights of the individual as the wangdao ideology was expressly hostile towards individualism, which was seen as a decadent Western concept inimical to Asia, but rather the interests of the state by ensuring that subjects fulfilled their duties to the emperor. The wangdao favored the collective over the individual, as the wangdao called for all people to put the needs of society ahead of their own needs. Zheng together with the Japanese legal scholar Ishiwara Kanji in a joint statement attacked the Western legal tradition for promoting individualism, which they claimed led to selfishness, greed and materialism, and argued that the wangdao with its disregard for the individual was a morally superior system. The seemingly idealistic Human Rights Protection Law counterbalanced the [...] "rights" [...] of the subjects with their [...] "responsibilities" [...] to the state with a greater emphasis on the latter, just as was the case in Japan. The wangdao promoted Confucian morality and spirituality, which was seen as coming down from the Emperor Puyi, and as such the legal system existed to serve the needs of the state headed by Emperor Puyi, who could change the laws as he saw fit. In this regard it is noteworthy that Legislative Yuan had only the power of assisting the Emperor with making laws, being endowed with far less powers than even the Imperial Diet in Japan had, which had the power to reject or approve laws. It was often suggested at the time that the Legislative Yuan of Manchukuo was a model for the Imperial Diet in Japan, an idea the Showā Emperor was sympathetic to, but never took up. The Showa Emperor in the end preferred the Meiji constitution passed by his grandfather in 1889 as it gave the Emperor of Japan ultimate power while at the same time the fiction of the Imperial Diet together with a Prime Minister and his cabinet governing Japan gave the Emperor a scapegoat when things went wrong.|$|E
2500|$|Sons and Daughters {{was created}} by Reg Watson who was {{inspired}} by glossy primetime soaps Dallas and Dynasty which were averaging huge ratings in their respective time slots on CBS and ABC and was curious to see how an Australian half hour soap similar in style to those shows would fair with early evening or primetime audiences. The show was an instant hit and with writers for the show being able to place one or more families and other characters in either Sydney or Melbourne, they knew the show would appeal to viewers living in those cities. Reg Watson knew Melbourne based shows often didn't rate well with Sydney viewers, and set about using either Sydney or Melbourne as the birth place {{for much of the}} shows cast of characters. Sons and Daughters even used some former plot lines from Dallas or Dynasty to gain high viewership figures for the shows timeslot. Critics and press likened the serial as an Australian version of Latin American or South American telenovelas which would often hit huge viewership figures in their home country. British television broadcaster ITV would soon begin airing the show and audiences in the United Kingdom and other European territories would begin to become fans of the show. Most European and foreign countries that aired the show broadcast it in daytime. Ratings for the show would be very high for the first three years, but following the departure of Rowena Wallace in early 1985 to pursue other acting opportunities, ratings quickly began to decline, and a wacky and rather dull idea was put in play for Wallace's character Patricia Hamilton to return to the soap played by another actress. In mid-1985, new actress to the show Belinda Giblin arrived as Alison Carr, the new identity of Patricia, who had in a storyline featured on the show had plastic surgery in Rio De Janeiro to escape from authorities who were looking for her in Australia for crimes about killing a wealthy millionaire's son named Luke Carlyle, and used this new identity to regain entry into Australia and with an instant boost to viewership figures watching the storyline the show was deemed to be saved from cancellation. However, when Rowena Wallace returned to the show in its final two years, ratings began to slide and after six successful years the show ended in 1988 and would be replaced with new half hour soap Home and Away, created by former writer on Sons and Daughters Beven Lee. Sons and Daughters is best remembered for its over the top storylines and dramatic and often hilarious cliffhangers. One such cliffhanger featured Alison Carr being bitten by a venomous snake, which had been hidden in a wall safe that Alison broke into to steal money from villainous Wayne Hamilton played by Ian Rawlings. Though the snake used, a python would have a non lethal bite, that storyline featuring the infamous snake cliffhanger was often credited as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and increase ratings for the show. Another rather dull storyline featured a bomb being hidden in the bottom of wheelchair that killed off a character in the show when it exploded. The show has gained a cult following and has been repeated more than once in both Australian and international territories.|$|E
