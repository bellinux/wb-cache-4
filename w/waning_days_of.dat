5|$|In 1934, {{when the}} Crown {{prosecutor}} for Prince Albert resigned {{to become the}} Conservative Party's legislative candidate, Diefenbaker took his place as prosecutor. Diefenbaker did not stand in the 1934 provincial election, in which the governing Conservatives lost every seat. Six days after the election, Diefenbaker resigned as Crown prosecutor. The federal government of Bennett was defeated the following year and Mackenzie King returned as Prime Minister. Judging his prospects hopeless, Diefenbaker had declined a nomination to stand again against Mackenzie King in Prince Albert. In the <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Bennett government, the Saskatchewan Conservative Party President was appointed a judge, leaving Diefenbaker, who had been elected the party's vice president, as acting president of the provincial party.|$|E

40|$|Postweaning {{guinea pigs}} housed {{with their mother}} and littermates since birth vocalized more and {{exhibited}} greater increases in plasma cortisol levels when placed for 1 hr into a novel test cage alone than they did when tested in the identical fashion with the mother present.

When tested with a familiar sibling cagemate, postweaning guinea pigs emitted fewer vocalizations than when tested alone but exhibited no less of an elevation of plasma cortisol levels. These results were obtained {{regardless of whether the}} subjects had been housed with mother and littermates from birth until the time of testing or with mother and littermates until weaning and then just the single sibling cagemate until the time of testing. The present findings closely approximate those seen in preweaning guinea pigs during tests of maternal and sibling separation, and indicate that guinea pigs can continue to exhibit a specific attachment to the mother beyond the time of weaning. © 1995 John Wiley 2 ̆ 6 Sons, Inc...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} swine hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection on pregnant gilts, their fetuses, and offspring, 12 gilts were intravenously inoculated with swine HEV. Six gilts, who were not inoculated, served as controls. All inoculated gilts became actively infected and shed HEV in feces, but vertical transmission was not detected in the fetuses. There was no evidence of clinical disease in the gilts or their offspring. Mild multifocal lymphohistiocytic hepatitis was observed in 4 of 12 inoculated gilts. There was no significant effect of swine HEV on fetal size, fetal viability, or offspring birth weight or weight gain. The offspring acquired anti-HEV colostral antibodies but remained seronegative after the antibodies <b>waned</b> by 71 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> age. Swine HEV infection induced subclinical hepatitis in pregnant gilts, but had no effect on the gilts' reproductive performance, or the fetuses or offspring.

25|$|When he {{was elected}} by the ministers to succeed King Thado Minbya, Swa took over a small kingdom barely three years old, and one that still faced several {{external}} and internal threats. In the north, he successfully fought off the Maw raids into Upper Burma, a longstanding problem since the <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Sagaing and Pinya kingdoms. He maintained friendly relations with Lan Na in the east, and Arakan in the west, placing his nominees on the Arakense throne between 1373 and 1385. In the south, he brought semi-independent kingdoms of Toungoo (Taungoo) and Prome (Pyay) firmly into Ava's orbit.

25|$|Then {{there was}} the debate within the Nader {{campaign}} over where to travel in the <b>waning</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the campaign.

But, Martin writes, Nader – who emerges from this account as the house radical of his own campaign – insisted on spending {{the final days of}} the campaign on a whirlwind tour of battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Florida. In other words, he chose to go where the votes were scarcest, jeopardizing his own chances of winning 5 percent of the vote, which he needed to gain federal funds in 2004.|$|E

Through the late autumn and the early winter every road and country lane resounded with nakir and trumpet, with the neigh of the war-horse and the clatter of marching men. From the Wrekin in the Welsh marches to the Cotswolds in the west or Butser in the south, there was no hill-top from which the peasant might not have seen the bright shimmer of arms, the toss and flutter of plume and of pensil. From bye-path, from {{woodland}} clearing, or from winding moor-side track these little rivulets of steel united in the larger roads to form a broader stream, growing ever fuller and larger as it approached the nearest or most commodious seaport. And there all day, and day after day, there was bustle and crowding and labor, while the great ships loaded up, and {{one after the other}} spread their white pinions and darted off to the open sea, amid the clash of cymbals and rolling of drums and lusty shouts of those who went and of those who waited.

40|$|Integrating lentiviral vectors {{based on}} the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) can transduce quiescent cells, which in lung account for almost 95 % of the epithelial cell population. Pseudotyping lentiviral vectors with the envelope glycoprotein from the Ebola Zaire virus, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), the Mokola virus, and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) resulted in transduction of mouse alveolar epithelium, but gene expression in the lung of C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c mice <b>waned</b> within 90 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> vector injection. Intratracheal delivery of the four pseudotyped lentiviral vectors resulted in transgene-specific T-cell activation in both mouse strains, albeit lower than that achieved by intramuscular injection of the vectors. We performed an adoptive transfer of luciferase-specific T cells, isolated from spleen or lung of donor mice injected with VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus vector expressing luciferase into the muscle or lung, respectively, into recipient recombination-activating gene (RAG) –deficient mice transduced in lung with adenovirus expressing firefly luciferase (ffluc 2). Gene expression declined within 7 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> adoptive transfer approaching background levels by day 36.
