50|$|The Beck Cabin is a 1-1/2 story peeled {{log cabin}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>screened</b> porch <b>across</b> the side facing the lake under the {{extended}} front gable. It was expanded by framed additions in 1965 and 1975. The interior {{consists of a}} main room facing the lake <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sleeping loft above along the back wall. The kitchen is at the back. The additions contain bedrooms.|$|R
50|$|The {{new house}} was a five-by-five bay block, of three storeys, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> semicircular bow on the {{entrance}} front and a platband above the first-floor windows. It was built of rubble stone with crude ashlar quoins and window surrounds, and was probably stuccoed until the mid-19th century. The original internal arrangement consisted of a D-shaped entrance hall behind the bow, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small staircase hall behind and a large rectangular room to either side. That on the south was <b>a</b> dining room <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> of columns <b>across</b> one end; that to the north a drawing room. Across {{the back of the}} house were the library, service stairs and Thomas Master's dressing room.|$|R
50|$|The Stationmaster's House is a {{historic}} house on Jaquith Road in Harrisville, New Hampshire. This vernacular 1-1/2 story wood frame house was built in 1896, and is noted {{as one of the}} few surviving buildings in Harrisville associated with the operation of the railroad. The house is located in a pine grove, just east of the former railroad right-of-way. It consists of a main three-bay section with side-gable roof, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shed-roofed <b>screened</b> porch <b>across</b> the front, which is supported by turned posts. A gable-roofed ell extends at a right angle to the rear of the main block. Notable in the building's construction are its lack of a proper foundation and mismatched windows.|$|R
2500|$|As {{previously}} {{mentioned in the}} 1950s–1960s section, during 1958–1961, the distance from home plate to the left field foul pole was [...] <b>with</b> <b>a</b> [...] <b>screen</b> running <b>across</b> the close part of left field. Due to the intervening addition of another section of seating rimming the field, the 2008 grounds crew had much less space to work with, {{and the result was}} a left field foul line only , <b>with</b> <b>a</b> [...] <b>screen,</b> which one Boston writer dubbed the [...] "Screen Monster". Even at that distance, 201 feet is also [...] short of the minimum legal home-run distance. This being an exhibition game, balls hit over the [...] temporary screen were still counted as home runs. There were only a couple of home runs over the screen, as pitchers adjusted (and Manny Ramirez did not play).|$|R
40|$|SNL- 9 (permitted by the State Engineer as C- 2950) was drilled {{to provide}} {{geological}} data and hydrological {{testing of the}} Culebra Dolomite Member of the Permian Rustler Formation within a proposed re-entrant of the margin of halite dissolved from {{the upper part of}} the Salado near Livingston Ridge. SNL- 9 is located in the southeast quarter of section 23, T 22 S, R 30 E, in eastern Eddy County, New Mexico. SNL- 9 was drilled to a total depth of 845 ft below the ground surface. Below surface dune sand and the Berino soil, SNL- 9 encountered, in order, the Mescalero caliche, Gatuna, Dewey Lake, Rustler, and uppermost Salado Formations. Two intervals were cored: 1) from the lower Forty-niner Member through the Magenta Dolomite and into the upper Tamarisk Member; and 2) from the lower Tamarisk Member through the Culebra Dolomite and Los Meda?os Members and into the uppermost Salado Formation. Geophysical logs were acquired from the open hole to total depth, and the drillhole was successfully completed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>screened</b> interval open <b>across</b> the Culebra...|$|R
40|$|SNL- 12 (permitted by the New Mexico State Engineer as C- 2954) was drilled {{to provide}} {{geological}} data and hydrological {{testing of the}} Culebra Dolomite Member of the Permian Rustler Formation near the margin of dissolution of halite in {{the upper part of}} the Salado south of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). SNL- 12 is located in the southeast quarter of section 20, T 23 S, R 31 E, in eastern Eddy County, New Mexico. SNL- 12 was drilled to a total depth of 905 ft below the ground level. Below surface dune sand and the Berino soil, SNL- 12 encountered, in order, the Mescalero caliche, Gatu?a, Dewey Lake, Rustler, and uppermost Salado Formations. Two intervals were cored: (1) from the lower Forty-niner Member through the Magenta Dolomite and into the upper Tamarisk Member; and (2) from the lower Tamarisk Member through the Culebra Dolomite and Los Meda?os Members and into the uppermost Salado Formation. Geophysical logs were acquired from the open hole to total depth, and the drillhole was successfully completed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>screened</b> interval open <b>across</b> the Culebra. At SNL- 12, the uppermost Salado cores display displacive halite crystals in clastic-rich units below an amalgamated sulfate at the top of the formation. There is no indication of thinning of the upper Salado due to postdepositional dissolution, and this is consistent with predrilling expectations...|$|R

25|$|Of the façade by Alessandro Galilei (1735), the cliché {{assessment}} {{has ever}} been {{that it is the}} façade of a palace, not of a church. Galilei's front, which is <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> <b>across</b> the older front creating a narthex or vestibule, does express the nave and double aisles of the archbasilica, which required a central bay wider {{than the rest of the}} sequence. Galilei provided it, without abandoning the range of identical arch-headed openings, by extending the central window by flanking columns that support the arch, in the familiar Serlian motif.|$|R

50|$|Humanity {{is thrown}} into disarray. In order to {{capitalize}} on Luo Ji's popularity with the masses as a messiah, his Wallfacer status is restored, which calms people down. Forced by the successor of the UN to work for them, as he refuses to come up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plan by himself, Luo Ji is given a project to track the other probes that will shortly enter the solar system. Project Snow is intended to create <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> <b>across</b> the solar system, which when crossed will reveal the trajectories of incoming probes. Luo Ji quickly realizes the futility of this project, but continues work anyway. He throws himself into the project, but it fails to reach its intended scope—only {{a third of the}} bombs necessary for the screen are created.|$|R

5000|$|Construction of {{the villa}} {{was under way}} by September 1553, and it was {{complete}} in 1555. The central block is <b>an</b> uncompromising rectangle, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pedimented tetrastyle portico, Ionic over Doric, that has been sunk into its wall-plane so that the columns are embedded half-columns. On the garden front, the similar structure instead forms <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> <b>across</b> the fronts of a recessed portico surmounted by a loggia, which become in single recessed central feature. The Doric frieze runs uninterrupted round the building, further binding all elements together. There are no surviving autograph drawings related to this project. However, Palladio published {{a version of the}} building in his I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura.

At the west end of the church is a pointed window over which is a plain arched bellcote. In the chancel there are paired lancet windows on the sides, and a two-light east window. Attached to the walls of the church are 18th-century headstones. Inside the chancel are a 19th-century credence table and a piscina. On the walls are memorial tablets. The fittings date from the 19th century and these include <b>a</b> <b>screen</b> <b>across</b> the north transept. In the vestry is a small 18th-century fireplace.
