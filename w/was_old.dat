5|$|Abbey of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) was {{designed}} in 1878 by J.E. Gnudtzmann in the Neo-Romanesque style. The original Church of Our Lady {{from the early}} 12th century was pulled down after the Reformation because it <b>was</b> <b>old</b> and unstable, but the 12th-century tower and the original portal with sculpted decorations can still be seen. The carved pulpit dates to around 1581.|$|E
5|$|According to Yuri Moshnik, {{a modern}} historian, the {{garrison}} at Viborg in 1710 stood at 6000 men; other modern historians B. Adamovich and A. I. Dubravin {{put the number}} at 4000. Since 1702, the commander there had been Zacharias Animoff, who <b>was</b> <b>old</b> and in poor health. For that reason, in February 1710, Colonel Magnus Stiernstråle officially replaced him; he had de facto headed the efforts to fortify the city.|$|E

5|$|Alfred also {{assisted}} {{his own son}} {{by promoting}} men who could be relied on to support him, and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough. In the view of Barbara Yorke, the compilation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which magnified Alfred's achievements, may have been partly intended to strengthen {{the case for the}} succession of his own descendants. However, Yorke also argues that Æthelwold's position was not fatally undermined by Alfred's will. His mother had witnessed a charter as regina, whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen, and Æthelwold's status as the son of a queen may have given him an advantage over Edward. Æthelwold was still the senior ætheling, and the only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and Edward as filius regis (son of a king), but lists Æthelwold above Edward, implying that he ranked above him.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{appeared}} to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Although the Chronicle of Man {{maintains}} that Lǫgmaðr voluntarily vacated his throne, {{there is reason}} to suspect that he was forced from power. In about 1096, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1119), and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lǫgmaðr's younger brother, Óláfr (died 1153), <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough to assume control. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lǫgmaðr faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lǫgmaðr by itself, it approached Ua Briain for assistance in placing Óláfr upon the throne.|$|E

5|$|At age six, Rainilaiarivony began {{two years}} of study {{at one of the}} new schools opened by the London Missionary Society (LMS) for the {{children}} of the noble class at the royal palace in Antananarivo. Ranavalona shut down the mission schools in 1836, but the boy continued to study privately with an older missionary student. When Rainilaiarivony reached age 11 or 12, the relatives who had raised him decided he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough to make his own way in the world. Beginning with the purchase and resale of a few bars of soap, the boy gradually grew his business and expanded into the more profitable resale of fabric. The young Rainilaiarivony's reputation for tenacity and industriousness, as he fought against his predestined misfortunes, eventually reached the palace, where at the age of 14 the boy was invited to meet Queen Ranavalona I. She was favorably impressed, awarding him the official ranking of Sixth Honor title of Officer of the Palace. At 16 he was promoted to Seventh Honor, then promoted twice again to Eighth and Ninth Honor at age 19, an unprecedented ascent through the ranks.|$|E
5|$|Denning {{was told}} he would be ineligible {{to serve in the}} Armed Forces because of a {{systolic}} heart murmur, which he believed the doctor diagnosed because he was tired of sending young men off to die.

He trained at Newark and was temporarily commissioned as a second lieutenant on 17 November 1917. Although he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough to serve in the armed forces, regulations meant that he was not allowed to serve in France until he was nineteen.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} {{publication}} of the Commentaries, Blackstone's chances of judicial appointment remained slim. While he <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough, experienced enough and widely respected, the presence of Lord Camden as Lord Chancellor and Blackstone's lack of aristocratic patrons at the time hindered his chances. In January 1770, however, Lord Grafton's government began to fall, with Camden resigning on 17 January and Solicitor-General John Dunning, following him. George III appointed Lord North as Prime Minister, and North picked Charles Yorke as Lord Chancellor. Yorke's death on 20 January, after holding the position for less than three days, left several important legal positions within the government open. As such, Blackstone, now MP for Westbury, was apparently approached to become Solicitor-General; he refused, not wanting to deal with the complicated duties attached to the position.|$|E
