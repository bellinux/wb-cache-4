25|$|Xuanzang left Adinapur, {{which had}} few Buddhist monks, but many stupas and monasteries. His travels included, passing through Hunza and the Khyber Pass to the east, {{reaching}} the former capital of Gandhara, Purushapura (Peshawar), {{on the other}} side. Peshawar <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> its former glory, and Buddhism was declining in the region. Xuanzang visited a number of stupas around Peshawar, notably the Kanishka Stupa. This stupa was built just southeast of Peshawar, by a former king of the city. In 1908, it was rediscovered by D.B. Spooner {{with the help of}} Xuanzang's account.|$|E
25|$|From Italy Fregoli went to Brazil, Spain, and the United States. While {{he was in}} Madrid he was {{watched in}} {{performance}} by Alfred Moul, {{the general manager of}} the Alhambra Theatre in London's Charing Cross Road (which was being refitted at that time in the Moorish style {{under the direction of the}} great designer Owen Jones). Moul had heard of Fregoli's genius and wanted to be the first impresario in Britain to sign him up. He subsequently claimed that Fregoli (and his team of supporting assistants) were being paid £350 per week to perform at the Alhambra—a remarkable amount for the time. This <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> what Fregoli was to generate in ticket sales.|$|E

500|$|On {{the balance}} between {{creating}} new material and drawing from existing mythology, Bell noted that telling stories that can entertain both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is challenging, and that for the series they try to add nods to the MCU films or the comics {{in a way that}} works well on its own for all viewers, but could also mean more for a fan. On where the series can draw from the comics, Jed Whedon explained that there are areas of the comics that the series is not allowed to go to, and that ultimately they only use the comics for inspiration in generating their own story. Tancharoen elaborated that, [...] "We're always going to be inspired and influenced by the comics, but of course on the show, we'll always be doing our spin to it." [...] About comparisons between the scope of the series and that of the films, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been very generous with the series' budget, and that the production could not complain for a network series, but that it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the films or even series like Game of Thrones. He explained that the series does attempt to create [...] "Marvel moments" [...] as best it can, but pointed out that some of the more memorable moments from the films are smaller, character moments—something that works really well on television—so the series strives for those when it cannot afford more scope and scale. Jed Whedon elaborated that they look at a sequence and try to keep only what is required to tell the story, so [...] "If a monster is landing on a car, instead of showing the whole monster leaping through the skyline, we {{want to be in the}} car with the character having that experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which {{were sold to}} the general public was extremely effective. A good example was The physical basis of life, a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868. Its theme— that vital action is nothing more than [...] "the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it"— shocked the audience, though that <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the uproar when it was published in the Fortnightly Review for February 1869. John Morley, the editor, said [...] "No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation". The issue was reprinted seven times and protoplasm became a household word; Punch added 'Professor Protoplasm' to his other soubriquets.|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1972, Gaudron {{had entered}} a {{bar with a}} male {{barrister}} friend when the waitress informed the friend that the bar did not serve women. Gaudron [...] "patiently explained to the barmaid that my friend didn't want a woman because he'd brought his own," [...] eventually creating [...] "something of a scene" [...] which {{attracted the attention of}} Labor politician Clyde Cameron, who said that he didn't realise such sexual discrimination still existed. Gaudron said that [...] "the discrimination being practised in that particular hotel <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the discrimination over which he would undoubtedly preside when he became Minister for Industrial Relations after the next election." [...] However, the Whitlam government was elected on 2 December, and Cameron duly became Minister for Industrial Relations. Whitlam called Gaudron on 3 December to hire her to argue the case.|$|E

60|$|I {{heard the}} cry of rage and vengeance which rose from the Prussians as they passed their dead comrade, and I could not but smile as I {{wondered}} what they could think of the Emperor as a horseman and a swordsman.

60|$|The Prince's grief at {{the death}} of his mother was great, but it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> that of the King, his father, who was quite inconsolable for the loss of his dear wife. Neither time nor reason seemed to lighten his sorrow, and the sight of all the {{familiar}} faces and things about him only served to remind him of his loss. He therefore resolved to travel for change, and by means of his magic art was able to visit every country he came to see under different shapes, returning every few weeks to the place where he had left a few followers.|$|E
60|$|Such {{were the}} bitter words of Knolles, the more bitter because Nigel felt {{in his heart}} that he had indeed done wrong, and that Chandos would have said the same though, perchance, in kinder words. He listened in silent respect, as his duty was, and then having saluted his leader he withdrew apart, threw himself down amongst the bushes, and wept the hottest tears of his life, sobbing bitterly with his face between his hands. He had striven hard, and yet {{everything}} had gone wrong with him. He was bruised, burned and aching from head to foot. Yet so high is the spirit above the body that all <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the sorrow and shame which racked his soul.|$|E

60|$|To {{concentrate}} on Elspeth {{so that he}} might find out what was in her mind was, as we have seen, seldom necessary to Tommy; for he had learned her by heart long ago. Yet a time was now come when he had to concentrate, and even then he was doubtful of the result. So often he had put that mind of hers to rights that it was an open box to him, or had been until he conceived the odd notion that perhaps it contained a secret drawer. This would have been resented by most brothers, but Tommy's chagrin <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the exhilaration with which he perceived that he might be about to discover something new about woman. He was like the digger whose hand is on the point of closing on a diamond--a certain holiness added.|$|E
60|$|Notable as my {{reception}} {{had been}} (under that unfortunate mistake of Mrs. Ponto that I {{was related to}} Lord Snobbington, which I was not permitted to correct), it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the bowing and kotooing, the raptures and flurry which preceded and welcomed the visit of a real live lord and lord's son, a brother officer of Cornet Wellesley Ponto, in the 120th Hussars, who came over with the young Cornet from Guttlebury, where their distinguished regiment was quartered. This was my Lord Gules, Lord Saltire's grandson and heir: a very young, short, sandy-haired and tobacco-smoking nobleman, who cannot have left the nursery very long, and who, though he accepted the honest Major's invitation to the Evergreens in a letter written in a school-boy handwriting, {{with a number of}} faults of spelling, may yet be a very fine classical scholar for what I know: having had his education at Eton, where he and young Ponto were inseparable.|$|E
6000|$|So the Count descanted {{at length}} upon {{the enormity of}} young Billings's early liaisons; and then he told his own, in the year four, with a burgomaster's {{daughter}} at Ratisbon, {{when he was in}} the Elector of Bavaria's service--then, after Blenheim, when he had come over to the Duke of Marlborough, when a physician's wife at Bonn poisoned herself for him, etc. etc.; of a piece with the story of the canoness, which has been recorded before. All the tales were true. A clever, ugly man every now and then is successful with the ladies; but a handsome fool is irresistible. Mrs. Cat listened and listened. Good heavens! she had heard all these tales before, and recollected the place and the time--how she was hemming a handkerchief for Max; who came round and kissed her, vowing that the physician's wife <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> her--how he was tired, and lying on the sofa, just come home from shooting. How handsome he looked! Cat thought he was only the handsomer now; and looked more grave and thoughtful, the dear fellow! ...|$|E

50|$|However nervous his job makes Mr Barrowclough, it <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> {{the fear}} he has of his often {{mentioned}} but never seen wife, Mrs Alice Barrowclough.

Fletcher once described him as looking like 'Arthur Askey on stilts'.|$|R

6000|$|An {{instance}} of what I mean {{may be found}} in the amusing article about the nightmares of the nursery. Superficially read it might almost be taken to mean that Dickens disapproved of ghost stories--disapproved of that old and genial horror which nurses can hardly supply fast enough for the children who want it. Dickens, one would have thought, should have been the last man in the world to object to horrible stories, having himself written some of the most horrible that exist in the world. The author of the Madman's Manuscript, of the disease of Monk and the death of Krook, cannot be considered fastidious in the matter of revolting realism or of revolting mysticism. If artistic horror is to be kept from the young, it is at least as necessary to keep little boys from reading Pickwick or Bleak House as to refrain from telling them the story of Captain Murderer or the terrible tale of Chips. If there was something appalling in the rhyme of Chips and pips and ships, it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> that infernal refrain of [...] "Mudstains, bloodstains" [...] which Dickens himself, in one of his highest moments of hellish art, put into Oliver Twist.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{carried the}} tray to the cabin, but I didn't call this Bompard [...] "Citizen." [...] Oh no! [...] "Mon Capitaine" [...] was my little word, same as Uncle Aurette used to answer in King Louis' Navy. Bompard, he liked it. He took me on for cabin servant, {{and after that}} no one asked questions; and thus I got good victuals and light work {{all the way across}} to America. He talked a heap of politics, and so did his officers, and when this Ambassador Genet got rid of his land-stomach and laid down the law after dinner, a rooks' {{parliament}} <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> their cabin. I learned to know most of the men which had worked the French Revolution, through waiting at table and hearing talk about 'em. One of our forecas'le six-pounders was called Danton and t'other Marat. I used to play the fiddle between 'em, sitting on the capstan. Day in and day out Bompard and Monsieur Genet talked o' what France had done, and how the United States was going to join her to finish off the English in this war. Monsieur Genet said he'd justabout make the United States fight for France. He was a rude common man. But I liked listening. I always helped drink any healths that was proposed--specially Citizen Danton's who'd cut off King Louis' head. An all-Englishman might have been shocked--but that's where my French blood saved me.|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced at}} such a contingency, but it failed to hold him long when once he had {{reflected}} {{that he would have}} been silly, in this case, with Maria Gostrey and little Bilham, with Madame de Vionnet and little Jeanne, with Lambert Strether, in fine, and above all with Chad Newsome himself. Wouldn't it be found to have made more for reality to be silly with these persons than sane with Sarah and Jim? Jim in fact, he presently made up his mind, was individually out of it; Jim didn't care; Jim hadn't come out either for Chad or for him; Jim in short left the moral side to Sally and indeed simply availed himself now, for the sense of recreation, {{of the fact that he}} left almost everything to Sally. He <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> Sally, and not so much by reason of Sally's temper and will as by that of her more developed type and greater acquaintance with the world. He quite frankly and serenely confessed, as he sat there with Strether, that he felt his type hang far in the rear of his wife's and still further, if possible, in the rear of his sister's. Their types, he well knew, were recognised and acclaimed; whereas the most a leading Woollett business-man could hope to achieve socially, and for that matter industrially, was a certain freedom to play into this general glamour.|$|E
