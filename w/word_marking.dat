The idea of some early grammariams of coordination reduction has been usefully developed in transformational syntax. Further studies in frequency, variety of stylistic applications and change of stylistic range should provide more interesting views of constructions with "and"...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{offers a}} grammatical description {{and analysis of}} Manda (N. 11), a Bantu language spoken along Lake Nyasa (Lake Malawi) in southern Tanzania. The study focuses on the “wider” TAM domain, i. e. on how tense, aspect, mood but also modality and negation are expressed in the language, offering {{a description of the}} form and function of the various markers employed. In addition, this work sets out to unravel the historical background of these markers and the diachronic processes of change - particularly grammaticalization - through which they have evolved. As Manda is a basically undescribed language, the thesis also includes a brief socio-historical account - focusing on the issues of contact - as well as a grammar sketch describing the fundamentals of the language. This study draws on a combination of methods consisting of both more prototypical field work as well as methods facilitating grammatical reconstruction. The vast bulk of the Manda data have been collected in the field. Hypotheses of change – but also of retention – are based on the synchronic variation found in this data, in comparison to the data of existing older sources as well as from neighboring languages. Furthermore, the Manda data has been compared to Proto-Bantu reconstructions and cross-Bantu as well as cross-linguistic generalizations on functional and formal change. The study shows that Manda in many ways adheres to the general traits of an (Eastern) Bantu language. Fundamentally, the language is highly agglutinative, with e. g. an elaborate noun class system and a rich set of both prefixes and affixes on the verbal <b>word,</b> <b>marking</b> nominal indexation, derivations as well as TAM. With regard to TAM, the study argues that much of the synthetic linguistic material found in Manda can be traced to Proto-Bantu and thus most likely is inherited. In contrast, many innovations and indications of ongoing change are displayed in the periphrastic constructions of the language. These include a set of auxiliary constructions used for expressing aspect, modality but also (non-standard) negation, a borrowed persistive marker and two particles being employed as standard negators...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in {{the examination of the}} steady state of simultaneous bilinguals. An understanding of what leads to the possible weaknesses in the grammar of early bilinguals can contribute {{to our understanding of the}} possible causes of the apparent characteristic ‘failures’ in second language acquisition (Montrul 2008). Spanish has a gender feature for nouns (Carroll 1989) and gender agreement for determiners and adjectives. Problems with the acquisition of gender marking on the noun and/or with gender agreement are well-known in the L 2 literature (Hawkins 1998; Fernández–Garcia 1999; Franceschina 2001; Bruhn de Garavito and White 2002; White et al. 2004). The question is whether or not the gender feature is acquired on the noun itself (White et al. 2004) or if problems are due to mapping. Current research has suggested masculine as the default gender for agreement marking in Spanish (McCarthy 2007) but the question of whether the gender feature is acquired on the noun persists. In the present study we will focus on the status of an internal interface property, gender, where syntax interfaces with morphology by examining code-mixed DPs of Spanish/ English bilinguals. A salient characteristic of bilingual grammars is that of code-mixing where properties from two languages are systematically ‘mixed’ within a phrase or sentence (Toribio 2001). The treatment of code-mixed DPs is different for L 1 Spanish speakers who speak English than for bilingual L 1 speakers of Spanish English (Liceras et al. 2008). The Liceras et al. spontaneous code-mixing data has shown that in situations where the determiner is in Spanish and the noun is in English, a Spanish speaker will agree the determiner with the inherent gender of the noun (as in (1 a-b)) while a bilingual speaker will invariably use the masculine form of the determiner regardless of the gender of the noun in Spanish (as in (2 a-b) : This evidence from the code-mixed DPs of Spanish/English bilingual speakers indicates that the status of their gender feature is different from that of L 1 Spanish speakers. Our research questions are the following: Are differences in Det selection between bilingual and L 1 Spanish speakers due to a difference in underlying structure (English DP versus Spanish DP) ? Have bilinguals acquired the abstract gender feature of Spanish? In order to investigate the research questions we have developed two tests: a lexical selection task and an elicited production task. Both tasks target code-mixed DPs where the Det is provided by Spanish and the noun is in English. Target tokens look at the gender selection of the Det as well as agreement in copula constructions. There are three subject groups: simultaneous Spanish/English bilinguals, adult L 2 Spanish advanced learners and L 1 Spanish speakers. Data will be discussed in terms of the status of the gender feature, the issue of default <b>word</b> <b>marking,</b> and the acquisition of internal interface properties...|$|E
