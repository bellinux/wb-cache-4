The writing pretest and posttest are used to measure students’ writing accuracy. The researcher uses a t-test to analyze the data. The result is satisfying. 35 students have shown statistically significant progress in their writing accuracy. The posttest result has outscored the pretest score.

This study is primarily a qualitative research involving frequency counts of the types of <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback</b> used by the teacher in the students’ compositions and qualitative analysis which is based on the questionnaire on the teacher’s beliefs and practices in giving <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback.</b> The study found that the teacher used direct, metalinguistic and unfocused <b>written</b> corrective <b>feedback</b> in her student’s compositions.
