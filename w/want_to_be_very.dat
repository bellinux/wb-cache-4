2500|$|Following the 1980 presidential election, Bush and {{his family}} moved to Miami-Dade County, Florida. [...] He took a job in real estate with Armando Codina, a 32-year-old Cuban {{immigrant}} and self-made millionaire. Codina had made a fortune in a computer business, and then formed a new company, The Codina Group, to pursue opportunities in real estate. [...] During his time with the company, Bush focused on finding tenants for commercial developments. Codina eventually made Bush his partner in a new development business, which quickly became one of South Florida's leading real estate development firms. As a partner, Bush received 40% of the firm's profits. [...] In 1983, Bush said of his move from Houston to Miami: [...] "On the personal side, my mother-in-law and sister-in-law were already living here", and on the professional side, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> wealthy, and I'll be glad to tell you when I've accomplished that goal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Former Ambassador to Egypt [...] Frank Wisner said:"It wasn’t the {{military}} that plotted the seizure {{of the government and}} grabbed it. It was a massive public uprising that, left unchecked, would have produced great violence. It would have left {{the military}} in the miserable position of having to control those demonstrations by force. The cry from the crowd was they wanted new elections … to help decide the country's future, which has been so troubled. The military was faced with, genuinely overheated situation … It isn’t a coup in any classic sense and, yet, the military played a role in upsetting the government. We have to ask ourselves, then, finally, what are the interests of the United States? And here the president wisely has waiver authority and has to make a judgment. Egypt is the largest and most influential country in the Middle East. Egypt is central to peace with Israel. Egypt's fate will influence the course of politics elsewhere in the region. So we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very,</b> very careful before we go out and condemn an event that has, by the most recent polling of Egypt's best pollsters, 80 percent support in the population. What is clear is the wave of anger against the government that drove Morsi from power, enjoyed massive, massive public support in the many, many millions of Egyptians.|$|E

5000|$|Bon teacher Tenzin Wangyal cautions, however, {{that even}} this {{so-called}} non-sectarian attitude {{may be taken}} to an extreme: A problem that seems very difficult to avoid involves the tendency of spiritual schools either to want to preserve their traditions in a very closed way or to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> open and nonsectarian; but there is often the danger that this very nonsectarianism can {{become a source of}} self-justification and lead to as closed an attitude as that of the sectarians.|$|E
