500|$|Although the European films {{allowed him}} to travel {{and gave him a}} {{constant}} source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he [...] "knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless". One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying [...] "I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that [...] "I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her". An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film Where <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> <b>When</b> the Lights Went Out?, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would [...] "listen... politely, then do it my own way, as if the conversation had never taken place"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called [...] "limp", and Christopher Young described as [...] "such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy".|$|E

500|$|For Angels fifth season, as with Buffys fourth, Spike {{steps in}} to replace Cordelia {{as a source}} of comedic {{dialogue}} within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where are you now? Where <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> you started and where are you now and {{how do you feel about}} that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E
500|$|Later reviews were {{generally}} positive. In a retrospective review, Christgau gave Janet an [...] "A–" [...] {{and said that}} although the costly production by Jam & Lewis makes the music sound [...] "more pornographic than obscene", [...] "this achievement is Janet's, period ... Better nose than Michael, better navel than Madonna, better sex than either." [...] Laura Sinagra wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) that with janet, Jackson [...] "took more risks" [...] lyrically than on her previous albums. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine notes that the album [...] "was {{at the forefront of}} the increasingly popular sampling trend in the '90s, with one song even employing three different samples as its foundation. Some make perfect sense on a thematic as well as sonic level, like Kool & the Gang's [...] "Kool It (Here Comes the Fuzz)" [...] and Stevie Wonder's [...] "Superwoman, Where <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> <b>When</b> I Needed You" [...] on [...] "New Agenda," [...] or the orchestral flourish from Diana Ross & the Supremes' [...] "Someday We'll Be Together" [...] on [...] "If," [...] which seems to exist for the sole purpose of providing the impetus behind one of the greatest dance-break routines in music video history." [...] Commenting on the album's broad range, he states: [...] "The mother of eclectic, genre-hopping records by Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani, and Fergie, janet. incorporates new jack swing, house, pop, rock, hip-hop, jazz, and even opera, but the album's range of styles isn't jarring in the least... Janet has never been one thing and janet. is a feminist statement, to be sure." [...] Alex Henderson of AllMusic offered a positive review, saying [...] "nyone who expected Jackson to top Rhythm Nation—her crowning achievement and an incredibly tough act to follow—was being unrealistic. But with janet., she delivered a respectable offering that, although not as strong as either Control or Nation, has many strong points." ...|$|E

2500|$|God speaks from a whirlwind. His speeches neither explain Job's suffering, nor defend divine justice, nor {{enter into}} the {{courtroom}} confrontation that Job has demanded, nor respond to his oath of innocence. Instead they contrast Job's weakness with divine wisdom and omnipotence: [...] "Where <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> I laid {{the foundations of the}} earth?" [...] Job makes a brief response, but God's monologue resumes, never addressing Job directly. In 42:1–6 Job makes his final response, confessing God's power and his own lack of knowledge [...] "of things beyond me which I did not know". Previously he has only heard, but now his eyes have seen God, and [...] "therefore I retract/ And repent in dust and ashes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to their}} low social status and {{language}} barrier, Korean Americans received very {{little if any}} aid or protection from police authorities. David Joo, a manager of the gun store, said, [...] "I {{want to make it}} clear that we didn't open fire first. At that time, four police cars were there. Somebody started to shoot at us. The LAPD ran away in half a second. I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed." [...] Carl Rhyu, a participant in the Korean immigrants' armed response to the rioting, said, [...] "If it was your own business and your own property, would you be willing to trust it to someone else? We are glad the National Guard is here. They're good backup. But when our shops were burning we called the police every five minutes; no response." [...] At a shopping center several miles north of Koreatown, Jay Rhee, who estimated that he and others fired five hundred shots into the ground and air, said, [...] "We have lost our faith in the police. Where <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>when</b> we needed you?" [...] Koreatown was isolated from South Central Los Angeles, yet despite such exclusion it was the heaviest hit.|$|E
2500|$|The September 11 {{attacks of}} 2001 and the {{economic}} recession helped move country music back into the spotlight. Many country artists, such as Alan Jackson with his ballad on terrorist attacks, [...] "Where <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> (<b>When</b> the World Stopped Turning)", wrote songs that celebrated the military, highlighted the gospel, and emphasized home and family values over wealth. Alt-Country singer Ryan Adams song [...] "New York, New York" [...] pays tribute to New York City, and it's popular music video (which was shot 4 days before the attacks) shows Adams playing {{in front of the}} Manhattan skyline, Along with several shots of the city. In contrast, more rock-oriented country singers took more direct aim at the attacks' perpetrators; Toby Keith's [...] "The Angry American (Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue)" [...] threatened to [...] "a boot in" [...] the posterior of the enemy, while Charlie Daniels's [...] "This Ain't No Rag, It's a Flag" [...] promised to [...] "hunt" [...] the perpetrators [...] "down like a mad dog hound." [...] These songs gained such recognition that it put Country music back into popular culture. The influence of rock music in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s as artists like Eric Church, Jason Aldean, and Brantley Gilbert have had success; Aaron Lewis, former frontman for the rock group Staind, had a moderately successful entry into country music in 2011 and 2012. Also rising in the late 2000s and early 2010s was the insertion of rap and spoken-word elements into country songs; artists such as Cowboy Troy and Colt Ford have focused almost exclusively on country rap (also known as hick hop) while other, more mainstream artists (such as Big & Rich and Jason Aldean) have used it on occasion.|$|E
