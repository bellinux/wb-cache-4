"He instinctively {{realized}} that orderliness would only proceed from centralized control of large aggregations {{of plant and}} capital, with the one aim of an orderly flow of products from the producer to the consumer.

500|$|Author J. C. Furnas {{regretted that}} [...] "a Presidential year always makes Dooleyites feel frustrated. [...] In 1960 we need Mr. Dooley to deal {{adequately}} with {{such things as}} public-opinion polls; Mr. Truman's opinion of primaries; the spring swarming of the Kennedys in Minnesota; [...] the problem [...] <b>whether</b> <b>Mr.</b> Nixon should invite Checkers back into the act". Writing again in 1991, Furnas suggested potential Dooley targets might include the Bork and Souter confirmation hearings, and the omnipresence of blue jeans; but that an impediment to a revival of interest in Dooley was the present-day view of dialect works as demeaning. English professor John W. Lowe stated that Dooley [...] "set the model for an ethnic spokesman who could be entertaining and informative {{at the same time}} using humor to mask a subversive form of humor and get a message across. Then, the Irish made it, and they found his brogue and dialect embarrassing." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 8, 2004 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia halted Hamdan's {{military}} commission because no [...] "competent tribunal" [...] had determined <b>whether</b> <b>Mr</b> Hamdan was a POW (as {{required by the}} Geneva Conventions), and because regardless of such determination, the commission violated the procedures of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).

2500|$|According to [...] Abbas Milani, {{whether the}} fatwa [...] "actually exists and even <b>whether</b> <b>Mr.</b> Khamenei is {{entitled}} to issue fatwas and finally how changeable are fatwas are all contested matters". While Seyyed Hossein Mousavian, head of the Iranian Foreign Relations Committee from 1997 to 2005 and a research scholar at Princeton University, recalls seeing the letter containing the anti-nuclear fatwa issued in the mid-1990s in office of the Iranian Supreme National Security Council, Karim Sadjadpour argues that references to the fatwa by the US government may be {{in order to give}} the Iranians a route to compromise on the basis of religious beliefs rather than pressure from US-led sanctions.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1973, when Brezhnev {{arrived in}} the United States to have a one-week meeting with [...] Nixon, Brezhnev told the press, [...] "I {{do not intend to}} refer to that matter—. It would be {{completely}} indecent for me to refer to it. ... My attitude toward Mr. Nixon is of very great respect." [...] When one reporter suggested that Nixon and his position with Brezhnev were [...] "weakened" [...] by the scandal, Brezhnev replied, [...] "It does not enter my mind to think <b>whether</b> <b>Mr.</b> Nixon has lost or gained any influence because of the affair." [...] Then he said further that he had respected Nixon because of Nixon's [...] "realistic and constructive approach to Soviet Union–United States relations ... passing from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiations between nations".|$|E

[...] "The only contentious issue was <b>whether</b> <b>Mr.</b> Joyce was an equal partner entitled to ¼ of the profits arising out of the activities (other than songwriting or publishing) of the Smiths." [...] Joyce's barrister, Nigel Davis QC, asserted that [...] "it was not until after the bestselling band split up in 1987 that his client discovered he was getting only 10 per cent of the profits". Davis continued: [...] "Mr Joyce never agreed to ten per cent, he never assumed he was getting ten per cent. On the contrary {{he thought he was}} getting 25 per cent." ...|$|E

2500|$|The FBI and Justice Department's {{investigations}} were {{triggered by}} a 2004 article in the Los Angeles Times reporting on Weldon and his daughter's links to the Russians and Serbians. On October 16, 2006, FBI agents raided the home of Weldon's daughter as well as five other locations of Weldon associates in Pennsylvania and Florida {{as part of the}} investigation.

2500|$|... {{had used}} {{ruthless}} tactics {{to convert the}} fine Republican state organization into a one-man Rockefeller machine, loyal not to party but to Rockefeller personally. In rapid succession, Mr. Rockefeller captiously took {{over most of the}} functions of the state chairman and {{in a matter of months}} succeeded in taking over and exercising absolute right of dictation as to each and every important party function at the state level. Such one-man dictatorship is clearly the deadly enemy of any semblance of two-party government. ... Faithful Republican leaders who have worked tirelessly over the years have been pushed aside or replaced. ... A stranger passing through Arkansas at this time and seeing Mr. Rockefeller's advertising on billboards would not know <b>whether</b> <b>Mr.</b> Rockefeller belonged to any political party. Certainly the fact that he is the Republican nominee has not been included. The evidence simply is unanswerable that Mr. Rockefeller is working for his own personal interest to the exclusion of all other considerations, which leaves the Republican Party in Arkansas hanging precariously at the whims of one individual.....|$|E
2500|$|On February 10, 2014, the Greater Baltimore Committee {{proposal}} {{to build an}} expanded convention Center and new arena hit a major roadblock: {{the owner of the}} Sheraton Inner Harbor and the person who was spearheading the efforts to raise private funds for the project, Willard Hackerman died. The Baltimore Business Journal reported on February 11, 2014, that the death of Willard Hackerman the day prior has thrown the future of the proposal into question. Kaliope Parthemos, Baltimore City's then-Deputy Mayor of Economic and Neighborhood Development told the Baltimore Business Journal that the City of Baltimore was in active discussions with Mr. Hackerman about the proposal up until December 2013 and stated that Mr. Hackerman was actively involved and wanted this {{proposal to}} move forward however he was [...] "frustrated" [...] that he could not have privately funded the entire cost by himself. Ms. Parthemos revealed that financing the estimated $900 million project [...] "remained a significant hurdle up until Hackerman's death." [...] Ms. Parthemos also stated that she was uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hackerman made any plans to have the project continue after his death in case if he died.|$|E
