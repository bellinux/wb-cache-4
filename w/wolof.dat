5|$|Positive Black Soul (also {{known as}} PBS) is a hip hop {{group based in}} Dakar, Senegal, {{one of the first}} such collectives in the country. Founded in 1989, the group is {{composed}} of Didier Sourou Awadi (alias DJ Awadi) and Amadou Barry (alias Doug E. Tee or Duggy-Tee), both of whom had previously been in other hip hop groups. They perform in the English, French, and <b>Wolof</b> languages and use traditional Senegalese instruments as part of their songs. Political and social activism have played important roles in the group since it was founded.|$|E
5|$|Wax {{resist dyeing}} of fabric {{is an ancient}} art form. It already existed in Egypt in the 4th century BC, where {{it was used to}} wrap mummies; linen was soaked in wax, and {{scratched}} using a stylus. In Asia, the technique was practised in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and in India and Japan during the Nara Period (645-794 AD). In Africa it was originally practised by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and <b>Wolof</b> in Senegal. These African version however, uses cassava starch or rice paste, or mud as a resist instead of beeswax.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, where batik was {{originally}} imported by Dutch merchants from Indonesia (then the Netherlands East Indies), paste made from starch or mud {{is used as}} a resist instead of wax. The most developed resist-dyeing skills {{are to be found in}} Nigeria where the Yoruba make adire cloths. Two methods of resist are used: adire eleso which involves tied and stitched designs and adire eleko that uses starch paste. The paste is most often made from cassava starch, rice, and other ingredients boiled together to produce a smooth thick paste. The Yoruba of West Africa use cassava paste as a resist while the Soninke and <b>Wolof</b> people in Senegal uses rice paste. The Bamana people of Mali use mud as a resist.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} population was originally animist, {{but while the}} fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% {{of the population of}} Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by <b>Wolof</b> and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Florida was {{transferred}} back to Spain which lured Americans with cheap land. A former loyalist to Britain who left South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, a planter and slave trader named Zephaniah Kingsley {{seized the opportunity}} and built a plantation named Laurel Grove near what is now Doctors Lake, close {{to the west bank}} of the St. Johns River, south of where Orange Park is today. Three years later, Kingsley took a trip to Cuba and purchased a 13-year-old <b>Wolof</b> girl named Anna Madgigine Jai. She became his common-law wife, and managed Laurel Grove while Kingsley traveled and conducted business. The plantation grew citrus and sea island cotton (Gossypium barbadense). In 1814, they moved to a larger plantation on Fort George Island, where they lived for 25 years, and owned several other plantations and homesteads in what is today Jacksonville and another on Drayton Island at the north end of Lake George. Kingsley later married three other freed women in a polygamous relationship; Spanish-controlled Florida allowed interracial marriages, and white landowners such as James Erwin, George Clarke, Francisco Sánchez, John Fraser, and Francis Richard, Jr.—early settlers along the river—all were married to or in extramarital relationships with African women.|$|E
25|$|The Sabar (drum) {{tradition}} {{associated with}} the <b>Wolof</b> people originated from the Serer Kingdom of Sine and spread to the Kingdom of Saloum. The <b>Wolof</b> people who migrated to Serer Saloum picked it up from there and spread it to <b>Wolof</b> Kingdoms. Each motif has a purpose and is used for different occasions. Individual motifs represent the history and genealogy of a particular family and are used during weddings, naming ceremonies, funerals etc.|$|E
5000|$|The Manjack {{people are}} {{an ethnic group}} in Guinea-Bissau. They are known as Manjaku by the Manjacks themselves, Ndiago by the <b>Wolofs</b> of Senegal, Manjaco by the Portuguese, and Manjaque by the French. Each of these terms means [...] "I tell you".|$|R
50|$|Mangin {{writes that}} the first troops of African {{soldiers}} were mainly composed by the <b>Wolofs</b> and Toucouleurs (Fulani). Both the <b>Wolofs</b> and the Fulani speak languages of the North-Atlantic branch of the Niger-Congo family and are predominantly Muslim. The Fulani group is a large ethnic group in West Africa that has a wide geographical spread and many different dialects/languages. We cannot be sure what variety of the Fula was spoken by these West African soldiers. Biondi points out {{that one of the}} largest differences between slavery in West Africa and the new world (the Americas) was the presence and importance of the “mixed” population and ’signares’ in particular. ’Signares’ is a term used for African or part-Africanwomen who were companions to the French men of the colony.|$|R
5|$|In 1869, Carabane became autonomous, but it {{merged with}} Sédhiou in 1886. Its {{garrison}} {{of a dozen}} men was regularly stricken with tropical diseases such as malaria. In 1877, 527 people were counted on the island, mostly Jola, but also some <b>Wolofs,</b> Muslims, and a few Manjacks from Portuguese Guinea.|$|R

50|$|The United Party was a {{political}} party in the Gambia. The party was founded {{during the colonial period}} and worked political in the then colony of Bathurst (the present capital of the Gambia, Banjul). The party drew support mainly from Roman Catholics. In Banjul it had support mainly amongst the <b>Wolofs,</b> in the rural areas mainly amongst Fulas. The party was led by P. S. Njie.|$|R
5|$|Senegal's {{independence}} was declared on August 20, 1960, {{and after the}} dissolution of the short-lived Mali Federation, Casamance saw the arrival of officials coming from the north. Although many of them were <b>Wolofs</b> and Muslims, they did not know the Jola country and its traditions. The periods of drought that ravaged the Sahel in the 1970s forced peanut farmers to move to regions where rice was all that grew.|$|R
50|$|The Halpulaar (Pulaar-speakers), {{composed}} of Fula people, a widespread group found along the Sahel from Chad to Senegal, and Toucouleurs, represent 23.8 {{percent of the}} population. Historically, {{they were the first}} to become Muslim. Many of the Toucouleurs, or sedentary Halpulaar of the Senegal River Valley in the north, converted to Islam around a millennium ago and later contributed to Islam's propagation throughout Senegal. Success was gained among the <b>Wolofs,</b> but repulsed by the Serers.|$|R

25|$|The next vassal {{kingdom of}} Mali {{to break away}} was the {{province}} of Jolof. The <b>Wolof</b> inhabitants of this kingdom united under their own emperor and formed the Jolof Empire around 1360 during a succession crisis that followed the death of Mansa Suleyman. It is unknown exactly why the <b>Wolof</b> broke away, but the destructive reign of Suleyman’s predecessor and nephew Maghan I {{may have played a}} role in Jolof’s motives if not the very reason why future mansas could not do anything about it.|$|E
25|$|Since April 1989, some 70,000 black Mauritanians – {{members of}} the Fula, Toucouleur, <b>Wolof,</b> Soninke and Bambara ethnic groups – have been {{expelled}} from Mauritania by the Mauritanian government.|$|E
5000|$|Malicounda Bambara is {{a village}} (pop. 1,555) in the M'bour Department of the Thiès Region in western Senegal, located {{approximately}} 85 km from the Senegalese capital of Dakar. Founded in 1902 by migrants from neighboring Mali {{in search of}} arable land, today the village counts ethnic bambaras, sarakolés, <b>wolofs</b> and socés among its population. Malicounda Bambara is especially notable for being the first village in Senegal to publicly abandon the traditional practice of female genital cutting.|$|R
50|$|After {{the demise}} of the Serer {{paternal}} dynasties of Baol, the title was retained by the <b>Wolofs.</b> The first Teignes of Baol were Serers which included members of the Joof dynasty, such as : Boureh Joof (Bouré Diouf in French speaking Senegal) and Guidiane Jegan Joof (Guidiane Diouf), during the Wagadou period, and Maad Patar Kholleh Joof the conqueror. The Faal (or Fall in French) dynasty, the last paternal dynasty, were Wolofized Black Moors who came to the throne after the Battle of Danki in 1549. The last Teigne of Baol was Tanor Ngone Jeng (Tanor Goñ Dieng), who reigned from 1890 to 3 July 1894.|$|R
50|$|Beyond tourism, Saint-Louis {{is also a}} {{commercial}} and an industrial centre for sugar production. Its other economic activities are fishing, irrigated alluvial agriculture, pastoral farming, trading and exportation of peanut skins. It {{is important to note}} that each of these economic activities is assured by a particular ethnic group. The <b>Wolofs</b> and Lebous who are the main inhabitants of Saint-Louis are mostly fishermen that live in fishing communities like Guet-Ndar on the Langue de Barbarie. The Fulas live in the inland and practice pastoral farming. The Maures who are migrants from Mauritania (Saint-Louis is less than six miles south of the border with Mauritania) are mostly merchants, traders and shopkeepers found everywhere in Saint Louis.|$|R
25|$|Ibrahima Fall {{comes from}} an aristocratic <b>Wolof</b> family from Cayor. A scholar {{confirms}} that Fall came out of an animistic influenced Muslim tradition, but believes Fall’s family was prosperous and formerly powerful in Cayor. Other sources confirm that Fall’s grandfather, Damel Dethialaw, was a ruler of the Cayor kingdom.|$|E
25|$|According to Elizabeth Berg, Ruth Wan and Ruth Lau, Serer {{people in}} Senegal {{did not have}} a caste system before the Malinka rulers conquered them and {{introduced}} a caste system.

50|$|Among West African Muslims, {{especially}} <b>Wolofs,</b> Fulas, and Mandinkas, the leaves, bark, and twigs of Kinkiliba {{are harvested}} {{and sold in}} bundles {{during the dry season}} leading up to and during the month of Ramadan. The Kinkiliba is used daily to brew a strong tea that is mixed with sugar and milk and is drunk with bread at sundown as a means of breaking the daily fast. Kinkiliba is used specifically for this purpose because of its sweet flavor and because it is believed to be an appetite stimulant, as those who have been fasting {{want to be able to}} enjoy as much rich food as possible in the evening after eating nothing from sunrise to sunset.|$|R
50|$|As fishing {{settlements}} {{around the}} Arguin banks were quickly {{devastated by the}} Portuguese slave raiders, in 1445 (or possibly 1444), Nuno Tristão was sent by Henry to press further south and look for new slave-raiding grounds. Tristão reached {{as far south as}} borderlands of Senegal, where the Sahara desert ends and forest begins, and the coastal population changed from 'tawny' Sanhaja Berbers to 'black' <b>Wolofs.</b> Tristão is believed to have reached as far as the Ponta da Berberia (Langue de Barbarie), just short of the entrance to the Senegal River. Bad weather prevented his entering the river or landing there, so he set sail back. On the way home, Tristão stopped by the Arguin banks and took another 21 Berbers captive.|$|R
50|$|The novel {{opens with}} Sheila Grey, George’s {{daughter}} and her partner, Tom, discussing the imminent return of her father from Bom Porto. In a letter, he tells her of his plans to retire to his parents’ house in St Cadix, Cornwall. The action then moves to Bom Porto, the capital of Montedor - an independent Marxist Republic - where we first meet George, who is {{the manager of a}} bunkering station. He plays a game of squash with Eduordo (Teddy) Duarte, the Minister of Communications, who informs him about the President’s plans to use Cubans to subjugate the mountainous <b>Wolofs,</b> a tribe who have historically been hostile towards the coastal Creole population. George later settles his affairs and is given a surprise official send-off and eventually arrives in Britain, booking himself into a Post House Hotel at Heathrow rather than choosing to stay with Sheila.|$|R
25|$|Sembène's {{knowledge}} of French and basic Arabic besides <b>Wolof,</b> his mother tongue, followed his attendance at a Madrasa, as was common for many Islamic boys, and a French school until 1936, when he {{clashed with the}} principal. He worked with his father—he was prone to seasickness—until 1938, then he moved to Dakar, where he worked a variety of manual labour jobs.|$|E
25|$|On 21 September 1895, the French exiled Aamadu Bàmba to Gabon. Aamadu Bàmba ordered Ibrahima Fall to {{work for}} Sherif Hassan. He did so until 1901, when Sherif Hassan died. In this {{interval}} (1895–1901), Fall kept sending money (in <b>Wolof</b> “Adiya”) to the Shaikh until his return in 1902. On 11 November 1902, Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke returned to Senegal and awarded Ibrahima Fall the degree of Sheikh.|$|E
25|$|The {{only major}} setback to his reign was {{the loss of}} Mali's Dyolof {{province}} in Senegal. The <b>Wolof</b> populations of the area united into their own state known as the Jolof Empire in the 1350s. Still, when Ibn Battuta arrived at Mali in July 1352, he found a thriving civilisation on par with virtually anything in the Muslim or Christian world. Mansa Souleyman Keita died in 1360 and was succeeded by his son, Camba Keita.|$|E
60|$|Passing the easternmost {{end of the}} peninsula, and sailing {{along the}} Bullom ('lowland') shores, we {{verified}} Dr. Blyden's assertion that this 'home of fevers' shows no outward and visible sign of exceeding unhealthiness. The soil is sandy, the bush is comparatively thin, and the tall trees give it the aspect of a high and dry land. We then turned north-east and skirted Tasso Island, a strip of river-holm girt with a wall of mangroves. It had an old English fort, founded in 1695; the factors traded with the Pulo (Fulah) country for slaves, ivory, and gold. It was abandoned after being taken by Van Ruyter, when he restored to the Dutch West Indian Company the conquests of Commodore Holmes. The rich soil in 1800 supported a fine cotton plantation, and here Mr. Heddle kept a 'factory.' The villagers turned out to gaze, not habited like the <b>Wolofs</b> of Albreda, but clad in shady hats and seedy pantaloons.|$|R
60|$|There is no {{difficulty}} in distinguishing {{at first sight}} Moslem from Kafir. Besides the gypsy-like Pulo, the 'brown race,' our older Fúlahs and Fellalahs, whose tongue {{is said to be}} a congener of the Nubian; and the wild, half-naked pagan Jolu, the principal tribes, are two, the Mandengas and the <b>Wólofs.</b> The former, whom Europeans divide into the Marabút, who does not drink, and the Soninki, who does, inhabit a triangle, its base being the line from the south of the Senegal to the Gambia River, and its apex the Niger; it has even extended to near Tin-Bukhtu (the Well of Bukhtu), our Timbuctoo. In old Mohammedan works their territory is called Wángara. This race of warmen and horsemen surprisingly resembles the Somal, who hold the same parallels of latitude in Eastern Africa, as to small heads, semi-Caucasian features, Asiatic above the nose-tip and African below; tall lithe figures, high shoulders, and long limbs, especially the forearm.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, {{the village}} of Carabane's {{official}} population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most {{of the population is}} Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by <b>Wolofs,</b> Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée {{at the time of the}} first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians.|$|R
