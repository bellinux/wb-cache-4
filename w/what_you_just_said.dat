5000|$|Shaam had {{modelled}} {{for four}} years in Bengaluru before model coordinator Biju Jayadevan introduced him to director Jeeva, who was auditioning for a debutant for his debut venture, 12B. Shaam recollects that during {{his first meeting with}} Jeeva, he handed over his portfolio and introduced himself in English, when Jeeva heard him out, and then said, “Repeat <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> in Tamil" [...] and Shaam did, and was subsequently signed on the next day after a meeting with producer Vikram Singh. The promos of the film were critically praised with Shaam signing on to appear on several projects before 12B even released. The film also brought together two of the Tamil film industry's leading actresses in the period in Simran and Jyothika. The pair had previously co-starred in S J Suryah's Vaali (1999) but had shared no scenes, for which Jeeva had been the cinematographer. Vivek also played a pivotal role of a mechanic while Hindi actors Sunil Shetty and Moon Moon Sen were also signed to appear in supporting roles. The film also featured Jeeva's assistant director, Srinath, in a minor supporting role; while Shiva who later appeared in the lead role in Chennai 600028 and Tamil Padam, makes a cameo appearance in a party scene. Shaam's voice was dubbed by television actor Vishwa, while Savitha Reddy dubbed for both Jyothika and Simran.|$|E

5000|$|Shaam {{began his}} career as a model in Bengaluru, {{modelling}} for various ads. Keen on pursuing an acting career, he was vainly searching for acting offers for four years. He then, following the recommendation of his model coordinator Biju Jayadevan, got to meet cinematographer Jeeva's, who was planning to make his directorial debut and was on the lookout for a new face for the film's lead role. Shaam was given the role for the film 12B. Shaam recollects that during his first meeting with Jeeva, he handed over his portfolio and introduced himself in English, when Jeeva heard him out, and then said, [...] "Repeat <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> in Tamil" [...] and Shaam did, and was subsequently signed on the next day after a meeting with producer Vikram Singh. The promos of the film were critically praised with Shaam signing on to appear on several projects before 12B even released. His second feature film, however, the S J Suryah-directed Khushi, in which he appeared in a cameo role, released first, since 12B got stuck in production and released in 2001 only. The film which was a blatant rip-off of Sliding Doors, fetched rave reviews and was seen as a [...] "dream entry" [...] for Shaam, his performance was praised as [...] "apt" [...] His subsequent releases including Vasanth's Hey! Nee Romba Azhaga Irukke (2002), Bala (2002), Anbe Anbe (2003) and Priyadarshan's Lesa Lesa (2003), garnered only average or poor box office returns. His final release of 2003 was Iyarkai by debutant S P Jananathan, which also failed at the box office due to a delayed release, but opened to high critical acclaim, even winning the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil.|$|E

Actors and directors often find Pinter's [...] "pauses and silences" [...] to be daunting elements of performing his plays, leading to much discussion {{of them in}} theatrical and dramatic criticism, and actors {{who have worked with}} Pinter in rehearsals have [...] "reported that he regretted ever starting to write 'Pause' as a stage direction, because it often leads to portentous overacting" [...] (Jacobson). Speaking about their experiences of working with Pinter in rehearsing director Carey Perloff's 1989 double bill of The Birthday Party and Mountain Language (for Classic Stage Company), American actors David Strathairn and Peter Riegert agreed with Jean Stapleton that [...] "Pinter's comments &hellip; 'freed' the cast from feeling reverential about his pauses," [...] and, while Strathairn [...] "believes pauses can be overdone," [...] he also [...] "thinks Pinter's are distinctive: 'The natural ones always seem to be right where he wrote them. His pause or beat comes naturally in the rhythm of the conversation. an actor, you find yourself pausing in mid-sentence, thinking about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> or are going to say.&hellip;' [...] " [...] Perloff said: [...] "He didn't want them weighted that much. &hellip; He kept laughing that everybody made such a big deal about it.' He wanted them honored, she said, but not as 'these long, heavy, psychological pauses, where people look at each other filled with pregnant meaning' [...] " [...] (Jacobson).|$|E
