However, after his conversation with Netanya council members of the Revisionist party, he published an announcement in a newspaper {{saying that he had}} been told by Irgun that the hostages would not be returned until the condemned Irgun members' fate was made clear. Subsequently, the British Army placed a cordon around Netanya and the surrounding area of Emek Hefer, which had 20 outlying settlements, a total area of 15,000 people, and on July 13, began an extensive search effort, codenamed Operation Tiger, to find the sergeants. The area was placed under martial law as 5,000 British troops conducted searches and questioned residents. A total of 1,427 people were interrogated during the operation. Local residents were kept under curfew, and Netanya became a virtual ghost town; its streets were empty save for patrolling British soldiers and armored vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{official}} results were published shortly after midnight 28 December {{and it was}} clear the two candidates to face in a runoff would be Josipović and Bandić all the major candidates gave their speeches. Josipović called for voters to vote for the light, not for the dark, while Bandić insulted Josipović saying he was a pawn of Zoran Milanović and nothing more than his remote-control. The following morning the official campaign for the second round began. Josipović denied being an SDP project calling himself independent and accusing Bandić of being a remote-control of Ivo Sanader, referring among other things to claims by Dragan Primorac that Bandić was the favorite of the former prime minister. Bandić denied the rumors, however the following day the media published a story claiming that Bandić and Sanader had a secret lunch that very day in a Zagreb restaurant. Bandić denied the rumors calling the journalists who published the story liars, saying the media's favorite is Josipović and that they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> discredit him.|$|E
25|$|McKittrick {{remained}} at large for several months, but was finally arrested in Dallas on September 21, 1973, after attempting to cash a forged payroll check at a drive-in bank. Under questioning, she corroborated Vandiver's story, and also told Carpenter and Gamino {{that she had}} met Ash Robinson while she was staying with Lilla Paulus in 1972. McKittrick claimed that Robinson had said he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> get custody of his grandson, but {{that the only way}} that would happen was if Hill was dead. She said that Robinson and Paulus had met frequently at Ben Taub Hospital, where money was handed over, and that Robinson had also visited Paulus at her home, where he gave her plans of Hill's home and $7,000 {{on the day of the}} shooting. McKittrick was scheduled to be tried in 1974, alongside Paulus. However, Paulus's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, argued for Vandiver's evidence to be dismissed under the Sixth Amendment, which gives a defendant the right to confront their accuser; the request was granted. DeGuerin also asked for McKittrick's evidence against Paulus to be ruled as inadmissible. But although this request was also granted, presiding Judge Price ruled that McKittrick's evidence could be used in the state's case against her. McKittrick's attorney, John Caperton, then sought consensus for her to enter a not guilty plea, but accept a guilty verdict, something to which Bennett agreed. McKittrick was convicted of being Vandiver's getaway driver and given a ten-year jail sentence. She was paroled after serving five years.|$|E

500|$|... "Fight for You" [...] is an urban-pop ballad with {{a length}} of four minutes and two seconds.

The song {{contains}} a sample of the song [...] "Africa" [...] (1982) by American rock band Toto. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Fight for You" [...] features [...] "airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats".

500|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} Barbara Gordon is her sense of morality, which {{differs from that of}} Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. She has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon's Birds of Prey issue #10, [...] "State of War", which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated an interview that [...] "he's less morally conflicted than other characters. She's very 'means to an end' oriented. She sees that sometimes you have to kill to save lives. She's not comfortable with that but accepts it. She <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> avoid using deadly force but, when push comes to shove, she'll drop the hammer." [...] She demonstrates a similar moral ambiguity in Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Of Like Minds when she argues with Black Canary over using illegally obtained information, which denies criminals the right of due process. Although the Huntress has never been opposed to using lethal force, she also comes into conflict with Oracle over the fact that she will use the psychological impact of a mission to subconsciously manipulate her field agents into conforming to her ideology.|$|E

On the way, Clarke is haunted by visions of Finn. Bellamy tries to convince Clarke {{to let him go}} to Mount Weather as an inside man; Clarke says she cannot lose him too. When they arrive at the village, Clarke burns Finn's corpse, along with the corpses of those he killed, in a traditional Grounder funeral. While grieving, Lexa tells Clarke of Costia, her own past love who was tortured and killed by Lexa's enemy, who believed she knew Lexa's secrets. She tells Clarke that love is weakness. At a dinner, Kane gifts Lexa with a bottle of liquor. When Gustus, her right hand, tests it for her, he appears to be poisoned, leading Lexa to believe it was an assassination attempt by the Sky People. Clarke immediately thinks it was Raven, as she was Finn's former girlfriend and loved him. Clarke confronts her; Raven punches Clarke for accusing her of doing it.
