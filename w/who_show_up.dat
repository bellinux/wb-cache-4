Doris Toumarkine of Film Journal International called the movie a [...] "well-told but troubling story impressively wrapped for audiences <b>who</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> in theatres for do-good cinema of a high order". Leigh Paatsch of News.com.au said, [...] "it is Bolkovac's ferocious will to right so many wrongs (expertly {{channelled}} by Weisz) that keeps you glued to the screen". Stephenie Foster of The Huffington Post gave the film a highly-favorable review: ...|$|E
2500|$|The team is {{considered}} a strong but unpredictable team. Traditionally Pakistani cricket has been filled with players of great talent but limited discipline, making them a team which could play inspirational cricket one day and then perform less than ordinarily another day. In particular, the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry has always been emotionally charged and provide for intriguing contests, as talented teams and players {{from both sides of}} the border elevate their game to new levels to produce high-quality cricket. Pakistani contests with India in the Cricket World Cup have seen packed stadiums and elevated atmospheres no matter where the World Cup has been held. The team is well supported both at home and abroad, especially in the United Kingdom where British Pakistanis have formed a fan-club called the [...] "Stani Army", <b>who</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> to matches across the country and provide raucous support. The Stani Army also take part in charity initiatives for needy Pakistanis, including annual friendly cricket matches against British Indian members of the similar [...] "Bharat Army".|$|E
2500|$|Jackson and Rose {{were both}} banned from MLB for life for actions related to {{gambling}} {{on their own}} teams—Jackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to lose the 1919 World Series intentionally, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the Cincinnati Reds when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on {{a game in which}} a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his 2004 autobiography. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer Bill James, though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared {{the people who want to}} put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to [...] "those women <b>who</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer".|$|E

2500|$|The CDC’s initial {{reaction}} to calls of the revising the AIDS definition included setting {{the threshold of}} AIDS {{for both men and}} women at a T cell count of under 200. However, McGovern dismissed this suggestion. “Lots of women <b>who</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> at hospitals don’t get T cells taken. No one knows they have HIV. I knew how many of our clients were dying of AIDS and not counted.” [...] Rather, McGovern, along with the ACLU and the New Jersey Women and AIDS Network, called for adding fifteen conditions to the list of the CDC’s surveillance case definition, which was eventually adopted in January 1993. Six months later, the Clinton administration revised federal criteria for evaluating HIV status and making it easier for women with AIDS to secure Social Security benefits. The Women’s Caucus’ role in altering the CDC’s definition helped to not only drastically increase availability of federal benefits to American women, but helped uncover a more accurate number of HIV/AIDS infected women in the United States; “under the new model, the number of women with AIDS in the United States increased almost 50 percent.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A Washington Post {{reviewer}} {{discussed how}} Ginsberg and Crenson charted the declining importance of citizens to political {{and public life}} in the United States. People are better described as consumers, not citizens. Americans no longer embrace civic responsibility. Many people don't bother to vote, according to one report. The authors argue that the public has chosen to stay aloof from government which it sees as [...] "another service provider." [...] Many factors are blamed for causing this shift, including fewer patronage jobs. Candidates use polls {{to focus on the}} dwindling number of persons <b>who</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> to vote. Increasing court involvement is blamed, as well, for diminishing the role of public sentiment. The authors suggest that the 1960s civil rights movement has morphed into a litigation struggle about rights and a [...] "middle class" [...] prerogative. Reviewer Kerry Lauerman suggested Ginsberg and Crenson [...] "overstate on occasion," [...] such as characterizing the issues of AIDS, breast cancer, and gun violence as [...] "the causes of the comfortable." [...] The reviewer criticized the writing style as sometimes [...] "turgid" [...] but concluded overall that the analysis was [...] "thoughtful and useful", but needed more analysis {{of the role of the}} media.|$|E
