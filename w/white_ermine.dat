25|$|Traditionally {{during the}} Octave of Easter, the Pope wears the white paschal mozzetta, {{which is of}} white damask silk trimmed with <b>white</b> <b>ermine.</b> While the paschal mozzetta fell out of use during the pontificate of Pope John Paul II, it was {{returned}} to use in 2008 by Pope Benedict XVI.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Brittany, ermine plain, {{was adopted}} by John III in 1316. Ermine {{had been used in}} Brittany long before, and there is no clue about its origin. It was {{probably}} chosen by the dukes because of its similarity with the French fleur-de-lis. The ermine, or stoat, as an animal became the badge of John IV {{at the end of the}} 14th century. It appeared later on numerous locations, including churches and castles. According to popular traditions, Anne of Brittany was hunting with her court when she saw a <b>white</b> <b>ermine</b> who preferred to die than to cross a dirty marsh. This episode would have inspired the duchess' motto : [...] "Potius mori quam foedari" [...] ("rather death than dishonour"). The motto has later been reused by Breton regiments, local World War II Resistants and cultural movements.|$|E
2500|$|British armory recognizes three {{variations}} of ermine. [...] A black field powdered with <b>white</b> <b>ermine</b> spots is termed ermines (Fr. contre-hermine, Ger. gegen-hermelin); a gold field with black ermine spots is erminois, {{and a black}} field with gold ermine spots is pean. [...] These are not regarded as separate furs, but merely {{variations of}} ermine. [...] Neither erminois nor pean are known by distinctive names outside of British armory; instead they are regarded as a field semé of ermine spots. [...] In French heraldry, erminois would be blazoned d'Or, semé d'hermines de sable, while pean would be de Sable, semé d'hermines d'or. [...] Especially in continental heraldry, a field of any tincture may be semé of ermine spots, producing a pattern indistinguishable from ermine, except {{by virtue of the}} tinctures used; but these should be treated as other fields semé, rather than heraldic furs.|$|E
50|$|The Proctors {{wear the}} ancient {{form of the}} BA hood with their gown. The hood is in the Belfast simple-shape and lined with <b>ermine</b> (<b>white</b> fur with black spots).|$|R
5000|$|They had a flag of <b>white</b> gilded <b>ermine,</b> {{while the}} sorcerers' flag was yellow with four devils {{depicted}} on it. All Benandanti were born [...] "with the shirt," [...] that is, enveloped in a caul. When the Inquisition following their stereotyped {{model of the}} Sabbath asked if the [...] "angel" [...] promised them delicious courses, women, and other salacious entertainments, the defendants proudly denied such insinuations.|$|R
60|$|A girl entered. She {{was proud}} and mincing in her deportment. Her face was handsome, but too haughty for a child. She wore a <b>white</b> coat, with <b>ermine</b> tippet, muff, and hat. Her {{long brown hair}} hung twining down her back.|$|R
60|$|Her weed was of samite fine, Her {{mantle of}} <b>white</b> <b>ermine,</b> Green silk her hose; Her shoon with silver gay, Her sandals flowers of May, Laced small and close.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bears'--big brown bears {{that father}} {{killed in a}} cave--and wolves' {{and those of the}} little ermine and sable that we trap. We get much, much for the <b>white</b> <b>ermine</b> and his black tail. Father's coming in another sledge with, oh! such a big pile. Don't you hear his dogs yelp? We'll win the race yet! Ugh! hoo! hoo! ho-o-o-o!--On! on! lazy ones, on, I say! don't let the old dogs catch the young ones!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Nine royal knights {{in equal}} rank succeed, [...] Each warrior {{mounted on a}} fiery steed; [...] In golden armour glorious to behold; [...] The rivets of their arms were nail'd with gold. [...] Their surcoats of <b>white</b> <b>ermine</b> fur were made; [...] With cloth of gold between, that cast a {{glittering}} shade. [...] The trappings of their steeds were of the same; [...] 260 [...] The golden fringe even set the ground on flame, [...] And drew a precious trail: a crown divine [...] Of laurel did about their temples twine.|$|E
5000|$|Other varieties, {{including}} <b>white,</b> black, <b>ermine,</b> cuckoo, splash {{and blue}} also exist. Hens are good winter layers of medium-sized, light brown to pinkish eggs. Some cocks are the quietest of all breeds and Faverolles are {{also known for}} their extreme docility. As a result, they tend to get bullied in a mixed flock for being so gentle and friendly. They thrive in groups with other Faverolles, or perhaps, with other docile breeds such as the Sussex.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to sable, black and <b>white</b> fox, <b>ermine,</b> beaver, squirrel, lynx, wolf, wolverine, rabbit, marten, walrus, sea otter, and polar bear were also hunted for their pelts. Most of these fur bearing animals {{are found in}} the Siberian taiga, except for the sea otters and walrus that were found on the North Pacific coasts. In more recent times, fur farming has been used to breed animals for their fur. Silver fox farms were started in 1936, mostly in Yakutia. These farms eliminated some of the dangers and uncertainties involved with hunting in the wilderness.|$|R
50|$|This altarpiece {{includes}} a remarkable use of symbolic animals and plants. The curtains framing the work are trimmed with ermine fur, which is clear through {{the inclusion of}} the black tips on the <b>white</b> fur. The <b>ermine</b> is often used in religious art as a symbol of purity and chasity, as seen in Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with the ermine. The ermine (also known as a weasel) has been connected to the conception of Christ.|$|R
60|$|The {{principle}} covers, {{however, the}} whole of modern life. Morris and the merely aesthetic mediaevalists always indicated that a crowd {{in the time of}} Chaucer would have been brightly clad and glittering, compared with a crowd in the time of Queen Victoria. I am not so sure that the real distinction is here. There would be brown frocks of friars in the first scene as well as brown bowlers of clerks in the second. There would be purple plumes of factory girls in the second scene as well as purple lenten vestments in the first. There would be white waistcoats against white ermine; gold watch chains against gold lions. The real difference is this: that the brown earth-color of the monk's coat was instinctively chosen to express labor and humility, whereas the brown color of the clerk's hat was not chosen to express anything. The monk did mean to say that he robed himself in dust. I am sure the clerk does not mean to say that he crowns himself with clay. He is not putting dust on his head, as the only diadem of man. Purple, at once rich and somber, does suggest a triumph temporarily eclipsed by a tragedy. But the factory girl does not intend her hat to express a triumph temporarily eclipsed by a tragedy; far from it. <b>White</b> <b>ermine</b> was meant to express moral purity; white waistcoats were not. Gold lions do suggest a flaming magnanimity; gold watch chains do not. The point is not that we have lost the material hues, but that we have lost the trick of turning them to the best advantage. We are not like children who have lost their paint box and are left alone with a gray lead-pencil. We are like children who have mixed all the colors in the paint-box together and lost the paper of instructions. Even then (I do not deny) one has some fun.|$|E

50|$|Pope Benedict XVI also {{restored}} {{the use of}} all three forms of the papal mozzetta. During his pontificate Benedict wore the winter papal mozzetta and the paschal mozzetta, both of which had last been last worn by Pope Paul VI. The winter papal mozzetta is of red velvet trimmed with <b>white</b> <b>ermine,</b> and the paschal mozzetta, worn only during the Eastertide, is of white damask silk trimmed with <b>white</b> <b>ermine.</b>|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{his wife}} {{became more and}} more an invalid; the little Alvina was a pretty, growing child. Woodhouse was really {{impressed}} by the sight of Mrs. Houghton, small, pale and withheld, taking a walk with her dainty little girl, so fresh in an ermine tippet and a muff. Mrs. Houghton in shiny black bear's-fur, the child in the <b>white</b> and spotted <b>ermine,</b> passing silent and shadowy down the street, made an impression which the people did not forget.|$|R
60|$|Fedora sauntered {{slowly around}} the rooms, leaning over and staking a gold plaque here and there. She was dressed {{as usual in}} <b>white,</b> with an <b>ermine</b> turban hat and stole and an {{enormous}} muff. Her hair seemed more golden than ever beneath its snow-white setting, and her complexion more dazzling. She seemed utterly unconscious of the admiration which her appearance evoked, and she passed Lane without apparently observing him. A moment afterwards, however, he moved to her side and addressed her.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the right}} panel St. Catherine is {{presented}} as almost {{the essence of a}} gothic princess. She stands reading a book in [...] "ravishing modesty", with unbound blonde hair, which is topped with an elaborate jewelled crown very similar to that in the Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, combined with her rich blue gown and tabard of <b>white</b> draped <b>ermine</b> showing her as the princess she was. A golden chain with a jewelled pendant hangs from her neck. The attributes associated with her are included in her depiction. In her right hand, she holds the sword used for her beheading and at her feet lies the breaking wheel on which she was tortured. Like the woman in van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait she is [...] "fashionably pear-shaped"; Heath describes her attire as [...] "more dazzling than the Virgin's", mirroring St. Michael's splendid armour on the opposite panel.|$|R

50|$|His {{music was}} {{originally}} {{inspired by the}} works of Breton musicians Glenmor and Alan Stivell. The title song from his first album, La blanche Hermine, the <b>White</b> <b>Ermine</b> being the national emblem of Brittany, became an anthem for Bretons.|$|E
50|$|Spilosoma lubricipeda, the <b>white</b> <b>ermine,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Erebidae. It is found {{throughout}} the temperate belt of Eurasia from Europe through Kazakhstan and southern Siberia to Amur Region, China, Korea and Japan. In China several sibling species occur.|$|E
60|$|The {{peaceful}} {{night had}} a good effect on them all; danger, being unseen, seemed far off. At times {{it was hard to}} realise that it had ever been. With courage restored, Adam rose early and walked along the Brow, seeing no change in the signs of life in Castra Regis. What he did see, to his wonder and concern, on his returning homeward, was Lady Arabella, in her tight-fitting <b>white</b> dress and <b>ermine</b> collar, but without her emeralds; she was emerging from the gate of Diana's Grove and walking towards the Castle. Pondering on this and trying to find some meaning in it, occupied his thoughts till he joined Mimi and Sir Nathaniel at breakfast. They began the meal in silence. What had been had been, and was known to them all. Moreover, it was not a pleasant topic.|$|R
5000|$|Inaugurated in 1883, Peleș Castle is {{not only}} a {{pleasant}} place during summer time; it has been conceived to be also a national monument, meant to keep the trophies of the Plevna victory, which explains the simple but majestic style. The castle's courtyard - Bramantes type - with a fountain in the middle, in the most accurate Renaissance style, pleasantly surprises the visitor. The courtyard has a merry decoration, made out of plants and flowers; all round, the building's facades are animated by elegant drawings. The interior of the castle is a true wonder, due to the beauty and richness of the sculpted wood and the stained glass windows. As you get in the vestibule, you are on the Honor Staircase, in front of the most important rulers of old Romania: Holy Stephen the Great, and Michael the Brave. In a proud attitude, wearing whether a fur cap or with the gold crown on their heads, they impress through the brilliant dressing, in which the <b>white</b> of <b>ermine</b> blends with the emerald green or the red of the large mantle. On the right and on left side of the two rulers, as servant knights, four shield bearers carry the Romanian Provinces escutcheons. Inside the Queen's library, over the groups of children symbolizing poetry and science, there is the image of Ulfilas (311-383 AD) a Goth religious ruler, from the northern side of Danube River, translating the Bible in their language and bringing his contribution in spreading Christianity, a Christian apostle of the Romans, and the image of Dante Alighieri, the creator of western poetry. Passing the library and getting into the dormitory, we will meet the image of Genies and Allegories of Painting and Music, as well as a series of legendary themes. Inside the apartments reserved for the honor guests, a number of coat-of-arms were shining through their heraldic abundance, speaking about the ancestors of the Royal Family. But among all, the glass paintings from the Peleș Castle are, beyond any doubt, the most profound and shining. Here, the subjects are taken out of Alecsandri's poetry.|$|R
5000|$|A king, whose kingdom was {{constantly}} imperiled by another king, had an only son {{who had fallen}} in love with a slave, Starlight. Her family was quite unknown, but he cared nothing for anything but her. Angry, the queen had the slave imprisoned in a tower. A beautiful white cat kept her company. The prince despaired. His father, because of a new attack, implored him to lead the army. The prince did, and the father promised that no one had harmed Starlight and that he would see her when he returned. He led the army and utterly defeated the other king's, capturing the king himself, but the king reneged on his promise. The prince freed the captive king, and the king and queen had him imprisoned. One day, Starlight confided to her cat that she was certain he had forgotten her, and the cat answered that he was also imprisoned. The cat then revealed herself as the fairy <b>Ermine</b> <b>White,</b> and told her that she was a princess. She gave her a box to be opened in her worst need, turned the tower in a stair for her escape, and made her promise to never tell who had freed her. She found the prince, and they concluded that she had to hide, which would cause his parents to free him, and send him a message of her refuge. The white cat warned them that the king's men were coming, and Starlight fled.|$|R

5000|$|Peter Lawford was at {{the event}} that night to {{introduce}} Monroe. He made a play on the actress's reputation for tardiness by giving her a number of introductions throughout the night, after which she did not appear on stage. When Monroe finally appeared in a spotlight, Lawford introduced her as the [...] "late Marilyn Monroe". Monroe peeled off her <b>white</b> <b>ermine</b> fur coat, revealing the dress, and the audience gasped.|$|E
50|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times. They were granted on 11 November 1983. The arms show a gold-colored wooden pole {{in the center}} with black and <b>white</b> <b>ermine</b> {{on each side of}} the pole. This was chosen as a symbol for forestry and fur farming. In the 17th century, the municipality exported many tall trees to the Dutch Republic, where they were used for shipbuilding. The ermine is a canting for the many animals in the forests.|$|E
50|$|The pope wears five {{versions}} of the mozzetta: the summer mozzetta, which is of red satin; the winter mozzetta, which is of red velvet trimmed with <b>white</b> <b>ermine</b> fur; the red serge mozzetta, which is worn during Masses for the deceased; the red clothed mozzetta, which is worn during the Lenten and Advent season; and the Paschal mozzetta, which is of white damask silk trimmed with white fur. The Paschal mozzetta is worn only during Eastertide.|$|E
50|$|Papal camauros are of red wool or velvet with <b>white</b> <b>ermine</b> {{trim and}} are worn, usually in winter, {{in place of}} the zucchetto, which in turn takes the place of the biretta worn by other members of the clergy. Like the biretta worn by lower clergy and the {{mortarboard}} worn by academics, the camauro derives from the academic cap (the pileus), originally worn to protect tonsured clerical heads from the cold. It is often worn with a red mozzetta, also sometimes fur-lined.|$|E

Lyra {{is described}} as having blue eyes and blond hair, along with being short for her age and quite thin but is still quite attractive. She is also brave, curious, and crafty. Her dæmon is Pantalaimon, nicknamed Pan. Because Lyra is still a child, Pan is still capable of changing into any shape he wishes (often a brown moth, a wildcat, a <b>white</b> <b>ermine,</b> or a mouse). Lyra has been prophesied by the witches to help the balance of life, but must do so without being aware of her destiny.|$|E

In the chaos following, he ends up {{unconscious}} in a garbage can, where college student Haruka Tsuchiya finds him. Mistaking him for a ferret, Tsuchiya takes Okojo home with him. At the Shiawase apartment complex, Okojo meets other pets, including the gerbil Chorori, and the various eccentric human tenants.With his friends, Okojo struggles to adapt to life with humans, vacuum cleaners, {{and all the other}} things that come with human society.The comedy is largely reliant on absurdity and Okojo's tendency towards melodrama.|$|E

In spite of his professed disdain for them, Okojo finds himself becoming very attached to his extended family of humans and animals. He takes himself very seriously, and as such has a quick temper and is prone to melodrama. When Okojo must be taken to the local veterinarian, Yuuta gives Okojo the name [...] "Kojopii," [...] but the other animals continue to call him [...] "Okojo-san." [...] Saeki Shun, who initially thought Okojo was a mouse, calls him [...] "Chuuchun." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{painting}} shows a young knight, {{surrounded by}} a rather crowded series of symbols. The heron caught in the sky by a hawk might hint at this knight's death in battle, also alluded to by his posture, which recalls that of a funerary statue; an alternative theory {{is that this is}} a memorial portrait of a person already dead. The other knight with a lance might then be the same person during his life. In the left lower corner is a <b>white</b> <b>ermine</b> and a scroll stating [...] "I prefer to die rather than to incur dishonour" [...] (malo mori quam foedari). The symbolism of these and the other animals and plants have been much discussed by art historians.|$|E
50|$|In the 16th century, a prime sable pelt {{sold for}} ten times what a peasant family could earn in a year, {{and a black}} fox fetched up to ten times the price of sable. Private traders sold roughly 350,000 rubles' worth of Siberian furs {{annually}} during the seventeenth century. In comparison, a peasant family of four earned less than one ruble a year from forty acres of good farmland. A few good fox pelts in 1623 could buy fifty acres of land, a decent cabin, five horses, ten head of cattle, twenty sheep, and still have capital left over. In the 1990s, <b>white</b> <b>ermine</b> pelts were worth 16 rubles, squirrel pelts were worth 5 rubles, and sable pelts were worth 150 rubles. These furs have even historically been used as currency, and fur-lined cloaks and hats were a signature of Russian royalty.|$|E
