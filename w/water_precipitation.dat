Mixing <b>precipitation</b> can be classified into two major different types: mixing precipitation in a strict sense and mixing precipitation in a broad sense.

50|$|Virga {{can cause}} varying weather effects, because as rain is changed from liquid to vapor form, it removes {{heat from the}} air due to the high heat of {{vaporization}} of <b>water.</b> <b>Precipitation</b> falling into these cooling down drafts may eventually reach the ground. In some instances, these pockets of colder air can descend rapidly, creating a wet or dry microburst which can be extremely hazardous to aviation. Conversely, precipitation evaporating at high altitude can compressionally heat as it falls, and result in a gusty downburst which may substantially and rapidly warm the surface temperature. This fairly rare phenomenon, a heat burst, also tends to be of exceedingly dry air.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Water {{in forest}} {{ecosystems}} can {{be present in}} various forms. The hydrological water cycle unfolds via fundamental hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration, precipitation, infiltration and outflow. Certain infrastructure works and recent climate changes within lowland forest areas have resulted in changes in flood water and ground water trends, and in quantities of precipitation and evapotranspiration. One of the chemical water quality indicators {{is the presence of}} metals in water. Higher metal concentrations in natural waters are undesirable since they are polluters of aquatic systems and detrimental to living organisms. Particularly dangerous are cadmium and lead. The objective of this paper was to analyse watercourse levels, ground water depths, and relations between <b>precipitation</b> <b>waters,</b> flood waters, ground waters, relative air humidity and evapotranspiration. An additional objective was to analyse the pollution of <b>precipitation</b> and flood <b>waters</b> in lowland forest ecosystems. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in the Posavina region in Croatia. Precipitation data from Nova Gradiška meteorological station, watercourse levels of the Sava River and ground water depth data from piezometer stations were used in the analysis of the hydrological relations. For <b>water</b> quality analysis, <b>precipitation</b> was collected at six sample sites during the spring of 2015 and 2016. Flood <b>water</b> and <b>precipitation</b> were collected in three repetitions during the spring of 2015 and 2016. Results: Trends of the Sava River water levels and ground water levels dropped significantly. The precipitation volume trend in the study area was positive, but not statistically significant, while evapotranspiration amounts increased significantly. Conclusions: A significant correlation has been found between particular water forms in the hydrological cycle, i. e. between <b>precipitation</b> <b>waters,</b> flood waters and ground waters, and between relative air humidity and evapotranspiration. No pollution of <b>precipitation</b> <b>waters</b> and flood waters with metals was found...|$|R

50|$|A common {{aspect of}} {{computer}} games that model {{some type of}} conflict is the explosion. Early computer games used the simple expedient of repeating the same explosion in each circumstance. However, {{in the real world}} an explosion can vary depending on the terrain, altitude of the explosion, and the type of solid bodies being impacted. Depending on the processing power available, the effects of the explosion can be modeled as the split and shattered components propelled by the expanding gas. This is modelled by means of a particle system simulation. A particle system model allows a variety of other physical phenomena to be simulated, including smoke, moving <b>water,</b> <b>precipitation,</b> and so forth. The individual particles within the system are modelled using the other elements of the physics simulation rules, with the limitation that the number of particles that can be simulated is restricted by the computing power of the hardware. Thus explosions may need to be modelled as a small set of large particles, rather than the more accurate huge number of fine particles.|$|E
