5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, {{demand for}} {{alkaline}} substances increased. A new industrial process developed by Nicolas Leblanc of Issoundun, France enabled cheap large-scale production of sodium carbonate (soda ash). In this Leblanc process, common salt {{is converted to}} soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, releasing hydrogen chloride as a by-product. Until the British Alkali Act 1863 and similar legislation in other countries, the excess HCl was vented into the air. After {{the passage of the}} act, soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.|$|E

25|$|As an example, {{suppose a}} {{spacecraft}} equipped {{with two or}} more dual-gimbal CMGs experiences a transient unwanted torque, perhaps caused by reaction from venting <b>waste</b> <b>gas,</b> tending to make it roll clockwise about its forward axis and thus increase its angular momentum along that axis. Then the CMG control program will command the gimbal motors of the CMGs to slant the rotors' spin axes gradually more and more forward, so that the angular momentum vectors of the rotors point more nearly along the forward axis. While this gradual change in rotor spin direction is in progress, the rotors will be creating gyroscopic torques whose resultant is anticlockwise about the forward axis, holding the spacecraft steady against the unwanted <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> torque.|$|E
25|$|A {{waste heat}} {{recovery}} unit (WHRU) is a heat exchanger that recovers heat from a hot gas stream while transferring it to a working medium, typically water or oils.

There is a legal requirement to scavenge <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> to maintain the level of <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> in the Operating Room below the legally acceptable limit. For example, in the UK the limits are typically 100ppm for nitrous oxide and 50ppm for halogenated volatile anaesthetic agents (except halothane which is 10ppm). Other jurisdictions have different requirements for local environmental contamination, for example, nitrous oxide maximum 25ppm and halogenated volatile gases maximum 2ppm. In addition to the legal requirement there is an Occupational Health requirement to maintain a safe workplace and limit exposure to potentially harmful gases.|$|R

25|$|Activated carbon is {{used for}} {{adsorption}} of organic substances and non-polar adsorbates {{and it is also}} usually used for <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> (and waste water) treatment. It is the most widely used adsorbent since most of its chemical (e.g. surface groups) and physical properties (e.g. pore size distribution and surface area) can be tuned according to what is needed. Its usefulness also derives from its large micropore (and sometimes mesopore) volume and the resulting high surface area.|$|E
25|$|Recoverable {{materials}} that are organic in nature, such as plant material, food scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through composting and digestion processes to decompose the organic matter.

In addition, <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See resource recovery).|$|E

Combustion of the <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> to produce steam has two very important rewards - energy conservation and pollution abatement. Energy conservation is achieved by using <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> in place of fuel oil to produce the steam required by the various plants. Pollution abatement {{is due to the}} combustion of the <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> which destroys most of the pollutants. This steam project has provided substantial energy conservation for the carbon black plant because the energy can be subtracted from the total energy used by the plant in determining the energy to produce carbon black.

In the early 20th century the Leblanc process was effectively replaced by the Solvay process, which did not produce HCl. However, hydrogen chloride production continued as a step in hydrochloric acid production.|$|E
500|$|Hot Blast was {{the single}} most {{important}} advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace {{and was one of the}} most important technologies developed during the Industrial Revolution. [...] Hot blast was patented by James Beaumont Neilson at Wilsontown Ironworks in Scotland in 1828.

[...] Within a few decades, the practice was to have a [...] "stove" [...] as large as the furnace next to it into which the <b>waste</b> <b>gas</b> (containing CO) from the furnace was directed and burnt.

40|$|Abstract—In {{the field}} of {{industrial}} control, {{there has been a}} significant increase in the use of AI based techniques. For various control problems there has been successful implementation of different Intelligent techniques like Fuzzy Logic, Artificial Neural Network and other Hybrids. One of the major byproducts recovered from crude oil is sulfur. Sulfur is recovered from crude oil using the Modified Clause process, upto 98 percent of the sulfur can be recovered by this method. The remaining 2 percent of the sulfur is one of the major constituents of <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> and is released into the atmosphere. <b>Waste</b> <b>gases</b> cannot be directly released into the atmosphere as it has sulfur compounds and other harmful constituents. Oxidizing <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> before releasing it into the atmosphere makes it safe for the environment. Oxidization of <b>waste</b> <b>gases</b> is done by the process of incineration. The incineration process requires fuel gas to achieve this. To use minimum fuel gas and to maximize oxidization, the incinerator needs to be optimized. This paper presents a neural network which is modeled for optimal control of incinerator in Sulfur Recovery Block of refineries. An Artificial Neural Network based Inverse Plant is modeled to achieve optimal control. The Neural Network model was developed by using the neural network tool box in MATLAB...|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} anesthetic machine is to provide anesthetic gas at a constant pressure, oxygen for breathing and to remove carbon dioxide or other waste anesthetic gases. [...] Since inhalational anaesthetics are flammable, various checklists {{have been developed to}} confirm that the machine is ready for use, that the safety features are active and the electrical hazards are removed. Intravenous anesthetic is delivered either by bolus doses or an infusion pump. There are also many smaller instruments used in airway management and monitoring the patient.

[...] The [...] framework was divided into sixteen 10m (32ft 9in) bays, with an intermediate frame between each of the principal wire-braced ring frames to reduce lateral loads on the triangular section longitudinal girders, of which there were 17, the uppermost of which was doubled to form a W-section girder. [...] The 16 gasbags were usually made from three layers of goldbeater's skin on a cotton backing, but shortages meant that sometimes heavier rubberised cotton was used instead.

[...] Some gasbags were also fitted with a manually operated manoeuvering valve at the top. [...] The ship was controlled from the forward gondola, which was divided into two structurally separate sections in order to avoid transmission of engine vibration to the crew accommodation: the small gap between the two sections was faired over with fabric. [...] The forward section was divided into three compartments, with the control area at the front; aft of this was the radio compartment, and then the officer's rest area, the windows of which had a machine-gun mounting either side.

[...] Further defensive armament consisted of a single machine gun in a small cockpit at the stern behind the rudders and a gun position mounting two or three machine guns on top of the hull, which was reached by a ladder from the forward gondola.
