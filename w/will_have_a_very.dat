25|$|The {{solar eclipse}} of August 12, 2045 <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> similar path of totality over the U.S. to the 2017 eclipse: about 400km (250mi) to the southwest, also {{crossing}} the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the country; however, totality {{will be more}} than twice as long.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler, {{who would}} have been {{eligible}} to play for Israel in the 2013 World Baseball Classic because of his Jewish heritage, said: [...] "Wow, I would be happy to play for Team Israel.... The truth is that if a proposal comes from Team USA to play for them, I <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> difficult decision to make. Youk , Braun , and I could make a fantastic team. I am sure that I'll talk it over with Youk – we always laugh about things like this." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Free and Accepted Masons of The SA Lodge of Friendship No.613 {{are about}} to bespeak an evening's {{entertainment}} at the Theatre {{for the benefit of}} the Hospital. [...] The Masons will appear in their Masonic costumes, and the ladies of their families will wear light blue ribands and aprons, so that the house <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> novel and imposing appearance, and it is hoped that it may prove a benefit, to enable the members to present a very handsome donation to that very valuable institution.|$|E
50|$|The {{final period}} of Roman Britain saw an {{apparent}} increase in attacks by land and sea, the raiders including the Picts, Scotti and the mysterious Attacotti whose origins are not certain. These raids <b>will</b> <b>have</b> also targeted the tribes of southern Scotland. The supposed final withdrawal of Roman forces around 410 {{is unlikely to}} have been of military impact on the Damnonii, although the withdrawal of pay from the residual Wall garrison <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> considerable economic effect.|$|R

50|$|An {{estimated}} 7,000 Sikhs {{were killed}} and 3,000 captured during this operation. The captives were marched back to Lahore, paraded {{in the streets and}} publicly beheaded. Given the small numbers of the Sikhs in those days of persecution, the losses <b>will</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> <b>very</b> substantial proportion of their population, perhaps a quarter to a third of the total.|$|R
2500|$|In {{multicellular}} {{storms and}} squall lines, the mid-level jet stream is often intersecting {{the line and}} its dry air introduced into the cloud is negatively unstable. [...] This results in a drying of the cloudy air in the region where the jet plunge groundward. On the back edge of the line, this shows as clear notches where one can find stronger downdrafts at the surface. [...] These kind of lines <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> characteristic undulating pattern caused by the interference of the gusts fronts coming {{from different parts of}} the line.|$|E
2500|$|If a dog is too large, he {{will not}} be able to get past turns in the tunnel, and will have to be dug to every few feet. [...] If a dog has to dig to the quarry when the tunnel {{tightens}} down (as it invariably will), the dog will have to push dirt behind it to progress, which can result in the dog being “bottled” by dirt from behind. [...] In such a situation the dog <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> difficult time getting out on its own if it cannot turn around.|$|E
2500|$|On June 9, 2011, Barr {{announced}} that he would again challenge Chandler for his seat in the 2012 elections. The announcement was immediately hailed by Texas Congressman Pete Sessions, chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee, who said, [...] "we need Republicans like Andy Barr to join us in Congress to cut spending, lower taxes and reduce the national debt." [...] Chandler responded to the announcement by declaring, [...] "Next year, voters <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> simple choice to make: whether to protect and save Social Security and Medicare, or to end them," [...] an allusion to Barr's publicly expressed support for Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan's budget proposal.|$|E

30|$|Notice that, if α > 1 agents with <b>a</b> high {{out-degree}} <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{even higher}} in-degree, whereas α < 0 implies that agents {{with a high}} out-degree <b>will</b> typically <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low in-degree.

5000|$|At {{the time}} of his death Balmain Tigers Chairman David Trodden {{released}} the following statement: [...] "The Tigers have lost one of the most famous and most respected figures in the history of our club.

2500|$|A grassed {{waterway}} reduces {{soil erosion}} and captures most nutrients and pesticides {{that would normally}} wash out of crop fields and into major waters. These waterways help to carry surface water at a non-erosive velocity to an area where {{it will have a}} stable outlet. [...] Outlets must be adequate enough to allow water to drain without ponding or flooding the area being protected, while also preventing erosion of the water into the outlet which can be accomplished through the use of riprap. [...] A limitation is during large runoff events, when soil is saturated, grassed waterways <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> concentrated flow of water making them not as effective during high rainfalls. Grassed waterways require very little maintenance once they are introduced with major upkeep being mowing of the grass and reseeding. Farm machinery and cattle can cross these waterways but it may be hazardous during wet periods. One of the major disadvantages of waterways are actually getting them established. A late summer or early fall seeding when rainfall is minimal is recommended to allow the seed to have the best chance at establishing a root system.|$|E

40|$|Any {{isolated}} {{signal of}} a gene is hard to predict. Current methods for promoter prediction, for instance, <b>will</b> <b>have</b> either <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low specificity or <b>a</b> <b>very</b> bad sensitivity, such that they will either predict {{a huge number of}} false positives (fake promoters) or <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small number of true promoters.

25|$|Higher {{fermentation}} temperatures {{which are}} more conducive to LAB growth and an earlier completion of MLF: The optimal temperatures for malolactic fermentation are between 20 and 37°C (68 and 98.6°F), while the process is significantly inhibited at temperatures below 15°C (59°F). Wine stored in the barrels in the cellar during the winter following fermentation <b>will</b> often <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> prolonged malolactic fermentation due to the cool cellar temperatures.|$|R
50|$|The plate-loaded {{machines}} <b>will</b> often <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high mechanical advantage, due to {{the need}} to make room for large plates over a large range of motion following a path that causes them to converge at one end or the other. Also, the motion will generally not be vertical, and the net resistance is equal to the cosine of the angle at which it is moving relative to vertical.|$|R

50|$|Powerchairs are {{commonly}} divided by their access capabilities. An indoor-chair may only reliably {{be able to}} cross completely flat surfaces, limiting them to household use. An indoor-outdoor chair is less limited, but may have restricted range or {{ability to deal with}} slopes or uneven surfaces. An outdoor chair is more capable, but <b>will</b> still <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> restricted ability to deal with rough terrain. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> few specialist designs offer a true cross-country capability.|$|R

5000|$|Auxiliary Board Members appoint [...] "assistants" [...] {{that operate}} {{on their behalf}} at the {{grassroots}} level.

Their role is as flexible as their Auxiliary Board Member feels is appropriate.|$|R

40|$|The {{intention}} of the Swedish salmonella control programme in pigs is to keep all categories of pigs free from salmonella and thereby ensure that pork and pork products are free from salmonella.

50|$|Individual {{cells in}} a {{population}} will often be {{at different points in}} the cell cycle. Scientists who wish to understand characteristics of the cell at a particular point in the cycle would have difficulty using population-level estimates, since they would average measurements from cells at different stages. Also, understanding the cell cycle in individual diseased cells, like those in a tumor, is also important, since they <b>will</b> often <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different cycle than healthy cells. Single-cell analysis of characteristics of the cell cycle allow scientists to understand these properties in greater detail.|$|R
