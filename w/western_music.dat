5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and <b>Western</b> <b>Music</b> is {{a studio}} album by American R singer-songwriter and {{musician}} Ray Charles. It was recorded by Charles in February 1962 at Capitol Studios in New York City and at United Recording Studios in Hollywood, before being released in April {{of that year}} by ABC-Paramount Records. The album departed stylistically from the singer's previous rhythm and blues music. It featured country, folk, and <b>Western</b> <b>music</b> standards reworked by Charles in popular song forms of the time, including R, pop, and jazz.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of music groups and rock bands, traditional folk music remains widely popular. The works of the national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam and national anthem writer Rabindranath Tagore have a widespread following across Dhaka. The Baily Road area is known as Natak Para (Theatre Neighbourhood) which is the center of Dhaka's thriving theatre movement. Indian and <b>Western</b> <b>music</b> and films are popular with large segments of Dhaka's population.|$|E
5|$|In most <b>Western</b> <b>music,</b> tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E

5000|$|Indian {{classical}} music is both elaborate and expressive. Like <b>Western</b> classical <b>music,</b> it divides the octave into 12 semitones {{of which the}} 7 basic notes are, in ascending tonal order, Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni [...] for Hindustani music and Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni [...] for Carnatic <b>music,</b> similar to <b>Western</b> <b>music's</b> Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti [...] However, Indian music uses just-intonation tuning, unlike most modern <b>Western</b> classical <b>music,</b> which uses the equal-temperament tuning system. Also, unlike modern <b>Western</b> classical <b>music,</b> Indian {{classical music}} places great emphasis on improvisation.|$|R

5|$|In 1956 {{he began}} to tour Europe and the Americas playing Indian {{classical}} music and increased its popularity there in the 1960s through teaching, performance, and his association with violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Beatles guitarist George Harrison. His influence on the latter helped popularize the use of Indian instruments in pop music throughout the 1960s. Shankar engaged <b>Western</b> <b>music</b> by writing compositions for sitar and orchestra, and toured {{the world in the}} 1970s and 1980s. From 1986 to 1992, he served as a nominated member of Rajya Sabha, the upper chamber of the Parliament of India. He continued to perform until the end of his life. In 1999, Shankar was awarded India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna.|$|E
5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and <b>Western</b> <b>Music</b> {{became one}} of the best-selling albums {{recorded}} by a black musician of the time, as well as one of the best-selling country albums, shipping at least 500,000 copies in its first three months of release. This achievement was {{due in part to the}} mainstream promotional efforts Modern Sounds had received from ABC prior to and following release. The album proved to be a crossover hit as well, as distributors claimed the record had been selling in pop, R and country music markets; at the time, often referred to as white and black markets during the period.|$|E

5|$|Regarded by {{many critics}} as Charles's best studio album, Modern Sounds in Country and <b>Western</b> <b>Music</b> has been {{considered}} by several music writers to be a landmark album in American music. The album's integration of soul and country music bent racial barriers in popular music, amid {{the height of the}} Civil Rights Movement. In the process of recording the album, Charles {{became one of the first}} African-American musicians to exercise complete artistic control over his own recording career. The album has been called one of the greatest albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone and Time.|$|E

5|$|Basic Guides were {{formerly}} {{issued for}} students which, unlike the Resource Guides, {{remained the same}} from year to year. The Art Basic Guide focuses on art fundamentals, such as the elements of art, principles of composition, and different 2-D and 3-D techniques. Additionally, a brief introduction to art history is included. The Economics Basic Guide reviews fundamental economic concepts {{in addition to the}} basics of macroeconomics and microeconomics. The Language and Literature Basic Guide provides students with a basic grounding in the analysis of literature and introduces key terms such as synecdoche, metonymy, assonance, and aphorism. The Math Basic Guide offers a general overview of major topics in high school math, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. The Music Basic Guide begins by introducing the student to topics in music theory such as harmonics, rhythm, tempo, and the circle of fifths. It also includes information {{on a wide variety of}} instruments and a brief history of <b>Western</b> <b>music.</b> However, beginning in the 2010–2011 competition season, the Basic Guides were incorporated into the year's Resource Guides.|$|E
5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and <b>Western</b> <b>Music</b> was the 18th overall LP Charles had recorded. According to him, {{the title}} of the album was {{conceived}} by producer Sid Feller and ABC-Paramount's executives and management people. The recording sessions for the album took place at three sessions in mid-February 1962. The first two sessions were set on February 5 and 7 at Capitol Studios in New York, New York, at which one half of the album was recorded and produced. The other half was recorded on February 15 of that same year at United Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Instead of drawing what he should record from memory and his knowledge of country music, Charles asked Feller, his newly appointed A (Artists and Repertoire) man, to research top country standards through major country music publishers.|$|E
5|$|When Charles had {{announced}} {{that he wanted to}} work on an album of country music in 1961, during a period of racial segregation and tension in the United States, he received generally negative commentary and feedback from his peers, including fellow R musicians and ABC-Paramount executives. The country album concept, however, meant more to Charles as a test of his record label's faith in him and respect for his artistic freedom than as a test of social tolerance among listeners amid racial distinctions of country and R Fueled by his esteem for creative control, Charles pitched the idea of a country album to ABC representatives. Following the successful lobby of the concept and a contract renewal in early 1962, which was linked to the launching of his own Tangerine label, Charles prepared his band for the recording sessions that produced Modern Sounds in Country and <b>Western</b> <b>Music.</b>|$|E
