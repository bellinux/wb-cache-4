Halcrow Group, the engineering consultancy, were responsible for carrying out the assessment, which looked at the benefits that each route might provide, not only for navigation but also for water quality, water resources and habitat for wildlife.

The title reflected his intention to provide useful financial information to managers within the company, allowing them to take informed decisions, rather than dictating what the company would be doing from head office. The financial comptroller position became a board position in 1953, and accordingly Smallpeice {{was appointed to the}} board.

In addition, spectators from certain areas were transported by bus directly to the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The meeting {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} a steering committee and short-, intermediate- and long-range committees.
