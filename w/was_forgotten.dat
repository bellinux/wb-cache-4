5|$|As most {{explicitly}} {{noted by}} the first quatrain, the poem was originally intended to be sung. Indeed, as noted by Stephen Medcalf, Emeritus professor at Sussex University, the text itself seems to imply melody and verse. However, due to the oral tradition of the time, the original melody of the song was not notated and {{over the course of}} time <b>was</b> <b>forgotten.</b>|$|E
5|$|The project, however, found strong resistance. As Carlota {{was married}} to John VI, a prince of Portugal, many people though that Carlotism was a trick to conceal Portuguese expansionism. Carlota herself had {{different}} political ideas than those of her supporters: Belgrano and the others shared the ideas of enlightenment, but Carlota aspired to keep the full power of an absolutist monarchy. By 1810 the project <b>was</b> <b>forgotten.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{right to}} <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> has emerged {{so as to}} build legal {{foundations}} for data subjects to be relieved from misappropriation of personal data on the Internet. However, studies of information systems (IS) {{on the right to}} <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> and related issues are rare as agreements of the right are diverse according to legal and cultural backgrounds. IS researchers should conduct both explorative and exploitative research in order to build a firm knowledge base for {{a better understanding of the}} right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> from the IS perspective. Doing so would help academia, legislators, and governments, and individuals to understand effects of the right on social, technological and psychological point of view.

5|$|It is {{commonly}} thought that Bachelier's work gained little attention and <b>was</b> <b>forgotten</b> for decades {{until it was}} rediscovered in the 1950s by the Leonard Savage, and then become more popular after Bachelier's thesis was translated into English in 1964. But the work was never forgotten in the mathematical community, as Bachelier published a book in 1912 detailing his ideas, which was cited by mathematicians including Doob, Feller and Kolomogorov. The book continued to be cited, but then starting in the 1960s the original thesis by Bachelier began to be cited more than his book when economists started citing Bachelier's work.|$|E
5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, and hardly {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War of Independence, had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research. Despite this, after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were hardly cited for almost 40 years. One could say that Makriyannis <b>was</b> <b>forgotten,</b> {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E
5|$|At {{his death}} Gov. Belcher left {{instructions}} {{that he be}} buried with his ardent friend and cousin, Judge Jonathan Remington (1667-1745, father-in-law of William Ellery, a signer of the Declaration of Independence). The body of Judge Jonathan Remington was disinterred and placed by his side. The monument which the governor had directed to be raised over his resting-place was never erected. The tomb became the family vault of Jennisons (Gov. Belcher's granddaughter married Dr. Timothy Lindall Jennison). The site of their grave <b>was</b> <b>forgotten</b> and long search has been made for it. In the late 1800s, local historians found that Gov. Jonathan Belcher and Judge Jonathan Remington were buried in one grave in Old Burying Ground, Cambridge, Ma. Their tomb is contiguous to that of Judge Edmund Trowbridge and Edmund Trowbridge Dana. In that of Judge Trowbridge rest the remains of Washington Allston; of Chief Justice Francis Dana; of the poet Richard Henry Dana and others of the family.|$|E

The right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> in the coming era of big data gives new opportunities to information technology companies.

5|$|In early 1932, {{a letter}} Rhoads {{had written in}} November 1931, which disparaged Puerto Ricans and claimed he had killed and {{intentionally}} injected cancer cells into his patients, was given by a lab assistant to Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. He publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media, {{which led to a}} scandal, an official investigation, and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests. In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague. Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community found evidence of his or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal <b>was</b> <b>forgotten.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the English {{bacteriologist}} Frederick Twort discovered {{a group of}} viruses that infect bacteria, now called bacteriophages (or commonly phages), and the French-Canadian microbiologist Félix d'Herelle described viruses that, when added to bacteria on an agar plate, would produce areas of dead bacteria. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension. Phages were heralded as a potential treatment for diseases such as typhoid and cholera, but their promise <b>was</b> <b>forgotten</b> {{with the development of}} penicillin. The study of phages provided insights into the switching on and off of genes, and a useful mechanism for introducing foreign genes into bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Mellor hill fort is a prehistoric site in North West England, {{that dates}} from the British Iron Age—about 800 BC to 100 AD. Situated on a hill in Mellor, Greater Manchester, on {{the western edge of}} the Peak District, the hill fort overlooks the Cheshire Plain. Although the {{settlement}} was founded during the Iron Age, evidence exists of activity on the site as far back as 8,000BC; during the Bronze Age the hill may have been an area where funerary practices were performed. Artefacts such as a Bronze Age amber necklace indicate the site was high status and that its residents took part in long-distance trade. The settlement was occupied into the Roman period. After the site was abandoned, probably in the 4th century, it <b>was</b> <b>forgotten</b> until its rediscovery in the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|A Research {{proposal}} submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the Bachelor of laws degreeThe right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>is</b> a data protection right that enables an individual to have personal data concerning themselves removed from the internet. Data Protection laws in Kenya are insufficient. The Data Protection Bill which was first drafted in 2008 {{is yet to be}} enacted in 2016. The internet has today become an important tool for many Kenyans that is used everyday yet there are insufficient laws to protect the data that they leave on the internet. In this paper I seek to determine whether Kenya should adopt the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten.</b> I examine the data protection laws in other countries to examine what a data protection right should entail. Then I look at the proposed right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> legislation and why the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>is</b> an important right. Finally I examine the situation in Kenya and find {{that there is a need}} for better Data Protection laws; even the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> upon examination of the Data Protection Bill is insufficient. Not only do they not provide for the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> or the right to erasure, it also fails to establish a regulatory authority to ensure compliance with the legislation. For these reasons I recommend that the Data Protection Bill should be amended to include the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> and a proper regulatory authority should be set up under the Act. I also recommend that Data Protection should be a concern for the law makers who should amend the Bill and pass it...|$|R
5|$|Prior to Confederation in 1867, the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom {{served in}} Canada as {{the symbol of}} royal authority. Arms had not been granted {{to any of the}} colonies in British North America, apart from 17th-century grants to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. The year after Confederation, arms were granted by Royal Warrant on May 26, 1868 to Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia (that Nova Scotia had been granted arms <b>was</b> <b>forgotten,</b> and it took until 1929 for the {{historic}} arms granted in the 17th century to be reinstated) and New Brunswick. In the Royal Warrant of 1868, Queen Victoria authorized the four arms of the first provinces to be quartered for use on the Great Seal of Canada and while this was not done for the first Great Seal, it is through this reference it became the de facto arms for Canada until 1921. That is why it was in this form Canada was represented on the first Red Ensign carried by Canadian troops at Vimy Ridge in 1917.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma and the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who <b>was</b> <b>forgotten</b> from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world to remember how Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only gain their love when {{she was the only one}} left, she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror were to get in someones eye, they would see nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in the urn they originally found Elsa in.|$|E

40|$|The Court of Justice of the E.

Free speech advocates claimed that the ruling authorized needless censorship, while privacy rights advocates argued that the ruling provided much-needed privacy protection in the internet age. The right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> ruling <b>is</b> deliberately broad, yet reinforces the Directive’s journalistic exception to protect free speech. However, the CJEU’s failure to define the term “search engine” in its decision unintentionally allows the Directive’s exception to be circumvented. More countries outside the E.

While the right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> could <b>be</b> incorporated into existing international law, having search engines apply their right to <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> policies internationally <b>is</b> the most realistic way of meeting the growing demand.
