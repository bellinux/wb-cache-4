5|$|In a {{fundraising}} {{speech on}} 5 October 1843 at the Manchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform, and realised {{in the days}} following that {{the most effective way to}} reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before writing Shakugan no Shana, Takahashi {{made his}} debut {{as an author}} with A/B Extreme, which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, A/B Extreme was too {{difficult}} for readers to understand, so for his next work, {{he set out to}} write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was not one of the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to his editor.|$|E

5|$|The American writer Jeffery Deaver {{was then}} {{commissioned}} by Ian Fleming Publications to produce Carte Blanche, {{which was published}} on 26 May 2011. The book updated Bond working for a post-9/11 agency, independent of MI5 or MI6. On 26 September 2013 the novel Solo, by William Boyd {{was published in the}} UK and by HarperCollins in Canada and the US; the book was once again set in the 1960s. In October 2014 it was announced that Anthony Horowitz <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a further Bond instalment. The novel, titled Trigger Mortis, is set in the 1950s, and it contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming.|$|E
5|$|Undone is {{the third}} studio album by Christian rock band, MercyMe. It was {{produced}} by Pete Kipley and released on April 20, 2004 on INO Records. Following the success of MercyMe's previous studio efforts, they were given significantly more resources with which to develop the album and brought in a sixth member, guitarist Barry Graul. Unlike the band's previous songwriting style, which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the lyrics first, they wrote the music for the songs on the album before writing the lyrics. The album has a pop rock and adult contemporary sound, while the lyrics are personal and convey Christian themes.|$|E
5|$|After a gap of six years, Sebastian Faulks was {{commissioned}} by Ian Fleming Publications to write a new Bond novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth. The book—titled Devil May Care—was published in the UK by Penguin Books and by Doubleday in the US. American writer Jeffery Deaver was then commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to produce Carte Blanche, which was published on 26 May 2011. The book updated Bond into a post-9/11 agent, independent of MI5 or MI6. On 26 September 2013 Solo, written by William Boyd, was published, set in 1969. In October 2014 {{it was announced that}} Anthony Horowitz <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a Bond continuation novel. Set in the 1950s two weeks after the events of Goldfinger, it contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming. Trigger Mortis was released on 8 September 2015.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E
5|$|Barnette's first {{action as}} mayor <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> {{a letter to}} Washington, D.C., asking the federal {{government}} to sell its military food stores from posts near the town, thus alleviating the food shortage. This move was followed by others: licensing a telephone company, providing for garbage collection, fire protection, and a one-room school (which shut down later that winter for lack of funds). Barnette used his position to grant long-term contracts for city utilities to members of his family. One of Barnette's brothers-in-law, James W. Hill, was given a 25-year contract to provide electricity, drinking water, and steam heat to the city. In 1904, Barnette arranged for regular shipments of supplies to Fairbanks, and the town continued to expand. In addition to the local telephone system, Fairbanks was connected to the outside world via the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System, which was expanded from Eagle to Nome in 1903 and passed through Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{returned}} from his injury on February 19, 2012 at Elimination Chamber to show support for John Laurinaitis. Christian returned on the March 16 episode of SmackDown, hosting an episode of the 'Peep Show' and given a spot on Laurinaitis' team in a 12-man tag match at WrestleMania XXVIII. On the March 26 episode of Raw, {{as part of a}} storyline, Christian was injured once again after (kayfabe) re-aggravating his neck and shoulder in a match with CM Punk. This <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> him off at WrestleMania as it was later reported that Christian has not yet been fully medically cleared to compete due to a history of shoulder injuries. Despite the injury, Christian still appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony to induct long-time friend Edge.|$|E

There are also infinitives corresponding to other aspects: (<b>to)</b> have <b>written,</b> (<b>to)</b> <b>be</b> <b>writing,</b> (<b>to)</b> have <b>been</b> <b>writing.</b> The second-person imperative <b>is</b> identical <b>to</b> the (basic) infinitive; other imperative forms may be made with let (let us go, or lets go; let them eat cake).|$|R

5|$|In 1966, Gowing became Reader in Contemporary History {{at the new}} University of Kent, Canterbury, {{covering}} scientific, technical, {{economic and}} social history. The UKAEA retained her as a consultant, paying her £1,000 per annum for three years. Her main task <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a two-volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939–1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952. To help out, the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) and Gowing's Assistant Historian. Despite their being accredited as official historians, the Atomic Weapons Establishment would not let them take their notes away, {{so they had to}} do their writing on site, {{under the watchful eye of}} Aldermaston's DRO. To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station, and then the Tube to Paddington and the railway to Reading, where Arnold picked Gowing up in her car and drove to Harwell.|$|E
5|$|The {{game that}} became Fez {{began in a}} {{collaboration}} between Montreal-based Phil Fish and Toronto-based Shawn McGrath on McGrath's idea for a puzzle game: a four-sided 3D space with each side in 2D, similar to Fish's 3D pixels (voxels) as incorporated into Fez. The entirety of Fez design, lore, and art descends from this game mechanic. Fish provided the project's art and credited his influence to Shigeru Miyamoto and Hayao Miyazaki. Fish and McGrath's partnership crumbled due to creative differences, as Fish {{wanted to create a}} platform game. Fish continued to work on the game in his spare time and announced his search for a programmer on DeviantArt, and the first person to reply, Renaud Bédard, became lead programmer. They were both the same age and living in Montreal. Though Bédard had some hobbyist experience in 3D graphics and was studying computer science, Fez was his first professional game development project. His first task <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the level editor and game engine.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Sir Mike Jackson, Dannatt was appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS)—the professional head of the British Army—on 29 August 2006. Concerned that {{the formation of the}} British Armed Forces Federation meant that soldiers were losing confidence in generals to lobby on their behalf, his first act as CGS <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a long letter to the Secretary of State for Defence, Des Browne, which he copied to the MoD's senior civil servant, Bill Jeffrey; Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS); and to the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Air Staff—his opposite numbers in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force respectively. In the letter, he asserted his view that the Army was over-stretched by operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and that essential equipment, such as helicopters, was unavailable or ineffective and outdated, like the Snatch Land Rover. He also raised concerns with the standard of accommodation provided for soldiers at home and with soldiers' wages. The following weekend, he travelled to Afghanistan on his first official visit as CGS. He met Des Browne in person for the first time two days after becoming CGS and later acknowledged the difficulties faced by defence secretaries in the little time they have to prepare for the role.|$|E
50|$|Jewish scribes have {{preserved}} {{a carefully}} guarded tradition regarding the line arrangements of certain verses, namely, which words <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> {{at the forefront}} of a line, and which words <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>written</b> {{at the end of the}} same. The line arrangements of Shirat Ha'azinu (Deut. 32:1-43) in the Yemenite Torah scrolls follow closely that of Ben Asher as conveyed by Maimonides' Mishne Torah, and, unlike the Sephardic tradition of writing the song in seventy lines (based on the Shulhan Arukh), the Yemenite tradition <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the song in only sixty-seven lines.|$|R

25|$|In March 1980, Paramount was {{planning}} a weekly NBC-TV series as a starring vehicle for Welles; Leon Tokatyan (Lou Grant) <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the pilot.

40|$|Abstract. There <b>are</b> {{two ways}} <b>to</b> <b>write</b> {{a program for}} {{manipulating}} tree-structured data such as XML documents and S-expressions: One <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a tree-processing program focusing on the logical structure of the data and the other <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a stream-processing program focusing on the physical structure. While tree-processing programs <b>are</b> easier <b>to</b> <b>write</b> than stream-processing programs, tree-processing programs are less efficient in memory usage since they use trees as intermediate data. Our aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> establish a method for automatically translating a treeprocessing program to a stream-processing one {{in order to take}} the best of both worlds. We define a programming language for processing binary trees and a type system based on ordered linear type, and show that every well-typed program can <b>be</b> translated <b>to</b> an equivalent stream-processing program. ...|$|R
