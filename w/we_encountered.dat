The extent {{and nature of the}} British press coverage of Mills has been criticised, as in May 2003, when Guardian columnist Matt Seaton wrote a piece declaring [...] "There is little that is edifying in the symbolic lynching of Heather. The poisonous judgmentalism that drives it is in the worst tradition of small town gossip. It is prurient, spiteful, hypocritical, and we should cry 'shame' on it". Publicist Mark Borkowski wrote in the Independent on Sunday, on 23 March 2008: [...] "Not since the cult of Myra Hindley have <b>we</b> <b>encountered</b> so much vitriol aimed at one woman". Feminist writer Natasha Walter has compared the coverage to that of Britney Spears.

500|$|AM2 {{developed}} what Sega {{hoped would}} be the Dreamcast's killer app, Shenmue, a [...] "revenge epic {{in the tradition of}} Chinese cinema." [...] The action-adventure title involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father's murder, but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million. Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, Shenmue was eventually downsized to a trilogy—and only one sequel was ever released.s development |publisher=Polygon |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |quote=Yu Suzuki: The biggest challenge <b>we</b> <b>encountered</b> was project management.

It's the ultimate Dreamcast fanboy's pilgrimage, and as I took my first steps down Dobuita Street and recognized locations I'd walked past countless times before—Kurita's Military Store, Mary's Embroidery Store and the parking lot where Ryo honed his fighting skills—I couldn't help but go a little dewy eyed." [...] According to Moore, Shenmue sold [...] "extremely well", but the game had no chance of making a profit due to the Dreamcast's limited installed base. Shenmue II [...] "was completed for a much more reasonable sum", while Sato defended Shenmue as an [...] "investment [...] will someday be recouped" [...] because [...] "the development advances we learned... can be applied to other games". In addition to the mixed reception for Shenmue, IGN's Travis Fahs stated that [...] "the [...] era wasn't as kind to [...] as earlier years"—citing (among others) F355 Challenge as an [...] "acclaimed" [...] arcade title that [...] "didn't do much at home", and Genki's port of Virtua Fighter 3 as inferior to the arcade version, [...] "which was already a couple years old and never as popular as its predecessors."s view, buyers of modern coin-op conversions have the right to expect more from their investments than unenhanced facsimiles. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102942/http://www.edge-online.com/review/virtua-fighter-3tb-review/ |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }} The Virtua Fighter series would experience a [...] "tremendous comeback" [...] with the universally acclaimed Virtua Fighter 4—which saw a console release exclusively on PS2.|$|E
