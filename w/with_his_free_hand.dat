5|$|Desmond Haynes was {{the fourth}} man to be {{dismissed}} for handling the ball in Test cricket, {{just over a year}} after Mohsin. Facing India in late 1983, Haynes had been struck on the bat and pad by the ball, which then headed towards the stumps. The West Indian batsman redirected the ball away from the stumps <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand.</b> Upon being given out, Haynes—who was ignorant of the law regarding handling the ball—argued with the umpire about the dismissal. After asking the bowler, Kapil Dev, if he wanted to withdraw his appeal, the umpire sent Haynes back to the pavilion. The first instance in One Day Internationals was in 1986, when the Indian batsman Mohinder Amarnath knocked away a turning delivery from Australia's Greg Matthews that was heading for the stumps. In 1993, Graham Gooch became the only player to be dismissed for handling the ball after scoring a century. Playing defensively to try and draw the Test match against Australia, Gooch blocked a short ball from Merv Hughes. The ball flicked off his bat and fell towards his stumps, prompting Gooch to instinctively punch the ball away: Australia won the match by 179 runs.|$|E
500|$|The {{dismissal}} of Daryll Cullinan in 1999 {{was the second}} instance in ODIs: facing the West Indian spinner Keith Arthurton, Cullinan fended the ball off into the ground. It bounced high in the air, and Cullinan removed his right hand from his bat to catch it as it fell again. Despite {{the fact that it}} was unlikely that the ball would land near the stumps, the West Indies captain, Brian Lara, appealed, and Cullinan was dismissed. The next occurrence was two years later, in a Test match between Australia and India. In the first innings of the match, Steve Waugh was struck on the pads by a delivery from Harbhajan Singh. The umpire turned down the appeal, but as he did so, the ball bounced and spun towards the stumps. Waugh was alerted by a shout from the non-striking batsman, and instinctively swept the ball away <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand.</b> The most recent instance came during the same year as Waugh's dismissal, in another Test match involving India. England's Michael Vaughan missed an attempted sweep against Sarandeep Singh, and the ball trickled along the ground after striking his pads. Vaughan brushed the ball away with his hand, despite {{the fact that it was}} not travelling towards the stumps. Initially, he claimed that he was attempting the give the ball back to the fielder at short leg, but he later admitted that he [...] "should have just held up [...] hands and said 'I got it all wrong, I'm an idiot.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{occasion}} of a batsman being given out handled {{the ball in}} international cricket occurred during a Test match between South Africa and England in Cape Town in 1957. In the second innings of the match, the South African Russell Endean padded away a delivery from Jim Laker. The ball looped off his pads into the air, and was falling towards his stumps until Endean instinctively knocked it away <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand.</b> He later suggested that he had [...] "thought of heading it away, but that seemed too theatrical." [...] The second instance came 22 years later during a bad-tempered series between Australia and Pakistan that also involved another rare dismissal method: Mankading. Andrew Hilditch was the victim in this match; {{he picked up the}} ball and returned it to the bowler after a wayward throw from a fielder. The bowler, Sarfraz Nawaz, appealed for the wicket and Hilditch was given out. Another Pakistan player, Asif Iqbal, distanced himself from the incident, commenting that he felt [...] "there was no need for us to stoop so low as to appeal against Hilditch". Hilditch's dismissal marked the only time that a non-striking batsman has been given out for handling the ball. The next case also occurred in a match between Australia and Pakistan. The match was marred by stones being thrown at the Australians in the field, providing a tense atmosphere. Mohsin Khan defended a delivery from Geoff Lawson, which then landed behind him. Mohsin pushed the ball away from the stumps with his hand, resulting in the wicket.|$|E

60|$|<b>With</b> <b>his</b> partly <b>free</b> right <b>hand</b> he now {{tried to}} get hold of the beam that lay across, but not quite against, his breast. In no way could he do so. He was unable to depress the {{shoulder}} so as to push the elbow beyond that edge of the timber which was nearest his knees; failing in that, he could not raise the forearm and hand to grasp the beam. The brace that made an angle with it downward and backward prevented him from doing anything in that direction, and between it and his body the space was not half so wide as the length of his forearm. Obviously he could not get his hand under the beam nor over it; the hand could not, in fact, touch it at all. Having demonstrated his inability, he desisted, and began to think whether he could reach any of the débris piled upon his legs.|$|R
60|$|Here, again, as at so many points, we come {{up against}} the abuse of schools to keep people in ignorance and error, {{so that they may}} be {{incapable}} of successful revolt against their industrial slavery. The most important simple fundamental economic truth to impress on a child in complicated civilizations like ours is the truth that whoever consumes goods or services without producing by personal effort the equivalent of what he or she consumes, inflicts on the community precisely the same injury that a thief produces, and would, in any honest State, be treated as a thief, however full his or her pockets might be of money made by other people. The nation that first teaches its children that truth, instead of flogging them if they discover it for themselves, may have to fight all the slaves of all the other nations to begin with; but it will beat them as easily as an unburdened man <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> and <b>with</b> all <b>his</b> energies in full play can beat an invalid who has to carry another invalid on his back.|$|R

60|$|Jean drew a long, {{deep breath}} and held it. He {{let go of his}} rifle. He rose, silently as a lifting shadow. He drew the bowie knife. Then with light, swift bounds he glided up the bank. Greaves must have heard a rustling--a soft, quick pad of moccasin, for he turned with a start. And that instant Jean's left arm darted like a {{striking}} snake round Greaves's neck and closed tight and hard. <b>With</b> <b>his</b> right <b>hand</b> <b>free,</b> holding the knife, Jean might have ended the deadly business in just one move. But when his bared arm felt the hot, bulging neck something terrible burst out of the depths of him. To kill this enemy of his father's was not enough! Physical contact had unleashed the savage soul of the Indian. Yet there was more, and as Jean gave the straining body a tremendous jerk backward, he felt the same strange thrill, the dark joy that he had known when his fist had smashed the face of Simm Bruce. Greaves had leered--he had corroborated Bruce's vile insinuation about Ellen Jorth. So it was more than hate that actuated Jean Isbel.|$|R
50|$|The Eddy {{brothers}} séance {{trick was}} exposed by the magician Chung Ling Soo. The trick involved a curtain {{that was put}} across the room, with musical instruments placed on a table inside the curtain space. Two {{members of the audience}} would be selected and enter the curtain. Horatio would grasp the audience sitter's left arm and the other sitter would grasp his right arm. To the audience outside the curtain, various musical instruments would be seen floating in the air above the top of the curtain and tapping the trio on the head. A hand would also come through the curtain and write a message on a slate held by William who was sitting outside the curtain. The trick was performed by Horatio evading control and releasing his hand. He would do this by various methods such as using a fake hand made from a piece of heavy sheet lead which he would place in his left hand and grasp the audience sitter's arm. Horatio would quietly remove <b>his</b> real hand <b>with</b> the leaden hand remaining behind, giving the sense of touch that an actual hand was there. <b>With</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> Horatio would manipulate the instruments and perform the alleged supernatural phenomena.|$|R
5000|$|In 1903, an Indian team {{coached by}} Pop Warner first {{employed}} its infamous [...] "hidden-ball play" [...] against heavily favored Harvard. Warner, as coach at Cornell, had already used it against Penn State in 1897, {{but it had}} not achieved much notice. Carlisle led Harvard at halftime, and hoping to keep the game's momentum, Warner elected to try the play on the ensuing kickoff. Harvard executed the kick, and the Indians formed {{a circle around the}} returner. With the aid of a specially altered jersey, the ball was placed up the back of the returner. The Indians broke the huddle and spread out in different directions. Each player feigned carrying the ball, except Dillon, the man with the ball up the back of his jersey. The ruse confused the Crimson players, and they scrambled to find the ball carrier. Dillon, <b>with</b> both <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>free,</b> was ignored by the searching Harvard players, and he ran unmolested into the end zone. With the score, Carlisle extended its lead to 11-0, but Harvard came back and eventually won 12-11. Nevertheless, the close match, and trick play, resulted in national attention. Warner had learned the trick from John Heisman while facing Auburn in 1895 during his tenure as coach of the Georgia Bulldogs.|$|R
6000|$|The man hooked {{his left}} arm about the side-post of the open window-shield. It was a strong arm, a firm grip. He seized her left wrist <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand.</b> Though all the while his eyes grotesquely kept their amused sparkle, and beside them writhed laughter-wrinkles, he shouted hoarsely, [...] "You'll stop hell!" [...] His hand slid from her wrist to the {{steering}} wheel. [...] "I can drive this boat's well as you can. You make one move to stop, and I steer her over---- Blooie! Down the bank!" ...|$|E
60|$|Cheenbuk {{felt this}} {{the moment they}} joined issue, and on the instant an irresistible {{sensation}} of mercy overwhelmed him. Holding the gun with his right hand, and keeping its muzzle well to one side, for {{he did not feel}} quite certain as to its spouting capacities, he grasped the Indian's throat with his left. Quick as lightning Alizay, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> drew his scalping-knife and struck at the Eskimo's shoulder, but not less quick was Cheenbuk in releasing the throat and catching the Indian's wrist with a grip that rendered it powerless.|$|E
60|$|Then Moore was silent, {{holding her}} <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> {{breathing}} hard, and slowly quieting down. Columbine felt {{then that he}} {{knew that there was}} something terribly wrong, and that perhaps he dared not voice his fear. At any rate, he silently held her, waiting. That silent wait grew unendurable for Columbine. She wanted to prolong this moment that was to be all she could ever surrender. But she dared not do so, for she knew if he ever kissed her again her duty to Belllounds would vanish like mist in the sun.|$|E
6000|$|But {{there was}} a more vital {{question}} that drove out all others. Could he, bound as he was, manage to cut his bonds? He essayed cautiously to rub the open blade {{up and down on}} the cord that bound his two wrists together. It was an awkward business, and drew a smothered [...] "Ow" [...] of pain from him as the knife cut into his wrist. But slowly and doggedly he went on sawing to and fro. He cut the flesh badly, but at last he felt the cord slacken. <b>With</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>free,</b> the rest was easy. Five minutes later he stood upright with some difficulty, owing to the cramp in his limbs. His first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist. Then he sat on the edge of the bed to think. Conrad had taken the key of the door, so he could expect little more assistance from Annette. The only outlet from the room was the door, consequently he would perforce have to wait until the two men returned to fetch him. But when they did... Tommy smiled! Moving with infinite caution in the dark room, he found and unhooked the famous picture. He felt an economical pleasure that his first plan would not be wasted. There was now nothing to do but to wait. He waited.|$|R
60|$|She bore {{all this}} well, for a while,--and indeed never ceased to bear it well, {{to the eyes}} of those around her. When Parson John told her of Walter's hunting, she laughed, {{and said that she}} hoped he would {{distinguish}} himself. When her aunt on one occasion congratulated her, telling her that she had done well and nobly, she bore the congratulation with a smile and a kind word. But she thought about it much, and within the chambers of her own bosom there were complaints made that the play which had been played between him and her during the last few months should for her have been such a very tragedy, while for him the matter {{was no more than a}} melodrama, touched with a pleasing melancholy. He had not been made a waif upon the waters by the misfortune of a few weeks, by the error of a lawyer, by a mistaken calculation,--not even by the crime of his father. His manhood was, at any rate, perfect to him. Though he might be a poor man, he was still a man <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>free,</b> and <b>with</b> something before him which he could do. She understood, too, that the rough work of his life would be such that it would rub away, perhaps too quickly, the impression of his late love, and enable him hereafter to love another. But for her,--for her there could be nothing but memory, regrets, and a life which would simply be a waiting for death. But she had done nothing wrong,--and she must console herself with that, if consolation could then be found.|$|R
60|$|And he {{sat by the}} bedside, slowly, rhythmically {{stroking}} her brows <b>with</b> <b>his</b> finger-tips, {{stroking her}} eyes shut, soothing her, holding her fingers in <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand.</b> They could hear the sleepers' breathing in the other rooms.|$|R
60|$|I {{burst open}} the door, and seized {{him as he}} lifted his hand on her.

She struck up his pistol as he pulled it out of his pocket <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> and presented it at my head. The bullet was fired into the air. I tripped up his heels at the same moment. The report of the pistol had alarmed the house. We two together kept him on the ground until help arrived.|$|E
60|$|When the {{hurricane}} blast reached the Columbia, {{the captain was}} {{in the act of}} slipping on a lined raincoat,--a big affair, with long sleeves and an extra high collar. One arm was in the coat and the other was going down the sleeve when it caught in the lining. At that instant the shock threw the captain across the deck and almost over the railing. He caught at the railing <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> but his other hand remained a prisoner in the coat sleeve, while the garment itself stuck in a bunch across his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|It was no {{time for}} lingering. With the quick glance and fore-knowledge of a woman, Saxon saw, not merely the curious {{children}} clustering about, but the peering of adult faces from open doors and windows, and past window-shades lifted up or held aside. <b>With</b> <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> Billy drew back the linen robe and helped her to a place beside him. The high-backed, luxuriously upholstered seat of brown leather gave her a sense of great comfort; yet even greater, it seemed to her, was the nearness and comfort of the man himself and of his body.|$|E
60|$|There {{was another}} interval. An {{appearance}} of disturbance showed {{itself on the}} sleeper's face. Suddenly, he waved <b>his</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> {{in the direction of}} the waiting-room.|$|R
