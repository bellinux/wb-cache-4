5|$|The {{caissons}} {{are required}} to turn with the <b>wheel</b> <b>in</b> order to remain level. Whilst {{the weight of the}} caissons on the bearings is generally sufficient to rotate them, a gearing mechanism using three large identically sized gears connected by two smaller ones ensures that they turn at precisely the correct speed and remain correctly balanced.|$|E
5|$|The last squeaky <b>wheel</b> <b>in</b> the City Council {{had been}} greased. The last {{independent}} voice {{had joined the}} chorus...Shiller's endorsement of Daley {{is all the more}} amazing when you look at where she started, about as close to a Marxist as you'd ever find at City Hall.|$|E
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front <b>wheel</b> <b>in</b> the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E

5|$|In early {{editions of}} the setting, The Realms shared a unified {{cosmology}} with various other campaign settings called the Great <b>Wheel.</b> <b>In</b> this way each of the Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various planes of existence. With {{the release of the}} 2001 Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a driven wheel, a torque must be applied to {{generate}} the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in {{the case of}} a bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a <b>wheel.</b> <b>In</b> addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E
5|$|Later discoveries {{turned up}} {{a large number of}} excised clips, held by {{interested}} parties as proof of the edits. In October 1996, Australian Doctor Who fans Damian Shanahan and Ellen Parry discovered a collection in the records of the National Archives of Australia, provided as evidence by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board (now the Classification Board). These clips include The Smugglers, episodes 1, 3-4; The Highlanders, episode 1; The Underwater Menace, episodes 2, 4; The Macra Terror, episode 3; Fury From The Deep, episodes 2, 4-5; and The <b>Wheel</b> <b>In</b> Space, episode 4.|$|E
50|$|Washi Beam Co. is a Japanese {{manufacturer}} specializing <b>in</b> forged automotive <b>wheels.</b> Founded <b>in</b> 1971, {{the company}} began forging aluminum road <b>wheels</b> <b>in</b> 1984 and magnesium racing <b>wheels</b> <b>in</b> 1992. The company claims to have forged more than 24,000 wheels for Formula 1 teams. The wheels for Formula 1 cars produced by Washi Beam are distributed under BBS trademark. Washi Beam also supplies numerous automotive original equipment manufacturers.|$|R

5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front <b>wheel</b> <b>in</b> the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E
5|$|Part of the Dinorwig Slate Quarry is now {{within the}} Padarn Country Park, {{and the other}} part houses the Dinorwig power station in caverns under the old quarry workings. The National Slate Museum is located {{in some of the}} quarry workshops. The museum has {{displays}} including Victorian slate-workers' cottages that once stood at Tanygrisiau near Blaenau Ffestiniog. As well as many exhibits, it has the multi-media display To Steal a Mountain, showing the lives and work of the men who quarried slate here. The museum has the largest working water <b>wheel</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom, which is available for viewing via several walkways, and a restored incline formerly used to carry slate waggons uphill and downhill.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield's {{museums are}} managed by two {{distinct}} organisations. Museums Sheffield manages the Weston Park Museum (a Grade II* listed Building), Millennium Galleries and Graves Art Gallery. Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust manages the museums dedicated to Sheffield's industrial heritage {{of which there}} are three. Kelham Island Museum (located just to the North of the city centre) showcases the city's history of steel manufacturing. Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet (in the south of the city) is a Grade I Listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Shepherd <b>Wheel</b> (<b>in</b> the south-East of the city) is a former water-powered grinding workshop, Grade II listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E

5|$|SkyLoop {{is a type}} {{of steel}} roller coaster {{manufactured}} by Maurer Söhne. There are currently 10 SkyLoops operating worldwide; 9 of which are identical XT 150 models with only one being the extended, XT 450 model. The first SkyLoop to open was Sky <b>Wheel</b> <b>in</b> 2004 (XT 150) while the first and only XT 450, Abismo opened in 2006. There are also 3 other models available; XT 900, Custom, and Launch, those have not been built yet.|$|E
5|$|The Film Library's remit covers {{material}} originated on film, not {{on videotape}} – yet {{two of the}} film-originated episodes of Doctor Who (The Power of the Daleks Episode 6 and The <b>Wheel</b> <b>in</b> Space Episode 5) were junked by the Film Library, while it held such unexplained material as 16mm copies of The Tenth Planet Episodes 1–3, presumably viewing prints which were mistakenly returned to them at some point instead of BBC Enterprises. Most surprisingly of all, they also retained a 16mm telerecording copy of the original untransmitted pilot, presumably a viewing print made in 1963 and subsequently lodged at the Library.|$|E
5|$|The first ferries {{crossing}} the Dordogne were flat-bottomed boats driven by oars or keelboats {{driven by a}} sail. The passage was very risky and accidents occurred, especially during high tides and storms. From 1754, a cable ferry crossed the 550m wide river. The cable lay above the waters and stretched obliquely to the current. In 1821, the cable ferry {{was replaced by a}} two-part ferry powered by a carousel of twelve horses. The horses set in motion gears which in turn powered a large paddle <b>wheel.</b> <b>In</b> good weather, the crossing time was improved to 30–45minutes, but in bad weather the trip remained uncertain.|$|E

5|$|The {{flag was}} {{proposed}} by Nehru at the Constituent Assembly on 22 July 1947 as a horizontal tricolour of deep saffron, white and dark green in equal proportions, with the Ashoka <b>wheel</b> <b>in</b> {{blue in the}} centre of the white band. Nehru also presented two flags, one in Khadi-silk and the other in Khadi-cotton, to the assembly. The resolution was approved unanimously. It served as the national flag of the Dominion of India between 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950, and has served as the flag of the Republic of India since then.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the study of bike {{dynamics}} is nearly as old as the bicycle itself. It includes contributions from famous scientists such as Rankine, Appell, and Whipple. In the early 19th century Karl von Drais, credited with inventing the two-wheeled vehicle variously called the laufmaschine, velocipede, draisine, and dandy horse, showed that a rider could balance his device by steering the front <b>wheel.</b> <b>In</b> 1869, Rankine published an article in The Engineer repeating von Drais's assertion that balance is maintained by steering {{in the direction of a}} lean.|$|E
5|$|The {{pumping station}} {{operated}} continuously, providing {{water for the}} increasing traffic on the canal. Problems {{with the size of}} the water wheel, which was supported at either end, meant that the middle of the wheel sagged, putting strain on the bearings and stays. In the 1840s the trussing was changed from stays to tension rods to strengthen and lighten the wheel, along with improvements to the pumps. The changes to the wheel were unsuccessful, and in the 1850s a central bearing was added dividing the <b>wheel</b> <b>in</b> two.|$|E
