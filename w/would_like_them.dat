5|$|In the 1930s, Lorenzo Hagglund, {{a veteran}} of World War I and a history buff, began searching the strait for remains of the battle. In 1932 he found the remains of Royal Savages hull, which he {{successfully}} raised in 1934. Stored for more than fifty years, the remains were sold by his son to the National Civil War Museum. As of March 2009, the remains were in a city garage in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The city of Plattsburgh, New York, has claimed ownership of the remains and <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> returned to upstate New York.|$|E

But I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> {{to watch the}} best among the lotNool Veli, Mullum Malarum, Udiripookal, Salangai Oli and Amirthavarshini (Kannada)". In 2006, {{director}} S. Shankar said that he entered the film industry [...] "with dreams of directing films such as Mullum Malarum", though he never got to make such films. Asked for her favourite scene in any film, actress Sripriya replied: [...] "For me, {{that would be an}} entire movie– Mullum Malarum." [...] In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar asked eight Tamil directors to list ten of their favourite films; fourK. Balachander, K. Bhagyaraj, Mani Ratnam and K. S. Ravikumarnamed Mullum Malarum. Director Kathir said in July 2012 that Mullum Malarum inspired him to enter the film industry. The title of G. V. Prakash Kumar's film, Ketta Paiyan Da Indha Karthi, is a play on the line [...] "Ketta Paiyan Sir Indha Kaali" [...] from Mullum Malarum. In October 2015, director Pa. Ranjith stated that Rajinikanth's characterisation in Mullum Malarum was a [...] "lesson" [...] of sorts for him, and the actor's character in Ranjith's Kabali (2016) was influenced by Kali in Mullum Malarum.|$|E
500|$|In 1918, Long began urging Terhune {{to publish}} a book of his dog stories, though Terhune himself was not {{convinced}} at first. He considered them {{to be nothing more}} than [...] "hack writing" [...] and inferior to his other works. Even after Long convinced him of the public's love of the works, Terhune initially did nothing towards the goal. Later that year, Doubleday-Page, which had published Terhune's last novel Fortune, wrote asking to see his next book while reminding him that their contract gave them first refusal rights to it. Wanting to escape from that publisher due to the dismal performance of Fortune, Terhune decided to follow Long's suggestion so he could use the book of dog stories to fulfill his contractual obligation. After he collected together the twenty Lad stories he'd written so far, he reorganized them into chapters and submitted the book. He was unsurprised that it was rejected, but in the rejection letter the company referred to Alfred Ollivant's 1898 novel Owd Bob and Jack London's 1903 novel Call of the Wild as [...] "superior pieces of work". As Terhune himself considered both authors to be unimpressive writers, he became determined that Lad: A Dog would be published. E. P. Dutton's John Macrae, who was a known dog lover, found the stories [...] "simple but charming" [...] and felt the public <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> greatly.|$|E

2500|$|Morgan {{targeted}} his sponsors freely. One early sponsor {{had been}} Adler Shoe Stores, which {{came close to}} canceling its account after Morgan started making references to [...] "Old Man Adler" [...] on the air; the chain changed its mind after it was learned business spiked upward, with many new patrons asking to meet Old Man Adler. [...] Morgan had to read an Adler commercial heralding the new fall line of colors; Morgan thought the colors were dreadful, and said he wouldn't wear them to a dogfight, but perhaps the listeners <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them.</b> Old Man Adler demanded a retraction on the air. Morgan obliged: [...] "I would wear them to a dogfight." [...] Morgan later recalled with bemusement, [...] "It made him happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Lamm {{told his}} {{listeners}} {{that they should}} value and encourage the efforts of non-Orthodox leaders to more seriously integrate traditional Jewish practices {{into the lives of}} their followers. They should welcome the creation of Reform and Conservative day schools and not see them as a threat to their own. In many communities, Orthodox day schools, or Orthodox-oriented community day schools, have large numbers of students from non-Orthodox families. The liberal movements should be appreciated and encouraged because they are doing something Jewish, even if it is not the way that Orthodox Jews <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> to, he said. [...] "What they are doing is something, and something is better than nothing," [...] he said in his speech. [...] "I'm very openly attacking the notion that we sometimes find in the Orthodox community that 'being a goy is better'" [...] than being a non-Orthodox Jew, he said in an interview.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2006 Straw {{attracted}} controversy {{by suggesting}} {{to a local}} newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles {{in the past and}} it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: [...] "Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather." [...] He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.|$|E
2500|$|Following the pre-{{audition}}s, acts audition {{in front}} of (as of 2016) four celebrity judges. The judges may end an act's performance early by pressing their red buzzer, which lights up their corresponding X above the stage. If an act receives X's from all judges, they must stop their performance. In addition, large audiences have also been {{a factor in the}} judging process, as their reaction to an act's performance may swing or influence a judge's vote. This makes the audience the so-called [...] "fifth" [...] ("fourth", from seasons 1-4) judge. From seasons 1 to 4, voting worked on a majority-of-two basis where two positive votes were required. Starting from season 5, voting works on a majority-of-three basis as there are four judges. The judging panel give an act a [...] "Yes" [...] if they like them and <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> to advance to the next stage of the competition, and a [...] "No" [...] if they dislike the act and do not wish to see them again.|$|E
2500|$|As for casting in general, the {{director}} expressed his {{dissatisfaction with the}} process. He felt Sorcerer [...] "needed stars" [...] and claimed that the actors hired for the roles of Scanlon and Manzon were his fifth, sixth or seventh preferred choices. Spanish actor Francisco Rabal, however, was his [...] "about second or third choice". Friedkin said that he wanted Rabal {{for the role of}} [...] "Frog One" [...] in The French Connection because he loved his performance in Luis Buñuel's Belle de Jour, but the casting director mistakenly got Fernando Rey instead. It was not until Sorcerer came along that Friedkin and Rabal finally worked together. Scanlon's role was also offered to Clint Eastwood and Jack Nicholson, neither of whom was willing to travel to the Dominican Republic. Despite liking Cremer, Friedkin felt that this role would benefit from the presence of Jean-Paul Belmondo or Lino Ventura. The abundance of foreign actors on the cast list prompted Sidney Sheinberg to ask {{the director}} whether he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> to have Anglicized pseudonyms.|$|E

2500|$|Babe becomes {{suspicious}} when Stan frequently vanishes off the square. She {{follows him}} to the hospital, where she discovers he has terminal prostate cancer. She urges him to tell his family, but he insists he wants {{to deal with it}} alone. However, an upset Babe reveals the cancer at Lee's 22nd birthday celebrations. He is angry with her and tries to lie {{his way out of the}} truth, but later confesses that this Christmas is likely to be his last. Cora is very upset to realise the truth as well, as her husband died of cancer several years ago. Stan confronts Babe and reveals he knows she is hiding Shirley; this leads Mick and Dean to bring her back to Walford. Christmas lunch is unsettled when Stan's ex-wife Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) visits. Cora storms off upset and the day is later upset when Shirley admits that she is Mick's mother. Stan throws Babe out and urges Mick and Tina to carry on as normal, but he is left reeling when Mick tells him that Dean has raped Linda. [...] After he collapses in the Square, Stan tells Tina and Mick he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> to help him end his life. Although Mick furiously refuses, Tina eventually agrees, but Mick stops her before she can. This causes Mick and Stan to fallout. Stan tries to arrange a trip to the dogs for the Carters, but they are concerned for his health. Before they can leave, he loses feeling in his legs and is rushed to hospital, where he tells them he does not want them to visit and wants the money he loaned Shirley and Dean for Blades' back. He learns that he will never be able to walk again due to his cancerous tumour pushing on his spine. Babe and Cora visit him, and he proposes to Cora, which upsets Babe as she reveals she never stopped loving him. Cora accepts after Babe gives her her blessing, delighting Stan.|$|E
