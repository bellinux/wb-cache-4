25|$|Clarett's time at Ohio State University {{was marked}} by several troubling incidents. He was seen yelling at his {{position}} coach during the Northwestern–Ohio State game in the 2002 season. In December 2002, he publicly maligned OSU officials for not paying for him to fly home for the funeral of a friend and accused administrators of lying <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> he had not filed the necessary paperwork. In July 2003, Clarett {{became the center of}} an academic scandal when a teaching assistant told the New York Times that Clarett had received preferential treatment from professors, claiming he had not attended any classes during his only year at Ohio State. However, the investigation did not find sufficient evidence of academic misconduct.|$|E
25|$|It {{was around}} this time that the project was joined by both the US Coast Guard and the Royal Canadian Navy. The project was still top secret at this time, and little actual {{information}} was shared, especially with the Coast Guard. The Canadian liaison was required, as ideal siting for the stations would require several stations in various locations in the Canadian Maritime Provinces. One site in Nova Scotia {{proved to be a}} battle; the site was owned by a fisherman whose domineering teetotaler wife was dead set against having {{anything to do with the}} sinful Navy men. When the site selection committee of J.A. Waldschmitt and Lt. Cdmr. Argyle were discussing the matter with the husband, a third visitor arrived and he offered the men cigarettes. They refused, and the hostess then asked if they drank. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> they did not, the land was quickly secured.|$|E

25|$|George Orson Welles {{was born}} May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, son of Richard Head Welles (b. Richard Hodgdon Wells, November 12, 1872, near St. Joseph, Missouri; d. December 28, 1930, Chicago, Illinois) and Beatrice Ives Welles (b. Beatrice Lucy Ives, September 1, 1883, Springfield, Illinois; d. May 10, 1924, Chicago). He {{was named after}} his {{paternal}} great-grandfather, influential Kenosha attorney Orson S. Head, and his brother George Head. An alternative story {{of the source of}} his first and middle names is one told by George Ade, who met Welles's parents on a West Indies cruise toward the end of 1914. Ade was traveling with a friend, Orson Wells (no relation), {{and the two of them}} sat at the same table as Mr. and Mrs. Richard Welles. Mrs Welles was pregnant at the time, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> good-by, she told them that she had enjoyed their company so much that if the child were a boy, she intended to name it for them - George Orson. Welles's birth announcement and a picture of him as a young boy are among George Ade's papers at Purdue University.|$|E
25|$|In August 2013, DCFEMS {{reported}} that it had significantly lowered EMS response times in April, May, June, and July 2013. The department said its standard was {{to respond to a}} call (e.g., leave the station) within 6.5 minutes 90 percent of the time. The department lowered its response time from 84 percent of the time in February 2013 to 92 percent of the time in June 2013. The response time for critical calls (about half of those received every day) also fell, from 5:03 minutes in February 2013 to 4:02 minutes in June 2013. Ellerbe attributed the improvements to a new protocol that required ambulance crews and firefighter EMTs to submit paperwork justifying the response time every time it exceeded the standard. Ellerbe suggested that some employees were simply not responding very quickly, and noted that at least one employee was disciplined {{for not being able to}} justify a slow response time. The firefighters' union complained about the amount of paperwork required, and said crews were sacrificing safety in order to meet the response time standard. The union claimed there had been a sharp rise in minor road accidents since Ellerbe's protocol went into effect, and that some crews were lying <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> they had responded.|$|E

Instead, the 2010 film {{is more of a}} reimagining. The pair also explained that A Nightmare on Elm Street would have a different tone than the Friday the 13th remake. Form states, [...] "I think a Friday the 13th movie like we made was really fun. You know, sex, drugs and rock and roll, and I think a Nightmare movie is not that." ...|$|E

GameSpot mentioned that the [...] "great sense of humor" [...] of the original game is also noticeable in Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando, a statement echoed by GameZone <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> that the game's cut-scenes [...] "represent some of the most thought-out and gut-wrenchingly funny sequences ever witnessed in a platforming game." ...|$|E
500|$|The Project 69 {{ships were}} {{intended}} to use a newly designed [...] gun in a new triple turret, but they were both well behind schedule when Joseph Stalin asked the Germans in February 1940 if any triple [...] turrets were available for purchase under the German–Soviet Commercial Agreement. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> no, he then asked if any twin [...] turrets were available instead. Krupp had six incomplete turrets on hand that had originally been ordered before the war to rearm the Scharnhorst-class battleships, but they had been cancelled {{after the start of}} World War II. A preliminary purchase agreement was made to buy 12 guns and six turrets later that month, well before any studies were made to see if the substitution was even possible. It was later determined that they could be used, so the agreement was finalized in November 1940 with the deliveries scheduled from October 1941 to 28 March 1943.|$|E
500|$|In May, {{columnist}} Joel Stein of Time magazine {{wrote about}} {{his young son}} Laszlo's frustration with the inescapable [...] "cultural assault" [...] of Frozen at preschool and all social and extracurricular activities, and how he had arranged for a Skype call with lead actress Bell after Laszlo began asking why the film was made. When Laszlo asked whether Bell knew when she made Frozen {{that it would take}} over kids' lives, she replied: [...] "I did not know that people would not let it go. No pun intended." [...] In a December 2014 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Lee acknowledged that she had transitioned from thanking people when they expressed their appreciation for Frozen to having to apologize <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> [...] "we're still listening to those songs" [...] (with their children). Lee also said that she used the film and its strong female characters to inspire her own daughter, who had experienced bullying at school, and admitted that she herself as a child was bullied as well; thus, they had managed to be true to themselves like Anna and Elsa.|$|E

500|$|The {{environment}} in Lody's boarding-house was becoming increasingly hostile; his hosts were growing suspicious of him. Their doubts grew as the ongoing espionage scare progressed. He had {{stayed there for}} more than three weeks and his evasive answers when questioned about when he expected to leave did not satisfy them. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> that his accent appeared to be [...] "more German than American", he knew it was time to go. He wrote in his letter of 27 September that [...] "the fear of espionage is very great and every day I see some Germans going to Redford Barracks under the escort of a soldier... It is advisable for me to vanish for a few days, and to change my place of abode. I can only hope that my telegraphic and letter information have duly arrived." [...] He told his controllers that he would go to Ireland, disembarking at Dublin as it was the only Irish port not closed to foreigners. Despite his hopes, his letter was intercepted by the British; this time it was retained as the information therein was of genuine military value.|$|E
500|$|When {{choosing}} {{candidates for}} the Tatsunoko and Capcom character rosters, the development team was free to nominate any character it wished. However, the team faced limitations on its Tatsunoko candidates; Niitsuma explained, [...] " [...] had to consider licensing issues. Once we had that list we {{had to figure out}} how to make a balanced fighting game. On top of that we wanted a good balance between male and female characters." [...] Selection emphasis was placed on main characters, rather than on villains. Certain characters were denied by Tatsunoko Production without explanation to Capcom. [...] "We weren't privy to a lot of their decision making process. They didn't share a lot of reasons with us. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> no and we asked why, they wouldn't tell us, but would give us another suggestion," [...] Niitsuma said. They disallowed characters from Genesis Climber MOSPEADA or Samurai Pizza Cats, despite the high number of fan requests for the latter. The eponymous characters of Tatsunoko's Muteking, The Dashing Warrior and Nurse Witch Komugi were among those planned for inclusion, but were eventually scrapped. The finalized Tatsunoko cast consists of characters that the team enjoyed in their youth. The development team hoped to include Capcom's Phoenix Wright and Franziska von Karma from the Ace Attorney series, but, while the latter's use of a whip made her easy to incorporate, the team struggled to find appropriate attacks for Phoenix. Since Phoenix doesn't move from the waist down in his original game environment, the team considered adding tires to his desk and having the entirety move as a single character. However, this was abandoned due to potential collision issues. Though they envisioned an attack that used his catch-phrase [...] "", with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the Japanese four-character phrase (in kanji) to a ten-letter word in English, unbalancing the game. Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution were also scrapped.|$|E
