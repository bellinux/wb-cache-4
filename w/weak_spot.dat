5|$|Uneven heating {{can cause}} newly {{generated}} gases {{to break out}} of a <b>weak</b> <b>spot</b> on the surface of comet's nucleus, like a geyser. These streams of gas and dust can cause the nucleus to spin, and even split apart. In 2010 it was revealed dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) can power jets of material flowing out of a comet nucleus. Infrared imaging of Hartley 2 shows such jets exiting and carrying with it dust grains into the coma.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{criminal}} genius Lex Luthor {{plans to}} make a fortune in real estate by buying large amounts of barren desert land, then using a nuclear explosion on a weak point in the San Andreas Fault, sinking California and leaving Luthor's desert as the new West Coast, greatly increasing its value. Upon learning the U.S Army and U.S. Navy will launch a twin nuclear missile test, he diverts one missile to the <b>weak</b> <b>spot,</b> after his incompetent henchman Otis accidentally redirects the first missile to the wrong place.|$|E
5|$|Six partygoers {{simultaneously}} fall to {{the sidewalk}} outside the Rosencrantz apartment building in Brooklyn, apparently having jumped from a seventh floor balcony along with the balcony's furniture. When the Fringe team investigates, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) determine by {{the location of the}} bodies that they seem to have fallen through the balcony, as if it momentarily ceased to exist. From other stories of strange phenomena occurring throughout the building, Walter concludes that the same cracks in reality that have harmed the parallel universe are starting to appear in the prime one, with the building occupying a <b>weak</b> <b>spot</b> between universes.|$|E

Industrial reliability simulations based on aging of devices {{have been used to}} locate these <b>weak</b> <b>spots.</b> The objective is to improve the resilience of the circuit during its design and validation phase after determination of the <b>weak</b> <b>spots.</b> In the case of our target chip, this complete cycle was successfully completed. Finally a new simulation principle is being proposed in order to automate the search for <b>weak</b> <b>spots</b> to speed-up and strengthen this search. It enables at an early design stage to take appropriate counter measures to improve resilience...|$|R

5|$|Vesuvius {{was formed}} {{as a result of}} the {{collision}} of two tectonic plates, the African and the Eurasian. The former was subducted beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and caused the melting point of the upper mantle to drop enough to create partial melting of the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a <b>weak</b> <b>spot</b> at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.|$|E
5|$|Amorium was {{strongly}} fortified and garrisoned, but a traitor revealed a <b>weak</b> <b>spot</b> in the wall, where the Abbasids concentrated their attack, effecting a breach. Unable {{to break through}} the besieging army, Boiditzes, the commander of the breached section privately attempted to negotiate with the Caliph without notifying his superiors. He concluded a local truce and left his post, which allowed the Arabs to take advantage, enter the city and capture it. Amorium was systematically destroyed, never to recover its former prosperity. Many of its inhabitants were slaughtered, and the remainder driven off as slaves. Most of the survivors were released after a truce in 841, but prominent officials were taken to the caliph's capital of Samarra and executed years later after refusing to convert to Islam, becoming known as the 42 Martyrs of Amorium.|$|E
5|$|The {{larval stage}} of dragonflies lasts {{up to five}} years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to {{metamorphose}} into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a <b>weak</b> <b>spot</b> behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.|$|E

5|$|From Ancyra, the Abbasid army {{turned to}} Amorium, {{to which they}} laid siege on 1 August. Al-Afshin, Itakh, and Ashinas all took turns assaulting the city with their troops, but the siege was {{fiercely}} contested, even after the Abbasids, informed by a defector, effected a breach in a <b>weak</b> <b>spot</b> of the wall. After two weeks, however, {{taking advantage of a}} short truce for negotiations requested by one of the Byzantine commanders of the breach, the Abbasid army stormed the city. The city was thoroughly plundered and its walls razed, while the populace, numbering into the tens of thousands, was carried off to be sold into slavery. According to al-Tabari, al-Mu'tasim now pondered extending his campaign to attack Constantinople, when the conspiracy headed by his nephew, al-Abbas, was uncovered. Al-Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, without bothering with Theophilos and his forces, encamped in nearby Dorylaion. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the caliph's army and its prisoners suffered in the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, whereupon others found the opportunity to escape. In retaliation, al-Mu'tasim, after separating the most prominent among them, executed the rest, some 6,000 in number.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{learns that}} Derek and Sharon {{will be going}} away from town for a few days, with Sharon leaving one {{afternoon}} and Derek the next day. While Sharon is {{on her way to}} pick up Kyle, she realizes she forgot to set the alarm system and returns home. Meanwhile, Lisa breaks into Derek and Sharon's house again and decorates the master bed with rose petals. While setting the alarm, Sharon hears Lisa in the bedroom. She confronts Lisa, who tries to convince her that Derek was seeing Lisa. However, Sharon sees through her lie and attempts to call the police, but Lisa tackles her to the floor, and the two engage in a fistfight. Derek calls the home phone and Lisa answers; he calls Detective Reese and they both head toward the house. Lisa runs to the attic and Sharon pursues her. Sharon leads her to a <b>weak</b> <b>spot</b> in the attic floor, where Lisa falls through. Seeing that Lisa is in mortal danger, Sharon reaches out in an attempt to grab Lisa and lift her up, but Lisa refuses and tries to pull Sharon down with her. Seeing that the floor is beginning to buckle, Sharon pries Lisa off of her arm. Lisa falls and smashes onto the glass table below. A chandelier falls from the ceiling onto Lisa, eventually killing her. Detective Reese arrives as Sharon comes out of the house. As soon as Detective Reese goes inside the house to investigate Lisa's actions, Derek soon arrives; he and Sharon then tearfully embrace one another.|$|E
5|$|While on {{the trail}} of the vampire known as The Moon, they then run into trouble when the shape-shifting vampire Hierophant tracks them and finds them. The group {{attempts}} to fight him, but he proves to be too powerful. When notified by Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) that the Hierophant cannot enter houses without permission, Jake shapeshifts into a house and the group takes shelter inside. The Hierophant then tells Marceline that he didn't come to fight, but to propose an alliance to take down the Vampire King together. Marceline agrees only on the condition that the Hierophant no longer drinks blood, but he attacks her instead. During the struggle, he is accidentally knocked into Jake and dies due to entering a house uninvited. Marceline reabsorbs his shapeshifting powers but then falls ill, having been stung and poisoned by the Hierophant's stinger. Princess Bubblegum takes Marceline to the Candy Kingdom {{to try to find a}} cure for the Hierophant's poison. Meanwhile, Finn and Jake track down the Moon in hopes of using her healing power to heal Marceline. Upon finding the Moon, they find that due to her healing powers, they can't kill her with their stakes. When the sun sets, the Moon wakes up and Finn and Jake flee, luring the Moon to the Candy Kingdom. However, when they try to fight back, the Moon uses her powers to incapacitate Finn and Jake as she attempts to kill Marceline. Fortunately, Peppermint Butler stabs the Moon in the back, her only <b>weak</b> <b>spot.</b> Marceline reabsorbs the Moon's healing power and fully recovers from the poison.|$|E

40|$|For {{proteins}} that denature irreversibly, the denaturation is typically {{triggered by a}} partial unfolding, followed by a permanent change (e. g., aggregation). The regions that initiate the partial unfolding are named "weak spots". In this work, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and data analysis protocol is developed to identify the <b>weak</b> <b>spots</b> of Trichoderma reesei Cel 7 B, an important endoglucanase in cellulose hydrolysis, through assigning the local melting temperature (Tmp) to individual residue pairs. To test the predicted <b>weak</b> <b>spots,</b> a total of eight disulfide bonds were designed in these regions and all enhanced the enzyme thermostability. The increased stability, quantified by triangle T- 50 (which is the T- 50 difference between the mutant and the wild type enzyme), is negatively correlated with the MD-predicted T-mp, demonstrating {{the effectiveness of the}} protocol and highlighting the importance of the <b>weak</b> <b>spots.</b> Strengthening interactions in these regions proves to be a useful strategy in improving the thermostability of Tr.

25|$|Pouring metal defects include misruns, cold shuts, and inclusions. A misrun {{occurs when}} the liquid metal does not {{completely}} fill the mold cavity, leaving an unfilled portion. Cold shuts occur when two fronts of liquid metal do not fuse properly in the mold cavity, leaving a <b>weak</b> <b>spot.</b> Both are caused by either a lack of fluidity in the molten metal or cross-sections that are too narrow. The fluidity can be increased by changing the chemical composition of the metal or by increasing the pouring temperature. Another possible cause is back pressure from improperly vented mold cavities.|$|E
