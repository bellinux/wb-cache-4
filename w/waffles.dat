It is also used as sweetener for granola, applesauce, baked beans, candied sweet potatoes, winter squash, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and hot toddies. Maple syrup can also be used as a replacement for honey in wine (mead).|$|E
5|$|Using a wheelchair, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan) {{continues}} to order Bree (Marcia Cross) around at his whim {{and refuses to}} let her give him a bath. When Orson refuses to say please while Bree brings him breakfast, she places the <b>waffles</b> on a shelf he cannot reach. When the physical therapist arrives, he pretends to be starving and abused. The therapist tells Bree she must be more patient, or she will be reported. Later, when Orson still refuses to be bathed, Bree takes him outside and sprays him with the garden hose until he begs her to stop. He breaks down and admits he is miserable at the prospective of a life in which he needs {{to ask for help}} in everything. Bree finally understands, and asks Orson for forgiveness.|$|E
25|$|Bergische <b>waffles,</b> or <b>Waffles</b> from Berg county, are a {{specialty}} of the German region of Bergisches Land.

40|$|Abstract: As {{a part of}} an {{innovation}} project funded by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highways for LIFE program, a full-depth precast, ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) <b>waffle</b> deck panel and appropriate connections suitable for field implementation of <b>waffle</b> decks were developed. Following a successful full-scale validation test on a unit consisting of two panels with various types of connections under laboratory conditions, the <b>waffle</b> deck was installed successfully on a replacement bridge in Wapello County, Iowa. The subsequent load testing confirmed the desirable performance of the UHPC <b>waffle</b> deck bridge. Using the lessons from the completed project and outcomes {{from a series of}} simple and detailed finite element analyses of <b>waffle</b> decks, this report was developed to serve as a guide for broadening the design and installation of the UHPC <b>waffle</b> deck panel in new and existing bridges. Following an introduction to UHPC and <b>waffle</b> deck panels and a summary of completed work, this document presents information on <b>waffle</b> deck design, design of connections, redecking using <b>waffle</b> deck panels, and guidance on precast fabrication, construction, and installation of UHPC <b>waffle</b> deck panels...|$|R

25|$|Hotdog <b>waffles</b> {{are long}} <b>waffles</b> {{with a hot}} dog cooked inside them, similar to a corn dog. Originating in Thailand, this snack is served with ketchup, mayonnaise, or both. The batter is similar to American <b>waffles,</b> but uses {{margarine}} instead of butter, as {{it is one of}} the more accepted eccentricities of their food culture.|$|E
25|$|By the 16th century, {{paintings}} by Joachim de Beuckelaer, Pieter Aertsen and Pieter Bruegel clearly depict the modern waffle form. Bruegel's work, in particular, not only shows <b>waffles</b> being cooked, but fine detail of individual <b>waffles.</b> In those instances, the waffle pattern {{can be counted}} as a large 12x7 grid, with cleanly squared sides, suggesting {{the use of a}} fairly thin batter, akin to our contemporary Brussels <b>waffles</b> (Brusselse wafels).|$|E
50|$|The wonut is {{made from}} a {{combination}} of the ingredients of a <b>waffle</b> and a doughnut. The first stage of preparation is to pour the batter, which is slightly thicker than regular <b>waffle</b> batter, into a <b>waffle</b> iron. Then, the <b>waffle</b> is deep-fried until it is crisp. The final product can be glazed, frosted, and/or dunked in various toppings.|$|R

40|$|<b>Waffle</b> {{panels are}} often used on {{fuselage}} structures {{such as that of}} the Space Shuttle. The <b>waffle</b> panel design is an efficient design for carrying biaxial, in-plane, and shear loads. The <b>WAFFLE</b> program was designed for application on <b>waffle</b> panels. The Panel Analysis and Sizing Code (PASCO) program was designed for analyzing and sizing uniaxially stiffened panels. The application of the PASCO program in conjunction with the <b>WAFFLE</b> program is discussed to account for both the fillet radius and the presence of stiffness in both directions. The results of the tests are used to verify that these adjustments are valid and necessary if accurate analysis of the <b>waffle</b> panel is to be achieved...|$|R
25|$|Germany {{became a}} leader in the {{development}} and publication of waffle recipes during the 18th century, introducing coffee <b>waffles,</b> the specific use of Hefeweizen beer yeast, cardamom, nutmeg, and a number of zuickerwaffeln (sugar <b>waffles).</b> At the same time, the French introduced whipped egg whites to <b>waffles,</b> along with lemon zests, Spanish wine, and cloves. Joseph Gillier even published the first chocolate waffle recipe, featuring three ounces of chocolate grated and mixed into the batter, before cooking.|$|E
25|$|Pandan <b>waffles</b> {{originate}} from Vietnam and {{are characterized by}} the use of pandan flavoring and coconut milk in the batter. The pandan flavoring results in the batter's distinctive spring green color. When cooked, the waffle browns and crisps on the outside and stays green and chewy on the inside. Unlike most <b>waffles,</b> pandan <b>waffles</b> are typically eaten plain. In Vietnam they are relatively cheap and so are popular among children. They are a popular street food made in either cast iron molds heated with charcoal or in electric waffle irons.|$|E

25|$|Stroopwafels {{are thin}} <b>waffles</b> with a syrup filling. The stiff batter for the <b>waffles</b> {{is made from}} flour, butter, brown sugar, yeast, milk, and eggs. Medium-sized balls of batter are put on the waffle iron. When the waffle is baked {{and while it is}} still warm, it is cut into two halves. The warm filling, made from syrup is spread in between the waffle halves, which glues them together. They are popular in the Netherlands and Belgium and sold in pre-prepared {{packages}} in shops and markets.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Waffle,</b> or {{sometimes}} honeycomb fabric, is fabric, usually cotton or microfibre, woven {{in a way}} which makes it very absorbent. The <b>waffle</b> weave also allows air to flow through the towel so that it dries quickly. <b>Waffle</b> fabrics are made in a range of weights.|$|R
40|$|A compact <b>waffle</b> MOSFET {{using an}} {{enhanced}} waffle-layout strategy is presented {{together with the}} comparison with the traditional <b>waffle</b> design. The enhanced compact <b>waffle</b> MOSFET's have been fabricated using a 0. 35 -mum standard CMOS process. The true compactness of the enhanced compact <b>waffle</b> design is verified by the experimental results which show a reduction of about 25 % in drain diffusion capacitance per unit transistor width but without any performance compromise in driving current, transconductance and subthreshold characteristics of the <b>waffle</b> MOSFET. With its compactness, the enhanced <b>waffle</b> layout uses about 35 % less active device area compared with the multifinger counterpart. All these benefits are obtained without any extra processing cost. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|Belgian cuisine is characterised by the {{combination}} of French cuisine with the more hearty Flemish fare. Notable specialities include Brussels <b>waffles</b> (gaufres) and mussels (usually as moules-frites, served with fries). The city is a stronghold of chocolate and pralines manufacturers with renowned companies like Neuhaus, Leonidas and Godiva. Pralines were first introduced, in 1912, by Jean Neuhaus II, a Belgian chocolatier of Swiss origin, in the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert, in central Brussels. Numerous friteries are spread throughout the city, and in tourist areas, fresh hot <b>waffles</b> are also sold on the street.|$|E
25|$|Liège <b>waffles,</b> {{the most}} popular {{contemporary}} Belgian waffle variety, are rumored to have been invented during the 18th century, as well, by the chef to the prince-bishop of Liège. However, there are no German, French, Dutch, or Belgian cookbooks that contain references to them in this period – by any name – nor are there any waffle recipes that mention the Liège waffle's distinctive ingredients, brioche-based dough and pearl sugar. It is not until 1814 that Antoine Beauvilliers publishes a recipe in l'Art du Cuisiner where brioche dough is introduced as {{the base of the}} waffle and sucre cassé (crushed block sugar) is used as a garnish for the <b>waffles,</b> though not worked into the dough. Antonin Carême, the famous Parisian pastry chef, is the first to incorporate gros sucre into several waffle variations named in his 1822 work, Le Maitre d'Hotel Français. Then, in 1834, Leblanc publishes a complete recipe for gaufres grêlées (hail <b>waffles),</b> where gros sucre is mixed in. A full Gaufre de Liège recipe does not appear until 1921.|$|E
