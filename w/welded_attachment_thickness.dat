40|$|Welded steel {{connections}} of infrastructures {{are susceptible}} to fatigue failure. Advanced carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) has been demonstrated promising for fatigue strengthening of steel structures. Limited research was conducted on CFRP strengthening of welded connections. This paper focuses on the application of ultra high modulus (UHM) CFRP plates with a modulus of 460 GPa to strengthen steel plates with longitudinal fillet <b>weld</b> <b>attachment</b> using five CFRP strengthening configurations. A series of fatigue tension tests were carried out with constant amplitude fatigue loading. Beach marking technique was adopted to record the crack propagation process. Effects of CFRP bond length, bond width and bond locations on fatigue performance of welded steel joints were investigated. The experimental results showed that UHM CFRP plates could generally increase the fatigue life of the welded steel joints. It seems better to apply CFRP on the welding side of the specimen to achieve longer fatigue life. Then, the effects of <b>weld</b> and <b>weld</b> <b>attachment</b> on the CFRP strengthening efficiency was further studied by comparing experimental results of non-welded steel plates with single side UHM CFRP plate strengthening. Finally, the classification method was adopted to assess the strengthening efficiency of the UHM CFRP plate to the steel plates with longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>attachment...</b>|$|R

With this in mind, they cannot afford downtime or service interruptions due to bridge or member replacement. Corrosion of bridges causes millions of dollars each year for the railroad industry in terms of maintenance and inspection. Since a large number of these bridges are steel and their service life is typically governed by fatigue of welded details, it is important to determine the interactions of the corrosion and fatigue mechanisms. While there are differing opinions on the effects of corrosion on the fatigue life of <b>welded</b> steel <b>attachments,</b> the intent of this research is to experimentally investigate the relationship between fatigue and corrosion and determine whether this relationship is beneficial, neutral, or detrimental to the fatigue behavior of <b>welded</b> <b>attachments.</b> In order to investigate the effects of corrosion on the fatigue life of <b>welded</b> steel <b>attachments,</b> a testing methodology simulating the conditions a bridge could be expected to experience during its service life is established, executed and the results evaluated. Thirty-two specimens were subjected to cycles of corrosion and interval fatigue loading at varying corrosion times and fatigue cycles.

40|$|The present paper summarises {{an attempt}} of proposing a simple formula {{suitable}} for estimating the fatigue strength of welded connections whose weld beads are inclined {{with respect to}} the direction along which the fatigue loading is applied. By explicitly considering the degree of multiaxiality of the nominal stress state damaging the weld toe, such a formula is directly derived from the so-called Modified Wöhler Curve Method (MWCM). The MWCM is a bi-parametrical critical plane approach which postulates that, independently from the complexity of the assessed load history, fatigue strength can accurately be estimated by using the stress components relative to that material plane experiencing the maximum shear stress range. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed design technique was checked against a number of experimental results taken from the literature and generated by testing steel plates with inclined fillet <b>welded</b> <b>attachments.</b> This validation exercise allowed us to prove that the devised formula can successfully be used in situations of practical interest to design against fatigue welded joints whose welds are inclined {{with respect to the}} direction along which the cyclic force is applied...|$|R

Residual tensile stresses re-duce the fatigue life of welded joints {{in the region}} of multi-cycle loading by two to three times and more. The effect of tensile residual stresses on the fatigue limit of symmetrically loaded (R = minus 1) welded joints is equal to that of stress concentration factor.

The new U-channel joint was tested in tension, compression and bending to investigate its characteristics. It is found to have good performance in bending also, even though in compression it performs same as the circular fillet joint. An extensive parametric study was carried out to investigate the effect of parameters like flange skin stiffener, foam density, foam thickness in the web, and aluminum attachments.

Under ideal conditions, the use of infra-red instrumentation should allow bridge inspection personnel to rapidly scan the structure and determine if a potential structural problem has developed. If a problem spot is located by the infra-red camera, then the trouble spot can be examined carefully to determine the need for corrective maintenance. The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of sensitive infra-red equipment for detecting fatigue cracks in steel highway bridge structures and components. The performance and sensitivity of one particular infra-red system was explored by conducting tests on two different specimen types in the laboratory, followed by a check of the equipment under field conditions. Crack detection sensitivity in the laboratory was evaluated using a center-hole test coupon geometry as well as a <b>welded</b> <b>attachment</b> plate detail. The test samples were subjected to cyclic loading to initiate and propagate a fatigue crack. Control variables for the infra-red system were then varied to evaluate the optimal conditions. The field tests were conducted to assess the equipment limitations and performance under field conditions. The detail inspected involved a vertical plate that was welded to the web of a beam member and used to attach transverse diaphragm cross-frame members; the diaphragm connection plate was selected for inspection because it was known that fatigue cracks had developed at the end of a number of the vertical plates. It was found that infra-red inspection could be used successfully to detect fatigue cracks in steel bridge members and components if the crack had propagated through the thickness. Consequently, the crack size that could be reliably and consistently detected was not significantly different from that which could be detected from a careful visual inspection. Moreover, a number of difficulties were encountered when using infra-red inspection in the field.

The tanks are examined by ultrasonic (UT) methods for thinning, pitting, and {{stress corrosion cracking}} {{in order to assess}} fitness-for-service. During an inspection in 2002, ten cracks were identified on one of the tanks. Given the location of the cracks (i. e., adjacent to <b>welds,</b> <b>weld</b> <b>attachments,</b> and <b>weld</b> repairs), fabrication details (e. g., this tank was not stress-relieved), and the service history the degradation mechanism was stress corrosion cracking. Crack instability calculations utilizing API- 579 guidance were performed to show that the combination of expected future service condition hydrostatic and weld residual stresses do not drive any of the identified cracks to instability. The cracks were re-inspected in 2007 to determine if crack growth had occurred. During this re-examination, one indication that was initially reported as a 'possible perpendicular crack < 25 % through wall' in 2002, was clearly shown not to be a crack. Additionally, examination of a new area immediately adjacent to other cracks along a vertical weld revealed three new cracks. It is not known when these new cracks formed as they could very well have been present in 2002 as well. Therefore, a total of twelve cracks were evaluated during the re-examination. Comparison of the crack lengths measured in 2002 and 2007 revealed that crack growth had occurred in four of the nine previously measured cracks. The crack length extension ranged from 0. 25 to 1. 8 inches. However, in all cases the cracks still remained within the residual stress zone (i. e., within two to three inches of the weld). The impact of the cracks that grew on the future service of Tank 15 was re-assessed. API- 579 crack instability calculations were again performed, based on expected future service conditions and trended crack growth rates for the future tank service cycle.

Some results obtained for a nominal 100 Degree F temperature drop across the thickness of the superheater header wall yielded a maximum hoop stress of 19. 01 (Ksi) and a maximum in plane stress of 1. 58 (Ksi).

40|$|Stress-assisted {{corrosion}} (SAC) {{was observed}} on the waterside of mild steel recovery boiler tubes only at locations exhibiting {{the combination of}} a substantial external <b>attachment</b> <b>weld</b> and a significant internal oxide accumulation compared to the nominal Fe 3 O 4 film. Penetrations of up to 30 % of the tube wall thickness were observed metallographically, and the penetrations were invariably transgranular with bulbous features, rounded tips, and filled with a relatively dense oxide comprised of alternating layers of Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4. Microprobe analysis also revealed the presence of trace quantities (0. 1 – 1 at. %) of Cu, Cl, P, and S in the oxide, indicating at least one source of contamination in the boiler feed water. Nondestructive testing, which included two ultrasonic techniques, radiography, and visual inspection with a borescope, was not particularly successful for detecting SAC...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} observed that complex fabricated structures subject to fatigue loading fail at the welded joints. Some {{problems can be}} corrected by proper detail design but fatigue performance can also be improved using post-weld improvement methods. In general, improvement methods {{can be divided into}} two main groups: weld geometry modification methods and residual stress modification methods. The former remove weld toe defects and/or reduce the stress concentration while the latter introduce compressive stress fields in the area where fatigue cracks are likely to initiate. The ultrasonic impact treatment method belongs to the class of residual stress improvement methods. The method makes use of an ultrasonic carrier frequency to accelerate hardened tools that, in turn, impact the weld toe. The fatigue strength of non-load carrying attachments in the as-welded condition has been experimentally compared to the fatigue strength of ultrasonic impact treated <b>welds.</b> Longitudinal <b>attachment</b> specimens made of two thicknesses of steel S 355 J 0 have been tested for determining the efficiency of ultrasonic impact treatment. Treated welds were found to have about 50 % greater fatigue strength, when the slope of the S-N–curve is three. High mean stress fatigue testing based on the Ohta-method did not decrease the degree of weld improvement due to UIT. This indicated that the method could be also applied for large fabricated structures operating under high reactive residual stresses equilibrated within the volume of the structure. 1...|$|R
