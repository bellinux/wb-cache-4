5|$|One day <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> is out, Sasha finds a {{bag with}} a very young cat inside it in the water. The captain takes him home and names him Patch. The spring thaw arrives, and the captain ties up the boat and prepares to go elsewhere. Sasha decides not {{to go with the}} captain and Patch because she now knows that she is going to have kits, and wants them born in the forest. Patch and the captain are sad, but they understand.|$|E
5|$|Ramón Jiménez, Fernández's stepfather, {{defected}} from Cuba in 2005, {{settling in}} Tampa, Florida. Fernández attempted to defect unsuccessfully three times, with each failed defection attempt {{followed by a}} prison term. Fernández, along {{with his mother and}} sister, defected in 2007. On that successful attempt, José's mother fell overboard <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> hit turbulent waters, and José had to dive into the water to save her life. They reached Mexico, and then moved to Tampa in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Romanians {{boarded the}} SS Conte Verde at Genoa, the French {{were picked up}} at Villefranche-sur-Mer on 21 June 1930; and the Belgians {{embarked}} at Barcelona. The Conte Verde carried Rimet, the trophy and the three designated European referees: the Belgians Jean Langenus and Henri Christophe, along with Thomas Balway, a Parisian {{who may have been}} English. The Brazilian team were picked up <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> docked in Rio de Janeiro on 29 June before arriving in Uruguay on 4 July. Yugoslavia travelled via the mail steamship Florida from Marseille.|$|E

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> were at last filled {{they pushed}} off and rowed towards the rock. On {{approaching}} it {{the men were}} cautioned to pull steadily by Mr Stevenson, who steered <b>the</b> leading <b>boat.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now 'd be your chance, Joe, if {{they had}} n't taken the skiff," [...] 'Frisco Kid whispered, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> had {{vanished}} into the loom of the land.|$|R
5|$|After 10 days of {{questioning}} Winter {{was taken to}} Rennes, where he was joined three days later by Captain Burton, Hollings, and Orr. These three had managed to stay together <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> was sunk, and were captured by a German parachute unit carrying out manoeuvres. Burton {{was sent to a}} prisoner of war camp in Germany, Winter, Hollings and Orr were taken to Frankfurt and handed over to the Gestapo for further questioning, after which Winter was sent to a prisoner of war camp at Memmingen. The fate of Hollings and Orr has never been established. Winter and a Special Air Service officer escaped from the camp in April 1945, disguised as French soldiers. Desgranges was also able to escape from captivity, travelling via Spain to Britain, where he joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE).|$|E
5|$|Following the Games, she {{received}} death threats upon returning to Somalia, and after being confronted by Al-Shabaab, {{she began to}} deny {{that she was an}} athlete. The organisation banned woman from participating in sports, and Omar eventually made her way to Ethiopia in order to pursue the hope of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics. She attempted to make her way to Europe, travelling to Libya in September 2011. Alongside other refugees, she attempted to cross the Mediterranean by sea in 2012; she drowned while attempting to board an Italian naval vessel <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> she was on was intercepted off the coast of Libya. Omar's life story was later dramatised as the graphic novel An Olympic Dream: The story of Samia Yusuf Omar by German artist Reinhard Kleist.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} October 9, 2002 and wrapped by March 7, 2003. The quick shoot was only marred by two accidents: as Jack Sparrow steals the Interceptor, {{three of the}} ropes attaching it to the Dauntless did not break at first, {{and when they did}} snap, debris hit Depp's knee, though he was not injured, and the way the incident played out on film made it look like Sparrow merely ducks. A more humorous accident was <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> Sparrow was supposed to arrive in at Port Royal sank. In October, the crew was shooting scenes at Rancho Palos Verdes, by December they were shooting at Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and in January they were at the cavern set at Los Angeles. The script often changed with Elliott and Rossio on set, with additions such as Gibbs (Kevin McNally) telling Will how Sparrow allegedly escaped from an island – strapping two turtles together with rope made of his back hair – and Pryce was written into the climactic battle to keep some empathy for the audience.|$|E

5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} Wallace didn’t {{come back to}} Neptune to play basketball, as he {{originally}} said. Dick delivers the drugs, and Logan learns that Hector is now the prime suspect in Felix's death. Two FBI agents talk to Sheriff Lamb, intent on getting the baby back. Veronica shows some information about Duncan’s computer. Weevil talks to Hector, who denies the accusation. The FBI agents and Sheriff Lamb learn that Duncan stole a boat. However, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> is searched they do not find anyone—just evidence that people were there. Veronica thinks that Duncan has been picked up by someone. Veronica asks Vinnie Van Lowe to give a letter to Duncan. Weevil talks to Sean Friedrich (Kevin Sheridan), a drug dealer, but learns that he wasn’t working for the Fitzpatricks. Veronica talks to Wallace (Percy Daggs III), who says that a teammate crashed his car into a man and drove away {{while he was in}} it. He felt incredibly guilty and decided to come back.|$|E

50|$|The {{state of}} peril {{in which the}} {{occupants}} of <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> found themselves {{at the time of}} their discovery was further confirmed by a cellphone call made by one occupant to a relative in Italy on the same day of 21 May, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat's</b> engine was said to have stopped, with water coming into <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first HADAG harbour tours {{started in}} 1921. The tour guides often told anecdotes and stories. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> {{came close to}} workers in the harbour, they would {{denounce}} the tour guides by saying [...] "he lücht" [...] (he lies).|$|R

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> {{was under}} Israeli control, activists {{were made to}} sit down and {{restrained}} with plastic ties. One man who complained that the plastic ties were too tight had them removed, then ran and jumped overboard, and was picked up by another boat. Passengers were searched one-by-one and then taken to the main salon. They were allowed to prepare food, but refused to eat until an IDF cameraman ceased filming them.|$|E
25|$|On September 21, 2001, a 40-year-old woman {{fell out}} of the boat when it plunged and died of {{multiple}} injuries sustained because of the blunt force trauma.

Her seat belt and lap bar were closed and locked <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> returned to the station.|$|E
25|$|During the 2007 World Cup, he {{got drunk}} {{with some of}} his {{teammates}} before an important game, and nearly drowned <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> carrying them capsized. In a 2014 episode of 8 out of 10 cats, he claimed that he was attempting to sail home in a pedalo. He stated that he awoke on a beach – the worst place he had ever slept. He lost his position as vice-captain and was fined, but remained {{as a member of the}} team.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> {{were beyond}} <b>the</b> Boyd's sight the Māori {{attacked}} the pākehā (foreigners), killing all with clubs and axes.

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> reached <b>the</b> fishing grounds, {{they came}} to and anchored, their masts coming out in slender {{silhouette}} against the sky. A row of dark figures was standing up in every boat; the gulfs shining expanse was darkened by odd black streaks--the mackerel had begun to school.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you have}} an {{extremely}} impudent one, Charlie. But {{can you tell me}} at what time <b>the</b> mackerel <b>boats</b> may be expected this evening, for it seems the old fellow is not often to be found at home during the day, and we shall be pretty sure to find him on <b>the</b> beach <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> arrive?" ...|$|R
25|$|In 2008, {{a former}} FBI agent {{asserted}} that {{some members of}} the Hells Angels had conspired to murder Mick Jagger in retribution for the Rolling Stones' lack of support following the concert, and for the negative portrayal of the Angels in the Gimme Shelter film.
