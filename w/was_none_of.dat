5|$|Among Cincinnati receivers, there <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the {{uncertainty}} that afflicted the Bearcats' quarterbacks. Wide receiver Mardy Gilyard caught 74passes {{during the regular}} season, setting a Cincinnati record with 1,118receiving yards. He also had 10touchdowns during the season, leading all Cincinnati players. Gilyard also played as the Bearcats' primary kick returner. He returned 32kicks, accumulating a school-record 897yards and 2touchdowns. Fellow wide receiver Dominick Goodman outpaced Gilyard in receptions with 78, but he had only 977receiving yards and 7touchdowns. On the first play of Cincinnati's game against Hawaii, Dominick injured his shoulder {{and his ability to}} play in the Orange Bowl was in doubt.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{stayed in}} jail for two months {{awaiting}} his trial. He had one hour per day of exercise with other prisoners. They could not understand his motive for the attack on Frick. Surely {{it must have been}} a personal dispute or a business quarrel. His explanations were met with condescending smiles. One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker who was about to stand trial for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers did not believe in violence. Berkman had no connection with Homestead, and the strike <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> his business. He had only hurt the workers' cause with his action.|$|E

25|$|Although the Argentine {{players and}} public criticised the {{awarding}} of the penalty kick, the game was generally played in a good, if highly competitive, spirit, and there <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the bitterness that had affected the 1966, 1986 and 1998 meetings.

25|$|Modern {{research}} has {{confirmed that the}} 1,400 tonnes of ore brought back to England from Baffin Island in 1577 and 1578 were not gold-bearing. Moreover, the original black stone on which Agnello conducted his tests in January 1577 had been found on Hall's Island during the 1576 voyage; according to Michael Lok's account, no ore was discovered during a search of Hall's Island on the second voyage of 1577, and Frobisher 'never after brought home one stone more of that rich ore which he brought in the first voyage, for there <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it to be found'.|$|E

25|$|The work at Dartford thus {{came to a}} halt. In {{a report}} in 1581 Schutz' design for the Dartford furnace was blamed, but recent modern {{research}} has shown that the real problem was that the 1400 tonnes of ore brought back to England from Baffin Island were not gold-bearing. Hogarth concluded that since Schutz had attempted to buy all the ore himself, he was unlikely to have tampered with the tests, and the 'inescapable conclusion' is that the assay method was at fault, perhaps because of contamination from additives necessarily used in the process. McDermott also notes that Schutz' original test while he was on Countess of Warwick Island had been on a 'rich red ore' from Jonas' Mount, but little of that ore was brought back on the 1577 voyage because the ships were already laden with black ore before the red ore was found, and Frobisher did not mine at Jonas' Mount on the 1578 voyage. Moreover, the original black stone had been found by Garrard on Hall's Island during the 1576 voyage, and according to Michael Lok's account, no ore was discovered during a search of Hall's Island on the second voyage of 1577, and Frobisher 'never after brought home one stone more of that rich ore which he brought in the first voyage, for there <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> it to be found'.|$|E
25|$|A retired Chicago {{police officer}} named Bill Dorsch has stated he {{has reason to}} believe {{there may be more}} victims buried within the grounds of the {{apartment}} building located at the 6100 block of West Miami Avenue in Chicago; a property which Gacy is known to have been the caretaker of for several years prior to his 1978 arrest. In 1975, Dorsch—then a Chicago police officer—observed Gacy (whom he knew on a casual basis), holding a shovel {{in the early hours of}} the morning. When confronted by Dorsch as to his actions, Gacy stated he was performing work that he was too busy to do during the day. Dorsch has also related that several other residents of West Miami Avenue have stated that, in the early- to mid-1970s, they had observed Gacy digging trenches in the grounds of the property; one of these residents has also stated that Gacy would later place plants in the elongated trenches he had dug. At the time these actions had been observed, Gacy had still been married to Carole Hoff. Following his first murder in January 1972, he is not known to have buried any murder victims beneath his own home until one month after his March, 1976 divorce. (John Butkovitch had been buried beneath his garage and the unknown victim known as Body 28 had been buried in his backyard.) Gacy's wife had informed investigators that, on several occasions in the years preceding their divorce, she had found several men's wallets and identification cards discarded about the property at 8213 Summerdale. When she had confronted Gacy about these items, he had angrily informed her the property <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> her business.|$|E

500|$|Regarding {{the lyrics}} aimed {{at his wife}} Faith, Biggie {{expressed}} an inability to find merit in what Shakur had claimed.

500|$|He further {{contended that}} {{helicopter}} operations in Malaysia had afforded the RAAF sufficient {{experience in the}} type of conditions they might face in Vietnam, though Australia's senior UH-1 pilot at the time considered that the former theatre offered [...] "little if any hostile opposition, and there <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the insertion and extraction of SAS patrols which was to become such {{an important part of the}} RAAF's Vietnam operations". Air Commodore Brian Eaton, as Director-General of Operational Requirements, advised Murdoch that if the Air Force did not more fully satisfy the ground support requirements of the Army, then the Army itself would seek to take control of this sphere of operations, undermining the RAAF's position as the main provider of Australia's air power. Murdoch's reluctance to deploy the helicopters was eventually overridden by the Australian government, and No.9 Squadron's UH-1s were in action in Vietnam less than a year later. When Murdoch visited the combat zone himself in August 1966, he was informed by Brigadier David Jackson that the squadron was not performing the role the Army expected of it.|$|E

500|$|However, {{some critics}} gave the episode mixed to {{negative}} reviews. Tom Ryan of WhatCulture rated the episode {{two and a}} half out of five stars, summing up the review with; [...] "Given the popularity of the original book and the success thus far of the current TV series, it is safe to assume that last nights episode was perhaps the most eagerly anticipated installment of the show since its inception. Too bad then that it was so underwhelming." [...] The Guardian writer Stuart Heritage stated; [...] "Last night's Hounds of Baskervilles wasn't quite as rapturously received as other adventures, perhaps because of {{the amount of time that}} Cumberbatch and Freeman spent apart. The whole middle section, where Watson stormed off in a huff after being subjected to another one of Sherlock's baroque [...] "that man is left-handed and also has dog hair on one of his socks" [...] monologues, felt slow and flat precisely because there <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the chemistry between the two leads that we've come to expect from Sherlock."

500|$|West's {{breakthrough}} came a {{year later}} on October 23, 2002, when, while driving home from a California recording studio after working late, he fell {{asleep at the wheel}} and was involved in a near-fatal car crash. The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which had to be wired shut in reconstructive surgery. The accident inspired West; two weeks after being admitted to a hospital, he recorded a song at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut. The composition, [...] "Through the Wire", expressed West's experience after the accident, and helped lay the foundation for his debut album, as according to West [...] "all the better artists have expressed what they were going through". West added that [...] "the album was my medicine", as working on the record distracted him from the pain. [...] "Through the Wire" [...] was first available on West's Get Well Soon... mixtape, released December 2002. At the same time, West announced that he was working on an album called The College Dropout, whose overall theme was to [...] "make your own decisions. Don't let society tell you, 'This is what you have to do.'" [...] The album saw West tear down the outdated idea that rappers had {{to be a part of}} the gang life to create rap music. West never gave into the stereotype of the street kid who grew up in a tough world where the only form of survival was to join the gang. He <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> that, nor did he ever try to be any of that. West became a rapper in his own right, without adapting his style, without changing his appearance, without making his music fit the mold that those in the rap industry expected.|$|E
500|$|The Ball and Theakston {{series are}} {{considered}} to be when Live & Kicking was at its peak in popularity. After their final series in 1999, it was believed the BBC would replace Live & Kicking with another programme, as its two predecessors had both lasted six years. Instead, they continued with Live & Kicking, with new presenters Emma Ledden and Steve Wilson. The series {{was the beginning of the}} end for the show; Ledden and Wilson did not know each other at the start of the series, and so there <b>was</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the interaction between them, as seen between Ball and Theakston. Additionally, SMTV Live which broadcast opposite on ITV was slowly becoming more popular, and gaining the audience the BBC was losing. After just one series, Ledden and Wilson's contracts were not renewed. Wilson later said that they were dropped just as they were starting to form a relationship, and that Ant & Dec, presenters of SMTV Live, had the edge over them as they had known each other much longer. Ledden had already been dropped when Wilson went through several meetings with the BBC. He decided it was better to leave after one good series, rather than do a second [...] "lame" [...] series, and went on to appear in rival SMTV Live's 100th show, in the Friends skit, 'Chums'. When Live & Kicking returned in October 2000, it was completely revamped, with brand new titles and a line-up of four presenters. However, this did nothing to increase viewing figures, and the chemistry between the presenters was even less apparent. It was decided not to end the show in April and replace it with a summer show, because the replacement FBi had lost even more viewers for the BBC. Live & Kicking continued until September after a move to Glasgow where the summer show had normally been filmed. Just before the move it was announced it would be the final series. The principal reason given for the decision was the increasing loss of viewers to SMTV Live, which had a similar format and was more successful. Live and Kicking was replaced by The Saturday Show, fronted by Dani Behr and Joe Mace, which was shown all year round until September 2003 when it began an Autumn-Spring/Summer loop with Dick and Dom in da Bungalow. Live & Kicking was featured in the BBC's It Started with Swap Shop programme in 2006, where Noel Edmonds interviewed the first pair of presenters, Andi Peters and Emma Forbes, about their time on the show.|$|E
