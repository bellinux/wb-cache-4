25|$|As {{a result}} of {{damaging}} floods in 1936 and 1937, the Army Corps of Engineers proposed a series of dams that were intended to regulate the river {{and to provide a}} more reliable water supply. One dam was to be built at Little Falls, just north of Washington, backing its pool up to Great Falls. Just above Great Falls, a much larger dam was proposed whose reservoir would extend to Harpers Ferry. Several other dams were proposed for the Potomac and its tributaries. <b>When</b> <b>detailed</b> studies were issued by the Corps in the 1950s, they met sustained opposition, led by U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, resulting in the plans' abandonment. The only dam project that did get built was Jennings Randolph Lake on the North Branch. The Corps built a supplementary water intake for the Washington Aqueduct at Little Falls in 1959.|$|E

500|$|The Roman {{physician}} Galen {{also argued}} {{for the importance of}} the brain, and theorized in some depth about how it might work. Galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain, nerves, and muscles, demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a branching network of nerves. He postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called pneumata psychikon, usually translated as [...] "animal spirits". Galen's ideas were widely known during the Middle Ages, but not much further progress came until the Renaissance, <b>when</b> <b>detailed</b> anatomical study resumed, combined with the theoretical speculations of Ren√© Descartes and those who followed him. Descartes, like Galen, thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms. He believed that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non-physical res cogitans, but that the majority of behaviors of humans, and all behaviors of animals, could be explained mechanistically.|$|E
