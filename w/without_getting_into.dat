25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. <b>Without</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would simply say that I have been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at all. That, I suggest to my colleagues, would be a travesty.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked why}} he was {{compelled}} to revisit the Velázquez so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against popes per se, but merely sought [...] "an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour <b>without</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> a sort of false fauve manner." [...] Schmied sees HeadVI as a reaction against Velázquez, and a commentary on how the papacy is [...] "obsolete and decayed", with a pope resistant to both modernisation and secularisation. To him, the figure seems to [...] "resist the maltreatment of image and tries to halt the impending collapse of the established work order. He screams and grimaces, clutching at arms of his throne." [...] Sylvester notes that Bacon was impressed by Picasso's figuration and handling of paint, especially in Picasso's 1930s works; and suggests that the white blobs around the pope's cape {{may be influenced by}} the 1913 Woman in a Slip Seated in an Armchair.|$|E

The director agreed with his star that the film should have a message. [...] "It's a picture about emotions and feelings and relationships and people in chaos," [...] he said. [...] "We felt like charting all that and showing the differences and showing people making terrible mistakes ruining their lives and then realizing it and trying to push back when everything is crumbling – <b>without</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> soap opera.

2500|$|Dulles {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of massive {{retaliation}} and brinkmanship. In an article written for Life magazine, Dulles defined his policy of brinkmanship: [...] "The ability to get to the verge <b>without</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> the war is the necessary art." [...] Dulles' hard line alienated many leaders of nonaligned countries when on June 9, 1955, he argued in a speech that [...] "neutrality has increasingly become obsolete and, except under very exceptional circumstances, it is an immoral and shortsighted conception." [...] Throughout the 1950s Dulles was in frequent conflict with those non-aligned statesmen he deemed excessively sympathetic to Communism, including India's V.K. Krishna Menon.|$|E

In this article, the author analyzes the best instrument, namely self discipline, official discipline and market discipline, for the effective risk management. In the light of literature review and lessons of firm/system wide financial failures, we also analyze degree of efficieny of disciplinary methods. We first conclude, however it may not provide optimal solutions to the risk management problems of financial intermediaries, better risk management standards should be developed. We also conclude that firm wide risk management processes may be managed by pragmatic regulatory policies <b>without</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> negative impacts of market mechanism and big financial firms’ pressures. ...|$|R

2500|$|Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X, 1953 is a {{painting}} by the Irish born artist Francis Bacon and {{is an example of}} Post World War II European Expressionism. The work shows a distorted version of the Portrait of Innocent X painted by the Spanish artist Diego Velázquez in 1650. The work is {{one of a series of}} variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works. When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely [...] "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour <b>without</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> a sort of false fauve manner." [...] The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance. The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.|$|E
