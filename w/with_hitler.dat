5|$|German {{generals and}} tacticians (along <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> himself) had an equally low {{opinion of the}} Dutch {{military}} and expected that the core region of Holland proper could be conquered in about three to five days.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels had {{frequent}} discussions <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> {{about the}} fate of the Jews, a subject they discussed almost every time they met. He was aware throughout that the Jews were being exterminated, and completely supported this decision. He {{was one of the few}} top Nazi officials to do so publicly.|$|E

5|$|In early April 1945, Braun {{travelled}} from Munich to Berlin to be <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> at the Führerbunker. She {{refused to}} leave as the Red Army closed in on the capital. After midnight {{on the night of}} 28–29 April, Hitler and Braun were married in a small civil ceremony within the Führerbunker. The event was witnessed by Joseph Goebbels and Martin Bormann. Thereafter, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife. When Braun married Hitler, her legal name changed to Eva Hitler. When she signed her marriage certificate she wrote the letter B for her family name, then lined this out and replaced it <b>with</b> <b>Hitler.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and {{articles}} took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable. Berlin had {{little in the way of}} fortifications or artillery (or even Volkssturm units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost everything had been sent to the front. Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> since he did not want to lose the confidence of his Führer.|$|E
5|$|Misch was {{transferred}} to the FBK in early May 1940. As a junior member of Hitler's permanent bodyguard, Misch travelled <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> throughout the war. When not serving as bodyguards, Misch and the others in the unit served as telephone operators, couriers, orderlies, valets, and waiters. When on duty, the FBK members were the only armed men Hitler allowed to be near him. They never had to surrender their weapon and were never searched when they were <b>with</b> <b>Hitler.</b> It did cause Misch some concern that they were armed only with Walther PPK 7.65 pistols.|$|E

5|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet {{victory in the}} Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began {{to recognize that the}} war could no longer be won. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{control of}} the Atlantic meant German meteorologists had less {{information}} than the Allies on incoming weather patterns. As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris was predicting two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend war games in Rennes, and men in many units were given leave. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> to try to obtain more Panzers.|$|E
5|$|As {{second in}} command of the SS and then Reichsführer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> to arrange for SS men as bodyguards; Himmler was not {{involved}} with Nazi Party policy-making decisions in the years leading up to the seizure of power. From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler.|$|E

5|$|Churchill's and the British {{response}} was officially restrained. This {{was due to}} the strong-willed defence of the Belgian defensive campaign presented to the cabinet by Sir Roger Keyes at 11:30am 28 May. The French and Belgian ministers had referred to Leopold's actions as treacherous, but they were unaware of the true events: Leopold had not signed an agreement <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> in order to form a collaborative government, but an unconditional surrender as Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was very}} fond of Magda Goebbels and the children. He enjoyed staying at the Goebbels' Berlin apartment, where he could relax. Magda had a close {{relationship}} <b>with</b> <b>Hitler,</b> and {{became a member of}} his small coterie of female friends. She also became an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, the German {{war effort}} {{was on the}} verge of {{collapse}} and Himmler's relationship <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> had deteriorated. Himmler considered independently negotiating a peace settlement. His masseur, Felix Kersten, who had moved to Sweden, acted as an intermediary in negotiations with Count Folke Bernadotte, head of the Swedish Red Cross. Letters were exchanged between the two men, and direct meetings were arranged by Walter Schellenberg of the RSHA.|$|E

5|$|In return, Hitler {{wrote to}} Quisling thanking {{him for his}} efforts and guaranteeing him some sort of {{position}} in the new government. The transfer of power on these terms was duly enacted on 15 April, <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> still confident the Administrative Council would receive {{the backing of the}} king. Quisling's domestic and international reputation both hit new lows, casting him as both a traitor and a failure.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 1944, Model {{was placed}} in command of Army Group North Ukraine in Galicia, which was {{withdrawing}} under heavy pressure from Zhukov's 1st Ukrainian Front. He replaced Manstein, who {{had fallen out of}} favour <b>with</b> <b>Hitler.</b> Despite Manstein's previous victories, the Führer wanted someone whom he anticipated would be unyielding in defence.|$|E
5|$|On February 8, 1942, Minister of Armaments Fritz Todt {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} shortly after taking off from Hitler's eastern {{headquarters}} at Rastenburg. Speer, who had arrived in Rastenburg the previous evening, had accepted Todt's offer to fly with him to Berlin, but had canceled some hours before takeoff (Speer stated in his memoirs that the cancellation was because of exhaustion from travel and a late-night meeting <b>with</b> <b>Hitler).</b> Later that day, Hitler appointed Speer as Todt's successor to all of his posts. In Inside the Third Reich, Speer recounts his meeting <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> and his reluctance to take ministerial office, saying that he only did so because Hitler commanded it. Speer also states that Hermann Göring raced to Hitler's headquarters on hearing of Todt's death, hoping to claim Todt's powers. Hitler instead presented Göring with the fait accompli of Speer's appointment.|$|E

5|$|Schaub {{took care}} of Hitler's {{personal}} belongings, papers and travel journeys, making him a notable figure in Hitler's inner circle. In 1924, he was imprisoned <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> for {{his involvement in the}} coup d'état attempt of November 1923 in Munich. In time he closely befriended Hitler. Later in July 1944, Schaub was present during the military briefing during which a bomb exploded, killing four people and injuring others; Hitler escaped with minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler—accompanied by Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, {{his former}} naval {{adjutant}} Commander Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, and his Luftwaffe adjutant Oberst Nicolaus von Below, among others—visited Bismarck on 5 May 1941. Missing was Grand Admiral Erich Raeder. Hitler was {{taken on a}} tour of the ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations. Hitler and Lütjens also met in private and discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic. After this meeting, Hitler and the officers of Bismarck had lunch in the officers' mess, where Hitler spoke about America's unwillingness to enter the war. Lindemann openly disagreed <b>with</b> <b>Hitler,</b> expressing his opinion that the possibility of the United States entering the war could not be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|After the war started, the FBB {{provided}} wider security {{protection for}} Hitler when {{in residence at}} the Berghof, as he travelled by vehicle to front-line command posts and at military headquarters. They would be in heavily armed vehicles at {{the front and back}} of Hitler's convoy. In addition, army motorcycle outriders were positioned at the front and rear of the convoy of vehicles. The FBK would ride <b>with</b> <b>Hitler</b> and the RSD men would ride in a separate car during the trips.|$|E
