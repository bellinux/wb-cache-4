Although significant research was done, until 1978 it <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> determine the abundances of some iron-group elements (e.g. cobalt and manganese) via spectrography because of their hyperfine structures.|$|E

5|$|According to Williams, {{the game}} <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> market, {{as the team}} wanted to prevent spoiling the {{narrative}} yet encourage people to buy the game.

5|$|As a {{classical}} singer, Turunen sings with classical vocal technique. She explained {{that in the}} early days of Nightwish, it <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> combine classical technique with the metal sound in a way that gave her liberty of action without damaging her vocal cords. Classical techniques helped her to play with her voice, so she decided not to pursue extra training in rock/pop singing.|$|E
5|$|As {{the series}} progressed, some critics began to express {{frustration}} with the comic. Joey Smith, also with Inside Pulse, found the large cast <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> track by the fourth issue. In a review of issue 33, Fulton found the series entertaining, but sometimes thought the plot felt directionless. Not all agreed, however; Paste Magazine included the comic book in its list of favorite horror comics in late 2016.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because it <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> access when things went wrong and, {{in tandem with the}} fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E

5|$|Before, Beyoncé's {{approach}} to heartbreak was always literal, {{her voice and}} her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness that at times <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> believe, let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.|$|E
5|$|Bristol lies {{on one of}} the UK's lesser coalfields, {{and from}} the 17th century collieries opened in Bristol, and what is now North Somerset and South Gloucestershire.

5|$|Greece's mountainous terrain {{favored a}} {{defensive}} strategy {{and the high}} ranges of the Rhodope, Epirus, Pindus and Olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities. However, air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many defiles. Although an invading force from Albania could be stopped by {{a relatively small number}} of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern part of the country <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> defend against an attack from the north.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> confirm {{because its}} star {{experiences}} high jitter, which disrupted {{the ability to}} obtain accurate measurements. As such, {{a greater number of}} radial velocity observations were collected to make the confirmation, although it was later determined that HAT-P-33b could not be determined using the radial velocity method. The planet's confirmation came about after the planet's light curve was collected, and the Blendanal process ruled out most false positive scenarios.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an unexplained {{decline in the}} alpine pika {{population}} occurred throughout the western Sayan Mountains. Although in 1977 Khlebnikov suggested {{it was due to}} an epidemic, it <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> ascertain if such a large territory had been affected all at once. By 1986 or 1987, a few localities that had high alpine pika population densities 16 to 17 years earlier became devoid of the species, due to its low reproductive rate and the insular nature of its habitat.|$|E

5|$|One of Chamberlin's {{challenges}} {{was working}} with the Australians.
