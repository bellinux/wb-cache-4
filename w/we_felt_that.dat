5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|We {{knew that}} we had created a new means of warfare, and the {{question}} as to what nation, to what victorious nation we were willing to entrust this brainchild of ours was a moral decision more than anything else. We wanted to see the world spared another conflict such as Germany had just been through, and <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> only by surrendering such a weapon to people who are guided by the Bible could such an assurance to the world be best secured.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
60|$|But that didn't {{discourage}} us. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{should get}} it clean in time.|$|R
60|$|Britten and I {{found it}} {{difficult}} to express to each other with any grace or precision what <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> about <b>that</b> magazine.|$|R

500|$|Daniel Hales, {{brother of}} the organisation's {{worldwide}} leader Bruce Hales, described the book {{as part of a}} trend of what he said were lies told about his group by critics and disaffected former members. He said such criticism showed it is [...] "open season to kill us". [...] "We're happy to live our lives in anonymity, just quietly in our neighbourhoods in our low-key way. We're quite happy to have our beliefs questioned, ethically debated, and points of religion looked at. That's not a problem. We don't mind being criticised. We don't even mind being despised because of it. But once it starts to be charged that we're acting criminally, we're acting illegally, we're acting immorally, we're acting against society, then <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> we really had to put our point of view. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it wasn't fair to our members," [...] said Daniel Hales to The West Australian.|$|E
500|$|Jim Seavey, {{associate}} director of athletics stated: [...] "Twelve years ago, the college discarded the logo that depicted the Indian with the headdress and feathers and stuff. We really did {{not have anything to}} represent our identity that we were comfortable with. <b>We</b> <b>felt...</b> <b>that</b> it wasn't appropriate to have a physical representation of a Native American as our mascot".|$|E
500|$|FX {{canceled}} Starved in October 2005. FX president John Landgraf told Variety, [...] "The {{show had}} a lot of fans, so it was tough to choose [...] Ultimately, <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> we're just {{not in a position to}} spread our resources. We launched our dramas one at a time, and launching two [...] like we did this summer just didn't work out as well." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the rest}} of us rather looked with favour on the Story Girl's idea. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> she would do penance as picturesquely and {{thoroughly}} as she did everything else.|$|R

5000|$|... "It {{was natural}} that Charles Hall, Tony Barber and I should plot escape together. We had known {{one another at}} Benson, before being shot down and <b>we</b> still <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all belonged to the same unit." ...|$|R
500|$|We can't {{cut to a}} city or a {{group of}} extras that we've never been to that we don’t know personally. That was our rule. And that’s a pretty {{significant}} rule to adhere to in a movie in which you're trying to give a sense of something that’s happening on a large scale, but <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> all of the elements that we had issues with prior, when we see any kind of disaster film, we're centered around that idea.|$|E
500|$|More than {{historical}} accuracy was at stake. In a 1901 address {{delivered at}} the Republic County site, Katherine S. Lewis of the Kansas Daughters of the American Revolution had declared that [...] "we have been seeking out antiquity for Kansas; <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> our state was too new to be interesting". In 1927, Kansans still regarded their Pike site as a focus of state pride, and were unwilling to give it up: in the Nebraska History issue, George Morehouse of the KHS wrote, [...] "It is now very strange that ... our Nebraska friends should become so enthusiastic in trying to take from our Pike's Pawnee Republic Village its halo of glory." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1863 Lee's army {{advanced}} {{north into}} Maryland, taking the war into Union territory {{for the second}} time. Steuart {{is said to have}} jumped down from his horse, kissed his native soil and stood on his head in jubilation. According to one of his aides: [...] "We loved Maryland, <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she was in bondage against her will, and we burned with desire to have a part in liberating her". Quartermaster John Howard recalled that Steuart performed [...] "seventeen double somersaults" [...] all the while whistling Maryland, My Maryland. Such celebrations would prove short lived, as Steuart's brigade was soon to be severely damaged at the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1–3, 1863). At first however, Lee's advance north went well. At the Second Battle of Winchester (June 13–15, 1863) Steuart fought with Johnson's division, helping to bring about a Confederate victory, during which his brigade took around 1,000 prisoners and suffered comparatively small losses of 9 killed, 34 wounded.|$|E
60|$|It really {{seemed the}} {{beginning}} of a new life, not to have that dreadful fear hanging over us any longer! <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> settled, <b>that</b> was one thing; not as if we should do as Bertram expected, have to come off to New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|The boys said [...] "the initial {{idea was}} to maybe put (Kylie) on the whole of 'Crave You' - to do it again. But <b>we</b> {{actually}} <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> keeping the original version on is part of keeping our original story mixed with the new." ...|$|R
60|$|During {{all this}} time my shipmates were quiet and grave, but active and full of energy, so that every order was at once obeyed without noise or confusion. Every man watched the {{slightest}} motion of the captain. <b>We</b> all <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> everything depended on him.|$|R
500|$|... "Breaking Point" [...] premiered on August 18, 2010, on {{the urban}} radio station V-103 in Atlanta. It was {{selected}} as the album's lead single to showcase Hilson sans featured acts. In an interview, Hilson elaborated on the decision: [...] "Timbaland and Polow [...] knew that even though I've been known for club records, guest features and collaborations, I am a true R lover ... for many reasons ... We knew it wouldn't grow as fast or even be as big a record as some of my past ... We wanted to showcase me by myself, feature-less, and we wanted to reveal that I can sing, and really connect with my music and my message. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> was the best introduction to No Boys Allowed." [...] Mosley Music Group and Interscope Records released the single via digital distribution in the United States on September 7, 2010. It was later sent to urban adult contemporary radio on October 25, 2010, while the album's second single, [...] "Pretty Girl Rock", was classified for contemporary hit radio the same week.|$|E
500|$|The {{monument}} {{was completed}} swiftly once the location was agreed; {{the total cost}} was £2,700 (1927), of which 10% was Lutyens' fee. The design and the proposed location {{continued to be a}} source of controversy in the local community. Some residents felt that the memorial would not be in keeping with the city's existing architecture, but Bignold felt sure that he had the backing of the ex-service community. He noted that the Guildhall was in a central location and as one of Norwich's most famous buildings was a significant attraction for visitors, and thus that siting the memorial there would display Norwich's pride in its contribution to the war. In response to criticisms of the design, he wrote that [...] "the form of any war memorial depends entirely on the sum of money available for its construction. Knowing this sum, we consulted Sir Edwin Lutyens as to the best means of expending it. [...] <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> all reasonable persons would be satisfied by the expert opinion of the man who gave London its Cenotaph".|$|E
500|$|Attanasio, Levinson and Fontana {{strove to}} make Homicide more {{realistic}} than other police dramas, even in minor details. For example, Levinson specifically asked that {{a dead body}} found by detectives in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other shows did not portray corpses in a realistic way. Some episodes, like [...] "Ghost of a Chance", focus on murders {{that take place in}} wealthy rural settings, rather than an urban or predominantly poorer location as most police dramas did. Homicide was noted for demonstrating better than most American television police shows that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances. In striving for realism, some cases in Homicide remain unsolved and murderers go free, most notably in the Adena Watson case. This theme often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives, who wanted happier endings with more closure. Fontana said of the Watson investigation, [...] "We never solved it because <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it would be a disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I know we {{used her}} very ill,' said Miss Gardner; 'but people have unaccountable fancies about {{publishing}} those matters. Mr. Finch was in haste, and <b>we</b> all <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{it was best}} to have it over, so it was talked of a very short time previously.' ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the release}} of Chuckles and Mr. Squeezy, Dino Campanella has stated in an {{interview}} in 2014 that Dredg is taking an indefinite hiatus: [...] "We didn’t want to be on a constant schedule of Dredg. We wanted {{to go out there and}} do things on our own, explore other things for a second. It was necessary to maintain our health individually and as a band. In a situation like this a lot of bands jump to conclusions and decide to break up, but we never had any intentions of breaking up. We love each other, love playing music together and we will as long as we want to, but at some point <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> wanted to be in control of our own schedule. It was a very natural thing. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that’s</b> what needed to happen." ...|$|R
60|$|We were {{a silent}} party. Papa and Mr. Petersfield made an {{occasional}} remark, and Polly tried {{once or twice}} to enliven us, {{but it would not}} do. <b>We</b> all <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were engaged upon a serious business, and that the future of our lives depended upon its result.|$|R
500|$|After Jacobs {{decided that}} Evans {{would no longer}} play Pam, he began searching for another actress to play the character. The role was {{eventually}} won by then 28-year-old actress, Victoria Principal. Principal won the role over another finalist, Judith Chapman, who was known famously for her work in daytime television. Shortly after Principal's role on Fantasy Island, a friend pointed her {{in the direction of}} Dallas and [...] "a part in it that was written for you". [...] Eventually, Principal received a copy of the script [...] "and read it and thought [...] was absolutely right". Acting as her own agent, she set up a meeting with the producers of Dallas. Lee Rich, an executive producer in 1979, recounted: [...] "We had all heard rumors about Victoria. This is a small town. Victoria's background, her so-called past, was a plus. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she had experienced life and could understand the part." [...] Jacobs later said, [...] "Victoria, of all the actors, went for the role the most aggressively. And that sort of determination just became part of the character." [...] Prior to being cast in Dallas, Principal had starred in a few small roles in movies and television specials. These works include Earthquake in 1974, and Fantasy Island in 1977.|$|E
500|$|The season's {{exploring}} of supernatural {{and mystical}} concepts ties-in {{with the release}} of Doctor Strange, the first MCU film to explore magic. In addition to the Darkhold, this includes the introduction of Ghost Rider, with Whedon explaining in July 2016, that [...] "the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters [...] <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> [...] was obviously a great character that we’d love to have on our show that we feel fits with that shift." [...] Whedon pointed out that the previous tie-ins were sometimes [...] "very direct", and other times [...] "more thematic. The tie this year will feel more of a reflection of , less an interweaving plot." [...] He added, [...] "Hopefully some of the questions that we’re asking will be answered by [...] then pose some new themes and ideas for us to explore." [...] "Deals with Our Devils", aired after the release of Doctor Strange, sees Aida create a portal to rescue Coulson and Fitz from another dimension. The visuals for these are intentionally reminiscent of those used in the film. Bell added that the Darkhold [...] "feels like it belongs in the library in Kathmandu", referring to the Kamar-Taj library seen in Doctor Strange.|$|E
500|$|Wright {{wanted to}} write and direct a cop film because [...] "there isn't really any {{tradition}} of cop films in the UK... <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> every {{other country in the}} world had its own tradition of great cop action films and we had none." [...] Wright and Pegg spent eighteen months writing the script. The first draft took eight months to develop, and after watching 138 cop-related films for dialogue and plot ideas and conducting over fifty interviews with police officers for research, the script was completed after another nine months. The title was based on the various two-word titles of action films in the 1980s and 1990s. In one interview Wright declared that he [...] "wanted to make a title that really had very little meaning...like Lethal Weapon and Point Break and Executive Decision." [...] In the same interview, Pegg joked that many action films' titles [...] "seem to be generated from two hats filled with adjectives and nouns and you just, 'Okay, that'll do.'" [...] While writing the script, the film's director and writer, Edgar Wright, as well as Pegg, intended to include Frost as the partner for Pegg's character. Frost revealed that he would do the film only if he could name his character, and he chose [...] "Danny Butterman".|$|E
60|$|Felix and I shivered. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> {{suddenly}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{had escaped}} a dreadful danger--the danger {{of having been}} born somebody else. But it took the Story Girl to make us realize just how dreadful it was and what a terrible risk we had run years before we, or our parents either, had existed.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{was really}} {{disappointed}} at get ting out", he said. [...] "I {{felt as if}} I'd let the team down with just four overs to go and I'd {{wanted to see it}} through.

2500|$|He {{apparently}} had difficulty understanding why other drivers {{were not as}} quick as himself. When Clark died, fellow driver Chris Amon was quoted as saying, [...] "If {{it could happen to}} him, what chance do the rest of us have? I think <b>we</b> all <b>felt</b> <b>that.</b> It seemed like we'd lost our leader." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of the Adena Watson murder case, a story arc which began {{at the start of the}} first season. The Watson case was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book that served as the basis of the Homicide series. Elements of the interview in [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] were incorporated from real-life police interrogations in that case. The Wallace case was never solved, and Fontana insisted that the Watson case in Homicide remain unsolved as well, despite pressure from NBC for a more satisfying conclusion. Fontana said, [...] "We never solved it because <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it would be a disservice to the real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." [...] The scene when Tucker admits for a moment he is not sure in his own mind that he didn't commit the murder was inspired by a similar real-life interaction Fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research. Fontana said, [...] "It was so chilling (and) I was like, 'Oh man, how do you get there?'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{final two}} {{performances}} {{were held in}} Tempe, Arizona on 19 and 20 December 1987 and were filmed for the 1988 film Rattle and Hum. U2 sang the refrain [...] "el pueblo vencerá", which means [...] "the people will overcome" [...] in Spanish, {{at the conclusion of}} the song. Bono noted that the Madres use the phrase for motivation. The Edge said [...] "we're so close to a Spanish speaking part of the world, <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> maybe people at the concert might pick up on this lyric." [...] Bono added that they had closed every concert since 1983 with the song [...] "40", and so they were looking to replace it with [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] from that point on. He explained, [...] "If the people of Arizona sing this, and if it goes into the film and onto the record, wherever we go in a way for the next few years, that will be taken up again. It'll be an interesting experiment ...". The footage was considered for the closing sequence of the film, but the band eventually decided against including it. [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)" [...] was used as the final live song, and [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] was chosen to play over the credits.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music was loud and heavy, and <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear {{more than two or three}} words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him".|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on the 1968 racing {{death of}} Jim Clark, Amon said: [...] "If {{this can happen}} to Jimmy, what chance {{do the rest of}} us have? I think <b>we</b> all <b>felt</b> <b>that.</b> It seemed like we'd lost our leader." [...] In 1995, Amon was {{inducted}} into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame.|$|R
