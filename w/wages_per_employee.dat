Finally, we are interested in the establishment’s profits measured by a categorical variable. The IAB Establishment Panel reports whether the profit situation is very good, good, satisfactory, sufficient or poor. As an alternative, we use the operating surplus (=sales-preliminary work-wages) as a proxy for profits.|$|E

30|$|Unfortunately, in the {{enterprise}} level data {{used in this}} study there is no better proxy for human capital intensity than the average <b>wage</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> in a firm. For example, the data has no information on the share of employees with a university degree or the share of employees that successfully passed the exams following apprenticeship. 3 To justify the use of the average wage in a firm as a proxy variable for human capital intensity in the absence of more direct measures it is argued that although qualification of the work force is not the only determinant of the average wage in a firm it can be expected to be highly positively correlated with it. Furthermore, it is pointed out that in the empirical models that link <b>wage</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> to exporting both firm size and industry affiliation are included and, therefore, both firm-size wage differentials and inter-industry wage differentials are controlled for.|$|R
30|$|These {{results are}} not valid for all subgroups of firms. Shorter {{compensation}} periods for time credits and debits under WTA arrangements should be preferred under the productivity perspective. The seeming contradiction that WTA increase productivity and do not enhance <b>wages</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> but induce lower profits can be resolved. WTA and other costs usually hinder higher profits in the short run, except if sales are highly volatile. In this situation, it is most beneficial for establishments to introduce WTA.|$|E
30|$|The {{intention}} of our {{paper is to}} demonstrate that WTA influence the business processes through different channels. To date, {{this has been an}} under-researched area. Our empirical investigations show that the major question asks whether firms benefit from WTA and whether WTA help to increase firm performance cannot simply be answered by yes or no. When unobserved firm effects, WTA endogeneity, and firm characteristics are considered, we find that WTA firms have significantly higher productivity and investments than other firms. On average, the <b>wages</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> are the same. The operating surplus does not distinguish between WTA and non-WTA firms, but profits are lower in the former firms.|$|E

We use (exogenous) regional variation in the enforcement of the labor law to identify the effects of more flexibility of firm outcomes. The preliminary findings suggest that firms with an easier access to informal labor tend to have a more educated workforce, higher capital-labor ratio and a more ad-vanced technology. This translates into a higher output and value added per employee. Additionally these firms tend to pay higher average <b>wages</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee.</b> We find this is either caused by a higher firm productivity and by the labor tax savings being shared with informal workers. Moreover, we do not find evidence that informality increases firm’s employment or employment turnover...|$|E

Recent studies using linked employer-employee panel data show that wage differences between exporters and non-exporters become smaller but do not completely vanish once observable and unobservable characteristics of the employees and of the workplace are controlled for. Therefore, any empirical model that uses the average wage in a firm as a proxy variable for human capital intensity of production to investigate the link between firm characteristics and the propensity to export suffers from an endogeneity problem—the higher the <b>wage</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> the higher is the probability that the firm is an exporter not only because more human capital intensive firms have a higher probability to export but also because a firm that exports has a higher <b>wage</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> irrespective of the (observed and unobserved) qualification of the work force!

30|$|Besides graphs and t-tests {{that reveal}} the {{development}} of the share of WTA and demonstrate in which characteristics WTA and non-WTA firms differ, we apply econometric methods. The least angle regression approach serves as the basis of variable selection. OLS estimates as benchmarks are supplemented by two-stage least squares for panel data. Our major results are as follows: productivity and investments are enhanced by WTA. No influence can be discovered on <b>wages</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> and operating surplus. The latter result is not maintained in establishments under strong sales variation. In this case, significantly positive effects on operating surplus are observed. In general, profits are negatively influenced by WTA. This outcome is less likely for firms with a high share of qualified workers. In times of low demand during the Great Recession, WTA help to reduce profit losses.|$|E
30|$|Productivity is not {{the only}} {{indicator}} to evaluate whether WTA are beneficial for establishments. Following Addison et al. (2001), typical further performance indicators are labor fluctuations, departures, hires, wages, innovation and profitability. We focus on <b>wages</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> investments and profitability. We test whether WTA also influence investments because innovations are expressed by investments and the latter affect productivity. Influence on firms’ costs is also relevant, especially for employee wages. Our last step is to test a relationship between profits and WTA. If there is a significantly positive correlation between these two indicators, we have strong evidence that WTA are beneficial for firms. As a supplement, interaction models are estimated. This means the WTA dummy is multiplied by specific firm’s characteristics and incorporated in the profit function. So we can prove whether WTA effects differ in establishments with typical characteristics from others.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical examination of political cycles in Israel {{by examining the}} instruments of fiscal and monetary policy {{at the time of}} election campaigns. In common with the findings of similar empirical studies undertaken elsewhere, the economic data for Israel support the theory of politico-economic cyclicality. The results of the study indicate that in the 1980 s and 1990 s (a period that includes six general elections) about two years before an election the government adopted an expansionary policy which intensified as the election drew nearer: public civilian consumption rose significantly in the two years before an election, and especially {{in the last six months}} before an election. Similar findings are evident from an examination of the real <b>wage</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> post in the public sector: this variable also rose significantly in the two years preceding an election, and in the 1980 s it soared in the last six months before an election. In addition, the rate of expansion of public consumption and the real <b>wage</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> post was negative in the six months after an election, although not markedly so. Contrary to economic theory and empirical findings worldwide which endorse it, in Israel we did not find a significant rise in transfer payments to the public (paid by the National Insurance Institute) before an election. With regard to monetary policy (as expressed in overdraft interest), there was an increase in the average nominal interest rate prior to an election, and a decline subsequently. In contrast with nominal interest, an examination of the ex post real interest rate does not indicate any specific trend at election time. 1...|$|R

30|$|We {{contribute}} to the WTA literature by providing a more detailed analysis of working time accounts with respect to firm effects. First, we discuss the impact of WTA on productivity not only during the Great Recession but also {{over a period of}} six years, including the recession period. This enables permanent effects to be detected. Second, we supplement the investigation of WTA effects on further important business indicators, especially with respect to the <b>wages</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> investments and profits. This provides us with insights about the question of whether WTA have positive effects on firm performance. Third, we investigate whether interaction effects of WTA with other influencing factors can be uncovered. Among others, we can indirectly show whether our results are in accordance with the two mentioned hypotheses. Fourth, a subgroup analysis is carried out. We show that the effects differ between establishments with a high share and a low share of skilled workers, between companies with strong and only weak sales fluctuations. Moreover, we present the effects of WTA under different agreements on the compensation period of time credits and debits within WTA regimes. This reveals whether the WTA effects are heterogeneous with respect to specific WTA contracts.|$|E
30|$|Wages [in Euros (logged)] – This {{variable}} {{is computed by}} dividing total payroll size {{by the total number}} of employees at the given due date (June 30 th 2010). The {{variable is}} logged to let the estimate of a potential effect on training depend on the level of wages. Note that average annually working hours <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> are unknown. Hence, payroll size must be related to the number of employees, giving the annual gross <b>wage</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee.</b> In this approach, part-time work is neglected. Consequently, at a given hourly wage level the estimate of annual gross wages will be lower the higher the share of part-time workers in a firm. Thus, wage levels (besides other covariates, such as the industry controls) will at least partially capture the extent of part-time work in a firm, which may lead to lower estimates of the relationship between wages and training.|$|R

40|$|Income {{inequality}} {{has attracted}} {{much interest in}} recent years and {{has become one of the}} key challenges of our generation. In countries where income earned through wages forms the bulk of an individual s wealth, disparity of wages can be a significant factor of income inequality. There has also been a growing trend in the world towards larger firms that have the ability to pay workers higher wages than smaller firms. For the purpose of this research paper, the researcher focuses on the wage segment of income inequality, and more specifically how the size of firms, over time, influences income inequality. Using secondary data, in the form of listed companies annual financial statements and various other data sources, the researcher conducted a study focusing on five developing (Indonesia, Philippines, India, Poland and South Africa) and five developed countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Australia and the United States of America), totalling 644 sample firms, with the aim of assessing the following hypotheses: the first stated that the mean growth rate of average <b>wages</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> for larger firms would be higher than smaller firms; the second stated that the mean growth rate of average wages per executive would be higher for larger firms than for smaller firms; lastly, within firms, the mean growth rate of average wages per executive would be greater than the growth rate of average wages per of the rest of the firms. The findings suggest that, when considering all employees, larger firms do not pay higher increases in wage than small firms. However, executives in larger firms in the Philippines, India and South Africa have higher increases in their wages than executives in smaller firm. This may be a contributing factor to income inequality within those countries. Lastly, this paper looks at wage disparity within firms and the findings suggest a high prevalence of increasing wage inequality, within firms.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present paper is to study the impact of R&D investment on inter-regional labour migration and inter-sectoral labour reallocation in the EU, specifically at regional level. In order to capture important general equilibrium effects, we employ a structural NEG model called RHOMOLO. The RHOMOLO model is a dynamic spatial general equilibrium (DSGE) modelling framework capturing 270 NUTS 2 regions in EU- 27, and decomposing the economy into 6 sectors. The current base year of RHOMOLO, and to which structural parameters' estimates are used to calibrate the model, is 2007. As a first step of our analysis we econometrically estimate both (i) within country and (ii) across countries migration flows {{as a function of}} relative population, relative real <b>wages</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> relative unemployment rate and regional connectivity (as proxied by bilateral trade between origin and destination regions normalised by the total of their GDP). Our econometric findings suggest that within-country migration is subject to much the same economic forces as between-country migration, with estimates of the coefficients of relative wages and relative unemployment within in the same range. Secondly, we econometrically estimate the R&D and human capital elasticities, which are key parameters in the semi-endogenous growth module of RHOMOLO {{to assess the impact of}} R&D investment on TFP growth. In our next step we produce regional scenarios for R&D investments according to the {{objective of}} the Europe 2020 strategy and use them to simulate a shock in R&D investments at the regional levels needed to meet the Europe 2020 strategy. Finally, we combine the previous work together in order to simulate the impact on employment levels of regional R&D investments through the geographically heterogeneous effect that they have on migration flows and on labour supply in each EU region. The geographical distribution of R&D expenditures is shown to affect migration flows as well as employment levels at the regional level by increasing skills in those regions affected by R&D expenditures. Spillover effects on neighbouring regions are also observed...|$|E

However, the increases were predominantly amongst small-sized firms which more than tripled, and medium-sized firms that doubled. Large firms remained about the same in number but firms employing 500 persons and more actually contracted from 52 to 40. With regards to wage levels in the manufacturing sector, the findings from the two censuses indicate that wages in large firms, thus those employing more than 100, more than doubled for all categories of workers between 1987 and 2003.

Moreover, we study how firms reacted differently along the cycle, depending on their historical level of wage rigidity. In particular, we seek to answer whether firms which were structurally less able to adjust wages of job stayers reacted by adjusting employment more and whether these firms, by hiring new workers at a re-negotiated salary which corresponds more to the new cyclical conditions, managed to partially compress their average <b>wage</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> even {{in the presence of}} high levels of wage rigidity for stayers.|$|R
