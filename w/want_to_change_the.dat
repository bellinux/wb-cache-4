Those who reject ethnic federalism propose that administrative regions should be carved out on consideration of more factors than language alone.

25|$|The firm helped {{multinational}} companies obtain 548 legal tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The rulings provide written {{assurance that}} companies’ tax-saving {{plans will be}} seen favorably by the Luxembourg authorities. The companies saved {{billions of dollars in}} taxes with these arrangements. Some firms paid less than one percent tax on the profits they shifted to Luxembourg. Employees or former employees of PwC provided documentation of the rulings to journalists. PwC UK’s head of tax was before the UK's public accounts committee and was questioned about lying regarding the marketing of these tax avoidance schemes. He told the committee the financing, investments and tax structure is legal and well-known to the British government. “If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> Lux tax regime, the politicians could change the Lux tax regime.” The disclosures attracted international attention and comment about tax avoidance schemes in Luxembourg and other tax havens. The revelations later led to a series of EU-wide measures aimed at regulating tax avoidance schemes and tax probes into several EU companies. PwC initiated charges against the two whistleblowers that revealed the LuxLeaks tax controversy. In March 2017 a Luxembourg appeals court upheld their convictions, but with reduced sentences.|$|E

Yuji Naka and Hirokazu Yasuhara were the primary creators of the Sonic 3 design document and project schedule. Sonic 3 began as a top-down, isometric game, similar to what would become Sonic 3D Blast (1996), but the concept was abandoned early as the team did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> Sonic formula too radically for a sequel. According to Sonic producer and programmer Yuji Naka, the team felt that they needed a deeper story to expand the world of Sonic, which [...] "made the project huge."

[...] A common argument was that Black Ice succeeded because AC/DC did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> style that succeeded in previous albums, with Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald declaring that given [...] "almost all of [...] could have appeared on any AC/DC album of the past 28 years", and Chris Jones of BBC saying that the band's [...] "almost platonic form of rock 'n' boogie that was hand built to last" [...] remains because they [...] "have no reason to tinker with a formula that was well-nigh perfect to begin with." [...] Writers such as Spins David Marchese and The Observers Peter Kimpton complimented the band's attempts at [...] "some new sonic tricks", such as the slide guitar of [...] "Stormy May Day" [...] and the quieter [...] "Decibel".|$|E
