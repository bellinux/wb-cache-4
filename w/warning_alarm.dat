5|$|Between 1962 and 1992 {{there was}} a {{hardened}} nuclear bunker, built for No 16 Group Royal Observer Corps Shrewsbury, who provided the field force of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation and would have sounded the four-minute <b>warning</b> <b>alarm</b> {{in the event of}} war and warned the population of Shrewsbury in the event of approaching radioactive fallout. The building was manned by up to 120 volunteers who trained on a weekly basis and wore a Royal Air Force style uniform. After the breakup of the communist bloc in 1989, the Royal Observer Corps was disbanded between September 1991 and December 1995. However, the nuclear bunker still stands just inside Holywell Street near the Abbey as a lasting reminder of the Cold War, but is now converted and used as a veterinary practice.|$|E

50|$|EICAS {{improves}} {{situational awareness}} {{by allowing the}} aircrew to view complex information in a graphical format and also by alerting the crew to unusual or hazardous situations. For example, if an engine begins to lose oil pressure, the EICAS might sound an alert, switch the display to the page with the oil system information and outline the low oil pressure data with a red box. Unlike traditional round gauges, many levels of <b>warnings</b> and <b>alarms</b> can be set. Proper {{care must be taken}} when designing EICAS to ensure that the aircrew are always provided with the most important information and not overloaded with <b>warnings</b> or <b>alarms.</b>|$|R
40|$|Selecting {{measures}} is {{a necessary}} component of human factors research. Proper selection {{must take into account}} the representation problem (how is the assign-ment of numbers to objects or phenomena justified?) and the uniqueness problem (to what degree is this assignment unique?). Other key human factors measure-ment issues include subject representativeness, variable representativeness, and setting representativeness. It is difficult to create a single measure that captures essential characteristics of complex systems. Several examples illustrate how the-ory can guide measurement selection in such diverse human factors research as vigilance, turning off <b>warning</b> <b>alarms,</b> information requirements for military com-mand centers, subjective workload, heart-rate signal analysis, and heat stress in nuclear power plants...|$|R

30|$|Traffic safety {{applications}} on vehicular ad hoc {{networks have}} attracted significant attention {{in recent years}} as they improve driving quality, drivers' comfort, and drivers' safety. To enable the massive usage of traffic safety application, it is necessary to prevent false traffic <b>warning</b> <b>alarms</b> spread on VANETs which will strongly affect drivers' behaviors and put drivers and passengers in danger. To eliminate the concern on traffic message plausibility, we propose the event-based reputation system (ERS) which utilizes cooperative event observation mechanism and reputation adaptation scheme along with event confidence threshold and event reputation threshold to evaluate the event intensity and event reliability at the same time. Experimental simulations show that the proposed system can prevent false traffic warning messages spread to the network and the system with its configuration flexibility is applicable to most VANET environments.|$|R

40|$|AbstractCorporate {{governance}} matters {{because how}} well corporations utilize the people's savings matters. Many developed economies mandate that corporations be run for their public shareholders. This {{is not because}} shareholders are superior to employees, bankers, bondholders, customers, suppliers, or anyone else. Rather, it is because poor governance usually harms public shareholders before it harms others. Well engineered disclosure rules make corporations transparent, so poor governance quickly depresses share prices, alarming shareholders who demand corrective measures. Ideally, all this happens before the problem grows large enough to harm employees, customers, or other stakeholders. Governing corporations for shareholders really amounts to ‘using’ shareholders as early <b>warning</b> <b>alarms</b> and automatic correction mechanisms. But sound government policies are necessary, for this works if corporations are rendered transparent and public shareholders are empowered to force changes. Other stakeholders cannot fulfill this role as well because shareholders’ wealth is most directly tied to the firm's economic efficiency...|$|R

50|$|With {{the double}} tracking, barrier arms were {{installed}} for vehicular traffic on Collins avenue and pedestrian cribs provided. However, because northbound trains stopping at Linden lead to prolonged {{operation of the}} flashing lights, bells, and barrier arms, and a second train approaching can also keep the <b>warning</b> <b>alarms</b> operating for long periods, many pedestrians became habitual risk takers. The cribs were also poorly designed forcing some pedestrians to walk with {{their backs to the}} trains before stepping onto the railway line. A series of pedestrian deaths at Collins Avenue followed. This led to the installation of second train coming indicators and, in the late 1980s, to longer pedestrian cribs that ensured pedestrians always faced oncoming trains and took sufficient steps to look up and see approaching trains before stepping onto the railway line. There have been no pedestrian deaths since the installation of the longer cribs.|$|R

50|$|The Russian {{space program}} has never given a high {{priority}} to the noise levels experienced by its cosmonauts (e.g. on Mir the noise levels reached 70-72 dB). Such noise levels may cause a temporary reduction in hearing but not a full hearing loss. This could result in hazard <b>warning</b> <b>alarms</b> not being heard against the background noise. To reduce the noise risks NASA engineers are building hardware with inbuilt noise reduction. A depressurized pump producing 100 dB can have the noise levels reduced to 60 dB by fitting four isolation mounts. For future space programs {{it is essential that}} the noise levels are reduced. The use of hearing protectors are not encouraged because they block out alarm signals. More research is necessary in this field as well as in other astronautical hygiene areas e.g. measures to reduce the risks of exposure to radiation, methods to create artificial gravity, more sensitive sensors to monitor hazardous substances, improved life support systems and more toxicological data on the Martian and lunar dust hazards.|$|R
