50|$|The {{most common}} species raised by Chinese turtle farmers is the Chinese {{softshell}} turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis), accounting for over 97% of all reported sales, {{both in terms}} of head count (124.8 million in the 684-farm sample) and weight. Large-scale production of this species appears to have been successful in satisfying China gourmets' demand for its meat, which has been reflected in the price drop: while in the mid-1990s, wild-caught softshelled turtles retailed for CNY 500 per Chinese pound or jin (500 g), and farm-raised ones at over CNY 200 / Chinese pound,by 1999 the price for farm-raised softshelled turtles dropped to CNY 60 per Chinese pound, and by 2009, to merely CNY 15-16 per Chinese pound.

40|$|ABSTRACT THE ENDANGERED <b>WATTLE-NECKED</b> <b>SOFTSHELL</b> <b>TURTLE</b> (Palea steindachneri) THROUGHOUT THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS by Christopher C. Radford Master of Science in Environment Science: Professional Science Master Option California State University, Chico Summer 2011 The <b>wattle-necked</b> <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Palea steindachneri) is {{native to}} China and Vietnam and is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as an {{endangered}} species. With continued capture and trade of the species, preservation efforts {{are unlikely to be}} successful in its native range. Outside of its native region, P. steindachneri populations are known to exist in the island nation of Mauritius and in the state of Hawaii. Viable populations in Hawaii may provide an opportunity for ex-situ conservation strategies, however, its status as introduced, and possibly invasive, must be carefully evaluated. The present project was conducted to determine the present distribution of softshell turtles throughout the Hawaiian Islands and to identify suitable sampling sites for future research. Survey methods included live trap placement in freshwater habitat, visual encounter surveys, and interviews. Captured turtles were tagged, measured, photographed, and promptly released. Field research was conducted on the islands of Kauai, Maui, Oahu, and Lanai and resulted in the capture of over five hundred freshwater animal specimens including three P. steindachneri, the identification of future study sites, access to sites, and an abundance of anecdotal data on the whereabouts of softshell turtles in Hawaii. The project produced a customized database, and interactive maps to manage and represent data collected. Future research on P. steindachneri in Hawaii should focus on known populations. Further in depth study of biological and ecological characteristics of the species in Hawaii will be crucial to {{the development and implementation of}} conservation management strategies for the <b>wattle-necked</b> <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> throughout the remote archipelago.

50|$|Smooth <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> may {{be easily}} {{confused}} with the spiny <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Apalone spinifera), as {{the differences between the}} two species are subtle. Spiny <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> have a rough carapace with spines along the front edge while, as the name implies, smooth <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> lack such spines. Additionally, the white chin and throat of the smooth softshell are unmarked, compared to the splotchy chin and throat of the spiny softshell. A. mutica is the only species of North American softshell with round nostrils; all other species have ridges on the nasal septum which make the nostrils C-shaped.|$|R
5000|$|The African <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> or Nile <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> (Trionyx triunguis) {{is a large}} {{species of}} turtle from fresh-water and {{brackish}} habitats in Africa (larger parts of East, West and Middle Africa) and the Near East (Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey). It is the only extant species from the genus Trionyx, {{but in the past}} many other <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> were placed in this genus; they have now been moved to various other genera. Despite the name [...] "African softshell turtle", {{it is not the only}} species or genus of <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> in Africa (the genera Cyclanorbis and Cycloderma are also African).|$|R
50|$|The black <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> or Bostami turtle (Nilssonia nigricans, {{previously}} {{placed in}} genus Aspideretes) is {{a species of}} freshwater turtle found in India (Assam) and Bangladesh (Chittagong and Sylhet).

5000|$|The smooth <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> has an anapsid skull. This kind of skull {{is present}} among the {{earliest}} reptiles and is retained by turtles today.

The smooth <b>softshell</b> <b>turtle</b> has a smooth, flexible and leather like carapace that {{is covered by}} skin instead of the hard scutes commonly observed in other turtle species. The plastron is light (white or gray) with no markings, and the underlying bones are visible. Smooth <b>softshell</b> <b>turtles</b> have a tubular snout with round nostrils.|$|R
