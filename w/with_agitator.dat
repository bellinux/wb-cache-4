40|$|The {{literature}} {{relating to}} the extraction of the aromatics, benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) using different commercial solvents, and to mixer-settler design and performance, has been reviewed. Liquid-liquid equilibria of the ternary systems: hexane-benzene-sulfolane, n-heptane-toluene-sulfolane, and octane-xylene-sulfolane were determined experimentally at temperatures of 30 oC, 35 oC, and 40 oC. The work was then extended to a multicomponent system. The data were correlated by using Hand's method and {{were found to be}} in a good agreement with theoretical predictions using the UNIFAC method. A study was made of the performance of a 10 -stage laboratory mixer-settler cascade for the extraction of BTX from a synthetic reformate utilizing sulfolane as a solvent. Murphree stage efficiency decreased with stage number but 99 % extraction was achievable within 4 stages. The effects of temperature, phase ratio, and agitator speed were investigated. The efficiency increased <b>with</b> <b>agitator</b> speed but > 1050 rpm resulted in secondary haze formation. An optimum temperature of 30 oC was selected from the phase equilibria; the optimum solvent: feed ratio was 3 : 1 for 4 stages. The experimental overall mass transfer coefficients were compared with those predicted from single drop correlations and were in all cases greater, by a factor of 1. 5 to 3, due to the surface renewal associated with drop break-up and coalescence promoted by agitation. A similar investigation was performed using real reformate from the Kuwait Oil Company. The phase ratios were in the range 0. 5 to 1 to 3. 25 to 1, the agitator speed 1050 rpm, and the operating temperature 30 oC. A maximum recovery of 99 % aromatics was achieved in 4 stages at a phase ratio of 3. 25 to 1. A backflow model was extended to simulate conditions in the mixer-settler cascade with this multicomponent system. Overall mass transfer coefficients were estimated by obtaining the best fit between experimental and predicted concentration profiles. They were up to 10 % greater than those with the synthetic feed but close agreement was not possible because the distribution coefficient and phase ratio varied with stage number. Sulfolane was demonstrated to be an excellent solvent for BTX recovery and a mixer-settler cascade was concluded to be a technically viable alternative to agitated columns for this process...|$|E
40|$|Liquid-liquid {{extraction}} {{has long}} been known as a unit operation that {{plays an important role in}} industry. This process is well known for its complexity and sensitivity to operation conditions. This thesis presents an attempt to explore the dynamics and control of this process using a systematic approach and state of the art control system design techniques. The process was studied first experimentally under carefully selected. operation conditions, which resembles the ranges employed practically under stable and efficient conditions. Data were collected at steady state conditions using adequate sampling techniques for the dispersed and continuous phases as well as during the transients of the column with the aid of a computer-based online data logging system and online concentration analysis. A stagewise single stage backflow model was improved to mimic the dynamic operation of the column. The developed model accounts for the variation in hydrodynamics, mass transfer, and physical properties throughout the length of the column. End effects were treated by addition of stages at the column entrances. Two parameters were incorporated in the model namely; mass transfer weight factor to correct for the assumption of no mass transfer in the. settling zones at each stage and the backmixing coefficients to handle the axial dispersion phenomena encountered in the course of column operation. The parameters were estimated by minimizing the differences between the experimental and the model predicted concentration profiles at steady state conditions using non-linear optimisation technique. The estimated values were then correlated as functions of operating parameters and were incorporated in·the model equations. The model equations comprise a stiff differential~algebraic system. This system was solved using the GEAR ODE solver. The calculated concentration profiles were compared to those experimentally measured. A very good agreement of the two profiles was achieved within a percent relative error of ± 2. S%. The developed rigorous dynamic model of the extraction column was used to derive linear time-invariant reduced-order models that relate the input variables (agitator speed, solvent feed flowrate and concentration, feed concentration and flowrate) to the output variables (raffinate concentration and extract concentration) using the asymptotic method of system identification. The reduced-order models were shown to be accurate in capturing the dynamic behaviour of the process with a maximum modelling prediction error of I %. The simplicity and accuracy of the derived reduced-order models allow for control system design and analysis of such complicated processes. The extraction column is a typical multivariable process <b>with</b> <b>agitator</b> speed and solvent feed flowrate considered as manipulative variables; raffinate concentration and extract concentration as controlled variables and the feeds concentration and feed flowrate as disturbance variables. The control system design of the extraction process was tackled as multi-loop decentralised SISO (Single Input Single Output) as well as centralised MIMO (Multi-Input Multi-Output) system using both conventional and model-based control techniques such as IMC (Internal Model Control) and MPC (Model Predictive Control). Control performance of each control scheme was. studied in terms of stability, speed of response, sensitivity to modelling errors (robustness), setpoint tracking capabilities and load rejection. For decentralised control, multiple loops were assigned to pair. each manipulated variable with each controlled variable according to the interaction analysis and other pairing criteria such as relative gain array (RGA), singular value analysis (SVD). Loops namely Rotor speed-Raffinate concentration and Solvent flowrate Extract concentration showed weak interaction. Multivariable MPC has shown more effective performance compared to other conventional techniques since it accounts for loops interaction, time delays, and input-output variables constraints...|$|E

40|$|Agitated dispersions of one {{liquid in}} another {{immiscible}} liquid {{are widely used}} in chemical industry in operations such as liquid-liquid extraction, suspension polymerisation, and blending of polymers. When holdup of the dispersed phase is increased, {{in an effort to}} increase the productivity, at a critical holdup, the dispersed phase catastrophically becomes the continuous phase and vice versa. This phenomenon is known as phase inversion. Although the inversion phenomenon has been studied off and on over the past few decades, the mechanism of phase inversion (PI) has yet not become clear. These studies have however brought out many interesting aspects of PI, besides unravelling the effect of physical and operational variables on PL Experiments show that oil-in-water (o/w) and water-in-oil (w/o) dispersions behave very differently, e. g water drops in w/o dispersions contain oil droplets in them, but oil drops in o/w dispersions contain none, dispersed phase hold up at which inversion occurs increases with agitation speed for w/o dispersions but decreases for o/w dispersions. A common feature of both types of dispersions however is that as agitation speed is increased to high values, inversion holdups reach a constant value. A further increase in agitation speed does not change inversion hold up. Although this finding was first reported a long time ago, the implications it may have not received any attentions. In fact, the work reported in the literature since then does not even mention it. The present work shows that this finding has profound implications. Starting with the finding that at high agitation speed inversion hold up does not change with agitation speed, the present work shows that inversion hold up also does not change <b>with</b> <b>agitator</b> diameter, type of agitator and vessel diameter. In these experiments, carried out in agitated vessel, energy was introduced as a point source. The experiments carried out with turbulent flow in annular region of two coaxial cylinders, inner one rotating, in which energy is introduced nearly uniformly throughout the system, show that the inversion holdup remains unchanged. These results indicate that constant values of inversion holdups for a given liquid-liquid systems (o/w and w/o) are properties of the liquid-liquid systems alone, independent of geometrical and operational parameters. A new hypothesis is proposed to explain the new findings. Phase inversion is considered to occur as a result of imbalance between breakup and coalescence of drops. Electrolytes, which affect only coalescence of drops, were therefore added to the system to investigate the effect of altering coalescence of drops on phase inversion. The experiments performed in the presence of electrolyte KI at various concentrations indicate that addition of electrolyte increases the inversion holdup for both o/w and w/o dispersions for three types of systems: non polar-water, polar-water and immiscible organic-organic. Higher the concentration of electrolyte used, higher was the holdup required for phase inversion. These findings indicate that while the addition of electrolyte increases coalescence of drops in lean dispersions, it has exactly opposite effect on imbalance of breakage and coalescence of drops at high holdups near phase inversion point. The opposite effect of electrolytes in lean and concentrated dispersions could be explained qualitatively, but only in part in the light of a new theory, involving multi-particle interactions. The phase inversion phenomenon is quantified in a simple manner by testing the breakage and coalescence rate expressions available in literature. It has been found that, equilibrium drop size (where breakage and coalescence events are in dynamic equilibrium) approaches infinity near phase inversion holdup which is not an ex perimentally observed fact. To capture the catastrophic nature of phase inversion, two steady state approach is proposed. The two steady states namely the stable steady state and unstable steady state, are achieved by modifying the expression for coalescence frequency on the basis of (i) shear coalescence mechanism and, (ii) recognising the fact that at high dispersed phase holdup the droplets are already in contact with each other at all times and hence rendering the second order coales cence process to a first order one. Using two steady states approach, catastrophic phase inversion is shown to occur at finite drop size...|$|E

The current approved method for determining the geometric mean diameter by weight (d(gw)) and geometric standard deviation (S-gw) of grains is standard ANSI/ASAE S 319. 4. This method controls many variables, including the suggested quantity of initial material and the type, number, and size of sieves. However, the method allows for variations in sieving time, sieve agitators, {{and the use of}} a dispersion agent. The objective of this experiment was to determine which method of particle size analysis best estimated the particle size of various cereal grain types. Eighteen samples of either corn, sorghum, or wheat were ground and analyzed using different variations of the approved method. Treatments were arranged in a 5 x 3 factorial arrangement with 5 sieving methods: 1) 10 -min sieving time <b>with</b> sieve <b>agitators</b> and no dispersion agent, 2) 10 -min sieving time <b>with</b> sieve <b>agitators</b> and dispersion agent, 3) 15 -min sieving time <b>with</b> no sieve <b>agitators</b> or dispersion agent, 4) 15 -min sieving time <b>with</b> sieve <b>agitators</b> and no dispersion agent, and 5) 15 -min sieving time <b>with</b> sieve <b>agitators</b> and dispersion agent conducted in 3 grain types (ground corn, sorghum, and wheat) with 4 replicates per treatment. The analytical method that resulted in the lowest dgw and greatest Sgw was considered desirable because it was presumably representative of increased movement of particles to their appropriate sieve. Analytical method affected dgw and Sgw (P 0. 05), but wheat ground using the same mill parameters was 120 to 104 m larger (P = 0. 05) than corn and sorghum, respectively.

50|$|Spiral mixers are {{specialist}} {{tools for}} mixing dough. A spiral-shaped agitator remains stationary while the bowl rotates. This method enables spiral mixers {{to mix the}} same size dough batch much quicker and with less under-mixed dough than a similarly powered planetary mixer. Spiral mixers can mix dough <b>with</b> less <b>agitator</b> friction than planetary mixers. This allows the dough to be mixed without increasing its temperature, ensuring the dough can rise properly.|$|R
50|$|During {{the wash}} cycle, the outer tub {{is filled with}} water {{sufficient}} to fully immerse and suspend the clothing freely in the basket. The movement of the agitator pushes water outward between the paddles towards {{the edge of the}} tub. The water then moves outward, up the sides of the basket, towards the center, and then down towards the agitator to repeat the process, in a circulation pattern similar to the shape of a torus. The agitator direction is periodically reversed, because continuous motion in one direction would just lead to the water spinning around the basket <b>with</b> the <b>agitator</b> rather than the water being pumped in the torus-shaped motion. Some washers supplement the water-pumping action of the <b>agitator</b> <b>with</b> a large rotating screw on the shaft above the agitator, to help move water downwards {{in the center of the}} basket.|$|R
