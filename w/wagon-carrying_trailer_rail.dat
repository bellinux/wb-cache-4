50|$|Cross-docking is a {{practice}} in logistics of unloading materials from an incoming semi-trailer truck or railroad car and loading these materials directly into outbound trucks, <b>trailers,</b> or <b>rail</b> cars, {{with little or}} no storage in between. This may be done to change the type of conveyance, to sort material intended for different destinations, or to combine material from different origins into transport vehicles (or containers) with the same destination or similar destinations.|$|R
25|$|The {{fastest growing}} rail traffic segment is {{currently}} intermodal. Intermodal is {{the movement of}} shipping containers or truck <b>trailers</b> by <b>rail</b> {{and at least one}} other mode of transportation, usually trucks or ocean-going vessels. Intermodal combines the door-to-door convenience of trucks with the long-haul economy of railroads. Rail intermodal has tripled in the last 25 years. It plays a critical role in making logistics far more efficient for retailers and others. The efficiency of intermodal provides the U.S. with a huge competitive advantage in the global economy.|$|R
40|$|A local orchardist was {{experiencing}} {{a problem that}} was being caused by their lack of apple picking bin moving equipment. The orchardist needed a well-engineered solution to this lack of equipment. The solution arrived at was a five bin trailer. There were multiple design requirements for this trailer, including the device needing {{to be able to}} interface with an ATV, be able to be loaded by hand, be able to carry five bins, and not exceed a budget of $ 750. While perfecting the design of the trailer, a number of different disciplines were utilized, which included dynamics, kinematics, static loading analysis, and material strength analysis. Different technologies were used to create a final design, including CAD modeling using Solidworks modeling software, MDSolids for maximum material stress predictions, and spreadsheet optimization of material cross sections using Microsoft Excel. The manufacture and assembly of the trailer device made use of different fabrication techniques, including welded and bolted joints. The results of the performance of this trailer were measured with multiple instruments, including a spring scale for measuring how the weight of the trailer hitch deviated from the calculated value. Also measured experimentally was the trailers ability to resist deformation occurring from a full load being dropped six inches onto the <b>trailer</b> <b>rails...</b>|$|R
40|$|Design and {{execution}} of joints with lock-bolts for steel structures. A large number of mechanical joints for steel structures is generated with conventional bolts. Still, this proven joining technology has some significant disadvantages. These include the big scattering of inserting the preload using the torque-tightening method, the risk of self-loosening by cyclic loads causing a cross movement of the components {{as well as the}} low fatigue resistance for axial loads. The lock-bolt technology was already invented in the 1930 s and mainly used for the aviation and space industry in support of its evident advantages. Due to demands from different industrial markets, like aviation, truck, <b>trailer,</b> <b>rail,</b> bus, agriculture, mining, military and steel construction industry, the lock-bolt technology was further developed and applied. Its application, particularly in the mechanical engineering sector, was mainly possible due to individual investigations performed by the users of the technology. These investigations were costly but necessary {{due to the lack of}} consistent design rules, which hindered a broader implementation and the calculation of lock-bolt connections in the construction and building industry. Within the scope of several research projects funded by the AiF (German Federation of Industrial Research Associations) the Fraunhofer-Application Center for Large Structures in Production Engineering successively developed calculation rules, which will be introduced to the reader within the scope of this paper with the aim to utilise the advantages of this joining technique. Furthermore, the applicability in the building industry with general technical approvals will be exemplified and current applications demonstrated...|$|R

2500|$|... 20 trams {{were built}} by Brush in 1937. These are {{single-deck}} cars that closely resemble the original English Electric railcoaches, but have more pointed ends. They were originally numbered 284–303, with eighteen survivors being renumbered 621–638 in 1968 (301 and 303 having been mothballed and scrapped without being renumbered). 638 was experimentally converted as a driver-only operated tram in 1969 with doors {{built at the}} ends for entry, but the experiment was deemed a failure due to the layout and seating capacity reduction; 638 was converted back into a conventional Brush railcoach. 638 was withdrawn from service in 1980 requiring an overhaul, but was scrapped in 1984 after being deemed surplus to requirements. 629 was withdrawn in 1972 requiring an overhaul, but was scrapped in 1980 due to Rigby Road workshops working throughout the 1970s on the OMO rebuild programme. 628 was withdrawn in 1969 due to a collision with Balloon car 726. The body of 628 was scrapped, but the underframe was converted into a <b>rail</b> carrying <b>trailer</b> with a <b>rail</b> crane installed. 628 was renumbered to 748 and then 260. 633 was rebuilt as the illuminated Trawler and was renumbered to 737 in 2008. One Brush car, No. 631, was retained by Blackpool Transport for their heritage fleet of trams and has been restored back to its 1950s condition. Although its restoration {{has not yet been}} completed and some features of its 1990s rebuild remain, it re-entered service in May 2013. 622 was given to Anchorsholme Primary School for use as a static classroom. 626 was sold to Peel Holdings. 636 was sold to Stored Energy Technology to test experimental equipment. All of the other Brush cars were acquired for preservation due to the modernisation of the tramway in 2011-2012. In December 2013, former Permanent Way car 259 (624, originally 287) and 632 which were preserved by the Lancastrian Transport Trust, returned to Rigby Road Depot from outside storage and await repaints and repairs before they can re-enter service as part of the heritage fleet. 621 was preserved at Beamish museum until 2016 when the tram was donated to the heritage fleet in Blackpool and moved back there in December 2016. 621 will return to service in September 2017, painted in 1950s green and cream livery. 623, painted in 1940s wartime green and cream livery, is in operation at Heaton Park Tramway, Manchester. In 2017, it went on loan to the Blackpool Tramway for the 80th anniversary of the Brush railcoach cars. 625 is privately preserved and is currently stored in Rigby Road Depot. 290 (627) is preserved by Fleetwood Heritage Leisure Trust. 630 is in operation at the National Tramway Museum, Crich. 630 was rebuilt in the 1990s with modern indicator headlamps, electrical equipment and bus-type seats. It remains in this condition as a reminder of this period of Blackpool's tramway history. 634 was privately sold and was on static display at the North Eastern Electrical Traction Trust museum painted in 1990s green and cream livery until 2016 when the tram was donated to the heritage fleet in Blackpool by its owner and returned to Blackpool in February 2016 and will re-enter service in the future. 298 (635) was preserved by the National Tramway Museum, Crich and remains stored. 637 is privately preserved and is currently stored in Fleetwood.|$|R
40|$|When the new locks of the Panama Canal are {{finished}} in 2015 Post Panamax vessels {{are able to}} sail through the Panama Canal. This will increase the container traffic intensity through the Caribbean. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) wants to anticipate on this expansion of the Panama Canal by investing in a US$ 1. 5 billion transshipment port in the Caribbean. Jamaica is an interesting location to realize this port, because of its ideal central position in the Caribbean and its location lies {{in the doorway of}} the Panama Canal. CHEC aims for the Goat Islands in Jamaica as their location for the new port. Normally the Jamaican government welcomes foreign investments of CHEC with open arms, but the Goat Islands are an environmentally protected area. Recently, this led to many complains by environmentalists. The new port can only be successful if it has a good competitive position with respect to other ports. The new port in Jamaica is a location with high potency to accommodate the container vessels which have ports at the East Coast of North America as destination. To attract shipping companies to the new transshipment port in Jamaica the price and efficiency of the new port must be competitive with other ports. As the new port of Jamaica doesn’t have a large hinterland and focusses mainly on transshipment, shipping companies are not bounded to Jamaica and can switch easily to other ports. The most competitive ports are Mariel (Cuba) and Freeport (the Bahamas). This report proposes designs and alternative locations for the new port. To find the ideal location for a new port in Jamaica different potential areas are selected and studied. The first steps resulted in sixteen possible locations for the port. Two Multi Criteria Analyses (MCA’s) resulted in a selection of four locations. Those possible locations for the new port are: the Goat Islands, Jackson Bay, Maccary Bay, and Little Bay. The best location is not found, because all the four locations are well-matched for their designed level of detail. Therefore the recommendation is made that all the four locations should be designed in a higher level of detail, so the decision makers can make well informed choices for the people of Jamaica. Because the media attention, the Jamaican government, and CHEC are more focusing on the Goat Islands than on the other locations, the location Goat Islands is designed further into detail. For designing the port the total surface of the port of 12 km 2 is divided into port area for transshipment (4 km 2) and area for the use of industry (8 km 2). The transshipment area has a quay length of 3 kilometer, which provides enough berthing space to handle seven Post Panamax ships and one Panamax ship simultaneously. The maximum expected throughput of 7 million TEU per year is found. The transshipment area is also designed into further detail. Super Post Panamax ship-to-shore cranes, multi <b>trailer</b> systems and <b>rail</b> mounted gantry cranes are most suitable for the port. The hinterland connection is also designed. A road connection is needed and a railway connection is designed as an option. The industrial surface can be used for many different facilities. These facilities are the assembling of gantry cranes for the Americas and creating cement and steel for export purposes. These activities need quay length which is included in the design of the total layout. Also space is reserved for a manufacturing facility, a logistics center, a LNG power plant, and a major IT facility. The extreme wave conditions for the new port are investigated to come up with the design loads. Extreme waves with a return period of 1 / 200 years give a surge level of 2. 0 meter and wave heights of 4. 0 meters at the port entrance. Behind the port is found a higher surge level of 2. 5 meters. Next to the extreme conditions the downtime of the port due to waves is established. Tropical storms are not strong enough to cause downtime, because of the sheltered area of Portland Bight. Only during hurricanes the port is not operational. The economical, social, and environmental impacts of the new port are described. For the new port the most favorable port model and a finance scheme are found. A private service port model with full concession in combination with a Build, Operate, and Transfer contract (BOT) is advised. The land will still be owned by the Jamaican government, but CHEC will fulfill both the functions of port authority and port operator. An environmental impact assessment has to be performed, because there are more issues besides the destruction of Little Goat Island, harming the fish sanctuary, and the impact on the total Portland Bight. Also these three issues should be investigated in detail. A SWOT analysis is carried out to find the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The main opportunity and threat is the change in expected throughput. To deal with this uncertainty an adaptive port planning is designed.
