She was treated at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta and had approximately 56 operations and substantial physical therapy.|$|E

60|$|He entered 62, Montpellier Square {{with the}} fullest {{intentions}} of being miserable. It was already half-past seven, and Irene, dressed for dinner, {{was seated in}} the drawing-room.

"We'll {{see about}} that," [...] {{returned}} the Spider in a severe tone, {{and the next}} instant he made a dive straight at Dorothy, opening the claws in his legs as if to grab and pinch her with the sharp points.

It was {{attached}} now to a ribbon round her neck. Sweet ring! She put it to her eyes.

60|$|But now, {{since the}} mighty Frogman {{had decided to}} {{undertake}} the journey, several of the Yips who were young and daring at once {{made up their minds}} to go along, so the next morning after breakfast the Frogman and Cayke the Cookie Cook and nine of the Yips started to slide {{down the side of the}} mountain. The bramble bushes and cactus plants were very prickly and uncomfortable to the touch, so the Frogman quickly commanded the Yips to go first and break a path, so that when he followed them he would not tear his splendid clothes. Cayke, too, <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>her</b> best dress and was likewise afraid of the thorns and prickers, so she kept behind the Frogman.|$|E
6000|$|But Grizel came; she {{was only}} late because it had taken her {{such a long time}} to say good-by to the girl in the glass. She <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>her</b> black dress and lustre jacket, and carried in a bundle the few treasures she was taking with her, and though she did not ask Tommy if he was coming, she cast a quick look round to see if he had a bundle anywhere, and he had none. That told her his decision, and she would have liked to sit down for a minute and cry, but of course she had too much pride, and she bade him {{farewell}} so promptly that he thought he had a grievance. [...] "I'm coming as far as the toll-house wi' you," [...] he said, sulkily, and so they started together.|$|E

60|$|He put an {{arm over}} the back of the seat, and assumed a more {{comfortable}} attitude. He glanced at Miriam, who was sitting in a lax, thoughtful pose with her eyes on the flowers. She <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>her</b> old dress, she had not had time to change, and the blue tones of her old dress brought out a certain warmth in her skin, and her pose exaggerated whatever was feminine in her rather lean and insufficient body, and rounded her flat chest delusively. A little line of light lay along her profile. The afternoon was full of transfiguring sunshine, children were playing noisily in the adjacent sandpit, some Judas trees were brightly abloom in the villa gardens that bordered the Recreation Ground, and all the place was bright with touches of young summer colour. It all merged with the effect of Miriam in Mr. Polly's mind.|$|E
60|$|Streaker, the housemaid, too, had an {{attribute}} of a most discomfiting nature. I {{am unable to}} say whether she was of an usually lymphatic temperament, or what else was the matter with her, but this young woman became a mere Distillery {{for the production of}} the largest and most transparent tears I ever met with. Combined with these characteristics, was a peculiar tenacity of hold in those specimens, so that they didn't fall, but hung upon her face and nose. In this condition, and mildly and deplorably shaking her head, her silence would throw me more heavily than the Admirable Crichton could have done in a verbal disputation for a purse of money. Cook, likewise, always covered me with confusion as with a garment, by neatly winding up the session with the protest that the Ouse <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>her</b> out, and by meekly repeating her last wishes regarding her silver watch.|$|E
60|$|Of Grizel's {{journey to}} London {{there are no}} {{particulars}} to tell. She <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>her</b> brown jacket and fur cap because Tommy had liked them, and she sat straight and stiff all the way. She {{had never been in}} a train since she was a baby, except two or three times to Tilliedrum, and she thought this was the right way to sit. Always, when the train stopped, which was at long intervals, she put her head out at the window and asked if this was the train to London. Every station a train stops at {{in the middle of the}} night is the infernal regions, and she shuddered to hear lost souls clanking their chains, which is what a milk-can becomes on its way to the van; but still she asked if this was the train to London. When fellow-passengers addressed her, she was very modest and cautious in her replies. Sometimes a look of extraordinary happiness, of radiance, passed over her face, and may have puzzled them. It was part of the thought that, however ill he might be, she was to see him now.|$|E
