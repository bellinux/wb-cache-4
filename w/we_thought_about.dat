500|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} {{as a result of}} the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which delayed the seventh season for an entire year; the producers were exploring ways to get back on the air earlier. Ideas included airing webisodes or mobisodes. According to the President of Entertainment at Fox, [...] "We were going to be off the air for a while and how do you bridge that gap. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> doing something online and after talking with [...] Howard Gordon we decided to do it on air." [...] The working title for the film was 24: Exile, until the change to 24: Redemption.|$|E
500|$|The Nintendo DS {{is said to}} have {{influenced}} the Wii's design. Designer Ken'ichiro Ashida noted, [...] "We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> copying the DS's touch-panel interface and even came up with a prototype." [...] The idea was eventually rejected because of the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical. Miyamoto also stated, [...] " [...] if the DS had flopped, we might have taken the Wii back to the drawing board." [...] In June 2011 Nintendo unveiled the prototype of its successor to the Wii, to be known as Wii U.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} Jerry-centered episode arose {{when the}} writers decided one of the {{characters}} would get mugged. Muharrar said, [...] "Once <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it, it was obvious it had to be Jerry. He's the Parks Department punching bag, and it seemed like it was time for Jerry's revenge." [...] Muharrar said the script tried to convey that although his co-workers mock him, they do not hate him, and that Jerry does not take the jokes against him personally. Series co-creator Michael Schur said once it was established in the episode [...] "Practice Date" [...] that Jerry was the co-worker everyone else picked on, he felt it was important to write an episode that established the other characters actually liked Jerry, despite their jokes at his expense.|$|E

500|$|Weiss {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} the introduction of Lyanna Mormont in the series, with Weiss saying, [...] "We were excited {{about the prospect of}} the character because she's mentioned in passing in the previous season," [...] referring to her letter to Stannis denying him men, and swearing fealty to House Stark. Weiss added, [...] "The more <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the kind of tough love Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks into her eyes, we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{how they}} chose their name, Jess Origliasso stated: [...] "The name is {{something}} <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> {{for a short}} time and we wanted it to be a girl's name, but we didn't want it to be 'the Jesses.' We were very conscious of not wanting to make it a twin thing, because we don't think that's really cool." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite earlier {{comments}} by Carruthers that [...] "Reese never wavered in {{her commitment to}} Bianca" [...] and was not bisexual, Pratt admitted that they were considering on [...] "turning" [...] Reese bisexual. [...] "...if Tamara decided to stay, keeping her on the show as an angry lesbian — with no other lesbian characters on the canvas — {{would be kind of}} insane," [...] said Pratt. [...] "So <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> making Reese bisexual — kind of an Anne Heche who bounces back and forth — and maybe make her an opportunistic black widow, a real bad girl. And Tamara would have been really great at that. But, ultimately, we decided to stick with the message." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mike Love said [...] "some of {{the words}} were so totally {{offensive}} to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em because I thought it was too nauseating." [...] The original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", created a stir within the group. He opposed the song's original message, though Jardine recalled {{that the decision to}} change the lyrics was ultimately Brian's: [...] "Brian was very concerned. He wanted to know what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'" [...] On Love's reaction to the album, Jardine commented: [...] "Mike was very confused... Mike's a formula hound – if it doesn't have a hook in it, if he can't hear a hook in it, he doesn't want to know about it.... I wasn't exactly thrilled with the change, but I grew to really appreciate it as soon as we started to work on it. It wasn't like anything we'd heard before." [...] Carl Wilson said: [...] "I loved every minute of it. He [...] could do no wrong. He could play me anything, and I would love it." [...] Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but not Dennis and Mike. Author John Tobler wrote that Dennis and Bruce Johnston loved the album, but that Jardine felt [...] "It sure doesn't sound like the old stuff." ...|$|E
6000|$|Anyway all the [...] "boys" [...] {{agreed that}} the great {{advantage}} of a launch would be {{that we could get}} a man to take us.

I didn't see my way to working it alone, and I told her so. She said she was {{authorized}} to offer the same sum to another, so I said I would talk it over with Nat. He agreed to stand in, and between us <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> the arrangements; but I never got to know any more about her.

This is definitely {{one of the more}} daring Ellington tributes {{that came out of the}} '90s. Instead of inundating us with standards that we've heard time and time again ... Koglmann's arrangements have strong classical/chamber music leanings, and his admiration for Gil Evans is evident.
