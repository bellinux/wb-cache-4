2500|$|On July 14, 1881, Garrett visited Fort Sumner to {{question}} {{a friend of}} the Kid's about his whereabouts and learned he was staying with a mutual friend, Pedro Menard [...] "Pete" [...] Maxwell. Around midnight, Garrett went to Maxwell's house. The Kid was asleep {{in another part of the}} house, but woke up in the middle of the night and entered Maxwell's bedroom, where Garrett was standing in the shadows. The Kid did not recognize the man standing in the dark. He asked him, repeatedly, [...] "¿Quién es?" [...] (<b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?),</b> and Garrett replied by shooting at him twice. The first shot hit the Kid in the chest just above the heart, killing him.|$|E
2500|$|Almost 500 legendary tales {{written by}} Pu Songling are {{compiled}} in Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio or Liaozhai Zhiyi. The tales, inspired by oral storytelling, include strong mythical characters like ghosts, immortals, beasts and foxes. They also offer commentary about people, particularly the privileged and court officials, whose human frailties {{may result in}} unfair, unjust and other unfavorable treatment to others. He wrote with vivid imagery about the music of heaven, {{the inability of the}} light produced by a fire-fly to illuminate the demons of the night, red rings in the sky that shear the heads off of men, and the six conditions of existence: men, sinners, angels, demons, beasts and devils. Nighttime is a symbol for people's inability to understand the world around them. And the supernatural beings are meant to be a mirror to examine the nature of man. From a preface by T'ang Meng Lai to the book, Lai states that the book should prompt the readers to reflect upon the following: [...] "We marvel at devils and foxes: we do not marvel at man. But <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that causes a man to move and to speak?" [...] One collection of the illustrated stories is at the National Museum of China.|$|E
2500|$|Until then, Charvet was {{operated}} {{in much the}} same way as it had been since its foundation: a customer was shown only what he requested, in most cases something fairly conservative. After Mr. Colban bought the firm, things changed. The change started when Baron Rothschild came into the store and asked to see some shirting fabrics, one of which was pink. When M. Colban, following previous Charvet practice, advised against the color, the Baron retorted, [...] "If not for me, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> for?" [...] Some time later, Nelson Rockefeller requested some shirt swatches be sent to New York. Bold stripes and unusual colors were sent and eventually selected. Colban had changed Charvet's policies as well as its role in the design process with the customer. A wide range of products was put on display, transforming the store in a [...] "veritable casbah" [...] of colors and [...] "almost edible" [...] fabrics. Colban also brought significant changes to the aspect of the store, having all the venerable furniture varnished in black. He created new lines of products and started ready-to-wear finely made shirts for men and women. A few years after, he was one of the first of many famous European shops and designers to sell ready-to-wear shirts, ties and accessories to Bergdorf Goodman. However, even while developing these new pre-made lines of products, Colban always insisted on the bespoke aspect of the firm as its core identity. He emphasised that [...] "the essential hardest of all to accomplish in today's world of quick and easy pseudo solutions, is an atmosphere of 'yes' to the customer and, even more, a respect for that commitment", re-iterating the focus of Charvet on its bespoke business.|$|E
