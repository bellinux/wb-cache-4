5|$|The {{third factor}} {{which led to}} the quick {{disintegration}} of II Corps was the poor state of morale amongst the soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. By 1975, the morale of South Vietnamese soldiers and their commanding officers had reached its lowest point as the war continued to drag on <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>end</b> in sight. The determination of the ARVN officer corps had taken a serious blow when South Vietnamese Foreign Minister Tran Van Lam returned from the United States in February 1975, and reported that no additional military or economic aid had been offered. When the order was given to abandon the Central Highlands, the primary concern of South Vietnamese military personnel was not battlefield victories, but the welfare of their families. Consequently, when the North Vietnamese attacked South Vietnamese forces on Route 7, large numbers of South Vietnamese soldiers left the battlefield to search for their families amidst the chaos. During the final days of South Vietnam’s existence, the average South Vietnamese soldier showed more loyalty to his family than to his commanding officer, which {{had a significant impact on}} his willingness to fight on.|$|E

He eventually decided to make one final attempt to take the eastern side, and if the effort failed he would give the order to withdraw. He gave orders to his chief secretary Saymari to cross to the eastern bank {{with a number of}} handpicked Dailamites, while he himself would attempt to distract the Hamdanid forces with a ruse.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the areas}} where {{trenches}} and fighting lines were located, such as the Champagne region of France, quantities of unexploded ordnance have remained, some of which remains dangerous, continuing to cause injuries and occasional fatalities in the 21st century. Some are found by farmers ploughing their fields and have been called the iron harvest. Some of this ammunition contains toxic chemical products such as mustard gas. Cleanup of major battlefields is a continuing task <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>end</b> in sight for decades to come. Squads remove, defuse or destroy hundreds of tons of unexploded ammunition every year in Belgium, France, and Germany.|$|E
25|$|The EL {{had been}} formed in 1960 as a merger of the Erie Railroad and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. It too was bankrupt, but was {{somewhat}} stronger financially than the others. It was ruled reorganizable under Chapter 77 on April 30, 1974 (as had the Boston and Maine Railroad), but on January 9, 1975, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>end</b> to its losses in sight, its trustees reconsidered {{and asked for}} inclusion. The Final System Plan assigned a major section of the EL, from northern New Jersey west to northeast Ohio, {{to be sold to}} the Chessie System, which would help spur competition in Conrail's territory. Chessie however could not reach an agreement with EL labor unions, and in February 1976 announced {{that it would not be}} buying the EL section. The USRA hurriedly assigned large amounts of trackage rights to the Delaware and Hudson Railway, allowing it to compete in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C., markets.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Chabon spent five years working on a second novel. Called Fountain City, the novel was a [...] "highly ambitious opus ... about an {{architect}} building a perfect baseball park in Florida," [...] and it eventually ballooned to 1,500 pages, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>end</b> in sight. The process was frustrating for Chabon, who, in his words, [...] "never felt like I was conceptually on steady ground." ...|$|E

50|$|The strong nouns {{generally}} {{originated from}} the Old Dutch a-stem, i-stem and u-stem inflections. They mostly had a nominative singular <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>ending,</b> and a nominative plural in -e or, for some neuter nouns, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>ending.</b> Most strong nouns were masculine or neuter. Feminines {{in this class}} were former i-stems, and could lack an ending in the dative singular, a remnant of the late Old Dutch inflection. In some rare occasions, the genitive singular was also endingless. Some nouns ended in -e in the singular also; these were primarily former ja-stems, which were masculine or neuter. A few were former i-stems with short stems. Nouns of this type tended {{to be drawn into}} the weak inflection by analogy.|$|R
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} desirable to have also edges {{with only one}} end (half-edges); these get only one arrow. An edge <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>ends</b> (a loose edge) has no arrows. The edges that are neither half nor loose edges may be called ordinary edges.|$|R

The game's production was turbulent, as the design's scope exceeded the available resources, and the team were left without a producer {{for nearly a year}} until Activision appointed David Mullich to the role, where he found designs and levels unfinished or abandoned. After three years in development <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>end</b> in sight and running over budget, Activision set a strict deadline for completion, and Bloodlines was released incomplete in November 2004.|$|E
500|$|The Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project's final {{construction}} project was straightening the Kissimmee River, a meandering -long river that was drained {{to make way}} for grazing land and agriculture. The C started building the C-38 canal in 1962 and the effects were seen almost immediately. Waterfowl, wading birds, and fish disappeared, prompting conservationists and sport fishers to demand the region be restored before the canal was finished in 1971. In general, C projects had been criticized for being temporary fixes that ignored future consequences, costing billions of dollars <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>end</b> in sight. After Governor Bob Graham initiated the Save Our Everglades campaign in 1983, the first section of the canal was backfilled in 1986. Graham announced that by 2000 the Everglades would be restored as closely as possible to its pre-drainage state. The Kissimmee River Restoration project was approved by Congress in 1992. It is estimated that it will cost $578million to convert only [...] of the canal. The entire project was to be complete by 2011, yet as of 2017, the project is [...] "more than halfway complete" [...] and the new completion date is 2020.|$|E

2500|$|In 1930, Saskatoon {{initiated}} {{a series of}} [...] "work for wages" [...] schemes designed to provide the unemployed with unskilled manual jobs. Financed from municipal, provincial, and federal sources, but operated by the city, the projects kept unemployment to manageable levels at first. Before 1932, most experts saw the depression as a temporary anomaly, a short-term emergency requiring no more than short-term emergency measures. By 1932 the depression was getting much worse <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>end</b> in sight. By spring 1932, the federal and provincial governments, short of revenue, were forced to abandon expensive public works {{in favor of the}} cheaper, more efficient direct relief of giving out cash and foot baskets.

Substantial levelling also occurred in noun and verb paradigms; the short-vowel forms <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>ending</b> generally adopted, by analogy, the long vowel of the forms with an ending.|$|R

2500|$|The Navy {{continued}} {{to dominate the}} seas, fighting the German fleet to a draw in the only great battle, the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Germany was blockaded and was increasingly short of food. It tried to fight back with submarines, despite the risk of war by the powerful neutral power the United States. The waters around Britain were declared a war zone where any ship, neutral or otherwise, was a target. After the liner Lusitania was sunk in May 1915, drowning over 100 American passengers, protests by the United States led Germany to abandon unrestricted submarine warfare. With victory over Russia in 1917 Germany now calculated it could finally have numerical superiority on the [...] Western Front. Planning for a massive Spring Offensive in 1918, it resumed the sinking of all merchant ships without warning. The United States entered the war alongside the Allies in 1917, and provided the needed manpower, money and supplies to keep them going. On other fronts, the British, French, Australians, and Japanese occupied Germany's colonies. Britain fought the Ottoman Empire, suffering defeats in the Gallipoli Campaign and in Mesopotamia, while arousing the Arabs who helped expel the Turks from their lands. Exhaustion and war-weariness were growing worse in 1917, as the fighting in France continued <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>end</b> in sight. The German spring offensives of 1918 failed, and with arrival of a million of the American Expeditionary Forces {{at the rate of}} 10,000 a day by May 1918, the Germans realized they were being overwhelmed.

2500|$|On the June 4, 2014 episode, Colbert briefly {{broke down}} {{the details of}} a dispute that Amazon was having with book {{publisher}} Hachette, who has printed every book he has authored (and is the issuer for thousands more authors). In an LA Times interview; fellow Hachette author James Patterson expressed fear in regard to the depths Amazon will go to maintain control over book pricing, publishing, and sales of any e-retail in general. The main issue between the two companies is of e-book sales, and Amazon's lowering of prices to what certain publishers consider unsustainable for their business. Considering Amazon's domination when it comes to bookselling (between 40 and 50% of all book sales) and the myriad products it has since taken to selling due to its success with literature, it is slowing down or halting all sales of published or upcoming books produced by Hachette <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>end</b> in sight, notifying potential customers {{that it would be a}} better decision to shop elsewhere for any Hachette books. In response to his books being delayed or outright banned from being ordered, Colbert (as well as fellow Hachette author Sherman Alexie) encouraged the Colbert Nation to order California from first-time author Edan Lepucki from Portland, Oregon bookseller Powell's Books linked to Colbert's website (as well as [...] "I Didn't Buy It on Amazon" [...] stickers) and urged fans to refuse to purchase anything from Amazon until the conflict is resolved in a fair way. On the July 21 episode, Colbert repeated the experiment, asking Lepucki for a recommendation of another Hachette author. Lepucki gave the nod to Stephan Eirik Clark who authored Sweetness #9.|$|E
