500|$|Musically, [...] "Deuces" [...] is a slow, down-tempo R ballad that {{displays}} {{elements of}} house and pop music. The song has {{a length of}} four minutes and thirty-six seconds. It is backed by synth chords and [...] "eerie harmonies", with Brown's [...] "smooth vocals" [...] making use of auto-tune effects. According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, the song contains lyrical content about [...] "breaking {{it off with a}} girl after failed attempts to make the relationship work". In the first verse, Brown sings: [...] "All that bullshit is for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture / Always hoping for the worst, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to fuck up / You'll regret the day when I find another girl, that knows just what I need / She knows just what I mean." ...|$|E
500|$|Altogether, Meessen's {{photographic}} {{ventures in}} the Indies {{and the resulting}} albums cost some 34,000Netherlands Indies gulden, which included camera equipment (though {{it is not known}} what model(s) he used), chemicals, transportation, and accommodations. Meessen worked alone, never taking a partner while in the Indies, and documented the land and people in the colony in his albumen prints. In his ethnographic photography of the indigenous peoples of the Indies, he often had to overcome superstitions which, the Bataviaasch Handelsblad wrote, [...] "made taking images of the people outside Java almost impossible". Others were more enthusiastic, including the villagers of Nias: [...] "Upon arrival I fired a few shots and flew the Dutch flag. Soon the villagers came and asked what I wanted. Once I told them, they promised their assistance. At exactly 5a.m. the following morning I found some 60warriors <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> on the beach." ...|$|E

Pleased with the Volume 4 album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and {{returned to}} the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a [...] "giant synthesiser". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. [...] "Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent" [...] Iommi said. [...] "Everybody was sitting there <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Class {{inequality}} in Swedish society {{was a strong}} and recurring theme in the Commission's findings. It appeared as a major motivator in the 289 personal narratives included in the report. These documents, of great research value and human interest today, were submitted by Swedes in Canada and the U.S. in response to requests in Swedish-American newspapers. The great majority of replies expressed enthusiasm for their new homeland and criticized conditions in Sweden. Bitter experiences of Swedish class snobbery still rankled after sometimes 40–50 years in America. Writers recalled the hard work, pitiful wages, and grim poverty {{of life in the}} Swedish countryside. One woman wrote from North Dakota of how in her Värmland home parish, she had had to earn her living in peasant households from the age of eight, starting work {{at four in the morning}} and living on [...] "rotten herring and potatoes, served out in small amounts so that I would not eat myself sick". She could see [...] "no hope of saving anything in case of illness", but rather could see [...] "the poorhouse <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in the distance". When she was seventeen, her emigrated brothers sent her a prepaid ticket to America, and [...] "the hour of freedom struck" ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Wanna Go" [...] is a dance-pop and hi-NRG song, which {{features}} a heavy bassline and drum fills; the latter are reminiscent of English band New Order's song [...] "Blue Monday" [...] (1983). Spears squeals and chuckles throughout the song, and her vocals are processed. In the pre-chorus, she draws out the [...] "e"'s in lines such as [...] "Shame on me / To need release / Uncontrollably." [...] The section also has a whistled hook, which was compared by Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice {{to the music of}} French recording artist Bob Sinclar and American recording artist Frankie Knuckles. In the chorus, Spears stutters [...] "I-I-I wanna go-o-o/All the wa-a-ay/ Taking out my freak tonight". Ryan Brockington of the New York Post compared [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] to the music of her fifth studio album Blackout (2007). In the lyrics, Spears sings about losing inhibitions, as evident in lines such as [...] "I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow/All the dir-ir-irt/I got (sic) running through my mind.", while playfully apologizing for her need for sexual release. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times stated that she sings about [...] "the scrum that surrounds her" [...] in [...] "Lately people got me all tied up / There's a countdown <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to erupt". According to the sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing, [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] is written in the key of D minor, with an electropop beat infused metronome of 138 beats per minute. Spears' vocals range from the low note of D3 to the high note of D5.|$|E

500|$|An {{enduring}} friendship {{featured in}} EastEnders {{was the one}} shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> mother. I {{caught a glimpse of}} her through the door. Sitting on top of the piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E
500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's {{waiting for you to}} come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 28 February 1923 Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik {{met again}} {{and went for}} several days to Petrograd together. In her 1956 book of memoirs Brik remembered:I came to the railway station and found him on the platform, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> on the wagon steps. As the train started, Volodya, leaning on the door read me the poem About That. Having finished, he burst into tears, immensely relieved.

2500|$|Jordan Pundik later accounted, [...] "I'm not {{comparing}} my band to the Beatles whatsoever, {{but their}} [...] records were simple songs {{about love and}} relationships, and people could relate to their songs because they understood what {{they were trying to}} say. That's what this record reminds me of. There's not weird metaphors. It's just straight up, wearing your heart on your sleeve." [...] Steve Klein emphasised the shift in mood from their previous album by stating, [...] "I think every record we make we try and capture a time period. When writing the songs for Coming Home it was more positive than negative. I felt on the last record, Catalyst, we were very negative lyrically. You can tell that by the titles [...] "All Downhill From Here" [...] and [...] "This Disaster," [...] it was a heavier record. Coming Home on the other hand takes you to a different place. It’s the record I feel we’ve been waiting our whole career to do, taking everything people love about NFG and bringing it to the next level." [...] Bassist Ian Grushka further explained, [...] "We only really talk about personal things that have affected us first-hand, our songs are about emotions rather than some political agenda." [...] The song, [...] "When I Die" [...] was written by Gilbert about the death of his father. When initially writing the bridge section for the song, Gilbert found the experience emotionally draining and had to leave the studio in order to compose himself. Despite this, he maintains that while song is [...] "sad", it remains [...] "a good sad." [...] He reflected this in the album's liner notes by adding, [...] "It is a song about accepting death and finding the bright side of the situation. I'm no longer afraid to die because I have my father there <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> on the other side." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to come for twenty years. These words brought tears to my eyes, and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow ourselves out. A Japanese colonel, our guide, showed us the triumphal arches, the electric light decorations and endless flags. But all this, say the shopkeepers is [...] "made in Osaka"”.|$|E
