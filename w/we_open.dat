He explained that, if light came from our eyes at a constant velocity it would take much too long to illuminate the stars {{for us to see}} them while we are still looking at them, because they are so far away. Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as <b>we</b> <b>open</b> our eyes.|$|E

Later in October he publicly supported the principle of public funding for embryonic stem-cell research. [...] "We {{have to make sure that}} <b>we</b> <b>open</b> up these avenues so that our best and our brightest can go find these cures that they believe they will find," [...] he said. In support of this he endorsed Proposition 71, a California ballot initiative intended to provide state government funding for stem-cell research.|$|E
500|$|... "Dve liri (ne ni bilo pišano)" [...] (...) {{contains}} lyrics sang by a {{woman for}} her past lover. It represents a song entrusted from a grandmother to her granddaughter to be played as her wedding song. Although the grandmother has passed way and has not heard the song played at her granddaughter's wedding, the granddaughter i.e. the song's protagonist, fulfills her wish and uses two lire to order a song from the band playing music at the wedding of her ex-lover to which she is partaking as an invitee. [...] "Ke pijam ljubov do kraj" [...] (...) has joyful lyrics about love and according to Bečković, it is musically similar to the playful rhythm typical of bosa nova {{due to the fact}} that Gočeva is accompanied by fast horns and a double bass. In the song, the female protagonist sings about a [...] "blazing kiss". The song [...] "Son" [...] (...) contains a [...] "fairy tale-like" [...] atmosphere. It describes a [...] "fleeting beauty once <b>we</b> <b>open</b> our eyes" [...] and how real life is different from a dream, as portrayed in the lyrics [...] "Pusta ostana želba nevina, son si mina i ti si zamina... Ne znam koj e kriv, Bože daj mi zdiv" [...] (...) [...] The cover versions of [...] "Te vidov i se zaljubiv" [...] (...) and [...] "Ako zgrešam neka izgoram" [...] (...) are characterized by arrangements which differ significantly from the original versions and rhythmically match the music atmosphere of the album.|$|E

2500|$|Biblical and {{literary}} scholars {{have noted that}} chapter and verse numbering disguises the actual form of the biblical writings and interferes with the act of reading. Ernest Sutherland Bates wrote, [...] "Certainly, no literary format was ever less conducive to pleasure or understanding than is the curious and complicated panoply in which the Scriptures have come down to us. [...] None but a work of transcendent literary genius could have survived such a handicap at all." [...] Richard Moulton noted, [...] "We are all agreed {{to speak of the}} Bible as a supremely great literature. [...] Yet, when <b>we</b> <b>open</b> our ordinary editions, we look in vain for the lyrics, epics, dramas, essays, sonnets, treatises, which make the other great literatures of the world; instead of these the eye catches nothing but a monotonous uniformity of numbered sentences." [...] New Testament scholar Hermann von Soden urged publishers, [...] "It is high time, in any editions that wish to facilitate rather than impede readers' understanding of the New Testament writings, for not only the verse divisions… but also the conventional chapter divisions to disappear completely from the text. Without giving any consideration to these divisions, the text must be printed {{in a way that will}} illustrate visually what units the authors themselves created within their works." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, Brig. Gen. William H. French's division of the II Corps prepared to move forward, subjected to Confederate artillery fire that was descending on the fog-covered city of Fredericksburg. General Burnside's orders to Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner, commander of the Right Grand Division, was to send [...] "a division or more" [...] to seize the high ground {{to the west of the}} city, assuming that his assault on the southern end of the Confederate line would be the decisive action of the battle. The avenue of approach was difficult—mostly open fields, but interrupted by scattered houses, fences, and gardens that would restrict the movement of battle lines. A canal stood about 200 yards west of the town, crossed by three narrow bridges, which would require the Union troops to funnel themselves into columns before proceeding. About 600 yards to the west of Fredericksburg was the low ridge known as Marye's Heights, rising 40–50 feet above the plain. (Although popularly known as Marye's Heights, the ridge was composed of several hills separated by ravines, from north to south: Taylor's Hill, Stansbury Hill, Marye's Hill, and Willis Hill.) Near the crest of the portion of the ridge comprising Marye's Hill and Willis Hill, a narrow lane in a slight cut—the Telegraph Road, known after the battle as the Sunken Road—was protected by a 4-foot stone wall, enhanced in places with log breastworks and abatis, making it a perfect infantry defensive position. Confederate Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws initially had about 2,000 men on the front line of Marye's Heights and there were an additional 7,000 men in reserve on the crest and behind the ridge. Massed artillery provided almost uninterrupted coverage of the plain below. General Longstreet had been assured by his artillery commander, Lt. Col. Edward Porter Alexander, [...] "General, we cover that ground now so well that we will comb it as with a fine-tooth comb. A chicken could not live on that field when <b>we</b> <b>open</b> on it." ...|$|E
