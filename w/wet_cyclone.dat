40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a three-year, Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The project {{objective}} was to demonstrate the technical feasibility of an Atmospheric Aerosol Chemistry Analyzer (AACA) that will provide a continuous, real-time analysis of the elemental (major, minor and trace) composition of atmospheric aerosols. The AACA concept is based on sampling the atmospheric aerosol through a <b>wet</b> <b>cyclone</b> scrubber that produces an aqueous suspension of the particles. This suspension can then be analyzed for elemental composition by ICP/MS or collected for subsequent analysis by other methods. The key technical challenge {{was to develop a}} <b>wet</b> <b>cyclone</b> aerosol sampler suitable for respirable particles found in ambient aerosols. We adapted an ultrasonic nebulizer to a conventional, commercially available, cyclone aerosol sampler and completed collection efficiency tests for the unit, which was shown to efficiently collect particles as small as 0. 2 microns. We have completed the necessary basic research and have demonstrated the feasibility of the AACA concept...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{modeling}} {{studies have been}} conducted on a CO 2 absorption in a cyclone scrubber operated at room temperature. The effects of parameters such as the initial concentration of alkali in the solution and the liquid – gas ratio on the CO 2 absorbed flux were experimentally and theoretically investigated. A theoretical study has been performed using a mathematical model based on the absorption in the liquid droplet with instantaneous reaction, in the inlet duct of the cyclone and in the cyclone itself. The results from the model were compared with experimental data and showed satisfactory agreement.   Keywords: CO 2 removal, mathematical model, <b>wet</b> <b>cyclone</b> scrubbe...|$|E
40|$|The {{systematic}} {{development of}} the residential combustion system {{is divided into three}} phases. Only Phases I and IA are detailed here. Phase I constitutes the design, fabrication, testing, and evaluation of a pulse combustor sized for residential space heating. Phase IA includes additional testing with coal-water slurries and the design and evaluation of integrated systems using dry micronized coal and slurry. Phase II is an optional phase to develop an integrated system including a heat exchanger. Phase III is projected as a field test of the integrated coal-fired residential space heater. During this period, a combustor test bed was designed and fabricated to provide experimental resolution for the primary technical issues necessary to design and fabricate a fully integrated and optimized unit. A preliminary integrated design was also prepared and analytic models developed to simulate both steady-state performance and transient response during start-up and periodic cycling. The combustor test bed, ancillary facility components (including the <b>wet</b> <b>cyclone</b> scrubber), and sampling train were installed. Shakedown tests of the test bed were also initiated and a test plan is being prepared...|$|E

Water introduced from the top to <b>wet</b> the <b>cyclone</b> walls carries these particles away. The wetted walls also prevent dust reentrainment.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Assessment of {{microbial}} {{air quality}} and surface contamination in ambulances and administration offices {{as a control}} place without occupational exposure to biological agents; based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi found in collected samples. Material and Methods: The sampling was done by <b>wet</b> <b>cyclone</b> technology using the Coriolis recon apparatus, imprint and swab methods, respectively. In total, 280 samples from 28 ambulances and 10 offices in Warszawa were tested. Data was analyzed using Shapiro-Wilk normality test, Kruskal-Wallis test with α = 0. 05. P value ≤ 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: The levels of air contamination were from 0 to 2. 3 × 101 colony-forming unit (CFU) /m 3 for bacteria and for yeast and filamentous fungi were from 0 to 1. 8 × 101 CFU/m 3. The assessment of office space air samples has shown the following numbers of microorganisms: bacteria from 3. 0 × 101 to 4. 2 × 101 CFU/m 3 and yeast and filamentous fungi from 0 to 1. 9 × 101 CFU/m 3. For surface contamination the mean bacterial count in ambulances has been between 1. 0 × 101 and 1. 3 × 102 CFU/ 25 cm 2 and in offices – between 1. 1 × 101 and 8. 5 × 101 CFU/ 25 cm 2. Mean fungal count has reached the level from 2. 8 × 100 to 4. 2 × 101 CFU/ 25 cm 2 in ambulances and 1. 3 × 101 to 5. 8 × 101 CFU/ 25 cm 2 in offices. The qualitative analysis has revealed the presence of Acinetobacter spp. (surfaces), coagulase – negative Staphylococci (air and surfaces), Aspergillus and Penicillium genera (air and surfaces). Conclusions: The study has revealed a satisfactory microbiological quantity of analyzed air and surface samples in both study and control environments. However, the presence of potentially pathogenic microorganisms {{in the air and}} on surfaces in ambulances may endanger the medical emergency staff and patients with infection. Disinfection and cleaning techniques therefore should be constantly developed and implemented. Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2017; 30 (4) : 617 – 62...|$|E
40|$|A eficiência de coleta e os gastos de implantação e operação são os principais fatores considerados na utilização de equipamentos para a separação de {{material}} particulado no gás. O ciclone é comumente empregado industrialmente por apresentar baixos custos, entretanto o seu uso é restrito devido à baixa eficiência na coleta de partículas menores que 5 &# 956;m. O incremento do ciclone convencional com bicos injetores de água proporcionou uma melhoria na sua eficiência de coleta. Neste trabalho foi investigado experimentalmente o desempenho de um ciclone úmido na remoção de rocha fosfática com diâmetro mediano de 4, 66 &# 956;m. Foram instalados 8 bicos injetores de água do tipo leque. As concentrações de particulado na entrada e na saída do equipamento foram obtidas através da amostragem isocinética. Variou-se a relação da vazão de líquido/gás (L/G) de 0, 65 a 2, 20 L/m 3 para 3 diferentes configurações de bicos. A temperatura na saída diminuiu em relação à entrada em função do aumento da razão L/G. Já a umidade relativa do gás aumentou conforme o aumento da razão L/G. O ciclone operando a seco apresentou eficiência média de 76, 7 % e a melhor eficiência média a úmido foi de 85, 3 %. Foi determinada a eficiência de coleta fracionária apenas para a condição operacional que resultou na melhor eficiência global. A adaptação do ciclone Stairmand com bicos injetores de água resultou em uma melhoria de 8, 6 % na eficiência global de coleta. The {{collection efficiency}} {{and costs of}} implementation and operation are the main factors considered {{in the use of}} equipment for the separation of particulate matter in the gas. The cyclone is commonly employed industrially by low costs, however its use is limited due to the low efficiency in collecting particles smaller than 5 &# 956;m. The increase of conventional cyclone with nozzles water led to an improvement in its collection efficiency. This work experimentally investigated the performance of a <b>wet</b> <b>cyclone</b> in the removal of phosphate rock with median diameter of 4. 66 &# 956;m. The cyclone was adapted with 8 water injectors nozzles of range type. The concentrations of particles in the entrance and exit of equipment were obtained by isokinetic sampling. The ratio of the flow of liquid / gas (L/G) was varied from 0. 65 to 2. 20 L/m 3 to 3 different nozzle configurations. The outlet temperature decreased compared to entry with increase of the ratio L/G. Have the relative humidity of the gas increased with increasing L/G. The cyclone dry operating had an average efficiency of 76. 7 % and the best average efficiency the wet was 85. 3 %. The fractional collection efficiency was determined only for the operating condition that resulted in the best overall efficiency. The adaptation of the cyclone Stairmand with water injectors nozzles resulted in an improvement of 8. 6 % in the overall collection efficiency...|$|E
