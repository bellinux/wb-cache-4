500|$|After Guy Lombardo's {{death in}} 1977, CBS and the Royal Canadians {{attempted}} {{to continue their}} New Year's Eve broadcasts from the Waldorf-Astoria for 1977–78. However, the effects of Lombardo's absence led {{to a decline in}} viewership, allowing New Year's Rockin' Eve to overtake the Royal Canadians in viewership in only its fifth year on-air. The threat of the new special also prompted CBS to drop the Royal Canadians entirely in 1979 in favor of a new special, Happy New Year, America, which premiered for New Year's Eve 1979–80. With its recent success, Clark began hoping that New Year's Rockin' Eve would become a television tradition of its own, lamenting that [...] "Lombardo would always win [...] because of the Waldorf and 35 years of tradition, but <b>we</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> it wrested." [...] Clark's hopes soon became reality, as New Year's Rockin' Eve had displaced Guy Lombardo as the most popular and most-watched New Year's Eve special on American television in the years following.|$|E
500|$|The {{child sexual}} abuse {{allegations}} of 2003 resulted in a long trial two years later. Sneddon was the lead investigator again, {{as well as the}} trial prosecutor. The trial ended with Jackson being acquitted on all counts.

Evidence to support these claims include Sneddon joking about Jackson's greatest hits album being released on the same day as his arrest and sarcastically saying, [...] "Like the sheriff and I really are into that kind of music".

Club gave the episode a mixed review, stating that the case-of-the-week was an oversimplification of the overall themes of Veronica Mars. The reviewer enjoyed the potential for Logan and Dick’s character development, although he felt that it was blunted by the knowledge that the series was about to end. “As fun as this episode is, the lack of the fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it.

Earlier that year, a Granada Television documentary, called Living with Michael Jackson, showed the pop star holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with Arvizo. Jackson denied these allegations, saying that the sleepovers were in no way sexual in nature. Sneddon again led the effort to prosecute Jackson. These prosecutions led to complaints that Sneddon was motivated by a [...] "vendetta" [...] against Jackson.
