500|$|Producer Wayne Young {{said his}} passion for the {{environment}} was his motivation for making the film, saying the film was [...] "blatantly environmental, although we {{have gone to a}} lot of trouble to avoid preaching. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> it to be viewed as entertainment." [...] The inspiration for FernGully came from stories written by his former wife, Diana Young. Diana first wrote the story of FernGully 15 years before the film's release. Wayne said the couple planned a film adaptation for five years, then spent [...] "seven years of dreaming and hustling, followed by another three years of production". Wayne stated their dream was not possible until the success of Walt Disney Feature Animation's 1989 film The Little Mermaid, which brought popularity back to animation. Hand drawn scenes in the film were complimented by computer animation, which was used to create elements such as flocks of birds that would have taken much longer to animate traditionally. Kroyer states 40,000 frames of computer animation were used in the film, and that the use of such animation halved the production time. Most of the film's $24 million budget was spent on the animation and the soundtrack.|$|E

2500|$|Welcome to DisneySea! Here {{you will}} {{experience}} a thrilling {{journey through the}} mysteries, challenges and natural wonders of the sea. Among the highlights of your trip will be an intimate encounter with our plant's most important environmental resource {{and the chance to}} participate in exciting research activities conducted by some of the world's leading oceanic scientists.For millions of Southern California residents and visitors, this fantastic voyage may become a reality based on the conceptual master plan {{for one of the most}} innovative theme parks ever conceived by The Walt Disney Company. According to its designers, the goal of DisneySea is to enable everyone to experience the [...] "marvels of nature's secret world beneath the sea" [...] and to gain firsthand experience of how the oceans affect human life as well as the life of the planet.Walt Disney Imagineering, the creative, design, production and project management subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company responsible for the creation of Disney theme parks and their attractions, ahs been charged to develop DisneySea. Its vision for Long Beach is a singular blend of entertainment and education through Disney-style rides and attractions, marine research facilities, an oceanarium and other aquatic adventures."Our goal is to sensitize millions of visitors each year to the enormous challenges and opportunities of our seas — our most precious resource — in a setting that encourages play and fantasy," [...] said David Malmuth, project director and vice president with Disney Development Company. [...] "Basically, we want people to have fun. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>want</b> our guests to directly experience the sea, to wonder about it, to ask questions and to have a memorable time."OceanaThe architectural centerpiece of DisneySea, Oceana would also serve as one of the main educational components of the park. Within this oceanarium, guests will experience true-to-life recreations of marine habitats and ecological systems from around the globe. Visitors will be able to touch, smell, feel and hear the world of water. Overhead walkways and underwater portholes would provide both bird's-eye and crab's-eye views.In Oceana, interactive displays and hands-on participation will encourage children and adults to learn about the ocean in ways that are fun, challenging, and informative. For example, guests can see for themselves how gills work, how fish communicate, and how coral build their fragile, complex reefs. Through special lenses, they may see through the eyes of an octopus, a lobster, a penguin, and a whale. A variety of demonstrations and experiments will be specially created to educate as well as entertain.Future Research CenterSet at the edge of DisneySea, the Future Research Center will be a state-of-the-art research laboratory where guests could interact with some of the nation's top marine scientists conducting oceanographic research.Southern Californians active in marine science will be invited to serve on an advisory board to direct the initial mission statement of the Center.Through an ongoing dialogue with the local scientific community and nearby universities, joint research programs will offer students of all ages a rare opportunity for hands-on exploration.Guests will be able to visit the heart of this functioning sea laboratory, observing scientists at work. Watching these experts, visitors can glimpse the future of man's involvement with the seas and probe deeper into man's relationship with the environment. For the more light-hearted adventurers, the Center will include a simulator adventure that will give guests a glimpse of the drama — and danger — faced by real explorers of the deep.Interactive Programs for Students of all AgesIn addition to Oceana and the Future Research Center, DisneySea will offer more formal on-site educational programs. A variety of full and half-day programs will be designed to help teachers in their efforts to share the wonder of the ocean with students. Programs may include special field trips featuring multi-media presentations, tours and lectures for the Los Angeles and Orange County area schools.Ocean Outreach CenterSimilar to the Teacher's Center in Walt Disney World's Epcot Center, an Ocean Outreach Center is envisioned to assist visitors in their quest for more information about the ocean. Serving as a library of the sea, the Outreach Center will offer computer terminals, reading rooms and research files designed to meet the need of guests, staff scientists, teachers and students.Attractions Capture Spirit of the SeaWhile plans for DisneySea are still evolving, Walt Disney Imagineering is planning attractions for visitors to enjoy the spirit of the sea with fun as the common denominator. For example, on the exotic beaches of Venture Reefs, guests will enjoy scenic beach vistas from the Caribbean, Polynesian, and the Pacific. They'll be entertained and invited to dine, shop, and take a dip in the ocean, where they'll find sunken ships and marine life [...] "under the sea."Fleets of Fantasy, adventurous attractions themed to storybook seafaring, would recapture the spirit and whimsy of turn-of-the-century amusement park rides. Mysterious Island and Hero's Harbor would feature [...] "high seas" [...] thrill rides incorporating thousands of years of mythic folklore relating to the ocean.At the rim of the American continent and the Pacific Ocean, DisneySea will offer a unique entertainment experience — and a site of magic and wonder.}}}} ...|$|E
