And I think we showed too much. I think maybe <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E

25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

Drummer Jon Coghill told The Sydney Morning Herald [...] "we wanted to have more fun and enjoy that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> band, rather than chase what you're supposed to do", and guitarist Ian Haug said [...] "We all found that this is really important to us, but we wanted to make it more fun".|$|E

To many older homosexuals and {{many members of the}} Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. Randy Wicker, who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the [...] "screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap."

Though he was against that war, he disagreed with the tactics of the student protest movement, thinking it silly and juvenile to take anger at the war out on a private university.

500|$|According to Rolling Stone, Marquee Moon was a post-punk album, while Jason Heller from The A.V. Club {{described}} it as [...] "elegantly jagged" [...] art punk. Robert Christgau regarded it {{as more of a}} rock record because of Television's formal and technical abilities as musicians: [...] "It wasn't punk. Its intensity wasn't manic; it didn't come in spurts." [...] Both sides of the album began with three shorter, hook-driven songs, which Stylus Magazines Evan Chakroff said veered between progressive rock and post-punk styles. The title track and [...] "Torn Curtain" [...] were longer and more jam-oriented. [...] "As peculiar as it sounds, I've always thought that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> pop band", Verlaine later told Select.

500|$|After her appointment, Cooney hired Bob Davidson as her assistant; he was {{responsible}} for making agreements with approximately 180 public television stations to broadcast the new series. She assembled a team of producers: Jon Stone {{was responsible}} for writing, casting, and format; David Connell assumed control of animation and volume production; and Samuel Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team. Stone, Connell, and Gibbon had worked on another children's show, Captain Kangaroo, together. Cooney later said about Sesame Streets original team of producers, [...] "collectively, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> genius". CTW's first children's show, Sesame Street, premiered on 10 November 1969.
