The apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only <b>wants</b> <b>the</b> throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E

Dalma immediately sees destiny in Will, and provides Sparrow with a jar of dirt - Jones can only set foot on land once every 10 years, and since land is where Sparrow is safe, Dalma suggests with the dirt that he takes land with him.|$|E
