2500|$|Renault {{failed to}} fully {{accommodate}} the European-origin cars to U.S. market demands.

The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar also became [...] "very problematic in the mid-1980s" [...] due to the inflation and declining economy in the U.S., compared to French currency.

2500|$|The new model, {{introduced}} {{at a time}} of increased interest in small cars, won several awards including Motor Trend Car of the Year. Motor Trend declared: [...] "The Alliance may well be the best-assembled first-year car we’ve ever seen. Way to go Renault!" [...] The Alliance was listed as number one on Car and Driver's list of Ten Best cars for 1983. The positive reception and sales of 200,000 Alliances by 1984 was hindered by the availability of only two body styles. The Alliance was a European-designed car and not fully suited to U.S. market demands. The distribution network was also not well supported, which led to lower quality delivered by dealerships with [...] "disastrous consequences" [...] for the image of the automobiles, as well as high <b>warranty</b> <b>costs</b> because of quality failings which greatly impacted sales from 1985 to the end of production in 1987. Alliance and Encore production ended in June 1987 while the Renault 9 and 11 models continued through the 1988 model year in Europe, being replaced by the all new Renault 19.|$|E

First, the definition of auto engine warranty supply chain (AEWSC) was explained; then, under two-dimensional renewable free warranty policy, the components of AEWSC cost were analyzed for repairable engines. AEWSC cost covers not only traditional product <b>warranty</b> <b>cost,</b> but also potential cost resulting from re-failed engines; thirdly, an AEWSC Cost model was built based on cost analysis; finally, numeral analysis was developed through using the proposed cost model. The analysis results help engine manufacturer reduce AEWSC cost...|$|R

2500|$|Mazda and NSU {{signed a}} study {{contract}} {{to develop the}} Wankel engine in 1961 and competed to bring the first Wankel-powered automobile to market. Although Mazda produced an experimental Wankel that year, NSU was first with a Wankel automobile for sale, the sporty NSU Spider in 1964; Mazda countered with a display of two- and four-rotor Wankel engines at that year's Tokyo Motor Show. In 1967, NSU began production of a Wankel-engined luxury car, the Ro 80. However, NSU had not produced reliable apex seals on the rotor, unlike Mazda and Curtiss-Wright. NSU had problems with apex seals' wear, poor shaft lubrication, and poor fuel economy, leading to frequent engine failures, not solved until 1972, which led to large <b>warranty</b> <b>costs</b> curtailing further NSU Wankel engine development. This premature release of the new Wankel engine gave a poor reputation for all makes and even when these issues were solved in the last engines produced by NSU {{in the second half}} of the '70s, sales did not recover. Audi, after the takeover of NSU, built in 1979 a new KKM 871 engine with side intake ports and 750 cc per chamber, [...] at 6,500 rpm, and 220 Nm at 3,500 rpm. The engine was installed in an Audi 100 hull named [...] "Audi 200", but was not mass-produced.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about data mining in {{automotive}} warranty analysis, {{with an emphasis}} on modeling the mean cumulative <b>warranty</b> <b>cost</b> or number of claims (per vehicle). In our study, we deal with a type of truncation that is typical for automotive warranty data, where the warranty coverage and the resulting warranty data are limited by age and mileage. Age, as a function of time, is known for all sold vehicles at all time. However, mileage is only observed for a vehicle with at least one claim and only {{at the time of the}} claim. To deal with this problem of incomplete mileage information, we consider a linear approach and a piece-wise linear approach within a nonparametric framework. We explore the univariate case, as well as the bivariate case. For the univariate case, we evaluate the mean cumulative <b>warranty</b> <b>cost</b> and its standard error as a function of age, a function of mileage, and a function of actual (calendar) time. For the bivariate case, we evaluate the mean cumulative <b>warranty</b> <b>cost</b> as a function of age and mileage. The effect of reporting delay of claim and several methods for making prediction are also considered. Throughout this thesis, we illustrate the ideas using examples based on real data...|$|R

After a pitched regulatory battle, the standard was rewritten to {{permit the use of}} reduced-voltage high beam headlamps producing up to 7,000 axial candela, as well as permitting any light color from white to amber or selective yellow. These changes to the regulation permitted automakers to implement a less costly DRL, such as by connecting the high beam filaments in series to supply each filament with half its rated voltage, or by burning the front turn signals full-time except when they are actually flashing as turn indicators.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. All {{multi-component product}} {{manufacturing}} companies face {{the problem of}} <b>warranty</b> <b>cost</b> estimation.

In this paper, we propose an approach, which learns dependency between part-failures and symptoms gleaned from such diverse sources of information, to predict expected number of failures with better accuracy.
