In addition, some designs such as Joanna were released to fine printing use long before they became widely available from Monotype.|$|E

(with a maximum of 250kg.), which <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> to the limit of a sustainable population of 1,250,000 people. As this is the maximum number, the difference between the population of Herodian Israel and other eras in the Second Temple Period, up to the Byzantine period, is left to guess. The proportion of Jews to gentiles is also unknown.|$|E

He completed his diploma within one year and returned to Los Angeles to pursue a rap career. Not sure of whether his rap career <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>out,</b> he would turn to become an architecture draftsman as a career backup.|$|E
25|$|Until 1989 in Scotland and 1990 in England and Wales, local councils {{raised their}} own revenue through a tax known as rates. Every property, whether {{residential}} or commercial, {{was given a}} rateable value which estimated the annual rent it would bring in. In the budgeting process the council <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> the total amount it needed to raise locally, and then divide it by the total rateable value within its boundaries to produce {{the proportion of the}} rateable value that each householder or business would have to pay. This proportion was known as 'the rate' for the year and the process was therefore known as 'setting a rate'.|$|E

25|$|Both {{director}} McTiernan and Schwarzenegger lost 25 pounds {{during the}} film. Schwarzenegger's weight loss {{was a professional}} choice. McTiernan lost the weight because he avoided the food in Mexico due to health concerns. Unlike McTiernan, most of {{the cast and crew}} suffered from traveler's diarrhea since the Mexican hotel in which they were living was having problems with the water purification. In an interview, Carl Weathers said the actors would secretly wake up as early as 3:00a.m. to work out before the day's shooting.

25|$|Aldikacti’s initial {{challenge}} was with GM's corporate structure, which split its engineers into two categories: the car engineers who would create blueprints for the car, and manufacturing engineers who <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> the fabrication and assembly issues. Fiero blueprints traveled {{back and forth}} between the two engineering branches, using up time and money. Aldikacti was forced to sit the two teams of engineers down next to one another, allowing for no excuses to why there was “no build” after his design was done. Many modifications in the Fiero’s production needed to be made; for instance, despite his long-standing interest in manufacturing body panels from plastic, Aldikacti consented to metal body pieces, the dies for which were much less costly.|$|E
25|$|After {{taking over}} from XIII Corps in mid-August, Cavan held {{a meeting with}} the divisional commanders to discuss the next attack, at which it was {{stressed}} that it would take place along all of the Corps front and that supervision from above was not inconsistent with granting initiative to subordinates. The Corps General Officer Commanding Royal Artillery (GOCRA) was to decide the lines of barrages but liaise with divisions, which <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> the details. XIV Corps headquarters was to co-ordinate divisional plans, rather than dictate them, discretion by divisional commanders being retained within the corps plan, especially as command of the artillery reverted to divisions at zero hour. Observation posts were established with provision for telephone, visual and pigeon communication. Guillemont was captured and held, German counter-attacks defeated and the ground consolidated in a rainstorm overnight. Operations against Ginchy from the south and towards Leuze and Bouleaux woods commenced.|$|E

25|$|In November 2014 U.S. President Obama {{expanded}} the original role of U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan for 2015. Originally {{they were supposed}} to advise, train and assist the Afghan Forces and to hunt the remnants of Al Qaeda. Under the president’s order U.S. forces can carry out missions against the Taliban and other militant groups threatening American troops or the Afghan government while American jets, bombers and drones can support Afghan troops on combat missions. By the end of 2015, half of the 9,800 American troops would leave Afghanistan. The rest would be consolidated in Kabul and Bagram, and then leave by the end of 2016, allowing Obama to say he ended the Afghan war before leaving office. The United States could still have military advisers in Kabul after 2016 who <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> of an office of security cooperation at the United States Embassy. But the Obama administration has not said how large that contingent might be and what its exact mission would be.|$|E

500|$|MFP {{funding in}} the 2010-2011 fiscal year totaled $3,308,741,821. That amount divided evenly among 696,444 public school {{students}} in Louisiana <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> to $4,750 per pupil. But some students cost more to educate than others. Rather than increasing the dollar amount, the MFP formula artificially increases {{the number of students}} it funds. This [...] "weighted membership" [...] accounts for special education, gifted and talented and at-risk students. For example, a school receives 2.5 times the amount of funding it would receive for a general population student to educate a special education student.|$|E

500|$|The money Tesla {{made from}} {{licensing}} his AC patents made him independently wealthy {{and gave him}} the time and funds to pursue his own interests.

500|$|While {{preparing}} the acoustic album, Grohl {{decided that he}} would improve it with guest appearances, and made a list of musicians {{that he would like to}} work with, such as Warren Haynes and Grant Hart. The guests that appeared on the record included Norah Jones, John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame, and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. John Paul Jones agreed to appear as he was in Los Angeles for the Grammy Awards, and Grohl described his appearance as the [...] "second-greatest thing to happen to me in my life" [...] behind his marriage. Norah Jones was brought for the bossa nova [...] "Virginia Moon" [...] after Grohl heard her record and considered that his song was [...] "her vibe" [...] and Jones' voice [...] "was so smooth and warm that I figured it <b>would</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> great with mine." [...] The song features Grohl's guitar technician Joe Beebe on lead guitar as he was the only one in the crew with jazz experience. The Wallflowers' keyboard player Rami Jaffee and that dog.'s violinist Petra Haden also contributed to the album, and were later drafted for the Foo Fighters' touring band. After the album was finished, Grohl stated that he hoped that the Foo Fighters were most remembered for this record, describing it as [...] "just the most fucking kick-ass thing we've ever done", and saying that [...] "If someone asked me which Led Zeppelin album to buy, I would tell them Physical Graffiti, because it has such a wide dynamic and it shows the range that band had. And that's what we wanted to do with this album." ...|$|E
