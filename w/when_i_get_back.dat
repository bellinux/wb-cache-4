500|$|Debate over Trescothick's {{place in}} the England squad {{continued}} amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, {{and the rise of}} Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: [...] "Of course I'd love to play for England again.... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to full fitness and I think I am OK and ready to play, I'll make myself available for England." [...] He added that he was [...] "desperate to play for England again" [...] but was waiting until he was [...] "as convinced as I can be that I am ready to take on the challenge of international cricket".|$|E

Gaga {{comes to the}} top of the pillar and sings a combination of [...] "Starstruck" [...] and [...] "LoveGame" [...] as she is joined by her dancers in tracks and jackets and hands Gaga her trademark disco stick. After [...] "LoveGame", she talks a monologue about the year [...] "3009". And says that [...] "The kids came out of New York and shot the paparazzi." [...] followed by saying [...] "It was a thousand years before when the monster first entered the city, vanished for our hearts and for our brains and for our faces (referencing to the three video interludes of the tour)" [...] and [...] "we knew we could co-exist with this monster with our MUSIC!!! With our art and with our fashion. My name is Lady Gaga." [...] and tells the crowd she feels [...] "beautiful and dirty rich" [...] and sang [...] "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich". This leads to the end of the first part wherein a video introduction called [...] "The Brain" [...] starts with Gaga appearing again as Candy Warhol and brushing her hair. After the video ends, Gaga appears on the stage in a black and white leotard with high-pointed [...] "puff" [...] shoulders and lightning shaped symbols, while riding on a similarly colored vespa. She then starts singing [...] "The Fame". This is followed by a speech. Gaga said she's been [...] "travelling the whole world, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back,</b> I can still smell the stench of greed." [...] And then she performs [...] "Money Honey" [...] with the dancers who are wearing backpacks. [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] starts immediately, accompanied by hand-waving and Gaga wore a hat made of toppled dominoes.|$|E

500|$|Hank Williams, {{who heard}} both the Miller and Griffin versions, started {{performing}} the {{song on the}} Louisiana Hayride shortly after joining in August 1948. Horace Logan, the show's producer and programming director for KWKH, reported that the audience [...] "went crazy" [...] the first time Williams performed the song on the show. [...] In light of the live audience's strong positive reaction, Williams decided to record the song. His decision was questioned by his musicians and also his producer, Fred Rose, who felt that the song did not merit a recording. Williams, mindful of the reaction he received live, [...] persisted, and the recording {{took place during the}} final half-hour of a session recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 22, 1948. For this recording, Williams replaced the jazz musicians with a modern country music band, using a rhythm guitar, mandolin, string bass, drums and a steel guitar. [...] Williams' session band was composed of Clyde Baum (mandolin), Zeke Turner (electric guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), Louis Innis (rhythm guitar), Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Willie Thawl (bass). With little time left, Byrd and Turner replicated the musical arrangement they previously used on an Ernest Tubb session for a cover of Jimmie Rodgers' [...] "Waiting for a Train". [...] In the episode of American Masters about Williams, Drifting Cowboy Don Helms recalls, [...] "When they recorded 'Lovesick Blues,' Fred told Hank, 'That song's out of meter! [...] Got too many bars in it. [...] And you hold that note too long.' [...] And Hank said, 'Well, when I find a note I like, I wanna hold on to it as long as I can,' you know, just tryin' to be funny. [...] And Fred said, 'Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. [...] That thing is so much out of meter, I'm gonna get me {{a cup of coffee and}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> maybe ya'll have that thing cut.' [...] And they did, but it was still out of meter. [...] So Fred lived with that the rest of his life." [...] Williams combined Griffin's lyrical arrangement with a two-beat honky-tonk track, borrowing the yodeling and beat drops from Miller's recording. [...] "Lovesick Blues" [...] was recorded in two takes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{trial was}} held in camera, {{and the nature of}} the {{documents}} the accused were supposed to have revealed was never officially made public, giving rise to a plethora of rumors, and to the widespread assumption that the whole trial was a frame-up to get even with Janša and Mladina. In addition, the Army made the decision to hold the trial in the Serbo-Croatian language rather than Slovenian, in spite of provisions in the Slovene republican constitution that all official business in Slovenia should be conducted in the Slovene language. This further outraged Slovenian public opinion, to which the use of the Slovenian language was of great symbolic significance. The four accused were sentenced to between six months' and four years' imprisonment, and handed back to the Slovene authorities, which carried out the sentences in the mildest way possible. Zavrl later related: [...] "I spent my days editing the magazine in my office and my nights in prison.

I must apologize for not writing sooner but I have been very busy. Since coming up here to Dutch Harbor I have received some cigarettes which you sent me. Let me thank you right now for thinking of me. I must admit that I never kept in touch with the Bryant Service Club but I have moved around quite a bit since coming in service. There isn’t much I can tell you about this place for we are subject to censorship. I am going on my forth month up here and it isn’t so bad. We have bowling alleys, gym, and movies up here. Hence we are really living. I write often to my ex roommate Larry Barbeau, he is still in Virginia. I was glad to hear Ben Scuda was found alive. I knew him very well. Often I think of the swell times I had back at Bryant and wished that I was there once again. I think of all the friends I made there and wonder where they are. I have no idea <b>when</b> <b>I</b> will <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to the states again. Most likely not for a long time. We must all have faith and know that victory will soon be ours. Please remember me to the Faculty and to everyone else. I will be anxious to hear form you in the near future. Until we meet again Yours trulyRichard C. Walrath Richard C. Walrath SK 3 /cCo.

6000|$|Beautiful {{and tender}} the letter I just receive from you--and that follows {{by a few}} days an equally beneficent one to my sister. She will (if she hasn't done it already) {{thank you for this}} herself--and tell you how deeply we feel the kindly balm of your {{faithful}} thought of us. Our return here, with my brother so acutely suffering and so all too precipitately (none the less) succumbing altogether--quite against what seemed presumable during our last three weeks in England--was a dreadful time; from the worst darkness of which we are, however, gradually emerging.... What is for the time a great further support is the wondrous beauty of this region, where we are lingering on three or four weeks more (when it becomes too cold in a house built only for summer--in spite of glorious wood-fires;) this season being the finest thing in the American year for weather and colour. The former is golden and the latter, amid these innumerable mountains and great forests and frequent lakes, a magnificence of crimson and orange, a mixture of flames and gems. I shall stay for some months (I mean {{on this side of the}} sea;) and yet I am so homesick that I seem to feel that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> do <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to dear little old England, I shall never in my life leave it again. We cling to each other, all of us here, meanwhile, and I can never be sufficiently grateful to my fate for my having been with my dearest brother for so many weeks before his death and up to the bitter end. I am better and better than three months ago, thank heaven, in spite of everything, and really believe I shall end by being better than I have been at all these last years, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was spoiling for my illness.

I got my letter yesterday, in the morning. Some inner warning troubled me, and I went down on the sea-shore by myself before I broke the seal. Do you believe the dead {{can come back to}} the world they once lived in?

I struggled against myself, as he would have had me struggle. I tried to be all that was most repellent to my own gentler nature; I tried to think pitilessly of putting the mountains and the seas between me and the man who bore my name. Hours passed before I could prevail on myself to go back and run the risk of meeting Allan Armadale in this house. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> did <b>get</b> <b>back,</b> and <b>when</b> he met me at night on the stairs, I thought I was looking him in the face as my father looked his father in the face when the cabin door closed between them. Draw your own conclusions, sir. Say, if you like, that the inheritance of my father's heathen belief in fate is one of the inheritances he has left to me. I won't dispute it; I won't deny that all through yesterday his superstition was my superstition. The night came before I could find my way to calmer and brighter thoughts. But I did find my way.

What a dream I had. All about Jackie 2 ̆ 6 the fellow {{she was married to}} {{and the rest of the}} models. There was so much {{confusion}} about getting to that wedding.

Golly, honey, it seems as though everyone should know by now that we’re getting engaged. Corinne is saying how wonderful Dick is.
