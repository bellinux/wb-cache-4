5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} on March 15, 44 BC. The {{assassination}} {{was led by}} Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the assassination. Many <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms {{in favor of the}} landless classes. Virtually all the conspirators fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation. The civil war that followed destroyed {{what was left of the}} Republic.|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} the {{tradition}} of the Sociedad to elect the First Lady of Argentina as president of the charity. But the ladies of the Sociedad did not approve of Eva Perón's impoverished background, lack of formal education, and former career as an actress. Fraser and Navarro write that the ladies of the Sociedad <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> Evita would set a bad example for the orphans, therefore the society ladies did not extend to Evita the position of president of their organization. It has often been said that Evita had the government funding for the Sociedad cut off in retaliation. Fraser and Navarro suggest that this version of events is in dispute, but that the government funding that had previously supported the Sociedad now went to support Evita's own foundation. The Fundación María Eva Duarte de Perón was created on 8 July 1948. It was later renamed to, simply, the Eva Perón Foundation. Its funding began with 10,000 pesos provided by Evita herself.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} day of the oral {{examinations}} in May 1943, Bloeme's non-Jewish boyfriend warned her that the Germans were looking for her. She asked the school board to administer all 12 of her examinations at once, and she received her high school diploma that same day. When the Germans arrived, they took her to an assembly point for Amsterdam Jews, but she managed to enter the building without being registered. A few days later, she sneaked out with a group of younger teens. At first she hid in the home of Christian friends of her parents who worked in the Dutch underground, but they <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> if they were arrested, Bloeme would be, too. She spent the next year hiding in 15 to 16 different places, including an Amsterdam old-age home and a job as a maid for a widow and her son in Rotterdam. When she returned to the people who worked in the underground, she was arrested and sent to Westerbork.|$|E
5|$|Frederick II, {{ruler of}} the Holy Roman Empire in the 13th century, {{realised}} that his dynasty was losing its power and granted freedoms to many cities {{in order to keep}} their allegiance. These cities became Free imperial cities and Sélestat became one of them in 1217. Under the new status Sélestat was able to build city walls and collect taxes on its own. Its serfs and settlers were freed. The German monarch Adolf of Nassau granted Sélestat a constitution in 1292. It was amended many times but it regulated local politics until 1789. Although the new status favoured trade and prosperity, free cities in Alsace <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> they would not be defended by imperial forces if a conflict was to occur. So they decided to form an alliance called the Decapolis in 1354, which comprised ten cities: (Haguenau, Colmar, Wissembourg, Turckheim, Obernai, Kaysersberg, Rosheim, Munster, Sélestat and Mulhouse). The seat of the alliance was in Haguenau but its archives were kept in Sélestat. Because the town was the most centrally located, it often hosted meetings of the association.|$|E
5|$|On December 16, 1945, Arévalo was {{incapacitated}} for a {{while after}} a car accident. The leaders of the Revolutionary Action Party (PAR), which was the party that supported the government, <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> Arana would {{take the opportunity to}} launch a coup and so struck a deal with him, which later {{came to be known as}} the Pacto del Barranco (Pact of the Ravine). Under the terms of this pact, Arana agreed to refrain from seizing power with the military; in return, the PAR agreed to support Arana's candidacy in the next presidential election, scheduled for November 1950. Arévalo himself recovered swiftly, but was forced to support the agreement. However, by 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana due to his lack of support for labor rights. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana. In 1947 Arana had demanded that certain labor leaders be expelled from the country; Árbenz vocally disagreed with Arana, and the former's intervention limited the number of deportees.|$|E

5|$|In late 1558, Calvin {{became ill}} with a fever. Since {{he was afraid}} that he might die before {{completing}} the final revision of the Institutes, he forced himself to work. The final edition was greatly expanded to the extent that Calvin referred to it as a new work. The expansion from the 21 chapters of the previous edition to 80 was due to the extended treatment of existing material rather than the addition of new topics. Shortly after he recovered, he strained his voice while preaching, which brought on a violent fit of coughing. He burst a blood-vessel in his lungs, and his health steadily declined. He preached his final sermon in St. Pierre on 6February 1564. On 25April, he made his will, in which he left small sums to his family and to the collège. A few days later, the ministers of the church came to visit him, and he bade his final farewell, which was recorded in Discours d'adieu aux ministres. He recounted his life in Geneva, sometimes recalling bitterly some of the hardships he had suffered. Calvin died on 27May 1564 aged 54. At first his body lay in state, but since so many people came to see it, the reformers <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> they would be accused of fostering a new saint's cult. On the following day, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cimetière des Rois. The exact location of the grave is unknown; a stone was added in the 19th century to mark a grave traditionally thought to be Calvin's.|$|E

According to Luke's account, Satan entered Judas at this time.|$|E

Instead, the afflicted were ostracised from their community due to ignorance about the disease, as people <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> it was contagious.|$|E

They were brought up in Golders Green and she was educated at South Hampstead High School, and completed her A-levels at Westminster School.
