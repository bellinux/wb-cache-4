5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Keyser Creek {{was a clear}} stream until it reached the repair shops of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. At this point, it {{received}} some oil and refuse. At the Capouse Shaft, the creek washed an ash bank and a culm bank and was contaminated with some sulfur. More dirty <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> drained into the creek at the Archbald Colliery and a fertilizer plant also discharged waste into it.|$|E

25|$|The Nuclear Assisted Hydrocarbon Production Method, Canadian patent {{application}} 2,659,302, {{is a method}} for the temporary or permanent storage of nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> comprising the placing of <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> into one or more repositories or boreholes constructed into an unconventional oil formation. The thermal flux of the <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> fracture the formation and alters the chemical and/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material within the subterranean formation to allow removal of the altered material. A mixture of hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and/or other formation fluids is produced from the formation. The radioactivity of high-level radioactive waste affords proliferation resistance to plutonium placed in {{the periphery of the}} repository or the deepest portion of a borehole.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{functions}} of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients from <b>waste</b> <b>material</b> and recycle it. As the <b>waste</b> <b>material</b> exits the small intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum {{and then to the}} ascending colon where this process of extraction starts. The unwanted <b>waste</b> <b>material</b> is moved upwards toward the transverse colon by the action of peristalsis.|$|R
50|$|Much of the {{efficiency}} of this process {{has to do with}} how much <b>waste</b> <b>material</b> can be mixed with glass formers. Industrial-scale melts have shown that a stable glass compound is formed even when the original melt mixture is up to 33-40% <b>waste</b> <b>material</b> by weight, {{depending on the type of}} waste.|$|R

50|$|By 1955, the Reserve Mining Company complex {{was built}} to extract iron from taconite. A new town, Silver Bay, was {{constructed}} to support it. For every ton of iron ore produced, however, two tons of <b>waste</b> <b>material</b> was left over. The Reserve Mining Company dumped the <b>waste</b> <b>material,</b> called tailings, into Lake Superior. Permits to do this were approved by the state.|$|R

25|$|Recycle: any {{recovery}} operation by which <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether {{for the original}} or other purposes. It includes composting {{and it does not}} include incineration.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{recovery}} from waste is {{the conversion of}} non-recyclable <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> into usable heat, electricity, or fuel {{through a variety of}} processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and landfill gas recovery. This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy {{recovery from}} waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills. Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.|$|E
25|$|To {{help protect}} the {{environment}} during construction of the tunnel a Quality Management Plan was set in place. This plan ensured all <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> were disposed of according to government regulations. Disposal techniques were also monitored for compliance.|$|E

25|$|Biogas is methane {{produced}} {{by the process of}} anaerobic digestion of organic material by anaerobes. It can be produced either from biodegradable <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> or by the use of energy crops fed into anaerobic digesters to supplement gas yields. The solid byproduct, digestate, {{can be used as a}} biofuel or a fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|For some <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> such as plastic, recent {{technical}} devices called recyclebots {{enable a}} form of distributed recycling. Preliminary life-cycle analysis (LCA) indicates that such distributed recycling of HDPE to make filament of 3-D printers in rural regions is energetically favorable to either using virgin resin or conventional recycling processes because of reductions in transportation energy.|$|E
40|$|The {{landmark}} {{record of}} decision in January 2000 by the US Department of Energy stated that at least 17 tons of surplus weapons plutonium will be converted to a mineral <b>waste</b> <b>material</b> and disposed of in a geological repository similar to the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site in Nevada. The need for fundamental thermodynamic properties (e. g., entropy, enthalpy and free energy of formation) of specific actinide-bearing mineral phases, related non-actinide phases, and potential decomposition phases is vital to <b>waste</b> <b>material</b> formulation, fabrication process optimization, environmental modeling, and licensing a proposed mineral <b>waste</b> <b>material.</b> Two and one half years ago we began a study designed to obtain the first measured values for the formation energetics of phases related to the disposal of this surplus weapons plutonium...|$|R

25|$|Incineration {{is a waste}} {{treatment}} process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in <b>waste</b> <b>materials.</b> This method also burns any organism to ash. It is used to sterilize medical and other biohazardous waste before it is discarded with non-hazardous waste. Bacteria incinerators are mini furnaces used to incinerate and kill off any micro organisms that may be on an inoculating loop or wire.|$|E
25|$|Incineration {{is carried}} out both {{on a small scale}} by {{individuals}} and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> (such as biological medical waste). Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous pollutants.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} gas masks of World War I, it was {{initially}} found that wood charcoal {{was a good}} absorbent of poison gases. Around 1918, {{it was found that}} charcoals made from the shells and seeds of various fruits and nuts such as coconuts, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, and peach stones performed much better than wood charcoal. These <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> were collected from the public in recycling programs to assist the war effort.|$|E

The technology, developed by and licensed from Arkenol Fuels in Orange County, California, reduces <b>waste</b> <b>material</b> to minuscule dimensions, where it is combined with sulfuric acid. This releases lignin structures within the biomass, where the sugar and acid are separated. The sugar goes into a yeast-fermenting process that results in its conversion to ethanol.|$|R

25|$|A {{landfill}} site (also {{known as a}} tip, dump, rubbish dump, garbage dump or dumping ground and historically as a midden) is a site for the disposal of <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> by burial and the oldest form of waste treatment (although the burial part is modern; historically, refuse was just left in piles or thrown into pits). Historically, landfills {{have been the most}} common method of organized waste disposal and remain so in many places around the world.|$|E
25|$|Although many {{government}} programs are concentrated on recycling at home, 64% of {{waste in the}} United Kingdom is generated by industry. The focus of many recycling programs done by industry is the cost‚Äìeffectiveness of recycling. The ubiquitous nature of cardboard packaging makes cardboard a commonly recycled waste product by companies that deal heavily in packaged goods, like retail stores, warehouses, and distributors of goods. Other industries deal in niche or specialized products, depending {{on the nature of}} the <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> that are present.|$|E
25|$|Now {{the city}} had to react to this revelation. Later the same year, the real {{property}} committee of the city forbade the disposal of waste oil and other hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>materials</b> at the dumping ground, but later, due to financial considerations, it had to allow {{the use of the}} site as the dumping ground of the Helsinki City Gas Works. The gas works was given special permission to continue to take its waste to the dumping ground, provided that it first neutralized the sulphuric acid waste with calcium oxide.|$|E
