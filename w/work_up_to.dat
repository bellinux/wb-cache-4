5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{followed}} the musical ideals espoused by The Five. He employed Orthodox liturgical {{themes in the}} Russian Easter Festival Overture, folk song in Capriccio Espagnol and orientalism in Scheherazade, possibly his best known work. He proved a prolific composer but also a perpetually self-critical one. He revised every orchestral <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> and including his Third Symphony—some, like Antar and Sadko, more than once. These revisions range from minor changes of tempo, phrasing and instrumental detail to wholesale transposition and complete recomposition.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. At a later time he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and the International Atomic Energy Agency.|$|E

25|$|The 18th century saw the {{creation}} of an associated school, now referred to as the Paris Opera Ballet School (French: École de Danse de l’Opéra de Paris), which opened in 1713. The operas of Rameau, and later Gluck, raised standards for the dancers. Jean-Georges Noverre was a particularly influential ballet master from 1776 to 1781. He created the ballet Les petits riens in 1778 on Mozart's music. Maximilien Gardel was ballet master from 1781, with his brother Pierre Gardel taking over after Maximilien's death in 1787. Pierre Gardel survived the Revolution creating ballets such as La Marseillaise and Offrande à la Liberté. He remained the ballet master until 1820 and continued to <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1829.|$|E
25|$|The {{parents of}} a Nova {{employee}} who committed suicide in 2004 filed a suit against the company on 31 August 2007.

During that period Nova was engaged in a rapid expansion meant {{to increase the number of}} Nova branches by 300 in an attempt to reach a total of 1,000. The parents' suit alleges that their son was required by Nova to <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 80 hours of overtime in one month, and even through the night on seven occasions, despite his inexperience. At one point he had requested to be relieved but was persuaded to stay, which eventually led to overwhelming stress shortly before his suicide.|$|E

In 2006, Negron {{was a member of}} the 53rd crew of the Spaceward Bound program at the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah. The program is {{designed}} to train astronauts to travel to travel to the moon between 2018 and 2020. The program also serves to train astronauts for the exploration of the planet Mars in future missions. She had to spend two weeks (15 days) in an environment in Utah which NASA scientists believe to be similar to that of Mars and <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 15 hours a day. Negron is also an educator and author who in 2015, began to conduct research on digital simulation with virtual reality.|$|E

25|$|The {{hand loom}} with the witch {{is typical of}} many {{that were used in}} the mills by cloth {{designers}} to develop new fabric designs and patterns. They are still used in the textile departments of universities and colleges for training students in weaving and the designing of fabrics. The shafts are lifted by a witch, an early form of dobby, with weights underneath to pull the shafts down, and can <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 50 shafts to produce very complicated patterns. The weft is put in by hand using the flying shuttle method invented in 1733 by John Kay, and up to four colours can be woven in the weft using Robert Kay's (son of John Kay) 1760 invention of the multiple shuttle box. On this simple-to-operate loom the designer is able to explore the application of new design ideas before beginning production trials on a wider loom. Many of the designs for woven fabrics made today were developed and created long ago on similar narrow-width pattern looms.|$|E

Publishers Jonathan Cape included many of the reviews on their advertisements for the book, which appeared in a number of national newspapers; the reviews included those from The Sunday Times, which concluded that Fleming was [...] "the best new English thriller-writer since [...] Ambler" [...] and The Observer, which advised their readers: [...] "don't miss this".|$|E

However, Band Baaja Baaraat earned positive reviews and emerged a sleeper hit. The film grossed approximately 214.4million after five weeks, making it a moderate box office success. Sharma's performance was praised by critics, many of whom cited it as her best <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> date. Film critic Anupama Chopra praised Sharma and said that she [...] "comes into her own as the ambitious Delhi girl, who dreams of upgrading to multi-crore Sainik Farms weddings".

500|$|Objects {{that are}} smaller than the katamari will stick to it when the player comes into contact with them, while greater objects can be hurdles; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari, slowing the player's progress. The game uses size, weight, and surface area to {{determine}} if an object will stick to the katamari. [...] This allows slender objects, such as pencils, that are longer than the katamari is wide, to be picked up, and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up. [...] Animals such as cats will chase the katamari, knocking things from it, but once the katamari is great enough, it will scare the animals away, {{and they can be}} rolled up once they are chased down. As objects stick to the katamari, the katamari will grow, eventually allowing objects that were once hurdles to be picked up, and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked. [...] In this manner, the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants, and slowly <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the point where the katamari is picking up buildings, mountains, and clouds.|$|E
500|$|Adamant then fought {{as part of}} Duncan's fleet at the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October 1797. The {{battle was}} a decisive victory for the British over the Dutch, led by Admiral Jan Willem de Winter, with Adamant {{escaping}} sustaining any casualties. Adamant was then attached to Sir Richard Strachan's squadron patrolling off Le Havre, after which she and Hotham were sent with a convoy to the Cape of Good Hope in October 1798. While operating in the Indian Ocean Adamant and the 74-gun , under Captain John Osborn, encountered the French commerce raider Preneuse, under Captain Jean-Marthe-Adrien l'Hermite off Port Louis, Île de France on 11 December 1799. In the ensuing Battle of Port Louis they chased her, forcing her to run ashore three miles from Port Louis, {{under the cover of}} French shore batteries. Hotham took Adamant in close, and tried to <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the grounded frigate, coming under heavy fire from the batteries and the Preneuse as he did so. After a period of exchanging fire, the Adamant forced the French frigate to strike, and that evening three boats carrying men from Adamant and Tremendous approached with orders to destroy the French vessel. Despite coming under heavy fire from the batteries, they boarded the ship, captured the remaining French crew, including Captain l'Hermite, and removed as much of their captives' private property as they could. They then set fire to the Preneuse and returned to their ships without the loss of a single man.|$|E

500|$|The Kurt–Blaine storyline was {{met with}} general acclaim from critics. In her review for the episode, Katie Morgan of Billboard reacted {{positively}} to the interaction between Kurt and Blaine. She wrote, [...] "It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to finally see Kurt happy." [...] In his review, Mark Perigard opined, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold {{the hell out of}} the moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery." [...] Robert Canning was more critical on the storyline. He highly criticized Darren Criss' performance as Blaine. In a detailed review regarding the storyline, Canning wrote, [...] "Kurt finally got the first kiss he deserved. Too bad it came from the wooden, glass-eyed Blaine. Chris Colfer has been in the running for performance awards for good reason. Darren Criss will not be. Colfer and his character deserve better than the cardboard, unemotional declaration of love that Criss delivered. Yay for Kurt and his first boyfriend, but that was a bland <b>work</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> their kiss." [...] Sandra Gonzalez called the whole development [...] "simply perfect". Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet", and stated that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. James Poniewozik reacted positively to the storyline. In his review, Poniewozik wrote, [...] "As for the at-long-last kiss, it's to Glees credit that it made me think, ‘Finally, Blaine and Kurt are locking lips already!’ before it made me think, ‘Look, an honest-to-God gay kiss, between two men, on my primetime TV show!’" [...] Aly Semigran of MTV praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, saying that the kiss scene was a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". Semigran went on to praise the acting in the scene, saying that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty". Brett Berk deemed the interaction to be [...] "appropriately fervid".|$|E
