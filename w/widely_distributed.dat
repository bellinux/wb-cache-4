5|$|Terphenylquinones are {{chemical}} compounds that are <b>widely</b> <b>distributed</b> among the Basidiomycetes division of fungi. Ascocoryne sarcoides {{has been shown}} to contain a terphenylquinone named ascocorynin—a chemical derivative of the compound benzoquinone. This pigment, when in alkaline solution, turns a dark violet, similar in color to the fruit bodies of the fungus. Ascocorynin has moderate antibiotic activity, and was shown in laboratory tests to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria, including the <b>widely</b> <b>distributed</b> food spoilage organism Bacillus stearothermophilus; however, it has no effect on the growth on Gram-negative bacteria, nor does it have any anti-fungal activity.|$|E

50|$|As digital {{technologies}} and digital electronic networks {{in some countries}} became very popular, it was very easy to reproduce and <b>widely</b> <b>distribute</b> some information goods. However, due {{to the difficulty of}} controlling the copying and distributing activities of people using such technologies, it is often harder for the producer of such goods to prevent illegal distribution of proprietary works. This operates on the principle of economic excludability.|$|R
5|$|Although lithium is <b>widely</b> <b>distributed</b> on Earth, it {{does not}} {{naturally}} occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity. The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm), or 25 micromolar; higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near hydrothermal vents.|$|E

The largest recorded population was 5.5 birds per hectare or 2.2 per acre at Palmerston in the Northern Territory. The peak abundance of the species in the mangroves around Darwin Harbour during the mid-dry and early wet season coincided with the production of young and the flowering of the yellow mangrove (Ceriops australis).|$|E

A temperate species, it is <b>widely</b> <b>distributed</b> in North America, where it grows on the ground on road sides, in pastures, grassy areas, and open woods. There are few well-documented occurrences of B.pila outside North America. B.pila closely resembles the European B.nigrescens, from which it can be reliably distinguished only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Collectively, Hygrophoropsis is a {{widespread}} genus, found in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is the most <b>widely</b> <b>distributed</b> species, found on several continents. The other species are not well-known and have more limited ranges. Fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, and peat, and on woodchips. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus, and causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. Some species may be facultatively mycorrhizal.|$|E

At least 268 metabolites from Alternaria fungi {{have been reported}} in the past few decades. They mainly include nitrogen-containing metabolites, steroids, terpenoids, pyranones, quinones, and phenolics. This review aims to briefly summarize the structurally different metabolites produced by Alternaria fungi, as well as their occurrences, biological activities and functions. Some considerations related to synthesis, biosynthesis, production and applications of the metabolites from Alternaria fungi are also discussed...|$|R

In April 2006, the OpenStreetMap Foundation was established to encourage the growth, development and distribution of free geospatial data and provide geospatial data for anybody to use and share. In December 2006, Yahoo! confirmed that OpenStreetMap could use its aerial photography as a backdrop for map production.|$|R
