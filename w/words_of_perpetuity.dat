50|$|A {{perpetuity}} is an annuity {{in which}} the periodic payments begin on a fixed date and continue indefinitely. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} a perpetual annuity. Fixed coupon payments on permanently invested (irredeemable) sums of money are prime examples <b>of</b> <b>perpetuities.</b> Scholarships paid perpetually from an endowment fit the definition <b>of</b> <b>perpetuity.</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{infinite}} convergent sum {{of independent}} and identically distributed random variables discounted by a multiplicative random walk is called <b>perpetuity,</b> because <b>of</b> a possible actuarial application.

Our results complement those of Denisov and Zwart [J. Appl. Probab. 44 (2007), 1031 [...] 1046].

40|$|We {{examine the}} proper {{valuation}} <b>of</b> <b>perpetuities</b> without real growth. The {{case of a}} “pure” non growing perpetuity (zero real growth and zero inflation) is of academic interest but in practice it might be difficult to find. The findings contradict what is generally accepted in the literature. In particular we examine the textbook formula for calculating the value <b>of</b> a <b>perpetuity.</b> When working with perpetuities we are in presence of a Chinese box: {{we have found that}} when working with perpetuities in a scenario of non zero inflation and zero real growth value increases with inflation. On the other hand, the textbook formula for calculating a non growing perpetuity in the same scenario under values the value <b>of</b> the <b>perpetuity</b> by relevant amounts. ...|$|R

50|$|Instances <b>of</b> <b>perpetuities</b> are the {{dividends}} {{upon the}} public stocks in England, France {{and some other}} countries. Thus, although it is usual to speak of £100 consols, the reality is the yearly dividend which the government pays by quarterly instalments. The practice of the French in this is arguably more logical. In speaking of their public funds (rentes) they do not mention the ideal capital sum, but speak of the annuity or annual payment that is received by the public creditor. Other instances <b>of</b> <b>perpetuities</b> are the incomes derived from the debenture stocks of railway companies, also the feu-duties commonly payable on house property in Scotland. The number of years' purchase which the perpetual annuities granted by a government or a railway company realize in the open market, forms a very simple test of the credit of the various governments or railways.|$|R

For those who thought that the controversy was over have actually followed the views of majority concerning the irrevocability, <b>perpetuity</b> and inalienability <b>of</b> the object of waqf.

This paper attempts to rethink the concept <b>of</b> waqf <b>perpetuity</b> and inalienability, and proposes to replace the <b>perpetuity</b> <b>of</b> the physical being of the object with that of dedication by assigning a value to the dedication which is then safeguarded and invested.
