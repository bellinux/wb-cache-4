500|$|There {{were also}} a few {{positive}} reviews. One such review came from Fraser McAlpine of BBC, who opened, [...] "It's {{one of the fundamental}} laws of pop, anything which tips a nod to 'You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)' by Dead Or Alive is going to be worth a listen." [...] He continued, [...] "Even though this is just a song written {{from the perspective of a}} randy man watching a pole-dancer and bragging about how much money he has [...] in a manner which would make Akon blush, there's just something kind of cute about the whole thing." [...] McAlpine attributed this to the song's [...] "Tigger-beat", explaining, [...] "How can anything too sordid be going on when everyone is bouncing around like they're on spacehoppers?" [...] Bill Lamb of About.com commented, [...] "You will hear echoes of another pop classic, but the new song stands on its own feet." [...] However, he noted that while pop music fans <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>it,</b> hip hop listeners would likely dismiss it, and he added that [...] "t's not groundbreaking by any means".|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Kirk Honeycutt called Speed Racers {{visual effects}} [...] "stellar", but stated it [...] "proudly denies entry into its ultra-bright world {{to all but}} gamers, fanboys and anime enthusiasts". He criticized that story and {{character}} were [...] "tossed aside" [...] towards the [...] "wearying" [...] races. Todd McCarthy of Variety noted the target audience should be amused, but others might think the film [...] "a cinematic pile-up", citing its implausibility {{and the lack of}} identifiable peril in the driving sequences. While noted viewers interested in CGI <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>it,</b> McCarthy said the frame sometimes resembled [...] "a kindergartner's art class collage". He had praise for the cinematography, the musical score, and the cast. Anime News Network's Zac Bertschy also praised the cast, while saying the story is [...] "as anyone would expect", adding [...] "the characters are all cardboard archetypes with Saturday Morning dialogue." [...] Speed Racer [...] "sets out to honor and refresh a youthful enthusiasm from the past and winds up smothering the fun in self-conscious grandiosity", declared The New York Times A. O. Scott.|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria {{received}} mixed reviews. Vince Broady, {{executive editor}} of Multimedia World, said Sierra was smart to try to capture the adult market, which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as The 7th Guest. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle declared it the best game of the year, calling it a [...] "masterwork" [...] and [...] "as close as it gets to a film you control", although he said not everyone <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>it</b> due to its violent content. Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ and called it [...] "one of the surest signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies". The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists, but also some [...] "horrific touches (that) seem a bit derivative, such as a Freddy Krueger-like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed". Kim McDaniel of The Salt Lake Tribune called it [...] "the most sophisticated computer game to date" [...] and [...] "a weird, wild, horrific ride {{that will make you}} jump at every turn, even if you aren't normally faint-of-heart". Although McDaniel said it might be easy for experienced gamers, she appreciated that it was more accessible for casual gamers than difficult games like The 7th Guest.|$|E

40|$|We propose herein a {{new method}} of DNA distribution, whereby DNA clones or PCR {{products}} are printed {{directly onto the}} pages of books and delivered to users along with relevant scientific information. DNA sheets, comprising water-soluble paper onto which DNA is spotted, can be bound into books. Readers can easily extract the DNA fragments from DNA sheets and amplify them using PCR. We show that DNA sheets can withstand various conditions that may be experienced during bookbinding and delivery, such as high temperatures and humidity. Almost all genes (95 %– 100 % of randomly selected RIKEN mouse cDNA clones) were recovered successfully by use of PCR. Readers can start their experiments after a 2 -h PCR amplification without waiting for the delivery of DNA clones. The DNA Book thus provides a novel method for delivering DNA in a timely and cost-effective manner. A sample DNA sheet (carrying RIKEN mouse cDNA clones encoding genes of enzymes for the TCA cycle) is included in this issue for field-testing. We <b>would</b> greatly <b>appreciate</b> <b>it</b> if readers could attempt to extract DNA and report the results and whether the DNA sheet was shipped to readers in good condition...|$|R
