40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the impact of successive exclusion of degrees-of-freedom within digits (thumb and index finger) <b>and</b> <b>wrist</b> when performing tasks demanding varying degrees of end effector kinematic complexity. The analysis was performed by successive constraining articulations in the fingers (thumb <b>and</b> index) <b>and</b> <b>wrists</b> or human subjects via splints, and then timing performance of part movement, positioning, and assembly operations requiring different levels of kinematic freedom. Analysis of performance times showed that transferring degrees-of-freedom, or articulations, from the digits to the <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> arm had little or no material affect upon manipulation performance times if <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> arm kinematics were unrestricted. If <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> arm kinematics are not constrained and are of high-quality, our findings show that transferring kinematic freedom from the digits to the <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> arms or remote end effectors offers limited or no consequence in terms of remote assembly operations. The importance of such findings, in terms of development and implementation of commercially attractive telemanipulators, is discussed...|$|R

The metatarsal-phalangeal joint {{at the base}} of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, <b>wrists</b> <b>and</b> fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins over 2–4hours and during the night. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including fatigue and a high fever.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Using {{ultrasonography}} (US) {{to guide}} botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injection {{in patients with}} post-stroke <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> finger flexor muscle spasticity and assessing clinical outcomes after the injection and rehabilitation intervention. Methods: Twenty-three patients with <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> finger spasticity after stroke were recruited in this study from May 2012 to May 2013. Under US guidance, the proper dose (250 U) of BTX-A was injected into each spastic muscle at two injection sites. Then, conventional rehabilitation training started next day after BTX-A injection. The degree of spasticity was assessed by modified Ashworth scale (MAS) <b>and</b> <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> finger motor function by active rang of movement (AROM), and Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) at the baseline, 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks after BTX-A injection. Results: Significant decreases (p < 0. 02) in the MAS scores of both the finger flexor muscle tone <b>and</b> <b>wrist</b> flexor muscle tone measured at 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after the BTX-A injection were found {{in comparison with the}} baseline scores. Compared with the baseline, the AROM values of the <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> finger extensions and the FMA scores of the <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> hand significantly increased (p < 0. 02) at 2, 4 and 12 weeks after the BTX-A injection. Conclusions: US-guided BTX-A injection combined with rehabilitation exercise decrease spasticity of the <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> finger flexor muscles and improve their motor function in stroke patients up to 12 weeks following BTX-A injection...|$|R

5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Chaos, {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around his <b>wrists</b> <b>and</b> forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons mechanic called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes, and to use these for a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time. When a World Weapon is not equipped, Kratos may punch or kick foes {{as part of the}} new combat system. Another new mechanic is that Kratos can tether enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade, and he can throw the tethered enemy.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Chaos: {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's <b>wrists</b> <b>and</b> forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Sun Shield and Gauntlet of Zeus—offering alternative combat options. Kratos only learns three magical abilities, as opposed to four in previous installments, including the Efreet, the Light of Dawn, and Charon's Wrath, giving him {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies. He acquires the relic Triton's Lance—similar to Poseidon's Trident in God of War— which allows him to breathe underwater; a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Exile, {{replacing}} the Blades of Athena used in previous installments {{and the opening}} moments of this game. The weapon {{is a pair of}} blades that are attached to chains wrapped around the character's <b>wrists</b> <b>and</b> forearms, which can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whip—with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, which is similar to the Blades of Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of onyx.|$|E

5|$|Booth was {{regarded}} as an elegant batsman who had an erect stance at the crease. He was known for not hitting the ball hard but for having an easy and relaxed style. In hockey, a player {{is not allowed to}} lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and <b>wrists</b> <b>and</b> enabled him to impart momentum on the ball without a large swing of the blade. Booth was particularly known for his late cut and his cover drive, which he played in a manner not dissimilar to Mark Waugh. He was known for his quick footwork against spin bowling and was rarely stumped, and he had the ability to change his batting tempo. Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps. A lean player, Booth stood 181cm, weighed 66kg and refrained from smoking, gambling and drinking. He was known for his efficient outfielding, and {{on the second day of}} the Second Test against the West Indies in Trinidad in 196465, he ran out Gary Sobers and Basil Butcher with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time leg spinner before converting to off spin.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} a pair of blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's <b>wrists</b> <b>and</b> forearms. Called Athena's Blades (also known as the Blades of Athena) in this game, they can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Barbarian Hammer, the Spear of Destiny, and periodically, the Blade of Olympus—offering alternative combat options. Although Kratos begins the game with Athena's Blades and the magic ability Poseidon's Rage (both at maximum power), the blade's power is reduced and the magic is relinquished after an encounter with Zeus (Poseidon's Rage can be regained by obtaining a certain urn). As with previous games, Kratos learns to use up to four magical abilities, such as Typhon's Bane that acts as a bow and arrow for distant targets, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. Other new magical abilities include Cronos' Rage, Head of Euryale, and Atlas Quake. The special ability Rage of the Gods, featured in the previous game is replaced by Rage of the Titans; unlike the previous game, the Rage meter—which allows usage of the ability—does not have to be full in order to use the ability, and can be switched on and off at will.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Beck {{wakes up}} in a shallow grave {{in the woods with}} rope burns on her neck and no memory of how she got there. She hitchhikes to her house in Manson, Wisconsin, where her friends and family do not {{immediately}} recognize her. Her Aunt Johnny, who is a mortician, examines her and determines that Rachel should not be alive. With the help of Rachel's friend Jet, the three decide to find Rachel's attacker. Meanwhile, two other women in Manson are killed; one by Lilith, and one by a 10-year-old girl named Zoe who is possessed by the demon Malus. When Rachel's group coincidentally meets Zoe, Lilith causes a car accident that injures Aunt Johnny and kills Jet. Rachel accompanies Jet's body to the morgue, where Jet comes back to life in a condition similar to Rachel. Lilith traps Zoe and confronts Malus, whom she summoned 300 years prior to take revenge on the city of Manson for killing her followers during a witch-hunt. He tells her he is close to bringing about the End times, which will also destroy Manson. During their conversation, Zoe slits her <b>wrists</b> <b>and</b> Malus leaves her body to find another host. Zoe is taken to a hospital, where her life is saved and Rachel and Jet find her.|$|E

5|$|After {{breaking}} up from Sarah, Lydia becomes jealous of Zoe and Sarah's friendship. Lydia then begins {{going out with}} Sarah again although she is more invested in the relationship with Sarah. Lydia's true colours start to show when she tells Sarah she has received dead flowers on her and former girlfriend Charlotte's anniversary, she tells Sarah she thinks they are from Charlotte, she then shows the same bouquet to Charlotte and accuses Zoe. It is then revealed during an argument with Charlotte that Lydia tried to kill herself when she and Charlotte split up. Lydia sees Sarah and Zoe going on an adventure holiday with Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson), Fernando Fernandez (Jeronimo Best) and Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) and is jealous when she takes Zoe. Lydia follows them and has an argument with Sarah. She continues to pretend Charlotte is stalking her {{in order to gain}} sympathy. When left alone with Zoe, she tells her Sarah tried to kill herself over her. Later, Lydia overhears Sarah admit her love to a drunken Zoe. The next day, Lydia begins slitting her <b>wrists</b> <b>and</b> tries to convince Sarah that Zoe is trying to split them up. Lydia uses a knife on one of the parachutes which Zoe will use, however they get mixed up. As the girls head into the sky, Lydia begins to feel guilty and tries to stop them, however Zoe and Sarah jump out. Lydia follows and is horrified when Zoe's parachute deploys and Sarah's does not. Sarah then hits the ground. Lydia and Zoe rush to her body, both crying. Lydia frames Zoe for the death of Sarah by hiding the knife used to sabotage the parachute behind Zoe's bed. Lydia then proceeds to slit her wrists in the shower due to her guilt.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Athena, {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's <b>wrists</b> <b>and</b> forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. Later in the game, Kratos acquires a new weapon, the Arms of Sparta—a spear and shield offering alternative combat options (e.g., Kratos can use the shield for defense and the spear for offense, such as throwing it at distant targets). Kratos gains a special ability, Thera's Bane, that infuses his blades with fire, and {{is similar to the}} Rage ability in previous games, providing increased attack damage that is strong enough to pierce through enemy armor. As with the Items in God of War III, this ability automatically replenishes itself (represented by the Fire meter), allowing further usage. Both the Arms of Sparta and Thera's Bane are used to overcome environmental obstacles (e.g., certain doors require the use of Thera's Bane to open). Kratos learns to use up to three magical abilities, including the Eye of Atlantis, Scourge of Erinys, and the Horn of Boreas, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. The relic Poseidon's Trident is retained from the prior installment, which allows him to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of a leopard with glowing blue eyes (later {{revealed}} to be Kesha) walking down an alleyway. The song's title flashes {{on the screen and}} the video pans to Kesha. She walks down the alleyway with two men who grab another man. Kesha spray-paints a dollar sign on his chest. They come to a party where she and her friends flash their tattooed dollar signs on their <b>wrists</b> <b>and</b> forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on a chair with two men by her side. Jeffree Star then approaches Kesha. Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid spilling {{over the top of the}} glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from the cup and turns back into a leopard.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to: (i) determine the acceleration response of the forearm at the <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> elbow; (ii) determine the efficacy of wrist guards by measuring the impact outcome at the <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> elbow, and; (iii) determine the effects of muscle activation and elbow angles on the <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> elbow acceleration characteristics. A seated human pendulum was designed to simulate a forward fall and produce an impact to the hands of 28 subjects. Two surface accelerometers measured the <b>wrist</b> <b>and</b> elbow acceleration characteristics in response to four muscle activation levels two elbow angles <b>and</b> a <b>wrist</b> guard. The results suggest that wrist guards are capable of absorbing or redirecting the initial impact force. Furthermore, the increase in muscle activation level and the natural elbow angle, disabled the segments ability to attenuate the shock wave initiated at the hand as measured by the acceleration response at the elbow...|$|R
