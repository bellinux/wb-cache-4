5|$|Another American {{tradition}} {{is that of}} an apolitical military, although this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, <b>who</b> <b>hated</b> politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|During one leg of {{the return}} trip, the men were stopped by the Hukbalahap, Filipino Communist guerrillas <b>who</b> <b>hated</b> both the Americans and the Japanese. They were also rivals to Pajota's men. One of Pajota's lieutenants conferred with the Hukbalahap and {{returned}} to tell Mucci {{that they were not}} allowed to pass through the village. Angered by the message, Mucci sent the lieutenant back to insist that pursuing Japanese forces would be coming. The lieutenant came back and told Mucci that only Americans could pass, and Pajota's men had to stay. Both the Rangers and guerrillas were finally allowed through after an agitated Mucci told the lieutenant that he would call in an artillery barrage and level the whole village. In fact, Mucci's radio was not working at that point.|$|E

25|$|Man of Steel also {{illustrated}} significant {{events in}} Superman's relationships, {{such as his}} first interview with Lois Lane and his first encounter with Gotham City's Batman. Lex Luthor was reinvented by Wolfman and portrayed as a corrupt business tycoon <b>who</b> <b>hated</b> Superman for exposing his unethical business practices. Superman's adoptive parents lived into his adulthood, providing hooks that Byrne felt made the character more human.|$|E
25|$|Addressing the Lau Provincial Council in Ratu Mara's honour, Fiji's current vice-president, Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi praised {{him as a}} man {{of vision}} and compassion, <b>who</b> <b>hated</b> lies and lived by the truth. He praised him as a {{committed}} Christian who practised what he preached, and who did not differentiate between people but treated all men alike whatever their race or religion. Madraiwiwi called on Lauans today to follow Mara's example.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{draft of}} the play was entitled simply Anon: A Play. Barrie's working titles for it included The Great White Father and Peter Pan, or The Boy <b>Who</b> <b>Hated</b> Mothers. Producer Charles Frohman disliked the title on the manuscript, in answer to which Barrie reportedly suggested The Boy Who Couldn't Grow Up; Frohman suggested changing it to Wouldn't and dropping The Great White Father as a title.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Addams {{served at}} the Signal Corps Photographic Center in New York, where he made {{animated}} training films for the U.S. Army. In late 1942, he met his first wife, Barbara Jean Day, who purportedly resembled his cartoon character Morticia Addams. The marriage ended eight years later, after Addams, <b>who</b> <b>hated</b> small children, refused to adopt one. She later married New Yorker colleague John Hersey, {{author of the book}} Hiroshima.|$|E
25|$|Born on November 24, 1974, Sam Kellerman {{grew up in}} Manhattan while {{attending}} Stuyvesant High School. He was fifteen months younger than Max, and the 2nd of the four brothers in the Kellerman family. As an aspiring young artist, Kellerman wrote a play called The Man <b>Who</b> <b>Hated</b> Shakespeare and hosted a public-access cable-television show. On October 17, 2004, Sam Kellerman's body was found inside his apartment in the 1400 block of Vista Street in Los Angeles. As {{a result of the}} ensuing investigation, former boxer James Butler {{was arrested and charged with}} Sam's murder. He later confessed to the murder and was given a 29-year sentence.|$|E

25|$|De Gaulle {{had little}} success in {{attracting}} {{the support of}} major figures. Ambassador Charles Corbin, who had strongly supported the mooted Anglo-French Union on 16 June, resigned from the French Foreign Office but retired to South America. Alexis Leger, Secretary-General at the Quai d'Orsay (<b>who</b> <b>hated</b> Reynaud for sacking him) came to London but {{went on to the}} USA. Roland de Margerie stayed in France despite his opposition to the armistice. De Gaulle received support from Captain Tissier and André Dewavrin (both of whom had been fighting in Norway prior to joining the Free French), Gaston Palewski, Maurice Schumann and the jurist René Cassin.|$|E
25|$|When Ulysses S. Grant {{was sworn}} in as President, Jesse was {{standing}} nearby, as Chief Justice Salmon Chase administered the Oath of Office, March 4, 1869. Jesse had arrived without his wife Hannah, <b>who</b> <b>hated</b> publicity and never came to the White House. Asked by reporters where his wife was, Jesse spoke briefly, informing all that she had been invited but declined. Before the inauguration Jesse had inquired about lodging for himself and family, where Ulysses informed him that his extra rooms had been promised to friends. Some historians suggest that Ulysses at this time was on uneasy terms with his father and made no further effort to secure lodging for Jesse and family.|$|E
25|$|Bogart {{returned}} home to find his father suffering from poor health, his medical practice faltering, {{and much of the}} family's wealth lost on bad investments in timber. During his naval days, Bogart's character and values developed independently of family influence, and he began to rebel somewhat against their values. He came to be a liberal <b>who</b> <b>hated</b> pretensions, phonies, and snobs, and at times defied conventional behavior and authority, traits he displayed in both life and the movies. He did not, however, forsake good manners, articulateness, punctuality, modesty, and a dislike of being touched. After his naval service, he worked as a shipper and then bond salesman. He joined the Naval Reserve.|$|E

25|$|By 1860 Charlotte {{had been}} dead for five years, and the only people living at the parsonage were Mr. Brontë, his son-in-law, Arthur Bell Nicholls, and two servants. In 1857 Mrs. Gaskell's {{biography}} of Charlotte was published and though Mr. Brontë at its first reading approved of its commissioning, several months later he expressed doubts. The portrait of Nicholls, founded partly on the confidence of Ellen Nussey, seemed to him to be unjustified. Ellen Nussey, <b>who</b> <b>hated</b> Arthur, insists that his marital claims had perverted Charlotte's writing and she had to struggle against an interruption of her career. It is true that Arthur found Nussey to be too close to his wife, and he insisted that she should destroy her letters – although this never actually happened.|$|E
25|$|Khand (Evil) – Tolkien wrote {{even less}} about Khand {{than he did}} about Harad, though {{we know that the}} only thing implied about them is that the armor they wore covered - {{literally}} - their entire bodies ("Variags <b>who</b> <b>hated</b> the sun"), and that their weapons may be their own design of Haradrim and Easterling weapons. Games Workshop has based their Variags of Khand on the Mongols and the Japanese, featuring sashimonos and the unique chariots, despite the Easterlings being the only culture in Middle-earth with chariots in Tolkien's writings. It was suggested that the Gondorians were unaware of the lands further east, and thus the names of the Variags and Wainriders had been mixed-up. Khand allies with the Easterlings (and the Haradrim) frequently.|$|E
25|$|After a long healing slumber, Apocalypse, fully restored, awakens with Ozymandias at {{his side}} and quickly learns of the present danger: Onslaught. He observes the {{conflict}} between the psionic entity and Earth's heroes with Uatu the Watcher, who suggests to Apocalypse a course of action: an alliance with the one <b>who</b> <b>hated</b> him the most, Cable. Apocalypse surmises that Onslaught would be most vulnerable through the astral plane and that he needs Cable for actual physical transportation to this realm. Once on the astral plane, Apocalypse would remove the captive Franklin Richards, greatly weakening Onslaught. The plan succeeds, but is interrupted by the Invisible Woman, who had invisibly accompanied the pair, having suspected Apocalypse's motive in wanting to actually kill her son. However, the reprieve in battle gave Onslaught the time to escape, prolonging the conflict.|$|E

25|$|The {{restoration}} of Constantine I at first {{did not bring}} any change to Aspasia's situation. Considered intriguing by part of the Royal Family, especially by her sister-in-law Princess Elisabeth of Romania <b>who</b> <b>hated</b> her, she was under the suspicion {{that she wanted to}} put her unborn child on the throne. The Royal Family feared the birth of a male child, which could further complicate the political situation at a time when Greece was already at war against the Ottoman Empire. However, not all members of the Royal Family, shared this distrust: Princess Alice of Battenberg, aunt of the deceased Alexander I, chose to spend Christmas of 1920 in the company of Aspasia. For her part, Queen Sophia, who previously strongly opposed the relationship of her son with Aspasia, approaches her daughter-in-law and awaited birth of her first grandchild.|$|E
25|$|The text of {{the first}} of the three books of the Principia was {{presented}} to the Royal Society at the close of April 1686. Hooke made some priority claims (but failed to substantiate them), causing some delay. When Hooke's claim was made known to Newton, <b>who</b> <b>hated</b> disputes, Newton threatened to withdraw and suppress Book 3 altogether, but Halley, showing considerable diplomatic skills, tactfully persuaded Newton to withdraw his threat and let it go forward to publication. Samuel Pepys, as President, gave his imprimatur on 30 June 1686, licensing the book for publication. The Society had just spent its book budget on a History of Fishes, and the cost of publication was borne by Edmund Halley (who was also then acting as publisher of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society): the book appeared in summer 1687.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 Balmont and Lokhvitskaya met, apparently, for {{the last}} time. Since then their {{relationship}} has been confined to enigmatically constructed poetic dialogues, full of demands and threats on his part and pleas for mercy on hers. Apparently both were taking their shared self-created world of horror and passion seriously. Balmont was continuously complaining in his letters of being 'possessed', while Lokhvitskaya submerged herself in a quagmire of violent visions which, coupled with feelings of guilt towards her family, might have led to an illness the roots of which were obviously psychosomatic. Some (Alexandrova included) regard the involvement of Valery Bryusov, Balmont's close rival/friend {{to be the most}} damaging factor. The well-publicized fact that Bryusov (<b>who</b> <b>hated</b> Lokhvitskaya, thinking she was trying to 'steal' a friend of his) dabbled in black magic added a gothic touch to the whole affair.|$|E
