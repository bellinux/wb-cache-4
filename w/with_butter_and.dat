25|$|Tibetan barley {{has been}} a staple food in Tibetan cuisine since the fifth century CE. This grain, along with a cool climate that {{permitted}} storage, produced a civilization that was able to raise great armies. It is made into a flour product called tsampa that is still a staple in Tibet. The flour is roasted and mixed <b>with</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> butter tea to form a stiff dough that is eaten in small balls.|$|E
25|$|American waffles vary significantly. Generally denser {{and thinner}} than the Belgian waffle, {{they are often}} made from a batter leavened with baking powder, which is {{sometimes}} mixed with pecans, chocolate drops or berries and may be round, square, or rectangular in shape. Like American pancakes they are usually served as a sweet breakfast food, topped <b>with</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> maple syrup, bacon, and other fruit syrups, honey, or powdered sugar. They are also found in many different savory dishes, such as fried chicken and waffles or topped with kidney stew. They may also be served as desserts, topped with ice cream and various other toppings. A large chain (over 2,100 locations) of waffle specialty diners, Waffle House, is ubiquitous in the southern United States.|$|E

Children often drink hot chocolate in bowls or cups {{along with their}} breakfasts. Croissants, pain aux raisins or pain au chocolat (also named chocolatine {{in the south of}} France) are mostly included as a weekend treat. Breakfast of some kind is always served in cafés opening early in the day.|$|E

2500|$|In 1884, having {{developed}} Lever and Company to a {{point where}} it was virtually self-governing, William resolved to capture a large share of the international soap trade. In essence, he planned to manufacture and market a range of high quality, price differentiated products, using a strategy based upon his experiences <b>with</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> other commodity products. Thus, instead of selling soap by weight, he had it cut into small, manageable tablets which were individually wrapped. The 1875 Trade Mark Registration Act protected trade names from counterfeiters and imitators, and this opened the way for brand name recognition and consumer loyalty. Within 12 months, Lever had registered a series of Trade Marks, among them “Sunlight”, a house style that was later applied to a range of household soaps.|$|E

60|$|The Swiss breakfast was our {{old friend}} the Italian breakfast, <b>with</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> Gruyère cheese {{added to the}} milk and coffee. We dined at one o'clock, and at six or seven we supped upon a meal that had left off soup and added tea, in order to differ from the dinner. For all this, with our rooms, we paid what we should have paid at a New Hampshire farm-house; that is, {{a dollar a day}} each.|$|E

60|$|In {{the street}} {{of the village}} you might see cattle-dealers with cows and oxen for sale, and pig-drovers with herds of {{squeaking}} swine, and farmers with cartloads of cabbages, turnips, onions, and all other produce of the soil. Now and then a farmer's red-faced wife trotted along on horseback, <b>with</b> <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> cheese in two large panniers. The people of the village, with country squires, and other visitors from the neighborhood, walked hither and thither, trading, jesting, quarrelling, and making just such a bustle as their fathers and grandfathers had made half a century before.|$|E
6000|$|... [22] In Zayla {{there is}} not a single coffee-house. The settled Somal care little for the Arab beverage, and the Bedouins' reasons for {{avoiding}} it are not bad. [...] "If we drink coffee once," [...] say they, [...] "we shall want it again, and then where are we to get it?" [...] The Abyssinian Christians, probably to distinguish themselves from Moslems, object to coffee as well as to tobacco. The Gallas, on the other hand, eat it: the powdered bean is mixed <b>with</b> <b>butter,</b> <b>and</b> on forays a lump about the size of a billiard-ball is preferred to a substantial meal.|$|E

The boys thought they were not hungry, but when they began to eat {{they found out that}} they were, and before they knew it they had eaten the slices all up.
