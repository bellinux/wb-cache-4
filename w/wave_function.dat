5|$|Max Tegmark {{developed}} a four-part classification scheme {{for the different}} types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains. An example of such a model is the chaotic inflation model of the early universe. Another is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Parallel worlds are generated {{in a manner similar to}} quantum superposition and decoherence, with all states of the <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.|$|E
5|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}}. Devised by Hugh Everett, {{this interpretation}} does {{away with the}} conceptual problem of <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> collapse by supposing that all possible outcomes occur equally, in a constantly branching tree of parallel universes.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{together}} with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, Einstein put forward {{what is now}} known as the EPR paradox, and argued that the quantum-mechanical <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> must be an incomplete description of the physical world.|$|E

40|$|Magneto‐optical data {{obtained}} from photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation measurements performed {{in the presence of}} applied magnetic fields were used to determine the diamagnetic shifts of free excitons. The samples studied were coupled InxGa 1 −xAs–GaAs quantum wells. In all cases the excitons associated with antisymmetric <b>wave</b> <b>functions</b> were found to have larger diamagnetic shifts than the excitons associated with symmetric <b>wave</b> <b>functions.</b> This suggests that the excitons associated with antisymmetric <b>wave</b> <b>functions</b> have a smaller binding energy than excitons associated with symmetric <b>wave</b> <b>functions.</b> These properties are consistent with the fact that excitons associated with antisymmetric <b>wave</b> <b>functions</b> are less confined than excitons associated with the symmetric <b>wave</b> <b>functions...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive {{a number of}} {{expansions}} for Whittaker functions, regular and irregular Coulomb <b>wave</b> <b>functions.</b> The main result consists of a new expansion for the irregular Coulomb <b>wave</b> <b>functions</b> of orders zero and one in terms of regular Coulomb <b>wave</b> <b>functions.</b> The latter expansions are especially useful {{with a view to}} the numerical computation of irregular Coulomb <b>wave</b> <b>functions...</b>|$|R
5|$|Neutron {{interferometry}} {{has been}} used to investigate the Aharonov–Bohm effect, {{to examine the effects of}} gravity acting on an elementary particle, and to demonstrate a strange behavior of fermions that is at the basis of the Pauli exclusion principle: Unlike macroscopic objects, when fermions are rotated by 360° about any axis, they do not return to their original state, but develop a minus sign in their <b>wave</b> <b>function.</b> In other words, a fermion needs to be rotated 720° before returning to its original state.|$|E
5|$|The wave-like {{nature of}} the {{electron}} allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as {{would be the case}} for a classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the <b>wave</b> <b>function,</b> commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (ψ). When the absolute value of this function is squared, it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location—a probability density.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{was troubled}} {{by the fact that}} his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.|$|E
40|$|An {{differential}} equation for <b>wave</b> <b>functions</b> is proposed, which {{is equivalent to}} Schrödinger's wave equation {{and can be used}} to determine energy-level gaps of quantum systems. Contrary to Schrödinger's wave equation, this equation is on `bipartite' <b>wave</b> <b>functions.</b> It is shown that those `bipartite' <b>wave</b> <b>functions</b> satisfy all the basic properties of Schrödinger's <b>wave</b> <b>functions.</b> Further, it is argued that `bipartite' <b>wave</b> <b>functions</b> can present a mathematical expression of wave-particle duality.

5|$|Electrons are {{identical}} particles because they cannot {{be distinguished from}} each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons {{must be able to}} swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, , where the variables r1 and r2 correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. Bosons, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{relativistic}} Dirac equation {{has problems}} for elements {{with more than}} 137 protons. For such elements, the <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, {{and there is no}} gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox. More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons. For heavier elements, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the spontaneous emission of a positron; however, this does not happen if the innermost orbital is filled, so that element 173 is not necessarily the end of the periodic table.|$|E
25|$|The Schrödinger {{equation}} {{describes the}} (deterministic) {{evolution of the}} <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> of a particle. However, even if the <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> is known exactly, {{the result of a}} specific measurement on the <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> is uncertain.|$|E

25|$|So if the <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> {{itself is}} reality (rather than {{probability}} of classical coordinates), then the unitary {{evolution of the}} <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> in quantum mechanics, {{can be said to}} be deterministic.

25|$|The Schrödinger {{equation}} {{provides a}} way to calculate the <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. However, the Schrödinger equation does not directly say what, exactly, the <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> is.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that von Neumann-Landau {{equation}} for <b>wave</b> <b>functions</b> can present a mathematical formalism of motion of quantum mechanics. The <b>wave</b> <b>functions</b> of von Neumann-Landau equation {{for a single}} particle are `bipartite', in which the associated Schrödinger's <b>wave</b> <b>functions</b> correspond to those `bipartite' <b>wave</b> <b>functions</b> of product forms. This formalism establishes a mathematical expression of wave-particle duality and that von Neumann's entropy is a quantitative measure of complementarity between wave-like and particle-like behaviors. Furthermore, this extension of Schrödinger's form suggests that collapses of Schrödinger's <b>wave</b> <b>functions</b> {{can be regarded as}} the simultaneous transition of the particle from many levels to one.

25|$|The finite {{potential}} well problem is mathematically {{more complicated than}} the infinite particle-in-a-box problem as the <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> is not pinned to zero at {{the walls of the}} well.

25|$|In {{case the}} <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> {{of two or}} more {{particles}} is separable, then the system's total quantum potential becomes the sum of the quantum potentials of the two particles. Exact separability is extremely unphysical given that interactions between the system and its environment destroy the factorization; however, a <b>wave</b> <b>function</b> that is a superposition of several wave functions of approximately disjoint support will factorize approximately.|$|E
