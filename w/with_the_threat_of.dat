5|$|Although he {{immediately}} assumed {{use of his}} stepfather's surname, {{it was not until}} Clinton turned fifteen that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather. Clinton said that he remembered his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr., {{to the point where he}} intervened multiple times <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> violence to protect them.|$|E

50|$|The Malayan Emergency was {{declared}} over on 31 July 1960 {{and the first}} anti-terrorism law was enacted in the same year, known as the Internal Security Act 1960, to provide sweeping power to the Federal Government to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> armed communists resistance.|$|R
50|$|In 163, he {{was sent}} to Britain to control uprisings in the north. He rebuilt a number of forts, most notably that at Coria (Corbridge).

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, the castle was occupied by Captain Richard Swanley, a supporter of Parliament. In December 1648 it was briefly used to detain the King before his trial and execution. During the interregnum, it remained in use under the command of Colonel Thomas Eyre and was reinforced in 1650 to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> a Royalist invasion.|$|E
5|$|In 1698, the Company of Scotland {{attempted}} {{a project to}} secure a trading colony on the Isthmus of Panama. Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare {{is said to have}} invested in the Darien scheme. Its failure bankrupted these landowners, but not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> an English invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England.|$|E

They agree when faced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> having to talk to each other, and arrive at a Fortune Megastore, a venture of wealthy Arthur Fortune (modelled on British {{entrepreneur}} Richard Branson). Fortune easily charms the crowd and hands out dollar bills to his customers. This embarrasses the unpopular Mr. Burns, who asks Homer to help him be loved by all.|$|E

50|$|He {{learned to}} exploit the open, yet restrained, {{hostilities}} between the Byzantine Empire and the Crusader principalities of Edessa and Antioch. Most of his successes benefited from Byzantium’s pre-occupation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> Zengi (<b>the</b> atabeg of Mosul) from Aleppo {{and the lack of}} effective Frankish rule, especially in the Principality of Antioch.|$|R
5|$|About 16hours {{before the}} storm moved through the Lesser Antilles, the {{government}} of Saint Lucia declared a tropical storm warning. Guadeloupe, Martinique, Dominica, St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico and the U.S Virgin Islands issued tropical storm watches. Combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154oil platforms and 32oil rigs. The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2million barrels of loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas reserves were also limited. The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Curie's {{quest to}} create a new {{laboratory}} did not end with the University of Paris, however. In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris. The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been disappointed that the University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute. Only then, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the Caribbean Sea was {{initially}} an important theatre of naval conflict, as ships operating {{from the various}} French, British, Spanish and Dutch colonies preyed on enemy trade. During 1809 and 1810 however, the Royal Navy launched a series of co-ordinated amphibious operations that eliminated the French and Dutch colonies and brought {{the conflict in the}} Caribbean to an end. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> attacks on British trade in the region significantly reduced, the Royal Navy correspondingly reduced their presence in the Caribbean and the remaining British ships were distributed to observe trouble spots in the region, which in 1812 included the independent nation of Haiti.|$|E

5|$|Francis J. Underwood {{was born}} on November 5, 1959, to Catherine and Calvin T. Underwood in Gaffney, South Carolina. He is an only child. He was raised in impoverished circumstances, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> bank {{foreclosure}} on the farm they lived on. He entered The Sentinel, a military school in Charleston, South Carolina, loosely based on The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, {{in the fall of}} 1976. He graduated in 1981 and, despite having made poor grades, gained admittance into Harvard Law School. He graduated from there in 1984. While at the Sentinel, he had a homosexual relationship with his roommate, Tim Corbet, which lasted until his first year of law school. Underwood was raised Christian but holds God in complete contempt.|$|E
5|$|In 1001, Edward's relics (for he was {{considered}} a saint, although never canonized) were translated to a more prominent place within the nunnery at Shaftesbury. The ceremonies {{are said to have}} been led by the then-Bishop of Sherborne, Wulfsige III, accompanied by a senior cleric whom the Passio calls Elsinus, sometimes identified with Ælfsige, the abbot of the New Minster, Winchester. King Æthelred, preoccupied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> a Danish invasion, did not attend in person, but he issued a charter to the Shaftesbury nuns late in 1001 granting them lands at Bradford on Avon, which is thought to be related. A 13th-century calendar of saints gives the date of this translation as 20 June.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, Parliament {{ordered that}} {{supplies}} of ammunition and powder {{be sent to}} Sandown and the other castles of the Downs. Fresh earthworks were erected during the Interregnum between Sandown and Deal to address <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> Dutch attack. The garrison at Sandown remained substantial during the period, with a governor and 21 soldiers, but when Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 he reduced the numbers again to a captain and 18 men. In the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles' brother, King James II, the townsfolk of Deal seized Sandown Castle on behalf of William III, the Prince of Orange.|$|E

50|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> {{lawsuits}} and <b>the</b> strong possibility of NBC making good on its threat, WHDH reconsidered its decision two weeks later. However, Ansin's foresight would later {{prove to be}} correct. Viewership for WHDH's 11:00 news dropped 20 percent in the November 2009 sweeps period, and a wave of affiliate complaints about similar declines for their late newscasts would force NBC to end the primetime run of the program on February 11, 2010 in a very controversial shake-up of its late night lineup.|$|R
5|$|In January 1941, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> {{invasion}} of England reduced, {{it was decided}} to send the 2nd AIF units there to the Middle East and the battalion arrived in Egypt in March 1941. Following this the battalion moved to Palestine where it undertook further training and received a draft of reinforcements which enabled it to raise a fourth company in order to bring it up to establishment. Having been transferred to the 7th Division, the battalion took up defensive positions around Mersa Matruh before taking part in the Syria-Lebanon campaign, during which it took part in several battles.|$|E
5|$|Leigh {{appeared}} with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), {{which was the}} first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E
5|$|North Vietnam {{continued}} {{to build up}} its combat units in South Vietnam. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> U.S. airpower removed, the North Vietnamese military moved anti-aircraft units into South Vietnam, and deployed a sophisticated air-defence network that included the long-range SA-2 surface-to-air missile system, radar-guided anti-aircraft guns and the SA-7 Grail shoulder-launched missile The strong presence of North Vietnamese anti-aircraft units, which covered much of the northern provinces of South Vietnam, forced Republic of Vietnam Air Force reconnaissance and fighter aircraft to fly at higher altitudes to avoid being hit by surface-to-air missiles. Consequently, when North Vietnam went on the offensive again in 1975, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was severely handicapped.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a concise evaluation of Dutch defense strategies against <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea level rise {{as a consequence}} of global climate change. A set of (external) event scenarios for sea level rise is described ranging from a modest to a dramatic rise. Next, four different policy response scenarios are presented, while their related costs are confronted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event scenarios. It is concluded that- seen from a cost-effectiveness approach to various defense strategies- the traditional Dutch defense strategy is for the time being the most proper response to the sea level rise...|$|R
5|$|Other postcolonial {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} Shakespeare's audiences would have connected Sycorax <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> Islamic expansionism. Islam had successfully conquered and colonised much of the Middle East and some of southern Europe during the Middle Ages. The Algerian Sycorax may represent Christian Europe's fear of Islam and its growing political power. This interpretation inverts the traditional postcolonial interpretations of The Tempest, however. If Sycorax is viewed as an Islamic expansionist, then she herself is the coloniser, not Prospero (who becomes merely a re-colonizer of the island). However, Sycorax's portrayal as an absent, silent woman still allows the play to solidify the idea of European over Islamic power.|$|E
5|$|The ceasefire of 2004 brought {{relative}} peace, {{but in the}} meantime, {{the sinking}} of the Joola in 2002 claimed the lives of many inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists for several years. Considering the problems brought on by the conflict along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> coastal erosion on the island, some fear the worst. Thus, after years of development and community outreach, Carabane is experiencing difficulties in a number of ways.|$|E
5|$|The renewed {{interest}} in residential schools in the early 1800s {{has been linked to}} the decline in military hostility faced by British settlers, particularly after the War of 1812. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>of</b> invasion by American forces minimized, Indigenous communities were no longer viewed as allies but as barriers to permanent settlement. This perspective was further underscored by the transfer of affairs with Indigenous communities from military officials, familiar with and sympathetic to their customs and way of life, to civilian representatives concerned only with permanent colonial settlement.|$|E
