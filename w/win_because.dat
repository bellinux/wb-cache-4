Her second appearance in 2004 {{came during the}} CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying tournament in March. She subbed in during the 69th minute of the March 5 match against Costa Rica, helping to secure a third place <b>win.</b> <b>Because</b> of the team's third-place finish, Canada did not qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|During the 1925 season, Stanford lost {{just one}} PCC game (to Washington); California was finally defeated, 27–7. It {{was the first}} year of a new rivalry, with coach Howard Jones and the University of Southern California (USC) team. In their first game, at the Los Angeles Memorial Colosseum, Stanford scored twice in the first half but had to hold off the {{charging}} Trojans in a 13–9 <b>win.</b> <b>Because</b> of the loss to Washington, Warner's team was not invited to the Rose Bowl.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001–02 season, Brodeur {{finished}} {{among the}} league leaders in wins and GAA. Brodeur continued {{to lead the}} league in victories and remained a Vezina and MVP candidate. The next season, in 2002–03, Brodeur won the Vezina Trophy for the first time. He also won the Jennings Trophy again, was a Hart Memorial Trophy finalist for the league's Most Valuable Player, and was named a 1st Team All-Star and started in the All-Star Game. With {{one of the most}} impressive playoff performances of his career, Brodeur guided the Devils to their third Stanley Cup victory after seven-game series wins against the top-seeded Ottawa Senators and the 7th-seeded Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He posted 3 shutouts against Anaheim and had a playoff total of 7 overall, breaking the NHL record of 6 that had been set by Dominik Hašek the previous year. Despite this, the Conn Smythe Trophy for playoff MVP was awarded to Anaheim goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère, who became the first player not on the championship team to be named playoff MVP since Ron Hextall of Philadelphia in 1987. Some hockey writers speculated a New Jersey player did not <b>win</b> <b>because</b> there were multiple candidates, resulting in a split vote among the sportswriters who selected the winner.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 April {{elements}} of the 14th Panzer Division entered Zagreb and were greeted by cheering crowds. Slavko Kvaternik declared {{the establishment of the}} Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH) via the Zagreb Radio Station, with Zagreb as its capital. Most of the population was pleased with the dissolution of Yugoslavia. Kvaternik formed a provisional government in Zagreb on 12 April. Ante Pavelić, who was named the leader (Poglavnik) of NDH, arrived in Zagreb on 15 April. He gave a short speech in which he said: [...] "Ustaše! We have <b>won.</b> We <b>won</b> <b>because</b> we had faith. We <b>won</b> <b>because</b> we held out. We <b>won</b> <b>because</b> we fought. Ustaše! We <b>won</b> <b>because</b> we were always Za dom spremni!" [...] Jozo Dumančić was temporarily named the Mayor of Zagreb, thus replacing Mate Starčević.|$|R

25|$|Coming into Super Bowl XVIII, the Redskins were {{favored to}} <b>win</b> <b>because</b> of their offense, their number one-rated run defense, their league-best 14–2 regular season record, and their Super Bowl win from last season. Also, the Redskins had {{defeated}} the Raiders during an October 2 regular season game, 37–35, by scoring 17 {{points in the}} final six minutes of the game.|$|E

While 42% of the electorate voted for Memphis, 58% of the electorate voted against Memphis in this first round.|$|E
25|$|Bullying {{behaviours}} in {{the workplace}} also exist among colleagues. They can be either the ‘target’ or perpetrator. If workplace bullying happens among the co-workers, witnesses will take sides, either with the target or the perpetrator. Perpetrators always <b>win,</b> <b>because</b> witnesses {{do not want to}} be the next target. This does encourage perpetrators to continue this behaviour. In addition, the sense of the injustice experienced by a target might lead that person to become another perpetrator who bullies other colleagues who have less power than they.|$|E
25|$|Colts QB Peyton Manning {{played only}} a couple series and backup QB Jim Sorgi got some {{extended}} playing time.

25|$|Because of the {{controversial}} nature of the loss, Rahman's ranking did not suffer, but in November 1999, he was knocked out by Oleg Maskaev in the eighth round of a fight he looked to be winning. At one point during the match, Rahman was knocked through the ropes onto the floor, hitting {{his head on the}} floor. Rahman dropped out of The Ring top 10 {{as a result of the}} surprise loss. Rahman later said that he had seen Maskaev earlier in his career get knocked out in the first round by former champion Oliver McCall and he assumed he was brought in as an easy <b>win.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, he did not train as hard as he should have and was beaten.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Anquetil was whistled as he {{finished}} the Tour on the Parc des Princes because spectators had worked out that he and others had contrived to let Federico Bahamontes win rather than the Frenchman Henry Anglade. The French team was unbalanced by internal rivalries. Anglade, whose bossy nature earned him the nickname Napoleon, was particularly unusual in that he was represented by the agent Roger Piel while the others had Daniel Dousset. The two men controlled all French racing. Dousset soon worked out that his riders had to either beat Bahamontes or make sure that Anglade didn't win. Since they couldn't beat Anglade, they contrived to let Bahamontes <b>win</b> <b>because</b> Bahamontes, a poor rider on the flat and on small circuits, would be no threat to the post-Tour criterium fees {{that made up the}} bulk of riders' — and agents' — earnings.|$|E
25|$|In limited over matches (one innings matches), {{the team}} that scores more runs wins. So if team A scored 250 from 50 overs {{with the loss of}} 1 wicket (250–1), then the target for team B is to get 251. The number of wickets that has fallen does not affect which team has won. So if team B scored 251 but with the loss of 9 wickets (251–9), team B still won because it scored more runs, even though it lost more wickets. In a similar {{situation}} if team A scored 250/1, but team B scored 240 (all out), then team A would <b>win</b> <b>because</b> it scored more runs. Part way through a limited over match, to judge the likely final scores, it is important to know, in addition to runs already scored and wickets already lost, how many overs each side has remaining, so this is always quoted.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, {{only two}} non-Cup Series regulars won a race during the 35-race schedule: David Gilliland and Paul Menard. Menard and Johnny Sauter {{were the only}} Busch Series regulars to finish in the top-10 in points that season. In 2007, only three Busch drivers scored a victory: Aric Almirola, Stephen Leicht and Jason Leffler. Almirola's victory at the Milwaukee Mile on June 23 was {{controversial}} and unusual, as Almirola was pulled from his pole-winning car after leading 42 of the first 58 laps {{to make room for}} Cup regular Denny Hamlin, due to obligations with sponsor Rockwell Automation which is headquartered in Milwaukee. Hamlin was scheduled to compete in a Cup event at Infineon Raceway the same weekend, and had several delays in his trek from California to Wisconsin. Despite the loss in track position due to the driver change, Hamlin got back to the front to take the checkered flag after 250 laps. Almirola was officially credited with the <b>win</b> <b>because</b> he made the start, but did not participate in victory celebrations.|$|E

Mike Fahey, the former Democratic mayor of Omaha, {{said he would do}} whatever it took to deliver the district's electoral vote to Obama; and the Obama campaign considered the district [...] "in play". Former Nebraska U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and former Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama, and in November 2008 Obama won the district's electoral vote. This was an exceptional <b>win,</b> <b>because</b> with Nebraska's split electoral vote system Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win an electoral vote in Nebraska since 1964.|$|E

500|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{not include}} the 1987 winner, Stephen Roche, who was sidelined {{for the majority of the}} 1988 season with a knee injury. l'Unità writer Gino Sala, author Bill McGann and an El Mundo Deportivo writer named several riders as contenders for the overall classification, including Andrew Hampsten, Urs Zimmermann, Erik Breukink, Franco Chioccioli, and Pedro Delgado. Sala believed Jean-François Bernard came into the Giro in great shape and that the French rider could win the race if he could do well in the time trials and the mountains. In addition, Bernard Hinault told Sala that if Jean Francois could do well in this edition of the Giro, he could one day lead a team in the Tour de France. Former Giro champion Gianni Motta thought Hampsten would <b>win</b> <b>because</b> of the effort he was expected to make on the Gavia Pass stage. Motta believed that Hampsten would excel there, while the Italian riders – the majority of the peloton – would not because they did not realize its difficulty and thought the Gavia was [...] "just another climb." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Sci Fi Wire, Sanderson stated {{it was a great}} honor to be given the chance to complete the series but conceded he was unable to fill Jordan's shoes. Some parts of the book were nearly finished by Jordan, while others have only a couple of paragraphs to describe a twenty-page scene, but he describes Jordan's notes as [...] "amazing." [...] He later elaborated that [...] "the amount of material [...] left behind is what makes this book possible." [...] Speaking to The Guardian, he stated that although some people wouldn't like the book, and any failures would be blamed on him, [...] "I say that I <b>win</b> <b>because</b> I get to be part of this." [...] Through February 2008 Sanderson reread the entire series, posting his impressions of each book on his blog. The reread lasted until March 2008, at which point he [...] "began to grasp the daunting nature of this book," [...] with so many plot lines that needed to be resolved.|$|E
500|$|In the 1973 Preakness Stakes on May 19, Secretariat broke last, {{but then}} made a huge, last-to-first move on the first turn. Raymond Woolfe, a {{photographer}} for the Daily Racing Form, captured Secretariat launching the move with a leaping stride in the air. This was later {{used as the basis}} for the statue by John Skeaping that stands in the Belmont Park paddock. Turcotte later said that he was proudest of this <b>win</b> <b>because</b> of the split-second decision he made going into the turn: [...] "I let my horse drop back, when I went to drop in, they started backing up into me. I said, 'I don't want to get trapped here.' So I just breezed by them." [...] Secretariat completed the second quarter mile of the race in under 22 seconds. After reaching the lead with [...] furlongs to go, Secretariat was never challenged, and won by [...] lengths, with Sham again finishing second and Our Native in third, a further eight lengths back. It was the first time in history that the top three finishers in the Derby and Preakness were the same; the distance between each of the horses was also the same.|$|E
