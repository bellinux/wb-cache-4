25|$|The {{group on}} the pier was a rusty one — men and women, and boys and girls, all ragged, and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession, beggars. They trooped after us, and never more, while we tarried in Fayal, did {{we get rid of}} them. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> up the middle of the {{principal}} street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides, and glared upon us; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street.|$|E
25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

500|$|Leeds midfielder Albert Johanneson {{would become}} the first black player to play in an FA Cup final. However, before walking out onto the pitch Johanneson {{suffered}} racial abuse: “When <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> out, all I could hear was a cacophony of Zulu-like noises coming from the terraces. It was dreadful, I could barely hear myself think for those screams. I wanted to run back down the tunnel." ...|$|E
500|$|Kevin Conran disputed {{this budget}} {{figure in a}} 2015 interview. “I take great issue with that [...] {{personally}} and I’d like someone to show me where all that money went,” says Kevin. “I don’t support those numbers and I never have. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> into Jon Avnet’s office that first day and he said, ‘What {{do you want for}} the production?’ and we said $3million.

500|$|..... {{although}} we didn't deliberately {{set out to}} be a 'bunch of bastards' when <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> on to the field, I'd much prefer any team I captained to be described like that than as 'a nice bunch of blokes on the field.' As captain of Australia my philosophy was simple: between 11.00am and 6.00pm {{there was no time to}} be a nice guy. I believed that on the field players should concentrate on giving their best to the team, to themselves and to winning; in other words, playing hard and fairly within the rules. To my mind, doing all that left no time for being a nice guy.|$|E

500|$|Although Monteux {{retained}} his vitality {{to the end}} of his life, in {{his last}} years he suffered occasional collapses. In 1962 he fainted during a performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. In 1963 he collapsed again after being presented with the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, Britain's highest musical honour. The presentation was made by Sir Adrian Boult, who recalled that as they left the platform, [...] "Monteux gave two little groans as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> down the passage, and I suddenly found my arms full of violins and bows. The orchestra had recognized the signs. Their beloved chief was fainting." [...] Monteux suffered another collapse the following year, and David Zinman and Lorin Maazel deputised for him at the Festival Hall.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record {{producer}} Jude Cole. It was recorded and produced by John Alagía at his home studio in Easton, Maryland. In an interview with MTV, Wade explained his experience working with Alagía, and said, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> into John's house, we didn't know what to expect, and we {{get in there and}} the mixing board is in the living room, the B3 [...] is in the kitchen and the piano is over there. And he's so nonchalant about all his stuff — there'd be a triple-platinum Dave Matthews Band plaque sticking out from under the bed." [...] "You and Me" [...] was first released via digital download on January 28, 2005. It was then solicited to mainstream radio on March 15, 2005. An extended wedding version of the song was released on July 26, 2005.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{praised the}} film's fictionalization of history, writing in his review, [...] "The film doesn't {{pretend to be}} about the civil-rights workers themselves. It's almost as if Mr. Parker and Mr. Gerolmo {{respected}} the victims, their ideals and their fate too much to reinvent them through the use of fiction." [...] In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert surmised, [...] "We knew the outcome of this case when <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> into the theater. What we may have forgotten, or never known, is exactly what kinds of currents were in the air in 1964." [...] On the syndicated television program Siskel and Ebert and the Movies, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Siskel, writing for the Chicago Tribune, praised Hackman and Dafoe's [...] "subtle" [...] performances but felt that McDormand was [...] "most effective as the film's moral conscience".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] was filmed from April 7 to April 9, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Hype Williams. It officially premiered on Vevo on April 30, 2010. On working with Williams {{and the new}} looks she developed in the video, Aguilera stated, [...] "...someone with {{that much of a}} catalog under his belt and success as a video maker, he's like a legend. So again entering into the collaborating factor, I didn't know what to expect ... and he's probably thinking the same about me. And when <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> away from working with each other, it was just a love connection. I wanted to maintain and keep consistent with the look of the album packaging and book, and I really wanted to keep all that in line, and so he really paid attention, and I think it's really iconic and classic. We totally made magic together on a creative level, it was absolutely amazing. He really got in and listened to where my music was at".|$|E
500|$|Waters {{especially}} {{appreciated the}} way Davies interpreted Kitty's ambivalence {{about being in}} love with Nan. He wrote the line for her, [...] "I hate the way you make me feel", which according to Waters crystallises Kitty's complicated emotions well. The music in the adaptation was written for the film. Waters wrote song titles but not lyrics in the music references in the novel. For one song, during Kitty and Nan's first performance in the adaptation, Davies wrote a composition that had Kitty show Nan—dressed and performing as brothers—how to pick up girls in the park. It involved Kitty teaching Nan how to kiss, which they do onstage in front of audiences who are watching women, dressed as men, who are in reality {{having an affair with}} each other beyond the view of the audience. Waters wrote a similar description as Nan compares their act to their relationship; their sexual encounters to their performance onstage, noting the irony that Kitty insisted on absolute secrecy yet there they performed in front of thousands: [...] "You are too slow—you go too fast—not there, but here—that's good—that's better! It was as if <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> before the crimson curtain, lay down upon the boards and kissed and fondled—and were clapped, and cheered, and paid for it!" ...|$|E

2500|$|For example, {{the term}} 'arboretum' {{was first used}} in an English {{publication}} by J. C. Loudon in 1833 in The Gardener's Magazine when commenting on George Loddiges' famous Hackney Botanic Garden arboretum, begun in 1816, and open free {{to the public for}} educational benefit every Sunday. Loudon wrote: The arboretum looks better this season than it has ever done since it was planted... the more lofty trees suffered from the late high winds, but not materially. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> round the two outer spirals of this coil of trees and shrubs; viz. from Acer to Quercus. There is no garden scene about London so interesting.|$|E
2500|$|Calef {{could not}} get it {{published}} in Boston {{and he had to}} take it to London, where it was published in 1700. Scholars of the trials — Hutchinson, Upham, Burr, and even Poole — have relied on Calef's compilation of documents. John Hale, a minister in Beverly who was present at many of the proceedings, had completed his book, A Modest Enquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft in 1697, which was not published until 1702, after his death, and perhaps in response to Calef's book. Expressing regret over the actions taken, Hale admitted, [...] "Such was the darkness of that day, the tortures and lamentations of the afflicted, and the power of former presidents, that <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> in the clouds, and could not see our way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{walked a}} step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he {{shortened}} his stride to accommodate mine.

When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. [...] "Can I call you Uncle Billy?" [...] I asked. [...] "Why sure you can", he replied... "But then I get to call you darlin.'" [...] It was a deal. From then on, whenever <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> together it was hand in hand, and I was always his [...] "darlin.'" ...|$|E
