5|$|All species {{within the}} wolf-like canids possess 78 {{chromosomes}} {{and therefore can}} potentially interbreed. Genetic analysis reveals that hybridization takes place between gray wolves and jackals, creating a jackal-wolf hybrid. Hybridization also occurs between female golden jackals and male dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a jackal–dog hybrid. There was 11%–13% of ancient gene flow into the golden jackal from the population that was ancestral to wolves and dogs, and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% of the Israeli wolf genome is derived from admixure <b>with</b> <b>golden</b> jackals in ancient times.|$|E

5|$|The pyramid {{complex is}} unusual as the outer {{sections}} of the mortuary temple are offset {{to the south of}} {{the eastern side of the}} complex. This allowed Nyuserre to intercept and complete his father's causeway, which led from the valley temple close to the Nile to the pyramid itself on the desert edge. The valley temple of Nyuserre was thus built on the foundations laid by his father for his own unfinished valley temple. Once completed, it consisted of a portico with eight papyriform columns, its floor was of black basalt and its walls were made of limestone with painted reliefs above a dado of red granite. The back of the portico led to the causeway, the base of which was entirely covered in basalt, while its upper portions where decorated with numerous reliefs, some showing the king as a sphinx trampling over his enemies. The causeway was roofed by limestone blocks painted in blue <b>with</b> <b>golden</b> stars.|$|E
5|$|Wolves may {{kill and}} eat red foxes in {{disputes}} over carcasses. In areas in North America where red fox and coyote populations are sympatric, fox ranges {{tend to be}} located outside coyote territories. The principal cause of this separation {{is believed to be}} active avoidance of coyotes by the foxes. Interactions between the two species vary in nature, ranging from active antagonism to indifference. The majority of aggressive encounters are initiated by coyotes, and there are few reports of red foxes acting aggressively toward coyotes except when attacked or when their kits were approached. Foxes and coyotes have sometimes been seen feeding together. In Israel, red foxes share their habitat <b>with</b> <b>golden</b> jackals. Where their ranges meet, the two canids compete due to near identical diets. Foxes ignore jackal scents or tracks in their territories, and avoid close physical proximity with jackals themselves. In areas where jackals become very abundant, the population of foxes decreases significantly, apparently because of competitive exclusion.|$|E
