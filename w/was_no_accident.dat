5|$|Dor makes {{a strong}} feminist {{statement}} without being strident or shouting slogans. And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that bring them together, keep tugging at your heart. Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald was {{considered}} one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay higher prices for manufactured goods. It <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident,</b> Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|In late 1935, {{he turned}} to Frank C. Bennett, then President of Bennett Oil Corporation, President of Federal Oil of Houston, Texas, and Vice-President of Bennett Oil and Gas of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Merrill's choice of Bennett as an {{investor}} <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> or stroke of luck, as {{he knew that it}} was common for oil companies to invest in the development of airplanes, and frequently sponsored flights and other events to highlight the performance of their products. After Merrill’s convincing presentation, Bennett joined Merrill in forming the Bennett Aircraft Corporation of Wilmington, Delaware. The aircraft was to be a twin-engine (called bimotored in the 1930s), eight-place mid-wing monoplane with a conventional tail unit and retractable landing gear. It was powered by two wing-mounted Jacobs L-6 engines. The passenger cabin for six passengers was behind the two-crew flight deck.|$|E

25|$|That the {{bodywork}} enclosing all of Chapman's {{innovative technology}} was similar in appearance to the Vanwall Grand Prix cars <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident,</b> as both cars had been sculpted by pioneer automotive aerodynamacist Frank Costin. As {{with many of}} Lotus's competition cars, the aluminium used to construct the bodywork was extremely thin and offered {{little in the way}} of support for the underlying chassis members. The car was extremely low and compact, with the bonnet barely reaching the same height as the tops of the front wheels, despite the smaller diameters used from the 1959 season onward. The driver sat in a slightly reclined position — nowhere near as extremely inclined as Chapman would later inflict upon his pilots but still unusual for its day — and behind the driver rose a stubby rear fin, incorporating the fuel tank.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{explosion}} on the USS Sizemore (NCC-74012-A) the Excelsior {{returns from the}} Delta Quadrant via the gateway to Starbase 911 in Alpha Quadrant. Lorhrok reveals to Acting Captain Dovan that Leo Amara's death <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident.</b> Due to continuing difficulties arising from Lorhrok's junior grade rank, Dovan appoints him a full Lieutenant and acting First Officer (Episode #202). Yubari is kidnapped and held on the Renegade, but manages to escape, kidnapping Brahms in turn. While trying to restore a deleted isolinear chip, Rol shoots Lorhrok, apparently {{under the influence of}} an external force. As she lays dying, Cortez promotes Dovan to full commander, gives him co-ordinates to follow and mentions Dexter Remmick (Episode #203). While interrogating Brahms, Dovan reveals Cortez' heading to be 114 mark 388 mark 8 in the Delta Quadrant. Brahms' forces break him out of the Excelsior 's brig, but Rol remains behind to deliver a message to Dovan (Episode #204).|$|E
25|$|The {{classic example}} of {{targeted}} development is imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule kinase. The genetic abnormality causing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) {{has been known for}} a long time to be a chromosomal translocation creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident.</b> Brian Druker, working in Oregon Health & Science University, had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase with a drug would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with Novartis chemist Nicholas Lydon, who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, imatinib was found to have the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve complete haematological remission. It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect.|$|E

This <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident.</b> Frazee and Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert were friends, and American League president Ban Johnson's attempts to drive Frazee out of the game had caused the five teams loyal to Johnson to make no deals with the Red Sox as long as Frazee owned the club, leaving only the Yankees and White Sox as trading partners. When the White Sox's reputation was destroyed in the Black Sox Scandal, Frazee's only option for trades was to deal with the Yankees.|$|E
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, I can talk to any member of the Cabinet; and I could go see them within 24 hours.... It <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident</b> that the Chesapeake Bay was mentioned in the President's State of the Union address. That took a lot of hard work".|$|E

One soldier said the live fire started from the high-rise Palestinian blocks known as [...] "the twins"; the shooter was firing at the IDF post, he said. The soldier added that he had not seen the al-Durrahs. The Israelis returned fire on a Palestinian station 30 metres {{to the left of the}} al-Durrahs. Their weapons were equipped with optics that allowed them to fire accurately, according to the soldier, and none of them had switched to automatic fire. In the view of the soldier, the shooting of Jamal and Muhammad <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident.</b> The shots did not come from the Israeli position, he said.|$|E

500|$|Suspicion soon {{arose in}} the {{threatened}} city that the fire <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident.</b> The swirling winds carried sparks and burning flakes long distances to lodge on thatched roofs and in wooden gutters, causing seemingly unrelated house fires to break out far from their source and giving rise to rumours that fresh fires were being set on purpose. Foreigners were immediately suspects because of the current Second Anglo-Dutch War. Fear and suspicion hardened into certainty on Monday, as reports circulated of imminent invasion and of foreign undercover agents seen casting [...] "fireballs" [...] into houses, or caught with hand grenades or matches. There was a wave of street violence. William Taswell saw a mob loot the shop of a French painter and level it to the ground, and watched in horror as a blacksmith walked up to a Frenchman {{in the street and}} hit him over the head with an iron bar.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, Historian Emeritus Paul E.

He said that {{the heat from the}} engine was [...] "fantastic", but that he placed mica sheets and deflecting plates to direct the jet blast away from the wooden fuselage. Garber wrote that as Coandă's aircraft began to move forward and rise from the ground, [...] "the exhaust flame, instead of fanning outward, curved inward and ignited the aircraft." [...] In this interview Coandă said that he brought the aircraft back to earth under control, but the landing was [...] "abrupt" [...] and he was thrown clear of the airframe which was consumed completely by flame, the engine reduced to [...] "a few handfuls of white powder." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} days of women’s Olympic basketball, only six {{countries}} competed in the tournament, and the host country received an automatic entry. Therefore, there were 22 countries competing for the remaining five spots in 1980 Olympics held in Moscow. In the preliminary tournament, the Opals fell to the USA and Hungary, and did not qualify for the Olympics. [...] Three years later, the team traveled to Brazil for the 1983 World Championships, looking to demonstrate that their 1979 success <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident.</b> [...] Despite an early victory over Japan, Australia failed to advance and finished in 11th place. The Opals were not expected to participate at the 1984 Olympic Games held in Los Angeles. However, following the decision by Cuba to boycott the games, the door was opened for the Opals to compete in their first ever Olympics. Led by head coach Brendan Flynn, and team captain Jenny Cheesman, the Opals played competitively in every game, but finished fifth out of the six teams.|$|E

500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 2010 Hungarian Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello {{attempted}} to pass Schumacher down the inside on the main straight. Schumacher closed the inside line to force Barrichello onto the outside, but Barrichello persisted on the inside at , despite the close proximity of a concrete wall and Schumacher leaving him only inches to spare. Barrichello said [...] "It is the most dangerous thing that I have been through", and [...] "There is not a rule for that, but between ourselves we should take a line, stick to it and that's it." [...] Schumacher said that [...] "Obviously there was space enough to go through. We didn't touch, so I guess I just left enough space for him to come through." [...] Ross Brawn said [...] "at {{the end of the}} day he gave him enough space. You can argue that it was marginal, but it was just tough – tough racing." [...] A range of ex-drivers and commentators were highly critical of Schumacher. Although there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>accident,</b> the race steward, the same Derek Warwick of the 1991 Nürburgring incident, wanted to black flag Schumacher since that [...] "would have shown a better example to our young drivers". The Hungaroring incident was ruled to be dangerous and Schumacher received a 10 place grid penalty for the next race. Schumacher accepted the decision, and apologised.|$|E

Professor Weston, the chief villain of Lewis' Space Trilogy, is an outspoken proponent of this idea, and in Out of the Silent Planet Lewis opposes to it the depiction of the virtuous and stoic Martians/Malacandrians who choose to die with their dying planet, even though they possessed the technology to cross space and colonise Earth.|$|E
