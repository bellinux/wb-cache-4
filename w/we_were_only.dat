500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Kirchherr and her art school friends were {{involved}} in the European existentialist movement whose followers were later nicknamed [...] "Exis" [...] by Lennon. In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, and we tried to dress like the French existentialists... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried to be cool, as we call it now." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the eighteen-month design process, Samsung {{implemented}} stringent {{security measures}} and procedures to maintain secrecy of the eventual design until its launch. Designers worked on three prototypes concurrently while regarding {{each of them}} as the final product. Doing so required a constant duplication of effort, as they had to repeat the same process for all three prototypes. The prototypes, of which taking photos was forbidden, were locked in a separate laboratory, accessible only by core designers. They were transported by trusted company employees, instead of third-party couriers. [...] "Because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> permitted to see the products and others weren't," [...] explained Principal Engineer Lee Byung-Joon, [...] "we couldn't send pictures or drawings. We had to explain the Galaxy SIII {{with all sorts of}} words." [...] Despite such security measures, specifications of one of the three units were leaked by Vietnamese Web site Tinhte, although it was not the selected design.|$|E

500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, {{there has been so}} much talk about our side and a lot of pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and say <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E

2500|$|I was at {{the post}} office with my Mum and Auntie [...] They put us in the police ute and said they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [...] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, trying not to be left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were {{screaming}} in the back of that car. When we got to Broome they put me and my cousin in the Broome lock-up. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> ten years old. We were in the lock-up for two days waiting for the boat to Perth.|$|E

2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{the script and}} starting work on casting and production, Madonna realised that the budget of film {{was going to be}} high. Simpson's character had around 80costume changes with dresses by designers like Balenciaga, Christian Dior, Madeleine Vionnet and Elsa Schiaparelli. Most of the actual dresses were kept in museum archives, hence unobtainable to Madonna. Instead, many of the couture houses offered to create the dresses for her. While casting for the film, she asked for a Michael O'Connor wedding dress, in display at the National Museum of Costume in Scotland, for a scene where Riseborough would wear it. National Museum of Costume general manager Margaret Roberts said they were happy to send the dress to Madonna. [...] "Our Marriage in the Movies exhibition is packed with fabulous gowns that tell a story not only {{about the history of the}} period they represent, but also of Hollywood glamour and style," [...] she said. [...] This is a dress that was made for the movies, so when we received the request from Madonna's production company, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>only</b> too happy to oblige." [...] Other fashion designers working for the film included John Galliano and Issa, who provided clothes, Pierre Cartier the jewels, and Stephen Jones the hats.|$|E
