5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), <b>warm</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E
5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was <b>warm</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E
5|$|As {{the end of}} his Northwestern career {{approached}} in November 1963, Parseghian called Father Edmund Joyce, the vice president and chairman of the athletics board at Notre Dame, a Catholic university near South Bend, Indiana. He asked whether Hugh Devore, who was then interim head football coach, was going to be given the job on a longer-term basis. When Joyce said the university was searching for a new coach, Parseghian expressed interest in the job. Joyce did not immediately seem <b>warm</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea, however, and Parseghian explored an offer to coach at the University of Miami, where his old friend Andy Gustafson had been promoted from head coach to athletic director. Notre Dame was also considering Dan Devine for its coaching job, but ultimately offered it to Parseghian. Parseghian waffled at first, recalling his father's dislike of Catholics who had {{played a role in the}} Armenian deportations, but accepted in December and was given a salary of about $20,000 a year ($ today).|$|E

5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn <b>warm</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E

William Labov, although <b>warm</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> construction of a panlectal grammar, argued that it should be based in speakers' linguistic competence.

[...] A planned parade from Newark, New Jersey never materialized, and the families found themselves moving into barely completed, temporarily assigned units, located {{at the edge of the}} project so as to make the units more easily accessible across the mud flats that were supposed to be the town's roads, curbs and sidewalks. [...] Most units were not yet connected to utilities, and in some cases would not be for several months, even as winter approached. [...] Early residents vividly remember huddling around car radios, the only radios available because of lack of electricity, to hear the news of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. [...] No fire protection was provided, but a few guards were hired by the government and provided with bicycles for [...] "law enforcement". [...] The school was not yet under construction, and all school-age children were sent to three different school districts. [...] As would be expected, Winfield's neighbors were not <b>warm</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new residents and were even heard to make rude comments as the township's residents trudged into their communities, in their mud-covered boots, to make food purchases. [...] Transportation to the Kearny Shipyards was difficult if not impossible when the bus provided by the government broke down. [...] Although one would think things could not be worse, there was an outbreak of polio in Winfield, and the entire town was quarantined. [...] But even with these difficulties, there would soon be far more applicants than available units. [...] Quickly the township's population increased and the new residents were employed not only by the Kearny shipyards, but also by Merck & Company, National Pneumatic Company, Lawrence Engineering and Research Company, American Type Founders Co., American Gas Accumulator, Singer Manufacturing, and many other manufacturers.|$|E
