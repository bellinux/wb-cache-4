500|$|Strickland {{was born}} in Blackshear, Georgia to Susan Strickland, a nurse, and Dee Strickland, a high school {{football}} coach, principal and superintendent. KaDee's birthname is Katherine Dee; her parents combined the K in Katherine with her father's name to make KaDee. She was raised in Patterson, Georgia, which she said is a [...] "one-stoplight town", {{and she had a}} job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film Annie Hall (1975) and was, as she put it, [...] "wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people. I wanted to be in it". During her childhood, she was well known locally {{as a member of the}} Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements (she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary, middle and high school, the student council president and a cheerleader). She never considered a career in the performing arts until her participation in a one-act play performed by students of her high school: [...] " [...] the minute I set foot on stage, that was it. Destiny took over. There were no other options. I felt like I fit my skin, I knew what I <b>was</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> do", Strickland said.|$|E

500|$|In 1901, {{the newly}} created American League had {{attracted}} several of the top players in the competing National League to join its ranks. Rogers declined Lajoie's request {{for an increase in}} salary and as a result, Lajoie jumped to the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics, owned by former Phillies' part-owner Benjamin Shibe and managed by Connie Mack. Frank Hough offered Lajoie the contract on behalf of Mack. [...] "Hough offered me $24,000 ($ in current dollar terms) for four years. You can bet I signed in a hurry", Lajoie said. Lajoie was considered [...] "the first superstar" [...] to join the newly formed AL. He was also the first player whose yearly salary was for $4,000 ($ in current dollar terms). [...] "The Phillies opened their season and drew 6,000 fans. A week later, when we opened, there were 16,000 in the stands. The American League <b>was</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> stay", Lajoie later said. Lajoie's batting average that year was [...]426 (it was originally recorded at [...]405, later changed to [...]422 before finally revised again to [...]426). The batting average mark became the all-time AL record after the number was revised. Previously, Ty Cobb and George Sisler had been credited with having the AL's all-time mark. That same year in a game against the Chicago White Sox' Clark Griffith, Lajoie became the second Major Leaguer to be intentionally walked with the bases loaded in an 117 game after Abner Dalrymple in 1881. For the 1901 season, Lajoie led the majors in doubles (48), and led the majors in hits (232), batting average (.426), runs (145), on-base (.463) and slugging percentage (.643), and total bases (350). His 125 RBIs led the AL and his 14 home runs were a career-best and his 48 doubles are a Philadelphia Athletics' record. Mack said of Lajoie, [...] "He plays so naturally and so easily it looks like lack of effort." [...] Author Robert Kelly writes: ...|$|E

Some business experts felt that nothing could prevent the concentration of industry and therefore big business <b>was</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> stay. As a result, leaders like Roosevelt began to [...] "regulate," [...] but not limit, the growth and operation of corporate monopolies, although Brandeis wanted the trend to bigness slowed or even reversed.

[...] Her joining the Royal Shakespeare Company though, finally won her parents over. However, in a 2004 {{interview}} Oberman noted that her father's death seven years earlier prevented his seeing the development of her career and her national success as an actor: [...] "I've {{come a long way in}} my career since he died and I wish he <b>was</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> see it.

2500|$|In July 2003, British musicologists {{stumbled}} upon superficial {{similarities between the}} lyric and rhyming schemes of [...] "Yesterday" [...] and Nat King Cole's and Frankie Laine's [...] "Answer Me, My Love"; originally a German song by Gerhard Winkler and Fred Rauch called Mütterlein, it was a number 1 hit for Laine on the UK charts in 1953 as [...] "Answer Me, O Lord", leading to speculation that McCartney had {{been influenced by the}} song. McCartney's publicists denied any resemblance between [...] "Answer Me, My Love" [...] and [...] "Yesterday".

2500|$|When {{thanks to}} Besht, the Hasidism started taking {{a shape of}} {{large-scale}} social phenomenon, in 1772 the same Brody Community issued a famous harsh ban against its own [...] "son and offspring" [...] Besht and [...] "illness infected" [...] Hasidim with the strange exception of allowing the prayer in Lurianic rite. Gershon Kutover (Brody native, secretary to Baal Shem Tov and his brother-in-law, who settled in Palestine later) <b>was</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> defend his employer when Brody sages were preparing to anathematise him, and so they did. Brody ban of 1772 encompassed {{a great number of}} Hasidic practices, including Hasidic shehitah (slaughter by Talmud forbidden honed shehitah knives / geschleefeene) that irritated the Misnagdim. Brody ban justly predicted the impact the movement might have in Galicia. The proclamation is included in the pamphlet Zamir arisim ve-harevot surim. Brodyites expressed their concern that the new heresy can bring a catastrophe on whole Polish Jewry discrediting God's name {{in the same way as}} Frankists and Sabbateans did. Brody sages feared that the sect was particularly dangerous as there was no high authority to interfere after dissolution of the Great Council of Fours Lands. Brody declaration caused great furore on the tsaddiks when learning of it, who in their turn became even more active in a fight for a believer, as a cause of it.|$|E
