5|$|Congress {{declared}} war in June 1812, and after its adjournment, Johnson returned to Kentucky to recruit volunteers. So many men responded that he chose only those with horses, {{and raised a}} body of mounted rifles. Johnson recruited 300 men, divided into three companies, who elected him major. They merged with another battalion, forming a regiment of 500 men, <b>with</b> <b>Johnson</b> as colonel.|$|E
5|$|McAleer's rift <b>with</b> <b>Johnson,</b> {{along with}} his sudden retirement, damaged his {{professional}} reputation, and he received little recognition for his contributions to baseball. Today, he is most often remembered for initiating the customary request that the President of the United States throw out the first ball of the season.|$|E
5|$|McAleer's {{tenure as}} {{part-owner}} of the Red Sox {{came to a}} swift end. On July 15, 1913, McAleer became involved in a dispute with the AL president, Ban Johnson, when McAleer forced the resignation of Red Sox manager Jake Stahl, one of Johnson's closest friends. While McAleer claimed that he released Stahl because of a foot injury preventing Stahl from serving as a player-manager, rumors suggested {{that the two men}} had strong personal differences. Following a bitter quarrel <b>with</b> <b>Johnson,</b> McAleer sold his holdings in the Red Sox. His feud <b>with</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{turned out to be a}} lifelong affair, despite efforts taken by their mutual friend, Charles Comiskey, to smooth over the rift. While McAleer never publicly discussed the disagreement that spurred his retirement, he supposedly relayed his version of events to Frank B. Ward, a sports reporter with The Youngstown Daily Vindicator, with the understanding that the details remain confidential until McAleer's death.|$|E

5|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 178, with Earnhardt leading Johnson and Vickers. That lap, Burton (in fifth) had a flat left {{rear tire}} and lost a lap. The field then formed a single line, with most remaining in that formation {{for the rest}} of the race. On the final lap, Johnson and Vickers left turn two <b>with</b> <b>Johnson</b> moving out of line to pass Earnhardt. When Vickers tried to move out <b>with</b> <b>Johnson</b> to provide drafting assistance, he clipped Johnson's right rear quarter panel. Johnson clipped Earnhardt, sending both drivers into the infield. The yellow flag went out and the field was frozen in place, with the order of finish determined by where the drivers were when the caution began. This gave Vickers the victory (the first of his career), although he was booed by the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Following Kennedy's death, Marcus {{maintained}} {{close ties}} <b>with</b> <b>Johnson</b> and his administration, {{being considered for}} diplomatic posts to France and to the United Nations General Assembly while continuing to run his company and providing the wedding dresses for both the Johnsons' daughters, personally assisting Luci Johnson in selecting the designer for her own dress and the styles for the bridesmaids' gowns. After Johnson's retirement, Marcus's invitations were among the few the former president and his wife continued to accept. Marcus's own daughter Wendy joined Mrs. Johnson's staff {{for a time in}} 1963, working under Mrs. Johnson's personal secretary, Liz Carpenter.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Kentucky Democrats {{nominated}} Linn Boyd for governor, but Boyd {{declined the}} nomination. Powell {{was chosen to}} replace Boyd on the ticket, {{largely due to the}} influence of James Guthrie. The Whig party nominated Senator John J. Crittenden, and the race was complicated by former Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson's announcement that he would run as an independent Democratic candidate. Knowing the Democrats' chances were dimmed by having two candidates in the race, Powell arranged a meeting <b>with</b> <b>Johnson,</b> following which the latter withdrew his candidacy and pledged his support to Powell. Nevertheless, Crittenden won the election.|$|E

5|$|Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was an {{able and}} {{hard-working}} man, but {{difficult to deal}} <b>with.</b> <b>Johnson</b> both admired and was exasperated by his War Secretary, who, in combination with General of the Army Grant, worked to undermine the president's Southern policy from within his own administration. Johnson considered firing Stanton, but respected him for his wartime service as secretary. Stanton, for his part, feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign, despite his public disagreements with his president.|$|E

5|$|The Lakers {{returned}} to the NBA Finals in 1982, time time led by new coach Pat Riley, in a rematch against the 76ers. The 76ers defeated the Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals in a 7-game series, but were defeated by Lakers in 6 games, <b>with</b> <b>Johnson</b> being named Finals MVP. Upon losing their past three NBA Finals appearances, the 76ers decided that they needed one more piece to become champions, and enlisted Malone as their premier target. On September 15, 1982, they traded for Malone, who was also the league's reigning MVP.|$|E

Dodge advanced to third with 118 and Ford was bumped to fourth with 117. 5.04 million people watched the race on television.

5|$|The teams {{headed to}} Headingley for the Fourth Test with Barnes still unfit. Australia made two {{changes for the}} Test. Middle-order batsman Neil Harvey came in for Barnes, while Ron Saggers {{replaced}} Don Tallonwho had a finger injurybehind the stumps. Brown was not recalled to open with Morris; instead, Hassett was promoted from the middle-order to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. Australia thus jettisoned the experiment of opening the batting <b>with</b> <b>Johnson,</b> who had managed only one and six in the previous Test.|$|E
5|$|With Simmons' help, Johnson {{discovers that}} the Watchdogs have hacked S.H.I.E.L.D.'s list using {{tracking}} wristwatches given to all registered Inhumans. The next Inhuman {{on the list}} is J.T. James, an Inhuman with explosive abilities who spent time <b>with</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{under the influence of the}} parasitic Inhuman Hive. Johnson and Simmons remove James's wristwatch, but he betrays them to the Watchdogs with the promise that they would kill him once he helped destroy the other Inhumans—James hates himself and his Inhuman identity. Before they can investigate the Darkhold, Coulson and Mack are alerted to James's wristwatch being removed, and arrive to help Johnson and Simmons fight off the Watchdogs and arrest James.|$|E
5|$|Few {{other details}} are {{known about the}} singer's childhood. At some point he met another blind musician, Madkin Butler, who had a {{powerful}} singing and preaching style that influenced Johnson's own vocal delivery and repertoire. Adam Booker, a blind minister interviewed by the blues historian Samuel Charters in the 1950s, recalled that while visiting his father in Hearne, Johnson would perform religious songs on street corners with a tin cup tied to the neck of his Stella guitar to collect money. Occasionally, Johnson would play on the same street as Blind Lemon Jefferson, but {{the extent of the}} two songsters' involvement with each other is unknown. In 1926 or early 1927, Johnson established an unregistered marriage with Willie B. Harris, who occasionally sang on the street with him and at benefits for the Marlin Church of God in Christ <b>with</b> <b>Johnson</b> accompanied on piano. From the relationship, Johnson had a daughter, Sam Faye Johnson Kelly, in 1931. The blues guitarist L. C. Robinson recalled that his sister Anne also claimed to have been married to Johnson in the late 1920s.|$|E
