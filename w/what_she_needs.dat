5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E

500|$|Later on, Meg knocks Brian out, {{puts him}} {{in the trunk of}} his car and drives away. Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with {{packaging}} tape and is about to rape Brian. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needs,</b> and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) [...] "I know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needs...</b> Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her." [...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [...] "hwhip" [...] (with emphasis on the [...] "h") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.|$|E

[...] Unfortunately, Vernon is murdered in his home by a woman impersonating Nico, named Petra, just before the former gets there. When the two confront each other inside the apartment, Petra fails to kill Nico, and flees, leaving a few clues behind. [...] Nico quickly tries to find <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> to prove her innocence, but after the police arrive to investigate the murder, the detective in charge chooses to arrest her, based on the witness account of Vernon's landlady.

[...] Finding and managing to open a hidden safe, Nico finds diagrams and a DVD, with the latter she plays back at her own apartment before showing it to Andre Lobineau, an old friend of hers, finding it contained a message from Vernon about what he found, believing the bizarre storms happening across the world are a sign of a global catastrophe in the making. [...] Finding out about an abandoned theatre on the Ile St Louis in Paris, connected to a mask the killer had with her when she fled Vernon's murder, Nico heads out to investigate it but gets captured by Petra and her boss, Susarro.|$|E
2500|$|On July 25, 2011, Erica stabs David {{after she}} escapes from the {{clutches}} of her look-alike Jane Campbell that posed as her. She is taken to Oak Haven and there she first sees Janet [...] "from another Planet" [...] Green Dillon, then Annie Lavery, then Marian Colby Chandler, and finally she sees Dixie Cooney Martin. On August 11, 2011, Jane takes the blame for stabbing David so Erica can remain free. During the last few episodes of the show Erica is offered a chance to write a movie about her book (much {{to the dismay of}} Jack who wants to marry her). This leads to a fallout between the two at Stuart Chandler's welcome home party. As Jack leaves the party, Erica admits in front of everyone that she needs and loves Jack, to which he replies by bitterly telling her, Rhett Butler-style, that [...] "frankly," [...] he doesn't give a damn about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needs.</b> [...] "This is not the ending I wanted," [...] Erica says to Opal. [...] "Oh, you've done it, now you'll never get it back," [...] Opal tells her. [...] "Just watch me," [...] says Erica. As Erica goes after Jack, JR fires his pistol, ending the show. It is implied that the bullet has hit Erica as she is last to be shown before the screen blacks out.|$|E

2500|$|Lopez {{was drawn}} to the [...] "contagious" [...] melodies of Michael Jackson's album Off the Wall (1979), which led her to summon the record's mixer and engineer, Bruce Swedien, to work on This Is Me... Then. Lopez felt that Jackson's [...] "clear and spacious" [...] records made her feel a [...] "certain way". She said, [...] "It has such a {{beautiful}} quality on it, and every time I looked at a record , it would be engineered and mixed by Bruce Swedien. I was like, 'Who is this guy? I want this guy.' So I tracked him down and he was like, 'I want to do something with her. I know exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needs.</b> I'm coming in.' And it made a huge difference." [...] Lopez worked closely with longtime producer Cory Rooney on the album. Discussing the process, Rooney stated, [...] "This is by far the best record that I've ever worked on or done [...] In the beginning of the recording [...] she said it's important that she makes a record that is a few notches above everything else she did. She wanted to show growth musically and vocally." [...] Other producers Lopez worked with primarily were Troy Oliver, Loren Hill and Dan Shea. She had previously collaborated with Oliver and Shea on J.Lo (2001).|$|E

6000|$|She {{looked at}} me with a sudden passing {{tenderness}} in her eyes. [...] "Yes, all things, Hubert. All things. But we mustn't talk of that--though I begin to see my way clearer now. You shall be rewarded for your constancy at last, dear knight-errant. As to my chaperon, I'm not afraid of her boring me; she bores herself, poor lady; one can see that, just to look at her; but she will be much less bored if she has us two to travel with. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> is constant companionship, bright talk, excitement. She has come away from London, where she swims with the crowd; she has no resources of her own, no work, no head, no interests. Accustomed to a whirl of foolish gaieties, she wearies her small brain; thrown back upon herself, she bores herself at once, because she has nothing interesting to tell herself. She absolutely requires somebody else to interest her. She can't even amuse herself with a book for three minutes together. See, she has a yellow-backed French novel now, and she is only able to read five lines at a time; then she gets tired and glances about her listlessly. What she wants is someone gay, laid on, to divert her all the time from her own inanity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't think so. It {{is lack of}} {{judgment}} partially. A little tact and taste will fix her all right. Dutcher is fairly well-to-do, and she is all he has. He wrote me to get her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed,</b> but I'll leave that to you girls." ...|$|R
2500|$|Nilsson {{kept her}} home in a good, clean condition, which made mothers more willing to leave their {{unwanted}} children in her care.

6000|$|... "Pray do"--and the Count made a {{great and}} {{friendly}} point of it. [...] "You see the confidence I have in you." [...] Longmore said nothing and M. de Mauves puffed his cigar reflectively and watched the smoke. [...] "Madame de Mauves," [...] he said at last, [...] "is a rather singular person." [...] And then while our young man shifted his position and wondered whether {{he was going to}} [...] "explain" [...] Madame de Mauves, [...] "Being, as you are, her fellow countryman," [...] this lady's husband pursued, [...] "I don't mind speaking frankly. She's a little overstrained; the most charming woman in the world, as you see, but a little volontaire and morbid. Now you see she has taken this extraordinary fancy for solitude. I can't get her to go anywhere, to see any one. When my friends present themselves she's perfectly polite, but it cures them of coming again. She doesn't do herself justice, and I expect every day to hear two or three of them say to me, 'Your wife's jolie a croquer: what a pity she hasn't a little esprit.' You must have found out that she has really a great deal. But, to tell the whole truth, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>needs</b> is to forget herself. She sits alone for hours poring over her English books and looking at life through that terrible brown fog they seem to me--don't they?--to fling over the world. I doubt if your English authors," [...] the Count went on with a serenity which Longmore afterwards characterised as sublime, [...] "are very sound reading for young married women. I don't pretend to know much about them; but I remember that not long after our marriage Madame de Mauves undertook to read me one day some passages from a certain Wordsworth--a poet highly esteemed, it appears, chez vous. It was as if she had taken me by the nape of the neck and held my head for half an hour over a basin of soupe aux choux: I felt as if we ought to ventilate the drawing-room before any one called. But I suppose you know him--ce genie-la. Every nation has its own ideals of every kind, but when I remember some of OUR charming writers! I think at all events my wife never forgave me and that it was a real shock to her to find she had married a man who had very much the same taste in literature as in cookery. But you're a man of general culture, a man of the world," [...] said M. de Mauves, turning to Longmore but looking hard at the seal of his watchguard. [...] "You can talk about everything, and I'm sure you like Alfred de Musset as well as Monsieur Wordsworth. Talk to her about everything you can, Alfred de Musset included. Bah! I forgot you're going. Come back then as soon as possible and report on your travels. If my wife too would make a little voyage it would do her great good. It would enlarge her horizon"--and M. de Mauves made a series of short nervous jerks with his stick in the air--"it would wake up her imagination. She's too much of one piece, you know--it would show her how much one may bend without breaking." [...] He paused a moment and gave two or three vigorous puffs. Then turning to his companion again with eyebrows expressively raised: [...] "I hope you admire my candour. I beg you to believe I wouldn't say such things to one of US!" ...|$|E
