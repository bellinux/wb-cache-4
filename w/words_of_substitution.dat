Word obfuscation is used in adversarial communication by terrorist or criminals for conveying their messages without getting red-flagged by security and intelligence agencies intercepting or scanning messages (such as emails and telephone conversations). ConceptNet is a freely available semantic network represented as a directed graph consisting of nodes as concepts and edges as assertions of common sense about these concepts. We present a solution approach exploiting vast amount of semantic knowledge in ConceptNet for addressing the technically challenging problem <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>substitution</b> in adversarial communication. We frame the given problem as a textual reasoning and context inference task and utilize ConceptNet's natural-language-processing tool-kit for determining word substitution. We use ConceptNet to compute the conceptual similarity between any two given terms and define a Mean Average Conceptual Similarity (MACS) metric to identify out-of-context terms.

For a reinforced concrete member, <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> conventional concrete with ECC can significantly improve the deformation characteristics in terms of reinforced composite tensile or shear strength and energy dissipation ability. In this paper, a number of RC/ECC composite beam-column joints have been tested under reversed cyclic loading to study the effect <b>of</b> <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> concrete with ECC in the joint zone on the seismic behaviors of composite members. The experimental parameters include shear reinforcement ratio in the joint zone, axial load level on the column and <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> concrete with ECC or not. According to the test results, for the specimens without shear reinforcement in the joint zone, <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> concrete with ECC in the joint zone cannot change the brittle shear failure in the joint zone, but can significantly increase the load capacity and ductility of the beam-column joint specimens, {{as well as the}} energy dissipation ability due to high ductility and shear strength of ECC material.

It has provided a new way of thinking about cognitive processing, emphasizing its low-level mechanisms. One supposed advantage of connectionism is its biological plausibility.
