5|$|Between 1860 and 1863 Busch wrote {{over one}} hundred {{articles}} for the Münchener Bilderbogen and Fliegende Blätter, but he felt his dependence on publisher Kaspar Braun had become constricting. Busch appointed Dresden publisher Heinrich Richter, the son of Saxon painter Ludwig Richter, as his new publisher— Richter's press {{up to that time}} was producing children's books and religious Christian devotional literature. Busch could choose themes, although Richter raised some concerns regarding four suggested illustrated tales that were proposed. However, some were published in the 1864 as Bilderpossen, proving a failure. Busch then offered Richter the manuscripts of Max and Moritz, <b>waiving</b> any fees. Richter rejected the manuscript as sales prospects seemed poor. Busch's former publisher, Braun, purchased the right to Max and Moritz for 1,000 gulden, corresponding to approximately double the annual wage of a craftsman.|$|E
5|$|Sverdrup {{enlisted in}} the US Army at Fort Snelling, Minnesota on 26 July 1918. He was posted to Camp Devens, Massachusetts for {{training}} with the 36th Division. While there he took advantage of a regulation <b>waiving</b> the normal five-year residency requirement {{for members of the}} armed services seeking to take out US citizenship. Sverdrup formally took the oath as a citizen in Boston on 30 September 1918. The US Army then sent him to the Field Artillery's Officer Training Center at Camp Zachary Taylor, near Louisville, Kentucky, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 18 January 1919. The war having ended, Sverdrup was immediately placed in the inactive reserves. He was honorably discharged after nominally serving two five-year terms on 17 January 1929.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{scholarship}} {{was extended to}} permit Sullivan to spend one year in Leipzig, he stayed for three years. There, he became friendly with the impresario Carl Rosa and the violinist Joseph Joachim. For his last year at Leipzig, his father scraped together the money for living expenses, and the conservatoire assisted by <b>waiving</b> its fees. Sullivan credited his Leipzig period with tremendous musical growth. His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a set of incidental music to Shakespeare's The Tempest. Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862, a year after his return to London, and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer.|$|E
5|$|Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Pembleton (Andre Braugher), an {{excellent}} detective but a lone wolf, {{that he must}} work with a partner. Pembleton ends up investigating {{the death of a}} 65-year-old man with rookie detective Bayliss (Kyle Secor). Bayliss initially believes the death to be a heart attack, but Pembleton correctly determines it is a murder because the man's car is missing. Police later arrest a man named Johnny (Alexander Chaplin) who is found driving the dead man's car. During an interrogation, Pembleton fools Johnny into <b>waiving</b> his Miranda Rights, then sneakily persuades him into confessing to the murder. Bayliss, although convinced of Johnny's guilt, nevertheless questions the ethics of Pembleton's approach, prompting Pembleton to yell angrily at him {{in front of the other}} officers. The episode ends with Bayliss responding to his first homicide as the primary detective: the brutal murder of an 11-year-old girl named Adena Watson.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 2013, Morris {{signed with}} the Philadelphia 76ers. As the September 28 {{training}} camp date approached, Morris was expected to battle with Tony Wroten for the backup point guard position behind Michael Carter-Williams. When Carter-Williams missed games, it was Wroten who moved into the starting lineup. On November 16, 2013 he scored a NBA regular season career high 20 points along with 2 assists in a 13598-point loss to the New Orleans Pelicans. On November 20, 2013, he was waived by the 76ers as part of roster moves that included signing Elliot Williams and Lorenzo Brown and <b>waiving</b> Kwame Brown. In December, {{he was one of}} several guards to work out with the Memphis Grizzlies. That month, he was also considered by the Los Angeles Lakers when Kobe Bryant was injured since point guards Blake, Nash and Jordan Farmar were all injured. The Lakers, however, decided to sign Kendall Marshall who was averageing 19.4 points and 9.6 assists in the D-League at the time.|$|E
50|$|If the {{employer}} alleges that the employee <b>waived</b> a breach by not resigning, each breach {{needs to be}} looked at {{to see if it was}} <b>waived</b> separately, but even if a breach was <b>waived,</b> the last straw revives it for the purpose of determining whether overall there was a repudiation.|$|R

5|$|On September 30, 2013, Sims {{signed with}} the Boston Celtics. He {{was one of four}} nonguaranteed {{training}} camp invites (along with Damen Bell-Holter, Kammron Taylor and Chris Babb), vying for the final roster spot after accounting for the 14 guaranteed contracts. He was one of three small forwards invited to camp, along with Jeff Green, Gerald Wallace. On October 26, 2013, he was waived by the Celtics who waived all four nonguaranteed invitees reducing their roster to 14. After <b>waiving</b> the four players, Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said all four were welcome to join the team's D-League affiliate, Maine Red Claws, if they were willing to accept the low paying salary instead of higher paying offers overseas. Sims {{was the only one of}} the four who did not sign with the Red Claws by the end of the month. That year, he went on to sign with Hapoel Gilboa Galil of the Israeli Basketball Super League. In August 2014, he signed with Jeonju KCC Egis of the Korean Basketball League.|$|E
5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed <b>waiving</b> consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E
5|$|The single's {{music video}} was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was {{inspired}} by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, {{in the middle of a}} large meadow. She awakes, sad and depressed, wearing battered and disheveled clothing. As she walks down the stairs, Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer, apparently for the first time in many years, escaping from the misery she once called home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while <b>waiving</b> her arms in the air.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} five types of grain {{are subject to}} the law of challah: wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye. Quantities of dough made from these {{different}} grains are counted together. They were also subject to the prohibition of the consumption of new produce before the <b>waiving</b> of the first sheaf, and to the prohibition of reaping prior to Passover. If they took root prior to the <b>waiving</b> of the first sheaf, the <b>waiving</b> of the first sheaf released them for consumption. But if not, they were prohibited until the next <b>waiving</b> of the first sheaf. The Mishnah taught that rice, millet, poppy seed, sesame, and legumes are exempt from challah (for though they are sometimes made into dough, they are not capable of leavening), as are less than five-fourths of a kav, or about 3½ pounds (the minimum subject to challah) of the five kinds of grain subject to challah. Sponge-biscuits, honey cakes, dumplings, pancakes, and dough made from a mixture of consecrated and unconsecrated grain are also exempt from challah.|$|E
