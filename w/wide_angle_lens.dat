25|$|On 29 March 2012 a {{prototype}} of a new camera was presented by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) {{for the detection of}} gamma radiation. Images were made with a <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>lens,</b> the amount of contamination was presented in six different colors, the highest concentrations were red, after this yellow, green and purple. The camera was tested in February on different locations in Fukushima, the very accurate images of the contamination had already proven it effectiveness in the decontamination effort.|$|E
25|$|The images above {{attempt to}} explain the {{relation}} between the precession of the Earth's axis and the shift in the equinoxes. These images show the position of the Earth's axis on the celestial sphere, a fictitious sphere which places the stars according to their position as seen from Earth, regardless of their actual distance. The first image shows the celestial sphere from the outside, with the constellations in mirror image. The second image shows the perspective of a near-Earth position as seen through a very <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>lens</b> (from which the apparent distortion arises).|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} filming, eighty-two {{hours of}} tape were edited to the final fifty-eight-minute {{documentary}} piece. [...] TVTV's team utilized graphics, live music, and <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>lens</b> shots. [...] Stop-action sequences where quotations flash on the screen were also used for effect. [...] The production was the first Portapak video documentary made for national television, and the [...] "first program originally made on in (13mm) video tape to be broadcast nationally". [...] Lord of the Universe was also: [...] "The first independent video documentary made for national broadcast on public television." [...] The trailer was originally broadcast on WNET Channel Thirteen television. [...] Lord of the Universe was shown to a national audience in the United States on February 2, 1974, broadcast on 240stations of the Public Broadcasting Service. It aired a second time on July 12, 1974. Later TVTV productions broadcast on public television included Gerald Ford's America, and a 1975 program on Cajuns The Good Times Are Killing Me.|$|E

500|$|Katy Butler {{wrote in}} the San Francisco Bay Guardian that the TVTV style had {{improved}} since their previous work: [...] "This show has fewer interjections from TVTV personnel, fewer moments that drag, more technological razzle-dazzle (color footage, slow motion, stop motion, tight and rapid cutting)." [...] However, she described Guru Maharaj Ji and his entourage as [...] "an easy target" [...] and wrote that [...] "anybody can look like a fool when a smartass <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>lens</b> distorts their face, and teenage ex-dopers who think a fat boy is God don't stand a chance". [...] Butler wished that TVTV would move on to more challenging subjects for their future work. Bob Williams of the New York Post called the documentary a [...] "deplorable film" [...] and [...] "flat, pointless, television". [...] He wrote: [...] "The hour-long program was remiss in not providing some small examination of the available box-office take of the goofy kid guru, much less telling prospective contributors how it got involved in spending how much of its foundation grants and viewer subscription money in such a questionable venture without more inquisitive journalistic endeavor, or ignoring gurus." ...|$|E

5000|$|Telecentric {{optical path}} means that light hitting the sensor is {{traveling}} closer to {{perpendicular to the}} sensor, resulting in brighter corners, and improved off-center resolution, particularly on <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R

50|$|Deep {{focus is}} {{normally}} achieved by choosing a small aperture. The aperture {{of a camera}} determines how much light enters through the lens, so achieving deep focus requires a bright scene or long exposure. <b>Wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>lenses</b> also make a larger portion of the image appear sharp.|$|R
50|$|The Bessa-L {{was mostly}} {{intended}} {{to be used with}} ultra <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>lenses,</b> with which the absence of a focusing device is not a problem. Most notably Voigtländer introduced a 15 mm and a 12 mm lens, the latter being the widest rectilinear full-frame lens ever marketed up to then.|$|R
50|$|While {{the lens}} has {{some level of}} {{mustache}} distortion, {{it is able to}} offer superior levels of resolution compared to the Nikon AF-S 14-24mm 2.8G. Also, while it has a fair level of vignetting like most other <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>lenses,</b> it manages to keep chromatic aberration levels to a minimum.|$|R

50|$|The axial {{adjustment}} range for focusing Ultra <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>lenses</b> and some Wide-angle lenses in large format cameras is usually very small.Some manufacturers (e.g. Linhof) have offered special focusing lens mounts, so-called 'wide-angle focusing devices' for their cameras {{that allow the}} lens to be focused precisely without moving the entire front standard.|$|R
50|$|There are {{additional}} optical phenomena that can degrade image quality {{but are not}} considered aberrations. For example, the oblique cos4θ light falloff, sometimes called natural vignetting, and lateral magnification and perspective distortions seen in <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>lenses</b> are really geometric effects of projecting three-dimensional objects down into two-dimensional images, not physical defects.|$|R
