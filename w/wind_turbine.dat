5|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>turbine</b> {{design is}} the process of {{defining}} the form and specifications of a <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> to extract energy from the wind. A <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind's energy, point the turbine into the wind, convert mechanical rotation into electrical power, and other systems to start, stop, and control the turbine.|$|E
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> are not straightforward. The {{air flow}} at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With an {{increasing}} amount of wind energy installed, {{the behavior of}} <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> during grid disturbances {{becomes more and more}} important. This paper introduces the basic structures of doubly-fed <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> and direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> and analyses the capability of low voltage ride through (LVRT) of the <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> Finally this paper elaborates the principle and the procedures of the LVRT tests. The results of the tests show that: Doubly-fed <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> and direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are equipped with LVRT capability. The turbines are able to operate normally without disconnection and provide reactive power to support grid restoration during the dip. The direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are superior to the doubly-fed <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> on LVRT since a full-power converter is used...|$|R

50|$|From 2012 to 2014 the Nowy Tomyśl <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbines</b> {{were the}} tallest <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> {{in the world}} with a {{pinnacle}} height of 210 metres. They are still the tallest <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> installed on lattice towers.|$|R
5|$|Off-grid system {{users can}} either adapt to {{intermittent}} power or use batteries, photovoltaic or diesel systems {{to supplement the}} <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small <b>wind</b> <b>turbine,</b> possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing {{the need for a}} connection to the power grid.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of wind varies, {{and an average}} value for a given location does not alone indicate {{the amount of energy}} a <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> could produce there.|$|E
5|$|Total {{wind power}} could be {{captured}} {{only if the}} wind velocity is reduced to zero. In a realistic <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of stream tube, the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> is 59% of the total theoretical wind power (see: Betz' law).|$|E
50|$|All {{grid-connected}} <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> {{from the}} first one in 1939 until the development of variable-speed grid-connected <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> in the 1970s, were fixed-speed wind turbines.As recently as 2003, nearly all grid-connected <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> operated at exactly constant speed (synchronous generators) or within a few percent of constant speed (induction generators).As of 2011, many operational <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> used fixed speed induction generators (FSIG).As of 2011, most new grid-connected <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are variable speed wind turbines—they are in some variable speed configuration.|$|R

50|$|With 240 <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> already {{generating}} power, Horizon Wind Energy {{is considering}} an additional 170 <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> {{to bring the}} total number of turbines to 410. Test <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are being placed in eastern McLean County to determine if additional <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> can be supported. If constructed, power capacity estimates for the wind farm increase from 398 megawatts to 680 megawatts.|$|R

5|$|At the 2011 census, Shapinsay had a {{population}} of 307. The economy of the island is primarily based on agriculture {{with the exception of}} a few small businesses that are largely tourism-related. Plans for the construction of a <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> are under consideration.|$|E
5|$|Further insufficiencies, such as {{rotor blade}} {{friction}} and drag, gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> The basic relation that the turbine power is (approximately) {{proportional to the}} third power of velocity remains.|$|E
40|$|This is {{a thesis}} {{concerned}} with Vertical Axis <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbines</b> (VAWT) and researches in Vibration. The Vertical axis <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> (VAWT) compared with Horizontal axis <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> (HAWT) {{has a lower}} efficiency. However, the supporting structure of VAWT structure is relatively simple. It is suitable in poor wind conditions. Besides, VAWT also generates lower noise and vibrations. In this study, Finite element method {{is used to calculate}} and obtain natural Frequencies of Mechanical vibration. A simple model of Vertical Axis <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbines</b> Natural Frequencies under three conditions was used, to determine and analyse the relationship between Vibration and the shape of the <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbines.</b> This study offers a solution, that assists in analysing the vibration of Vertical Axis <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbines</b> and also provides improvements, in order to help the design and development Vertical Axis <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbines.</b> A way to reduce the vibration of the VAWT is offered in order to increase the lifetime and efficiency of Vertical Axis <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbines...</b>|$|R

5|$|Telenor Denmark, {{part of the}} Norwegian Telenor {{telecommunications}} and mobile phone company, has a workforce of about 1,100 in Aalborg, {{making it one of}} the city's largest new employers. Siemens Wind Power has rotor-blade production and testing facilities in Aaborg. In 2012 and 2013, there were additions in both areas. The new testing plant is the world's largest research test centre for <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> technology. In 2012, the company shipped a record 570 <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> blades from the Port of Aalborg, mainly to England and Ireland, up 45% on the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The Shapinsay {{development}} {{trust is}} working on the island's community plan, and owns the island's <b>wind</b> <b>turbine,</b> which was completed in August 2011 after the community voted for its construction. According to the development trust, the turbine could earn more than £5million during its 25-year lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The cost {{has reduced}} as <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> {{technology}} has improved. There are now longer and lighter <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> blades, improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital and maintenance costs {{have continued to}} decline. For example, the wind industry in the USA in early 2014 were able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300feet to 400feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been {{increasing the amount of}} wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{application}} of <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> is to generate energy using the wind.
