5|$|Although {{the regular}} Confederate {{military}} had a paper strength of 6,000 personnel, the first 100,000 volunteers {{from all over}} the South participated in a variety of dress. Many were from state militia outfits, which had their own state-issued uniforms. In the early battles, some Confederate units that wore dark blue uniforms were often mistaken on the field of battle for the enemy. Conversely, many Union units that were originally militia units <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> wearing gray.|$|E
5|$|As the American colonies <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war,</b> {{they needed}} soldiers, supplies, {{and lots of}} them. Soldiers needed uniforms and, as all {{shipping}} into the colonies had ceased, wool became an integral commodity to the war effort. During the Revolution the consumption of mutton ceased almost entirely in many areas, and in Virginia it became illegal to consume except in cases of extreme necessity.|$|E

40|$|This 11 th {{edition of}} Why nations <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> {{analyses}} ten case studies covering major international wars. The particular focus {{of each of}} the case studies turns upon the personalities of political and military leaders. Stoessinger emphasises that people <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> or precipitate wars. War is not some faceless entity that merely unfolds in some inexplicable way. In a critical stance towards attempts <b>to</b> explain <b>war,</b> the author holds that personalities often do not receive their due recognition in publications on war. Decisions by leaders <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> or leadership decisions that result in warlike acts causing societies or vulnerable sections of society to suffer, receive attention in this updated edition of Why nations <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> It is in the particular focus on people (the leaders who decide <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war)</b> where Stoessinger seeks for “… common truths about war in our time”...|$|R
40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this paper}} is to analyse why people <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war,</b> despite the, at first sight, divergence between benefits and costs. This paper provides a comparison of the willingness <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> in different OECD countries using World Values Survey data. The empirical findings in the United States, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden and West Germany, using the willingness to fight as a dependent variable, indicate that such factors as pride, trust, and political ideology significantly influence individuals' willingness <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> War, Pride, Trust,...|$|R

5|$|In January 1566 Sultan Suleiman I {{had ruled}} the Ottoman Empire for 46 years and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> {{for the last}} time. He was 72 years old and, {{although}} having gout {{to the extent that}} he was carried on a litter, he nominally commanded his thirteenth military campaign. On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left Constantinople at the head of one of the largest armies he had ever commanded.|$|E
5|$|The Company briefly {{considered}} {{sending a}} revived 2nd Rhodesia Regiment to the Western Front, but the British Army promptly rejected this idea, {{saying that the}} unit would be impractical for trench warfare because of its small size.

5|$|Wary of Skanderbeg, Venice {{no longer}} openly {{challenged}} him. Another treaty {{was signed in}} 1463, when Venice <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with the Turks. However, no peace was made between the Ottomans and Skanderbeg until 1463, before the Ottoman-Venetian war was of the same year, who retreated to Macedonia and prepared for another invasion of Albania after their defeat at Oronichea. During the Albanian-Venetian war, they had taken Svetigrad after several months of siege. Thence, they could cross into Albania uninhibited.|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{was able}} to recover a number of {{important}} cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor. Nevertheless, the Catholic/Latin crusaders believed their oaths were invalidated when Alexios did not help them during the siege of Antioch (he had in fact set out on the road to Antioch but had been persuaded to turn back by Stephen of Blois, who assured him that all was lost and that the expedition had already failed). Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with the Byzantines, but he agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.|$|E
5|$|Although Scottish seamen {{received}} {{protection against}} arbitrary impressment onto English men-of-war under Charles II, a fixed quota of conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs {{during the second}} half of the seventeenth century. Royal Navy patrols were now found in Scottish waters even in peacetime, such as the small ship-of-the-line HMS Kingfisher, which bombarded Carrick Castle during the Earl of Argyll's rebellion in 1685. Scotland <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> against the Dutch and their allies in the Second (1665–67) and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars (1672–74) as an independent kingdom. Scottish captains, at least 80 and perhaps 120, took letters of marque, and privateers played a major part in the naval conflict of the wars.|$|E

5|$|He {{soon after}} {{travelled}} to Portugal in April 1800 where {{he planned to}} finish Thalaba and {{send it back to}} England for publication. By July, he was able to complete the poem and in October the poem was edited and ready for publication. John Rickman served as Southey's agent in selling the book. Although finished, Southey continued to work on fixing the end of the poem until January 1801 after receiving suggestions from his friends. After Portugal <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with France and Spain, Southey left the country and he returned to England in June 1801. The poem was published in 1801 by Longman with 1,000 copies, but only sold half by 1804. A revised edition was published in 1809.|$|E
5|$|In January 1566 Suleiman <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> for {{the last}} time. The siege of Szigetvár was fought from 5 August to 8 September 1566 and, though it {{resulted}} in an Ottoman victory, there were heavy losses on both sides. Both commanders died during the battle—Zrinski in the final charge and Suleiman in his tent from natural causes. More than 20,000 Turks had fallen during the attacks {{and almost all of}} Zrinski's 2,300 man garrison was killed, with most of the final 600 men killed on the last day. Although the battle was an Ottoman victory, it stopped the Ottoman push to Vienna that year. Vienna was not threatened again until the Battle of Vienna in 1683.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Ramírez Treviño {{was a close}} {{associate}} of Jaime González Durán (El Hummer), a founder and top leader of Los Zetas drug cartel. In 2008, González Durán was arrested and sentenced to 35 years in prison; by 2010, Los Zetas, who were working as the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel, separated from the organization to operate independently. Both criminal organizations <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with each other, but Ramírez Treviño remained in the Gulf Cartel. Under the tutelage of Samuel Flores Borrego (El Metro 3), he worked as the second-in-command for the criminal organization in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. In an apparent power struggle within the Gulf Cartel, however, El Metro 3 was killed, and he became the regional kingpin in September 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Samian War {{was one of}} {{the last}} {{significant}} military events before the Peloponnesian War. After Thucydides' ostracism, Pericles was re-elected yearly to the generalship, the only office he ever officially occupied, although his influence was so great as to make him the de facto ruler of the state. In 440 BC Samos <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> against Miletus over control of Priene, an ancient city of Ionia on the foot-hills of Mycale. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians.|$|E
5|$|After the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China and Japan {{formally}} <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> When the Kuomintang and Communist Party {{declared a}} united front to fight the Japanese, Peng was confirmed as a general in the unified command structure of the NRA. At the August 20, 1937 Lochuan Conference(洛川会议), Mao believed that the united front should {{be used as a}} feint, giving token resistance to the Japanese while saving the strength of the Red Army for the eventual confrontation with the Kuomintang, but Peng, along with most other senior military and political leaders at the time, disagreed, and believed that the Red Army should genuinely focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao was not able to force his position, and the communists cooperated with the Kuomintang and fought the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|As {{is common}} in {{frontier}} societies, the Southern Rhodesian settler community was mostly male: {{at the time of}} the First World War, white females were outnumbered by males almost two to one. Because white women were so marriageable and cheap black labour was easily available to handle domestic duties, most female settlers did not work and spent most of their days supervising the household and family. The average white woman in the colony continued to live this kind of life during the war, in marked contrast to her British counterpart, who in many cases went to replace the male factory workers and farm labourers who <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war.</b> In Rhodesia little of this sort occurred: there were no munitions factories, and the idea of women working down the country's mines was not considered practical. Some white farmers' wives took over management of the land in their husbands' absence, but this was quite unusual.|$|E

5|$|Following the French Revolution in 1789, a {{political}} organisation {{was formed in}} Ireland named the Society of United Irishmen. Crossing social and religious boundaries, this organisation embraced republican principles with the stated goal of removing British government control from Ireland. When Britain <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with the French Republic in 1793, the organisation was declared illegal and driven under cover, many of its senior members going into exile in Europe or America. These men continued to call for armed resistance to the British government, and in 1796 persuaded the French Directory to launch the Expédition d'Irlande, a large scale invasion of Ireland. The expedition was a disaster, with thousands of French soldiers drowned without a single man successfully landed. Subsequently, the French-controlled government of the Batavian Republic, formerly the Dutch Republic, was persuaded to make an attempt on Ireland in October 1797, but their fleet was intercepted and defeated by Admiral Adam Duncan at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> with France in 1806.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> {{with the}} French Republic, joining the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. Despite {{resistance}} from the Dutch Army and a British expeditionary force, the Dutch Republic was overrun by the French {{in the winter of}} 1794–1795, the French reforming the country into the Batavian Republic, a client state of the French regime. Although war between Britain and the Batavian Republic had not been declared, the British government sent instructions on 19 January for Batavian shipping to be seized and, in conjunction with Stadtholder William of Orange, living in exile in London, for Batavian colonies to be neutralised in order to deny their use to the French. On 9 February these orders culminated in the outbreak of war between Britain and the Batavian Republic.|$|E
