[...] Four-time Olympic gold medallist Matthew Pinsent said of the race [...] "it truly was amazing". [...] Cambridge coach Robin Williams was generous in defeat: [...] "Credit to Oxford. They did an awesome job and took their chance. It was a fantastic race", while Oxford's coach Sean Bowden said [...] "I believed {{that if we could}} get through Barnes Bridge well <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> do it. [...] They were rowing so well and I knew how much they wanted it." [...] Simon Barnes of The Times noted that [...] "Cambridge reeled in an early Oxford lead and went ahead themselves ... that should {{have been the end of}} it... But this Oxford crew just kept pestering away ... and, with the finish in sight, Cambridge ... yielded." ...|$|E
500|$|The band started {{recording}} the album in London {{a week after}} the September 11 attacks in the United States, during which their [...] "poignant songs ... garnered larger audiences". Coldplay had never stayed in London for an extended period before and were bombarded by problems focusing on the production process. They decided to relocate to Liverpool, where they had recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Lead singer Chris Martin said that once there they [...] "became obsessed with recording". [...] "In My Place" [...] was the first song recorded for the album and the one that the band released as the album's lead single [...] "because it was the song that made us want to do a second album. It kept us going and made us think <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> write songs", following [...] "a strange period of not really knowing what we were doing" [...] three months after the success of Parachutes.|$|E
500|$|Such was the {{likelihood}} of Manchester United going on to retain the title, bookmaker Fred Done paid out on punters with two months of the season left. Arsenal steadily closed the gap, however, and victory against Wimbledon in March 1998 set up a title clash between themselves and the reigning champions. Wenger in the lead up to the game maintained {{it was possible for}} Arsenal to win the league, stating [...] "two or three weeks ago, the title was just a dream for us and people laughed when I said <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> do it". He suggested Manchester United were responsible for making the title race [...] "interesting". At Old Trafford, Overmars scored the decisive goal to give Arsenal a 1–0 win. The victory was followed by nine consecutive league wins, the last of which was a home fixture against Everton that secured Arsenal's status as champions. Wenger became the first foreign manager to win the double, when his team beat Newcastle United in the 1998 FA Cup Final.|$|E

500|$|On September 21, 2011, R.E.M. {{announced}} via {{its website}} {{that it was}} [...] "calling it a day as a band". Stipe said that he hoped fans realized it [...] "wasn't an easy decision": [...] "All things must end, {{and we wanted to}} do it right, to do it our way." [...] Long-time associate and former Warner Bros. Senior Vice President of Emerging Technology Ethan Kaplan has speculated that shake-ups at the record label influenced the group's decision to disband. The group discussed breaking up for several years, but was encouraged to continue after the lackluster critical and commercial performance of Around the Sun; according to Mills, [...] "We needed to prove, not only to our fans and critics but to ourselves, that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> make great records." [...] They were also uninterested in the business end of recording as R.E.M. The band members finished their collaboration by assembling the compilation album Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011, which was released in November 2011. The album is the first to collect songs from R.E.M.'s I.R.S. and Warner Bros. tenures, as well as three songs from the group's final studio recordings from post-Collapse into Now sessions. In November, Mills and Stipe did a brief span of promotional appearances in British media, ruling out the option of the group ever reuniting.|$|E

2500|$|Good {{had shown}} that, for some {{configurations}} of background knowledge, Nicod's criterion is false (provided {{that we are}} willing to equate [...] "inductively support" [...] with [...] "increase the probability of" [...] – see below). The possibility remained that, with respect to our actual configuration of knowledge, which is very different from Good's example, Nicod's criterion might still be true and so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> reach the paradoxical conclusion. Hempel, on the other hand, insists that it is our background knowledge itself which is the red herring, and that we should consider induction with respect to a condition of perfect ignorance.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{algorithm}} for 0-1 knapsack, {{discovered in}} 1974 and sometimes called [...] "meet-in-the-middle" [...] due to parallels to a similarly named algorithm in cryptography, is exponential {{in the number}} of different items but may be preferable to the DP algorithm when [...] is large compared to n. In particular, if the [...] are nonnegative but not integers, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> use the dynamic programming algorithm by scaling and rounding (i.e. using fixed-point arithmetic), but if the problem requires [...] fractional digits of precision to arrive at the correct answer, [...] will need to be scaled by , and the DP algorithm will require [...] space and [...] time.|$|E

[...] Made good time on the first 14 ‘portage free’ miles and were on schedule {{when they arrived at}} Froxfield Lock 3hrs into the race. [...] At this point they were told by their support crew that the race organisers had decided to abandon the event following a safety incident at Old Windsor weir the previous night. [...] The support crew explained that while they could not keep racing officially, but they were happy to carry on if the crew were, the watches were still running and they felt that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> get the challenge record. [...] Having prepared solely for this race for 4 months Capps/Baker made the decision to go for it, removing the number from the boat and informed the DW organisation we were no longer in any way their responsibility and got back on the water.|$|E
2500|$|Computationalism is a {{philosophy}} of mind theory stating that cognition {{is a form of}} computation. It is relevant to the Simulation hypothesis in that it illustrates how a simulation could contain conscious subjects, as required by a [...] "virtual people" [...] simulation. For example, {{it is well known that}} physical systems can be simulated to some degree of accuracy. If computationalism is correct and if there is no problem in generating artificial consciousness or cognition, it would establish the theoretical possibility of a simulated reality. Nevertheless, the relationship between cognition and phenomenal qualia of consciousness is disputed. It is possible that consciousness requires a vital substrate that a computer cannot provide and that simulated people, while behaving appropriately, would be philosophical zombies. This would undermine Nick Bostrom's simulation argument; we cannot be a simulated consciousness, if consciousness, as we know it, cannot be simulated. The skeptical hypothesis remains intact, however, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be envatted brains, existing as conscious beings within a simulated environment, even if consciousness cannot be simulated. It has been suggested that whereas virtual reality would enable a participant to experience only three senses (sight, sound and optionally smell), simulated reality would enable all five (including taste and touch).|$|E

"I don't deny, sir, {{you were}} right as it has turned out; only I wouldn't have {{believed}} that I could have missed the path, and I did want {{to get close to}} the place before we were observed.

60|$|At {{some time}} or other {{there had been}} a native village at this spot; {{probably}} the Zulus had cleaned it out in long past years, for I found human bones black with age lying in the long grass. Indeed, the cattle-kraal still remained and in such good condition that by piling up a few stones here and there on the walls and closing the narrow entrances with thorn bushes, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> use it to enclose our oxen at night.

'Tis a pity {{we are not going}} to Calais; if we had been joined by thirty archers there we should have made a brave show, and more than that, they would have done good service, for they are picked men. A few here may be as good, but not many.

Also he did us another ill turn--for it was proved that his money was at the bottom of it--by causing Ralph to be commandeered to serve on some distant Kaffir expedition, out of which trouble we were obliged to buy him, and at no small cost.|$|E

Of course, I shall endeavour to obtain terms for the garrison to march out; but I fear that Massena will hear of nothing but unconditional surrender." ...|$|E
