Flinn said that Meyer [...] "was in an optimistic mood", and the director suggested that Kirk quote Peter Pan for the last lines: [...] "Second star to the right, and straight on till morning." [...] Emotions ran high as the last shots of the cast were captured; Shatner said, [...] "By the time we finished the last scene, which extended longer than <b>we</b> <b>expected,</b> {{there was a sense of}} irritation.

[...] The Beach Boys then requested the services of Walter Sear, who asked Bob Moog to design a ribbon controller, since the group was used to playing the fretboards of a guitar. Sears remembers marking fretboard-like lines on the ribbon [...] "so they could play the damn thing." [...] Moog began manufacturing his own models of theremins.

Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, also acknowledged the defeat saying that the amendments his party had proposed [...] "weren't accepted and that people don't want to amend the Constitution".

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{described}} the episode as [...] "a great end to {{what may have}} been my favorite season of The Office to date."

Sepinwall said Jim's moment of composing himself in the hallway after calling Dwight in that scene was, [...] "Maybe Krasinski's single best moment on the series to date." [...] Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly said she had [...] "some mixed feelings" [...] about the episode and wished it had more from Ryan, Creed and Kelly, but she especially praised the ending scene with Jim and Pam, which she said she did not expect. Dan Hooper of VH1's Best Week Ever said, [...] "Office finale was awesome, as <b>we</b> <b>expected,</b> capping about seven straight weeks of just top-notch episodes with great character moments, a legitimately interesting plot, and just laugh line after laugh line, reminding us all [...] we spent time talking about this show every week." [...] Hooper also praised NBC for not advertising the twist ending: [...] "They didn’t stupidly dramatize it, and it ended up being a really nice, really fitting end" [...] to the season.|$|E

Not that <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> anything less. And trust Gulzar to artfully craft {{a really long}} fuse for the Kaminey bomb, making sure the tracks stay afire long before and after they actually go boom." [...] Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave a rating 4 out 5 and wrote, [...] "Kaminey is certainly not a run of the mill album {{and this is where}} its prime strength lies. The album boasts of at least three chartbuster tracks'Dhan Te Nan' (sure shot superhit), 'Thode Bheege' (must for the hearts in love) and 'Raat Ke Dhai Baje' (for some 'masti' and 'hungama'). Songs like 'Fatak' and 'Kaminey' are innovative and situational which showcase the range of Vishal Bhardwaj. Add to that the 'Go Charlie Go– Theme Music' and you know that Kaminey is yet another addition to some excellent albums that have hit the stands during last one month." [...] Planet Bollywood rated the album 8.5 out of 10 and said it is the best soundtrack released that year, and that [...] "t has experimentations with both music and lyrics". Indo-Asian News Service praised the soundtrack and said that [...] "..."Kaminey" [...] is easily among 2009's finest scores. Experimental in its sound, yet very mainstream in appeal. Vishal Bhardwaj has proved his mettle yet again." ...|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} the {{previous}} sections {{there are differences in}} actual freedom and in perceived freedom, and each correlate with happiness.

Conversely, <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> perceived freedom to be more a mental construal than a result of the environment, hence <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> perceived freedom to be determined mainly by psychological freedom; therefore, the influence of psychological freedom on happiness should be mediated by perceived freedom. <b>We</b> <b>expect</b> 1) an influence of psychological freedom on happiness via perceived freedom and a direct effect, 2) a direct influence of social freedom on happiness, 3) a direct influence of potential freedom on happiness.|$|R
