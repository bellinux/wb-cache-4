5|$|On March 20, 2017 the British paper The Guardian {{reported}} {{that hundreds of}} banks had helped launder KGB-related funds out of Russia, as uncovered by an investigation named Global Laundromat. NatWest was listed among the 17 banks in the UK that were “facing questions over <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> about the international scheme and why they did not turn away suspicious money transfers,” as the bank processed $1.1 million in Laundromat cash. Other banks facing scrutiny under the investigation included HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays and Coutts.|$|E
5|$|In 1964–65 {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in Shanina arose in the Soviet press, largely due to the publication of her diary. The newspaper Severny Komsomolets asked Shanina's contemporaries to write <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> about her. Streets in Arkhangelsk, Shangaly and Stroyevskoye were named after her, and the village of Yedma has a museum dedicated to Shanina. The local school where she studied in 1931–35 has a commemorative plate. In Arkhangelsk, regular shooting competitions were organized among members of the paramilitary DOSAAF sport organisation for the Roza Shanina Prize, while Novodvinsk organized an open shooting sports championship in her memory. The village of Malinovka in Ustyansky District started to hold annual cross-country ski races for the Roza Shanina Prize.|$|E
5|$|Nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> (their empirical observations) {{about the}} different kinds of plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E

50|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to conceptualize the process of creating concept maps. Ray McAleese, in a series of articles, has suggested that mapping is a process of off-loading. In this 1998 paper, McAleese draws on the work of Sowa and a paper by Sweller & Chandler. In essence, McAleese suggests that the process of making knowledge explicit, using nodes and relationships, allows the individual to become aware of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> and as a result to be able to modify <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know.</b> Maria Birbili applies that same idea to helping young children learn to think about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know.</b> The concept of the knowledge arena is suggestive of a virtual space where learners may explore <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do not <b>know.</b>|$|R

Formal models of knowledge have been developed to help us keep track of these levels of knowledge.

It is then shown how the model can be used to analyze gametheoretic solution concepts, in particular Nash equilibrium...|$|R

25|$|Following the {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald, {{and the release of}} the Warren Report, Cobb was privy to a conversation between Elena Garro, her sister Deva Guerrero, and her daughter. They expressed surprise at seeing Oswald's face in the newspapers, as they said they recognized him from a twist party at the home of Rubén Durán. They said that he was accompanied by two other men who looked like beatniks. In an October 5 report, Cobb informed the CIA of the conversation. Cobb wanted the women to tell American authorities <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew,</b> but advised them against going to the American embassy, instead suggesting that they go to Texas. Cobb was asked to leave Garro's home after their cat's back legs were found broken.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptians {{were one}} of the first major civilizations to codify design {{elements}} in art. The wall painting done {{in the service of the}} Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Early Egyptian art is characterized by the absence of linear perspective, which results in a seemingly flat space. These artists tended to create images based on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew,</b> and not as much on what they saw. Objects in these artworks generally do not decrease in size as they increase in distance and there is little shading to indicate depth. Sometimes, distance is indicated through the use of tiered space, where more distant objects are drawn higher above the nearby objects, but in the same scale and with no overlapping of forms. People and objects are almost always drawn in profile. Also, you may notice the people in Egyptian art are never facing forward. Archaeologists are not yet sure of why, but they are leaning towards the fact that artists status was low in the hierarchy so they could never be in front of a higher authority figure, and never be faced towards them.|$|E

500|$|On August 2, 1943, Berg {{accepted}} a {{position with the}} Office of Strategic Services Special Operations Branch (SO) for a salary of $3,800 ($ today) a year. [...] He was a paramilitary operations officer {{in the part of}} the OSS that is now called the CIA Special Activities Division. In September, he was assigned to the OSS Secret Intelligence branch (SI) and given a spot on the OSS SI Balkans desk. In this role, he parachuted into occupied Yugoslavia to evaluate the various resistance groups operating against the Nazis to determine which was the strongest. He talked to both Draža Mihailović and Tito and reviewed their forces, deciding that Tito had the stronger and better supported group. His evaluations were used to help determine the amount of support and aid to give each group. In late 1943, Berg was assigned to Project Larson, an OSS operation set up by OSS Chief of Special Projects John Shaheen. The stated purpose of the project was to kidnap Italian rocket and missile specialists out of Italy and bring them to the U.S. However, there was another project hidden within Larson, called Project AZUSA, with the goal of interviewing Italian physicists to see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> about Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. It was similar in scope and mission to the Alsos project.|$|E

Students who finished the L2 class highly proficient are more likely to retain <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew.</b> Yet, interestingly, high achievers in the classroom situation are no more likely to make efforts to use the L2 outside the classroom unless they have positive attitudes and high levels of motivation.
