500|$|The episode {{explores the}} {{differences}} in scientific and religious perspectives by presenting the two sides as competing modes of discourse; Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club argues that magic users, such as Jake, stand [...] "for magic and the wonderful unknown", whereas Bubblegum stands for [...] "cold, hard facts". While Bubblegum is resistant to embrace magical ways of thinking, by the episode's end, she realizes that [...] "magic has its uses". Moynihan later noted on his personal website that, [...] "in helping to write the episode, it wasn’t important (for me) to impart an idea of <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> or wrong about magic and science {{in the land of}} Ooo. It was important to impart the idea of a complex and contradictory fantasy." [...] He later argued that using the [...] "science v. religion" [...] debate to backdrop an episode was enjoyable because it allowed him to have [...] "fun with both sides of the perspective spectrum." [...] Likewise, Wellmann thought the show's willingness to explore weighty subjects is one of the ways the show has been so successful. He wrote, [...] "one of the biggest strengths of Adventure Time [...] that it’s bold to explore topics like [...] science v. religion in a non-judging, open-minded way." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Oblivion" [...] was {{originally}} published in Black Clock No. 1 (Spring 2004/Summer 2004). In this story, the narrator, Randall Napier, recounts his exhausting fight with his wife Hope over his alleged snoring, which she claims has been so loud that it keeps her awake at night. Randall protests, maintaining that he was awake and consequently unable to snore, while his wife was actually asleep. Eventually they travel to a Sleep Clinic in order to monitor their behaviors and determine for certain <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{administrative}} officer in Changshan recommended Zhao Yun {{to serve in the}} government. Zhao Yun then led a small group of volunteers to join Gongsun Zan, a warlord in You Province who was nominally a General of the Household (中郎將) under the Han central government. Around the time, another warlord Yuan Shao was recently appointed as the Governor (牧) of Ji Province and his fame was steadily rising, so Gongsun Zan was worried that many people in You Province would choose to serve under Yuan instead of him. When Zhao Yun came to join him, he mocked Zhao, [...] "I heard that all those in your home province wanted to serve the Yuans. Why did you have a change of heart, and decide to correct your mistake?" [...] Zhao Yun replied, [...] "The Empire {{is in a state of}} chaos and it's unclear <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and who is wrong. The people are in danger. Those in my home province, after careful deliberation, decided to follow a lord who practises benevolent governance. Therefore, I chose to join you, General, instead of Lord Yuan." [...] He participated in some of Gongsun Zan's battles against rival forces.|$|E

60|$|Christoval assigns images, sacrifice, {{and even}} human sacrifice, to the Creator Uiracocha. Garcilasso denies that the Creator Pachacamac had {{any of these}} things, he denies that Uiracocha {{was the name of}} the Creator, and he denies it, knowing that the Spaniards made the assertion.[22] <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>right?</b> Uiracocha, says Garcilasso, is one thing, with his sacrifices; the Creator, Pachacamac, without sacrifices, is another, is GOD.|$|E

50|$|The table {{allows us}} to see at a glance that the {{proportion}} of men <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> handed <b>is</b> about the same as the proportion of women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> handed although the proportions are not identical. The significance of {{the difference between the two}} proportions can be assessed with a variety of statistical tests including Pearson's chi-squared test, the G-test, Fisher's exact test, and Barnard's test, provided the entries in the table represent individuals randomly sampled from the population about which we want to draw a conclusion. If the proportions of individuals in the different columns vary significantly between rows (or vice versa), we say that there is a contingency between the two variables. In other words, the two variables are not independent. If there is no contingency, we say that the two variables are independent.|$|R

In these matters he <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> is safe; while he who is wrong must take {{the consequences of his}} own acts.

6000|$|Shaw in like manner comes {{upon the}} scene {{when many of}} our social usages are outworn. He sees the fact, announces it, and we burst into guffaws. The {{continuous}} laughter which greets Shaw's plays arises from a real contrast in {{the point of view}} of the dramatist and his audiences. When Pinero or Jones describes a whimsical situation we never doubt for a moment that the author's point of view is our own and that the abnormal predicament of his characters appeals to him in the same light as to his audience. With Shaw this sense of community of feeling is wholly lacking. He describes things as he sees them, and the house is in a roar. <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>right?</b> If we were really using our own senses and not gazing through the glasses of convention and romance and make-believe, should we see things as Shaw does? ...|$|E
