5|$|The Sinsen Line {{opened on}} 1 February 1923 as {{a branch of}} the Rodeløkka Line, which {{continued}} along Trondheimsveien to Carl Berners plass. The entire Rodeløkka Line was rebuilt <b>with</b> <b>double</b> track in 1938. In December 1940, a service extension of the Rodeløkka Line was built from Rodeløkka to Søndre Åsen, operated by the Oslo trolleybus, remaining in service until 14 January 1945. The tram service on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated on 6 February 1949, and replaced with bus line 27, although the tracks were kept.|$|E
5|$|The open {{goods wagons}} were {{originally}} delivered {{with a single}} top-hung side door on each side, but these proved inefficient, and all were eventually converted to side hung double doors.

5|$|After he {{announced}} {{the building of}} the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down <b>with</b> <b>double</b> pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him.|$|E

Also in 2006 Cole won the 100m backstroke at the Telstra Australian Swimming Championships. Cole qualified for the Australian Paralympic Swim Team in 2008 and, in the same year, attended the Beijing Paralympics where she won a silver medal in the Women's 100m Butterfly S9 event and bronze medals in the 400m Freestyle and 100m Backstroke events.|$|E

5|$|Dian was conquered {{during a}} {{military}} campaign launched by Han Wudi in 109 BCE, and the Yizhou commandery {{was established in}} the former kingdom. Archaeologists discovered the king of Dian's imperial seal inscribed by the Han, confirming Dian's surrender and status as a subject of the Han. The Dian led a series of unsuccessful rebellions against Han rule, beginning with two revolts in 86 BCE and 83 BCE. Chen Li, governor of the Zangge commandery, crushed a rebellion in 28–35 BCE. Under Wang Mang's reign as usurper of the Han throne between 9-23 CE, hostilities in southwestern China persisted. Wang sent military campaigns to quell the unrest. Seventy percent of the soldiers in one campaign died from illness. Another campaign, comprising 100,000 men and <b>with</b> <b>double</b> the supplies, was not fruitful. Rebellions continued in 42-45 and 176.|$|E
5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel <b>with</b> <b>double</b> sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also improve a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
5|$|From 7 January 2001, NSB {{made several}} major {{changes to the}} {{commuter}} rail. A fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim; including extra rush-hour trains from Lerkendal to Stjørdal, giving 23 departures per day in each direction. South of Trondheim, the service was rerouted to terminate at Lerkendal. Six stations were closed: Muruvik, Solbakken, Mære, Østborg, Rinnan and Elberg. At the same time, the station at Marienborg and Røstad opened. NSB also introduced a fare zone system, which gave up to NOK20 discount for single-fare travelers and about the same fares for month-pass holders. Part {{of the reason for}} the expansion was that the delivery of the new Class 93 trains for regional services freed up more Class 92 units. This also allowed NSB to operate some of services <b>with</b> <b>double</b> unit (four-car) trains in rush-hour.|$|E

5|$|On 15 June 1953, the Trunk Line from Lillestrøm to Eidsvoll took {{electrification}} into use. Further upgrades on the Drammen Line installing {{double track}} {{were put into}} service on 24 July 1953 from Billingstad to Hvalstad, on 29 November 1955 from Hvalstad to Asker and on 9 November 1958 from Sandvika to Billingstad. Between 1953 and 1955, NSB took delivery of 18 Class 67 multiple units. While visually similar to Class 65, they had improved technology and reliability. On 1 February 1961, the Gjøvik Line from OsloØ to Tøyen was put into service <b>with</b> <b>double</b> track and the line from OsloØ to Jaren put into service as electrified. Double track from Tøyen to Grefsen opened on 27 May 1962 and the sections from Jaren to Gjøvik was electrified in 1963.|$|E
