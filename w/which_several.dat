5|$|Another {{month of}} {{discussion}} and relatively minor refinement followed, during <b>which</b> <b>several</b> {{attempts were made}} to alter the Rutledge draft, though few were successful. Some wanted to add property qualifications for people to hold office, while others wanted to prevent the national government from issuing paper money. Madison in particular wanted to push the Constitution back in the direction of his Virginia plan.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Mount St.Helens {{is a large}} eruptive cone {{consisting}} of lava rock interlayered with ash, pumice, and other deposits. The mountain includes layers of basalt and andesite through <b>which</b> <b>several</b> domes of dacite lava have erupted. The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit, and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in what is today South Dakota for several {{thousand}} years. The first inhabitants were Paleoindian hunter-gatherers, and disappeared from the area around 5000 BC. Between 500AD and 800AD, a semi-nomadic people known as the Mound Builders lived {{in central and eastern}} South Dakota. In the 14th century, the Crow Creek Massacre occurred, in <b>which</b> <b>several</b> hundred men, women, and children were killed near the Missouri River.|$|E

It was reopened in 2016 (with Cristina Kirchner out of the government), and the tape was accepted as evidence.|$|E
5|$|After Lukashenko {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} in 1994, he stated his intention to amend the recently passed Constitution. The amendments, according to Lukashenko, would expand {{the power of his}} office, marking a turning point in post-Soviet era politics in Belarus. A May 1995 national referendum was {{the first step in the}} amendment process. Out of the four questions, one asked if the president could disband parliament if the members violate national law. The vote, <b>which</b> <b>several</b> Supreme Soviet deputies protested, resulted in 77% in favor of the provision regarding the dismissal of the legislature by the president. Other questions on the ballot, such as the national flag and national emblem, didn't affect the Constitution as a whole, but their status has been decided by the Constitution. Two years later, Lukashenko scheduled the first referendum that would potentially alter the Constitution. The last referendum on the Constitution occurred in 2004, also scheduled by Lukashenko.|$|E

5|$|Belgium {{has seen}} two talented waves since 1980, from <b>which</b> <b>several</b> players in {{defensive}} positions gained international fame. In the 1980s {{and the early}} 1990s, goalkeepers Jean-Marie Pfaff and Michel Preud'homme were elected best custodians at FIFA World Cups, while FIFA recognised midfielders Jan Ceulemans and Enzo Scifo as the propelling forces of Belgium's 1986 FIFA World Cup squad. In 2002, after all players of this generation had retired, Marc Wilmots became Belgium's top scorer at the World Cup with five goals.|$|E
5|$|Cynesige, the {{archbishop}} of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected Archbishop of York on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, {{and it appears that}} Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, <b>which</b> <b>several</b> of his predecessors had done. There were a few reasons for this, one of which was political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. Another reason was that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed {{the archbishop}} sufficient revenue to support himself.|$|E
5|$|Early Heian period works {{before the}} mid-10th century appear heavy {{compared}} to Nara period statues, carved from single blocks of wood, and characterised by draperies carved with alternating round and sharply cut folds. Stylistically, they followed high to later Tang style. In the Heian period the zōbussho were replaced with temple-run and independent workshops; wood became the primary medium; and a specific Japanese style emerged. By the mid-10th century, the style was refined presenting a more calm and gentle appearance, with attenuated proportions. Jōchō {{was the most}} important sculptor of this time, and he used the yosegi technique, in <b>which</b> <b>several</b> pieces of wood are joined to sculpt a single figure. He was the ancestor of three important schools of Japanese Buddhist statuary: the , Inpa and Keiha school. The Amida Nyorai at Byōdō-in is the only extant work by Jōchō.|$|E

5|$|In 1887, Rae {{travelled}} to France {{and settled}} in Paris with her mother Janet and sister Alison. They lived there for three years, before {{the family moved to}} the artists' colony at the fishing village of Étaples, in northern coastal France. During this initial part of her career, Rae exhibited works in Australia and New Zealand, though she remained in Europe. Exhibitions in which she was hung included the 1889 New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in Dunedin, and the 1896 Victorian Artists' Society, at <b>which</b> <b>several</b> of her landscapes were shown.|$|E
5|$|In 371, the Emperor Valens split Cappadocia {{into two}} new provinces, Cappadocia Prima and Cappadocia Secunda. This {{resulted}} in complex changes in ecclesiastical boundaries, during <b>which</b> <b>several</b> new bishoprics were created. Gregory was elected {{bishop of the}} new see of Nyssa in 372, presumably {{with the support of}} his brother Basil, who was metropolitan of Caesarea. Gregory's early policies as bishop often went against those of Basil : for instance, while his brother condemned the Sabellianist followers of Marcellus of Ancyra as heretics, Gregory may have tried to reconcile them with the church.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} this goal, the ADF was {{restructured}} {{to increase its}} ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. This was achieved by increasing {{the capabilities of the}} RAN and RAAF, and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia. During this time the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. However, in 1987 the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in <b>which</b> <b>several</b> warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 Fijian coups d'état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.|$|E

5|$|On {{receiving}} this reply, Bonaparte immediately {{ordered his}} fleet to bombard Valletta and on 11 June General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers directed an amphibious operation in <b>which</b> <b>several</b> thousand soldiers landed at seven strategic {{sites around the}} island. The French Knights deserted the order, and the remaining Knights failed to mount a meaningful resistance. Approximately 2,000 native Maltese militia resisted for 24 hours, retreating to Valletta once the city of Mdina fell to General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois. Although Valletta {{was strong enough to}} hold out against a lengthy siege, Bonaparte negotiated a surrender with Hompesch, who agreed to turn Malta and all of its resources over to the French in exchange for estates and pensions in France for himself and his knights. Bonaparte then established a French garrison on the islands, leaving 4,000 men under Vaubois while he {{and the rest of the}} expeditionary force sailed eastwards for Alexandria on 19 June.|$|E
5|$|Strong first-half play {{left the}} Buccaneers tied 7–7 with the Cleveland Browns at halftime, but {{they failed to}} {{maintain}} the intensity {{for the second half}} of the game. A screen pass from Steve Spurrier to Essex Johnson caught the blitzing Cleveland linebackers out of position for a 13-yard touchdown. The solid blocking of the first half gave way to the Cleveland rush in the second half, and Spurrier was replaced with Parnell Dickinson in the fourth quarter. Dickinson wound up leaving the game with a season-ending knee injury on a play in which he threw an interception to Terry Brown. Two Browns players were ejected for fighting, in a game in <b>which</b> <b>several</b> Buccaneers complained of cheap shots being taken. Dave Pear said, “If I had a gun, I would have shot them both in the head”, of two Cleveland players who tried to take out his knees.|$|E
