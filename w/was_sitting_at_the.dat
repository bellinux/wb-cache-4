5|$|I went to New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2013–14 season, the club decided to dedicate the number 12 shirt to the fans by not registering it to a player and having it listed as 'Glory Fans' when the squad is announced on match days. Alistair Edwards was sacked as Manager on 17 December 2013, and replaced on an interim basis by Kenny Lowe. Many fans blamed Jacob Burns for the sacking of Alistair Edwards (with rumours of him being the leader of the uprising against Edwards). The club would finish 8th in another disappointing season, with at one stage, the club <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the table.|$|E
25|$|On one {{occasion}} Hannah {{went to the}} sanctuary and prayed for a child. In tears, she vowed that were she granted a child, she would dedicate him to God as a Nazirite. Eli, who <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foot of the doorpost in the sanctuary at Shiloh, saw her apparently mumbling to herself and thought she was drunk, but was soon assured of her motivation and sobriety. Eli was the priest of Shiloh, {{and one of the}} last Israelite Judges before the rule of kings in ancient Israel. He had assumed the leadership after Samson's death. Eli blessed her and she returned home. Subsequently Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to Samuel.|$|E

Chaffee <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> right side of the cabin. His main role was to maintain communications with the blockhouse. A momentary power surge was detected at 23:30:55 GMT, which was believed to accompany an electrical short in equipment located on the lower left side of the cabin, the presumed ignition source for the fire. At 23:31:04 GMT, a voice was heard declaring, [...] "'ve got a fire in the cockpit." [...] Most investigative listeners believe that voice was Chaffee's.|$|E
500|$|Gary Rydstrom and {{his team}} at Skywalker Sound were hired for the film's sound production. Like Howard, Rydstrom {{employed}} different sounds for the two cultures. Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers, {{he felt that the}} Atlanteans should have a [...] "more organic" [...] sound utilizing ceramics and pottery. The sound made by the Atlantean flying-fish vehicles posed a particular challenge. Rydstrom revealed that he <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> side of a highway recording one day when a semi-truck drove by at high speed. When the recording was sped up on his computer he felt it sounded very organic, and that is what is heard within the film. Rydstrom created the harmonic chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by rubbing his finger along the edge of a champagne flute, and the sound of sub-pods moving through water with a water pick.|$|E
500|$|On August 27, 1964, Kemper's grandmother, Maude Matilda Hughey Kemper (1897–1964), <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{kitchen table}} {{when she and}} Kemper had an argument. Enraged by the argument, Kemper stormed off and grabbed the [...]22 caliber rifle which his {{grandfather}} had given him for hunting. He {{then returned to the}} kitchen and, when Maude told him not to shoot any birds, fatally shot her in the head before firing twice more into her back. Some accounts allege that Maude Kemper additionally suffered multiple post-mortem stab wounds with a kitchen knife. He then dragged her body out of the kitchen and into her bedroom. When Kemper's grandfather, Edmund Emil Kemper (1892–1964), came home from grocery shopping, Kemper went outside and fatally shot him in the driveway. He was unsure of what to do next and so phoned his mother, who urged him to contact the local police. Kemper then called the police and waited for them to take him into custody.|$|E

500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E
500|$|The next morning, Conkling then {{submitted}} {{a resolution that}} bound every delegate in the hall to support the party's nominee. Conkling said that [...] "no man should hold his seat here who is not ready so to agree." [...] A voice vote was called, and the resolution received nearly unanimous delegate support. However, about {{a dozen or so}} delegates answered [...] "no". Conkling was shocked. He asked, [...] " [...] at a Republican convention would vote 'no' on such a resolution?" [...] He then demanded a roll call to identify the dissenters. Most of the dissenters chose not to declare their disagreement in front of the thousands of spectators at the [...] "Glass Palace". Only three delegates, all from West Virginia, voted [...] "no" [...] to the resolution, and were showered with a [...] "storm of hisses." [...] Conkling then issued another resolution to strip the three West Virginians of their votes and squash their voices at the convention. The West Virginians revolted against Conkling's resolution, and heavily criticized him for his motion. James Garfield, who <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Ohio delegation, stood up and tried to settle the matter. He stated that the convention would be making a big mistake if they approved Conkling's motion, and he asked the delegates for their time in order to state his case. Garfield argued that the three West Virginians should not [...] "be disenfranchised because they thought it was not the time to make such an expression [...]" [...] He stated that [...] "there never can be a convention...that shall bind my vote against my will on any question whatever." [...] Garfield had won the crowd over with his speech. Conkling did not particularly enjoy the situation. He scribbled a note to Garfield which read, [...] "New York requests that Ohio's real candidate and dark horse come forward...R.C." ...|$|E

Kyle Velasquez, 16, <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> north row of computers; police later said he had not hidden underneath the desk when Klebold and Harris had first entered the library, but had curled up under the computer table. Klebold shot and killed Velasquez, hitting him in the head and back. Klebold and Harris put down their ammunition-filled duffel bags at the south—or lower—row of computers and reloaded their weapons. They walked back toward the windows facing the outside staircase. Noticing police evacuating students outside the school, Harris said: [...] "Let's go kill some cops." [...] He and Klebold began to shoot out the windows in the direction of the police. Officers returned fire, and Harris and Klebold retreated from the windows; no one was injured.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), in chapter [...] as Lot <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gate of Sodom in the evening, the two angels arrived, and Lot greeted them and bowed {{low to the}} ground. Lot invited the angels {{to spend the night}} at his house and bathe their feet, but they said that they would spend the night in the square. Lot urged them strongly, so they went to his house, and he {{prepared}} a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. Before they had retired for the night, all the men of Sodom gathered about the house shouting to Lot to bring his visitors out so that they might be intimate with them. Lot went outside the entrance, shutting the door behind him, and begged the men of Sodom not commit such a wrong. Lot offered the men his two virgin daughters for them to do with as they pleased, if they would not do anything to his guests, but they disparaged Lot as one who had come as an alien and now sought to rule them, and they pressed threateningly against him and the door. But the visitors stretched out their hands and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door and struck the people with blindness so that they were unable to find the entrance. The visitors directed Lot to bring what family he had out of the city, for they were about to destroy the place, because the outcry against its inhabitants had become so great. So Lot told his sons-in-law that they needed {{to get out of the}} place because God was about to destroy it, but Lot's sons-in-law thought that he was joking. As dawn broke, the angels urged Lot to flee with his wife and two remaining daughters, but still he delayed. So out of God's mercy, the men seized Lot, his wife, and daughters by the hand and brought them out of the city, telling them to flee for their lives and not to stop or look back anywhere in the plain. But Lot asked them whether he might flee to a little village nearby. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
