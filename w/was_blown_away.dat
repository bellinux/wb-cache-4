5|$|During the 1930s, several {{economic}} and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced {{what was known}} as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile topsoil <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined. The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of South Dakota declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.|$|E
5|$|When Davies {{presented}} his {{ideas for the}} U.S. Millionaire to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer. Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on Millionaires production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, {{a number of other}} popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. Millionaire during its development, including Peter Jennings, Bob Costas, Phil Donahue, and Montel Williams, but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British Millionaire and <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show. When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. Millionaire. With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of Millionaires production.|$|E
25|$|In many regions, {{more than}} 75% of the topsoil <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> {{by the end}} of the 1930s. Land {{degradation}} varied widely.

25|$|At the Ring's destruction, Sauron's {{power was}} {{immediately}} broken and his form in Middle-earth was destroyed. His departing spirit towered above Mordor {{like a black}} cloud, but <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> by a powerful wind from the West (the direction of the Blessed Realm and the Valar). His vast empires collapsed, his armies were defeated, the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr crumbled and the Nazgûl were consumed in a hail of fire from the Mountain as they flew towards it {{trying to save the}} Ring. Sauron himself was crippled beyond repair, putting an end to his long reign of terror.|$|E
25|$|Tennis Australia awarded Barty a {{wildcard}} {{into the}} 2013 French Open. She scored her first grand slam singles victory by defeating the Czech Republic's Lucie Hradecká {{in the first}} round. She had previously failed to win a match in five grand slam tournaments. She subsequently played World No. 12 Maria Kirilenko in the second round. Barty had made an encouraging start to the match, however with scores locked at 3–3, rain forced play to be suspended for the day. She <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> when play resumed on day six, winning just one more game in the match.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{only the}} east coast vessels participated in the winter cruise in the Caribbean Sea, however {{beginning}} in 1929, Vancouver joined Champlain beginning a tradition that would last until {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. These peacetime training cruises were not always smooth. While en route to the Caribbean Sea in January 1931, Champlain encountered a gale. The ship pushed through the storm, resulting in damage to the ship. The rigging was carried away and when a replacement was jury-rigged together, that too <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away.</b> The dinghy and whaler suffered damage and one person was injured.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{of the new}} main airport {{started on}} 13 August 1994. The western runway was already in place, and had been renovated by the Air Force in 1989. A new, eastern runway needed to be built. A hill at the airport <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away,</b> and the masses used to fill in where needed. The {{construction}} of the airport and railway required 13,000 man-years. 220 subcontractors were used, and working accidents were at {{a third of the}} national average, without any fatalities. The last flights to Fornebu took place on 7 October 1998. That night, 300 people and 500 truckloads transported equipment from Fornebu to Gardermoen. Gardermoen opened on 8 October 1998.|$|E
25|$|The Nimbin was a steel screw steamer {{built in}} 1927 at Copenhagen, {{that was the}} first motor vessel placed into the New South Wales coastal trade it was owned and {{operated}} by the North Coast Steam Navigation Company and was the first Australian registered merchant ship to be lost during World War II when it struck a mine laid by the German auxiliary cruiser Pinguin. The Nimbin was on its way from Coffs Harbour to its home port, Sydney, with a cargo of bundled three-ply timber and a large number of pigs. One third of the ship <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> and it sank in three minutes. Seven men were killed. The remaining thirteen clung to bundles of plywood. Some hours later an air force plane from RAAF Base Rathmines saw the survivors and directed the coastal ship SS Bonalbo to the scene to pick up the survivors.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, Wolf {{replaced}} Rhodes with Mike Sherman. Sherman {{had never}} been a head coach at any level of football and was relatively unknown in NFL circles. He had only coached in professional football for three years starting as the Packers' tight ends coach in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he followed Mike Holmgren to Seattle and became the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, although Sherman did not call the plays during games. Despite Sherman's apparent anonymity, Wolf <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> in the interview process by the coach's organizational skills and attention to detail. Sherman's inaugural season started slowly, but the Packers won their final four games to achieve a 9–7 record. Brett Favre praised the atmosphere Sherman had cultivated in Green Bay's locker room and fans were optimistic about the team's future. In the offseason, however, Wolf suddenly announced his own resignation as GM to take effect after the April 2001 draft. Packers President Bob Harlan was surprised by Wolf's decision and felt unsure of how to replace him. Harlan preferred the structure Green Bay had employed since 1991; a general manager who ran football operations and hired a subservient head coach. But with the momentum and locker room chemistry that was built during the 2000 season, Harlan was reluctant to bring in a new individual with a potentially different philosophy. Wolf recommended that Harlan give the job to Sherman. Though Harlan was wary of the structure in principle, he agreed with Wolf that it was the best solution. In 2001, Sherman assumed the duties of both GM and head coach.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, German forces {{used the}} {{fortress}} for ammunition storage. On June 5, 1941, the ammunition exploded, blasting through {{the entirety of}} Smederevo and reaching settlements as far as 10kilometers away. Much of the southern wall of the fortress was destroyed, the nearby railway station, packed with people, <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away,</b> {{and most of the}} buildings in the city were turned into debris. [...] Around 2,500people died in the explosion, and every other inhabitant was injured or wounded (approximately 5,500). [...] Bombing by the Allies in 1944 caused further damage.|$|E

Nearby, the Rainbow Pier only received structural damage to its railings, though the pier office <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away.</b> Rain entered the building occupied by Hatches, inc., damaging about 50% of the merchandise. Two bridges on State Road 80 were washed out. The Florida East Coast Bridge lost its railing, but remained partially opened to traffic.

500|$|To the contrary, Owen Gleiberman, {{film critic}} for the Entertainment Weekly, wrote: [...] "Django isn't nearly the film that Inglourious was.

[...] In his review for the Indy Week, David Fellerath wrote: [...] "Django Unchained shows signs that Tarantino did little research beyond repeated viewings of Sergio Corbucci's 1966 spaghetti Western Django and a blaxploitation from 1975 called Boss Nigger, written by and starring Fred Williamson."

500|$|On April Fools' Day on , Sunsoft {{announced}} that a sequel to the game would be released on the Virtual Console titled Blaster Master: Destination Fred. According to their press release, the game was only purported to be tested on several PlayChoice-10 machines in the Los Angeles area between 1988 and 1989. Upon discovery of copies {{of the game in}} Sunsoft's headquarters in Japan, Gaijinworks' founder Victor Ireland said: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> when I saw these. When I was going through boxes of stored code, promotional items, and ROMs to see what we had on hand to release for the U.S. Virtual Console market, finding these nine completely unknown cartridges literally stunned me.

500|$|The {{most severe}} {{structural}} damage occurred near Cape Villaret, [...] south-southwest of Broome. The Eco-beach tourist resort and the Yardoogarra station were devastated. The {{area around the}} homestead was totally devastated. A caravan parked nearby <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> and crumbled, and a semi trailer was blown to its side. The vegetation, {{which used to be}} very lush, was stripped of all leaves by the destructive winds which carried airborne salt and sand. The damage to the vegetation seemed to be worse than the tree damage seen in Exmouth caused by Cyclone Vance in March 1999. About [...] of fencing was pushed over, all windmills were destroyed, and about 200 head of cattle were lost, mostly due to drowning from the storm surge. However, the path of destruction to the vegetation was estimated to be just 15 to 20km wide, reflecting Rosita's small size.|$|E
