It makes you feel like celebrating... It gives you a great feeling inside, like you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> have a drink... People can't wait for the weekend." [...] Also in {{an interview}} with MTV News in late 2010, Avril Lavigne spoke about being included on the song, saying, [...] "It was really exciting because 'I'm With You' is one of my favorite songs that I've done, I always love performing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Frauenhofer {{referred}} to [...] "Trees" [...] as [...] "a definite highlight" [...] in which [...] "the doctor drops his trademark off-kilter raps on, surprisingly, environmentalism." [...] Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan {{wrote that the}} song [...] "Ants" [...] compares [...] "the humans infesting Earth to ants in a colony, enthused and disgusted at once". Frauenhofer, describing the song [...] "Eat It," [...] wrote that Princess Superstar [...] "constantly references sex" [...] while Dr. Octagon [...] "confusingly interjects with his complaints about how women only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> talk and eat", but Frauenhofer states that the sexual content of the album's lyrics is not as explicit as previous Thornton albums, such as Sex Style. Dallas Observer writer Geoff Johnston described the song as being [...] "as profane as one would hope for." ...|$|E

To compensate, the {{administration}} can lower the amount of extra scrip returned when parents <b>want</b> <b>to</b> borrow in the winter, and increase rates in the summer. [...] Depending upon {{the strength of the}} seasonality of babysitting, this might work. [...] But suppose the seasonality is so strong that no one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in the winter even when the administration sets its interest rates to zero. That is, suppose no parents <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> even when they can borrow money for free. In this hypothetical situation, the co-op has fallen into a liquidity trap.|$|R
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first {{recorded}} by American pop singer Katy Perry, recording the track as a demo for her debut album One of the Boys, though it was never fully executed for the album and was passed to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals, soon after a leaked version of Katy Perry on the Internet. Perry discussed her role with Bliss magazine: [...] "My vocals are actually on Breakout. I thought, 'Yes, I'm singing on a Miley single'." [...] Cyrus said naming the album Breakout {{was influenced by the}} song as it was [...] "one of [...] favorite songs" [...] on the album; this was because the song is feminine but has appeals to different age groups: [...] "Moms, dads, sisters, brothers can, you know, relate to it. And it's basically because you just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> have fun with your friends and sometimes, you know, go out dancing and let loose once in a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Adenhart {{made his}} Major League debut as the {{starting}} pitcher against the Oakland Athletics at home in Angel Stadium of Anaheim. At the time, he was the youngest active-roster pitcher in the major leagues. In his debut, he gave up five earned runs and walked five in two innings, earning a no-decision in a 15–8 loss. Adenhart was disappointed in his first appearance, saying, [...] "I let down the team first. You always <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> prove yourself to your teammates and your manager and your coaches. I was a disappointment to myself also." [...] His second start was against the Kansas City Royals, where he earned another no-decision, allowing three earned runs and striking out three over 4⅓ innings in a 5–3 win by the Angels. The reaction to his second start was more positive, with manager Mike Scioscia saying that [...] "it was definitely a start in the right direction." [...] Adenhart earned his only career decision, a victory, on May 12, 2008, against the Chicago White Sox in Anaheim, giving up four earned runs in 5⅔ innings {{en route to a}} 10–7 Angels victory. After the win against the White Sox, Adenhart was sent back down to the Salt Lake Bees. He {{spent the rest of the}} 2008 season at Salt Lake, amassing a 9–13 record with a 5.76 ERA in 26 games.|$|E

Miles Davis would never do that. And I'm not into a greatest-hits thing. I think a band, if you're going to be around, you should be moving forward and putting in the time and working for it, getting after the art. Otherwise you're just playing retreads. ... Imagine a tree that grows canned peaches. It's nothing I want to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pet usage is {{the primary}} market for trapped painted turtles {{although}} a small number are sent to turtle races. Commercial trapping is modest economically, with double digits of trappers, selling a few thousand turtles yearly, at $1–2 per turtle. Individual harvesters who trap painted turtles typically do so for extra money and alternate between fishing and turtle trapping based on the markets. Many have been traditionally involved in the trade: Ben Hedstrom of Minnesota said, [...] "We've sold turtles for 50 years. My dad did it since the 1920s." [...] Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch. Rex Campbell of Minnesota said, [...] "I {{can go out and}} catch more turtles today than I did 10 years ago. I don't see that it's hurting the turtle population. The last thing I want to see {{is the end of the}} resource we've all depended on for a long time. I'm not against regulating the industry, but we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> harvest and still make a living at it." ...|$|E

2500|$|... “Many of the Indians would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> buy {{trinkets}} {{and things}} {{to carry back}} home, such as nice blankets and shawls. [...] But during the rainy weather some of them thought they had an excuse to drink. [...] They said they thought it kept them warm. [...] I saw at once that this must not go on, as a little whiskey always calls for more. [...] So I called all the Indians together in council, and explained to them that I had noticed they were beginning to look for liquor again {{and that it was}} not good for them. [...] Then I said: “I am going to make a new rule with you. [...] Every man and woman hereafter will receive only half their pay. [...] The balance will be kept in my care until {{near the end of the}} season. [...] Then those of you who think you must be spending your money all the time will have something to take home with you when your work is done.’ [...] Some, of course, did not like this plan. [...] While they knew it was for their best interest, still they did not want to do without their liquor. [...] But the majority fell right in with my proposition. [...] They knew I would be honest with them, and that their money was safe with me. [...] So it was agreed that on each pay day half of the money should be put away until the show closed. [...] Further, each man was warned that he must be more careful about drinking.” ...|$|E
