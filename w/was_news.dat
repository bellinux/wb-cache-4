Seaman Alphonso McPherson held fast to his testimony even when faced by Coakley in cross-examination. Coakley denied threatening anyone, exclaiming that such an idea was a personal affront. Veltmann responded that this line of evidence <b>was</b> <b>news</b> to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E
5|$|Stossel grew {{continuously}} more {{frustrated with}} having {{to follow the}} assignment editor's vision of what <b>was</b> <b>news.</b> Perhaps because of his stuttering, he had always avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if {{he was forced to}} compete with other reporters by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women's movement, the growth of computer technology, and advancements in contraception, rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.|$|E

25|$|In November 1998, MacKenzie {{headed a}} consortium, TalkCo Holdings, which {{purchased}} Talk Radio from CLT for £24.7 million.

25|$|Wisden {{recalled}} that there <b>was</b> <b>news</b> {{off the field}} during this match because the England selectors met to decide which of Ray Illingworth or Colin Cowdrey, both playing in the match, would lead the team on the coming winter tour of Australia. Illingworth was chosen and he rewarded their faith in him by leading England to Ashes victory. In the current match, however, England struggled against formidable opponents who were determined to avenge their defeat at Nottingham. England were still without Geoff Boycott and fielded an unchanged team at Edgbaston. The World XI selected Peter Pollock and Deryck Murray in place of Graham McKenzie and Farokh Engineer. England were reduced to 76 for four in their first innings but Basil D'Oliveira led a recovery with help from Illingworth and Tony Greig. D'Oliveira made 110 and England reached what seemed a creditable 294. Despite the early loss of Eddie Barlow, {{the strength of the}} World XI batting is illustrated by the fact that no less than eight of them scored 40. The highlight was a fifth wicket partnership of 175 between Clive Lloyd (101) and Gary Sobers (80). England made a game of it on the last two days, exemplified by a stubborn last wicket stand of 45 between Alan Knott and John Snow. The World needed 141 to win in 195 minutes and struggled to get them. England reduced them to 107 for five but then Intikhab Alam and Mike Procter took control and quickly scored the remaining 34 runs.|$|E

[...] Jon Bershad of Mediaite commented, [...] "It’s as tense and exciting as expected." [...] Writing for TV Squad, Joel Keller analyzed Carter's comparison of Leno's legal contract with O'Brien's, and wrote that the author [...] "paints a picture of Leno and his producer, Debbie Vickers, as pragmatists and Conan as a cockeyed idealist". Joe Flint of Los Angeles Times commented about changes in the media industry since Carter's prior book The Late Shift, [...] "The only difference is that the media world has changed a lot then, and while [...] "The Late Shift" [...] had a lot of inside dirt and drama that <b>was</b> <b>news</b> to everyone but the most hardcore industry insiders, this time around the soap opera played out on TV and in the media." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote, [...] "There are lots of juicy bits, but the big takeaway: the guy with the best contract, wins", and called the book, [...] "Bill Carter's Jaypocalypse dirt-disher". Writing for ABC News, journalist Sheila Marikar commented, [...] "Bill Carter's new book, 'The War for Late Night,' reveals what happened behind the scenes, the expletives that were hurled during closed-door discussions, the roller coaster that O'Brien, Leno, and their cohorts rode during that tumultuous time." ...|$|E
