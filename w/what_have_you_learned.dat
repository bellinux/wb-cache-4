40|$|You’ve {{been working}} {{a long time}} towards a more nonviolent society. <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>learned?</b> Can you tell me?’ That’s {{basically}} what we asked eleven experienced and committed individuals. We wanted to learn some of the insights they had acquired over many years of action and reflection. Our interviews were open-ended. We talked to nonviolent activists, trainers, educators and community-builders. Six were from the Netherlands and five from Australia. Six were men and five were women. Their ages ranged from 20 s to 60 s. Many are quite well known in nonviolence circles and beyond. We took extensive notes on the interviews, wrote down all the insights, classified them into categories (such as education and cultural context), and amalgamated, rearranged, edited and sometimes rewrote them. Then we sent the result to all the interviewees for further comment. This list of insights is just a beginning. There are thousands of other experienced proponents of nonviolence, with many additional insights. You may disagree {{with some of the}} points here, or perhaps find some of them obscure. We hope, though, that you will find some new ideas or helpful reminders. If you can find just one helpful thing to take away, then the exercise is worthwhile...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{concept of}} the `heartsink patient' is well known and much used when talking about general practice. The {{opposite}} {{of this type of}} patient, however, has been little explored. Objective. To identify patient characteristics valued by GPs. Methods. Structured interview to collect narratives from GPs of individual patients, analysed qualitatively through thematic analysis and word frequency. Setting. Primary Care in Ireland. Participants. GP trainers. Main outcome measures. Emergent themes from four lead questions: Tell me about a patient you like, Tell me about the patient's personality, <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> about yourself as a GP?, What is different about being a GP as opposed to any other kind of doctor? In addition, a corpus linguistic analysis of word frequencies disclosed further themes, not identifiable on the surface of discourse. Results. Ten themes were identified: GPs valued patients who were likeable, a challenge, involved them in negotiation of the doctor-patient relationship, were interesting or virtuous and had a positive effect. GPs valued their profession in that they were facilitators, gave and elicited loyalty, formed personal attachments and had a different perspective. Conclusions. `Heartlift patients' may be a robust concept, to counterbalance heartsink patients. Data collected are suitable for training, and could help GPs enhance a sense of vocation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this report is to study the success of {{short-term}} intensive study programmes (ISPs) over the short-term perspective and highlight additional lessons for students which might be missed without the experience of working face-to-face on sophisticated tasks in multicultural teams. Approach/ Methodology – The evaluation of our ISPs was conducted using a quantitative methodology, via questionnaires given to students at the beginning, the middle {{and at the end}} of a course. The questionnaire development was based on the work of Prof. Dr. Scott Armstrong (Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania) for student self-assessment of their progress during participation in the MARCIEE project. Before, during and after the course, the participants filled out a questionnaire answering the following three questions: (1) What do you know? (2) What do you want to learn? (3) <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>learned?</b> Using this procedure, the teachers of the ISPs got direct feedback about the knowledge base, the needs and the learning success for each individual topic. For international ISP evaluation, it was decided to assess the improvements related to (1) knowledge, (2) know-how and (3) soft skills. The questions related to knowledge were derived from the content of the program and the lectures during the program. Regarding the soft skills and knowledge assessment, we followed Beard, Schwieger and Surendran (2008), Betz and Hackett (1983) and Bandura (1977). The questionnaire was first pretested and improved based on the initial results. Findings – The reports provided an overview of the level of success in teaching intercultural programs in higher education, further development of our evaluation tools, and the contribution of IPSs in improving skills and cross-cultural competences. Originality/Value – There are a lack of tools measuring short term success of ISPs. The ERASMUS+ grant program of the European Union under grant no. 2014 - 1 -DE 01 -KA 203 - 00624 has funded the creation of the resource.

40|$|For {{teachers}} {{from within the}} early childhood education and care sector, working with children and families in the current societal context has become increasingly problematic (Gardner, 1999, 2003; Prout, 2003 a, 2003 b). From one standpoint, {{research has indicated that}} much of the difficulty associated with working in this field is symptomatic of the uncertainty, discontinuity and insecurity characteristic of the post-modern condition (Dahlgren & Chiriac, 2009; Hulqvist & Dahlberg, 2001; Jenks, 1996 a, 1996 b; Lyotard, 1984; Prout, 2003 a, 2003 b). As authors of this paper, whilst we agree with this particular standpoint, {{it can be argued that}} the aforementioned perspective can be seen as an over-simplification of the problems in the ECEC field. While the characteristics of the post-modern condition may be considered to be at the heart of some of these problems, the complexities of current policy reform, the demands of neo-liberal approaches to the provision of care and education (Ball, 2003; Beck, 1999; Hulqvist, 1998; Popkewitz, 2000; Rose, 1999, 2000), as well as a lack of understanding of current contexts for children and their families compound the present state of play across the sector (Moss, 2003; Prout, 2003 a). Thus, new demands are evident for teachers in the ECEC field in relation to both personal and professional skill development. Therefore preparation for understanding the impact these contexts have on their identity development is critical to evaluating pre-service educator’s university experiences in contract with the reality of the rural practice context. On the grounds that learners view and interpret new information and experiences through their existing network of knowledge, experience and beliefs (Dahlgren & Chiriac, 2009; Darling-Hammond, 1997; Helm, 2006), the project’s design acknowledges and anticipates that the beginner teachers' experiences will be shaped, in part, by what they 'bring' to those experiences, including their initial choices to enter the profession, and their prior conceptions and expectations about teaching and initial teacher preparation (Helm, 2006). In this case study, juxtaposition between preconceptions and expectations of pre-service teacher education and early experiences as beginning teacher in a rural Australian context are explored and the key research questions guiding data interrogation include: o	What are the connections between your initial expectations about becoming a teacher and commencing your university studies and the reality of teaching in a rural context? o	How has this influenced or shaped your professional identity and learning? o	How has the rural context impacted upon the manifestation of the curriculum, impacting your professional decisions and development? o	How do you use the knowledge, skills and abilities developed at University in your professional context? o	<b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> about yourself as an individual as well as you as a professional? What will you do differently now as an outcome of your professional learning thus far? A model of critical reflection is used to interrogate the data from interviews and facebook postings over a 2 year period. Key themes emerged and these relate to the concept of teacher identity, the role of relationships, a sense of agency, the notion of relevance, and the central presence of emotion. In this paper these themes are presented as core features of the experience of 'becoming a teacher'. ...|$|E
