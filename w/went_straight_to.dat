5|$|There was a {{delay of}} {{several weeks before}} the report was {{distributed}} widely enough to gain the attention of governments. Mass transports of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz began on 15 May 1944 {{at a rate of}} 12,000 people a day. Most <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> the gas chambers. Vrba argued until {{the end of his life}} that the deportees would have refused to board the trains had the report been distributed wider and publicized sooner, a position generally not accepted by Holocaust historians.|$|E
5|$|L.A.

It stayed top of the UK game chart for three weeks. In Australia, video game stores in major cities reported that the game was going out of stock after a week. L.A. Noire debuted in Japan for the week of 4–10 July and sold a combined 71,057 units on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The PlayStation 3 version topped the chart, with 58,436 units sold, and the Xbox 360 version moved 12,621 units.|$|E
5|$|Lody {{described}} anti-Zeppelin precautions he {{had heard}} about in London and provided details of the conversions of the Cunard Line steamships RMS Aquitania and Lusitania for their wartime service, which he had seen while in Liverpool. Once again the letter was intercepted by the British and not allowed to go forward to Stockholm. Lody and Lee spent another evening in Dublin before going on a day-trip by coach to Glendalough to see the lough and the surrounding countryside. On 2 October they parted with an agreement to meet again in Killarney the following day. Lee travelled to Drogheda, where he stayed overnight, while Lody <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> Killarney and found {{a room at the}} Great Southern Hotel (now the Malton Hotel).|$|E

5|$|United won {{a corner}} {{just as the}} fourth {{official}} indicated three minutes of injury time, and with so little time left for an equaliser, Peter Schmeichel ventured up to Bayern's penalty area. Beckham flighted the corner in just over Schmeichel's head, Dwight Yorke put the ball back towards the crowded area, and after Thorsten Fink failed to clear sufficiently, the ball arrived {{at the feet of}} Ryan Giggs {{on the edge of the}} area. His right-footed snap-shot was weak and poorly struck, but it <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> Sheringham, who swiped at the shot with his right foot, and nestled the ball in the bottom corner of the net. The goal was timed at 90+0:36'. It looked as if, having been behind for most of the match, United had forced extra time.|$|E
5|$|At the Rio de Janeiro location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in Rio de Janeiro, Moore was immediately whisked off the plane and <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> hair and make-up work, before re-boarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above Rio de Janeiro, the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made of liquorice, although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures.|$|E
5|$|The Corinthians {{gained a}} corner kick early on, and Cardiff cleared. This was {{followed}} up by a further {{attack by the}} amateurs, but R.G. Jenkins' shot <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> Tom Farquharson in the Cardiff goal. Cardiff attacked twice in quick succession; both chances were squandered. A.H. Chadder, Frank Hartley and Jenkins moved up-field for Corinthian with some passing movement and played the ball through for Claude Ashton, but he shot wide of the post. Three corners followed for Cardiff, which were each stopped by Russell in goal for Corinthian stopped each chance. A few minutes later Len Davies headed the ball down to the feet of Ferguson, but the Cardiff player fired the ball wide of the goal despite being {{only a few feet}} away from the goal line. Just before half time, Cardiff won a direct free kick; Fred Keenor hammered the ball into a wall of Corinthian players.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} it was re-formed as No.1 AFTS, the flying school at Point Cook had also been made {{responsible}} for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers; this role was transferred to Central Flying School at East Sale in December 1956. Southern Area Command was re-formed as Training Command in September 1953. On 28May 1958, No.1 AFTS relocated to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, where its Wirraways were replaced by deHavilland Vampire jet trainers, which required a runway longer than that at Point Cook. The school's place at Point Cook was taken by No.1 BFTS, which transferred from Uranquinty on 19December. By this time the RAAF had decided to commission all pilots and navigators, who would be selected for these roles upon induction into the service; navigators therefore <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> the School of Air Navigation at East Sale, without attending flying training school. On 31December 1958, the Flying Training Squadron of RAAF College was disbanded, and the flight instruction component of the four-year cadet course became the responsibility of No.1 BFTS (for basic training) and No.1 AFTS (for advanced training). Previously, the cadets had used FTS aircraft under RAAF College instructors, but from 1959 their flight training was fully integrated with the FTS system.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> the Group {{stage of}} the Champions League after {{finishing}} second in the Eredivisie but were eliminated after only winning one game, and finishing six points behind Sparta Prague, and were consequently drawn against SC Freiburg of Germany {{in the third round}} of the UEFA Cup. Feyenoord won the first leg 1–0, after a late goal from Shinji Ono. The second leg was drawn 2–2, however Feyenoord came close to going out, as Freiburg took a 2–0 lead on 49 minutes with goals from Sebastian Kehl and Levan Kobiashvili, to make the aggregate score 2–1 in Freiburg's favour. But on 57 minutes, Pierre van Hooijdonk pulled a goal back, to make it 2–2 on aggregate, which would see Feyenoord going through due to the away goal rule. Feyenoord secured their place in the fourth round when Leonardo scored in the 86th minute. Feyenoord faced Rangers of Scotland in the fourth round with the tie proving to be a close affair. The first leg ended 1–1, in Glasgow, Feyenoord had gone ahead on seventy two minutes through Shinji Ono, but Rangers equalised after Peter Løvenkrands was brought down by Glenn Loovens on 81 minutes. Barry Ferguson scored the subsequent penalty. The second leg in Rotterdam ended 3–2 in Feyenoord's favor, the match was notable for the sending off of one player on each side Patrick Paauwe for Feyenoord and Neil McCann for Rangers.|$|E
5|$|When {{news of the}} RPF {{offensive}} broke, Habyarimana requested {{assistance from}} France in fighting the invasion. The French president's son, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, {{was head of the}} government's Africa Cell, and promised to send troops. On the night of 4 October, the Rwandan government staged a fake RPF attack on Kigali with gunfire and explosions around the city, seeking to convince the French that the regime was in imminent danger. The deception worked, and 600 French soldiers arrived in Rwanda the following day, double the number initially pledged. The French operation was code-named Noroît, and its official purpose was to protect French nationals. In reality, the mission was to support Habyarimana's regime, and the French parachute companies immediately set up positions blocking the RPF advance to the capital and Kigali International Airport. In addition to the French, Belgium and Zaire sent troops to Kigali in early October. The Belgian presence was short-lived, its troops withdrawing within two weeks because of laws preventing the army from intervening in a civil war. Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko's contribution was to send several hundred troops of the elite Special Presidential Division (DSP). Unlike the French, the Zairian troops <b>went</b> <b>straight</b> <b>to</b> the front line and began fighting the RPF, but their discipline was poor. The Zairian soldiers raped Rwandan civilians in the north of the country and looted their homes, prompting Habyarimana to expel them back to Zaire within a week of their arrival.|$|E
