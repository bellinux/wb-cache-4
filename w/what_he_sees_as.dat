5|$|Referring {{to the two}} ontological {{arguments}} {{proposed by}} Anselm in Chapters 2 and 3 of his Proslogion, Malcolm supported Kant's criticism of Anselm's argument in Chapter 2: that existence cannot be a perfection of something. However, he identified <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> the second ontological argument in Chapter 3 which is not susceptible to such criticism.|$|E
5|$|The South African comics writer Anton Kannemeyer has parodied the {{perceived}} racist {{nature of the}} book to highlight <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> the continuing racist undertones of South African society. In his Pappa in Afrika (2010), a satire of Tintin in the Congo, he portrays Tintin as an Afrikaner with racist views of indigenous Africans.|$|E

He has been particularly outspoken against <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> racism against Latino wrestlers in United States promotions – he butted heads with TNA over treatment of himself and Ron Killings, and WWE over issues regarding Latino wrestlers Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio, but he has also come into conflict with AAA over what he alleged was non-payment of talent.|$|E
5|$|The Sermons, a {{political}} treatise composed {{in the guise}} of sermons, went almost unnoticed by contemporaries. In the Sermons, Skarga discusses <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> the problems of the ailing Commonwealth: lack of patriotism, internal quarrels, tolerance of heretics, the king's relative powerlessness, perverse laws (a critique of the nobility's Golden Freedoms), and immorality. Another notable aspect of the book is its focus on the desperate plight of the serfs (the peasants).|$|E
5|$|The pair {{interview}} {{the cast and}} crew as suspects, discovering that many would benefit from either of the deaths—producer Kenny Neiderman had been having an affair with Danbury; Rowdy Beeman replaced Carroll as director; Ruby Dahl and Ramona Tangent, whose roles in the film will expand without Danbury; and Mark Bianco, a method actor relishing the opportunity to meet Black, whose role he plays. Also questioned is Hugo Winston, the man whose partner was murdered in the earlier case and who is campaigning against <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> a disrespectful production.|$|E
50|$|The nephew {{goes on to}} {{describe}} how, {{on the day he}} found his uncle dead, <b>he</b> began to <b>see</b> strange happenings with the truck himself, and he could not accept his uncle's death as suicide as there was no jug near the body with which Otto could have fed himself the oil. The nephew would dismiss <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a hallucination, {{were it not for the}} derelict sparkplug he took away from the corpse and kept as a reminder.|$|R

During {{a conversation with}} writer Evan Hunter, Hitchcock admits that he has erectile dysfunction and his only sexual partner is his wife (screenwriter Alma Reville).

He argued firstly that the EU constitution requires elected heads to choose its [...] "President" [...] and secondly that Juncker's manifesto fails to tackle <b>what</b> <b>he</b> (Norman) <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> the President's duty to address the unpopularity of EU mandates. He then asserted that democracy, for the British, involves legitimacy derived from the ballot box, whereas for some Europeans, it involves centralised bureaucracy.|$|R

60|$|No; not a {{syllable}} {{of it is}} true. Holbein is right, {{not because}} he draws more generally, but more truly, than Dürer. Dürer draws <b>what</b> <b>he</b> knows is there; but Holbein, only <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees.</b> And, <b>as</b> I have told you often before, the really scientific artist is he who not only asserts bravely <b>what</b> <b>he</b> does <b>see,</b> but confesses honestly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> does not. You must not draw all the hairs in an eyelash; {{not because it is}} sublime to generalize them, but because it is impossible to see them. How many hairs there are, a sign painter or anatomist may count; but how few of them you can see, it is only the utmost masters, Carpaccio, Tintoret, Reynolds, and Velasquez, who count, or know.|$|R
5|$|His third studio album, titled Mockingbird (2005), was {{released}} on December 26, 2005. The album touches on subjects such as politics, social justice, and war. Webb has stated that he tackled these subjects to stimulate discussion and engage people to bring about changes in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> {{some of the greatest}} problems the world is facing today. In order to broaden this discussion to people less inclined to purchase his album, beginning September 1, 2006, Webb offered Mockingbird for free on the website Free Derek Webb (no longer exists), where it was available for download until December 8, 2006. Over 80,000 free copies of the album were downloaded during this time.|$|E
5|$|Location of ambush {{and death}} : A number of reports {{have come down}} of Troilus' death {{variously}} mentioning water, exercising horses and the Thymbra, though they do not necessarily build into a coherent whole: the First Vatican Mythographer reports that Troilus was exercising outside Troy when Achilles attacked him; a commentator on Ibycus says that Troilus was slain by Achilles in the Thymbrian precinct outside Troy; Eustathius of Thessalonica's commentary on the Iliad says that Troilus was exercising his horses there; Apollodorus says that Achilles ambushed Troilus inside the temple of Thymbrian Apollo; finally, Statius reports that Troilus was speared to death as he fled around Apollo's walls. Gantz struggles {{to make sense of}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> contradictory material, feeling that Achilles' running down of Troilus' horse makes no sense if Troilus was just fleeing to the nearby temple building. He speculates that the ambush at the well and the sacrifice in the temple could be two different versions of the story or, alternatively, that Achilles takes Troilus to the temple to sacrifice him as an insult to Apollo.|$|E
25|$|Hitchens's book , about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> the non-existence {{of the war}} on drugs, was {{published}} by Bloomsbury in the autumn of 2012.

In June 2014 he published his first e-book, Short Breaks in Mordor, a compendium of foreign reports.|$|E

After Ken is unexpectedly cut off, the group tries to confirm his report, but their witnesses are disconnected before being put on the airwaves. A now audibly frightened Ken calls back and says he has taken refuge in a grain silo. <b>He</b> describes <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> outside <b>as</b> people eating their way inside others and tearing themselves apart. An infected man crashes into the silo, crippling himself, and Ken's call is interrupted by a transmission in French.|$|R

50|$|Amongst {{the varied}} tribes of {{southern}} Nigeria {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo, Spirit Spouses of the Sea are common features of life due to the geographical closeness of their cultures to the Atlantic Ocean, though attitudes to their supposed existence depend largely on the religious inclinations of the individuals concerned. For example, a Yoruba traditionalist might look at a conjugal visit from a dream-based lover {{in much the same}} way as the aforementioned Ewe and Baule do, whereas a Muslim or Christian tribesman in the same situation would most likely look at it as a grave misfortune and seek the mystic aid of a spiritual counsellor to rectify <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would <b>see</b> <b>as</b> a probably dangerous connection to an otherworldly demon.|$|R

Quite a task. As a result of quite a few months works, I eventually devised the Oxford Capacity Analysis (OCA).
