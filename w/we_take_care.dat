25|$|The {{formaldehyde}} {{surrounding the}} shark, Hirst says, {{is the process}} of death and decay. Though formaldehyde is used as a preservation means, over time, the object being preserved will soon wilt, flake, and wrinkle. Because the sculpture itself was made in 1991, the shark is very much rotting and deformed due to the formaldehyde taking its toll on the corpse. With the corpse rotting away, it symbolizes that no matter how well <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of ourselves or how timeless we think we are, our mind will start to fade away and we slowly will begin to forget.|$|E
500|$|The {{title was}} derived from a line from [...] "The Nurse's Song" [...] by English poet William Blake: [...] "And all the hills echoed". In January 2013, Publishers Weekly {{announced}} the publication date as May 21 of that year, and Riverhead Books released a statement that the novel was about [...] "how we love, how <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of one another, and how the choices we make resonate through generations". First printed in hardback, And the Mountains Echoed was priced at $28.95 in the United States and £14.99 in the United Kingdom. Hosseini went on a five-week tour to 41 cities across America to promote the book. In October 2013, plans were confirmed to translate And the Mountains Echoed into 40 languages, among them Icelandic and Malay.|$|E
2500|$|Brothel {{industry}} lobbyist George Flint disagreed, saying [...] "Anybody {{that has}} an ounce of brain or intelligence has to know they (legal and illegal prostitution) are two different things. We don't traffic women. We don't hire trafficked women. We don't work with pimps. We treat the girls with respect and dignity and <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In fact, the [...] {{net worth}} of each liturgist, and the {{percentage}} of his wealth committed to the liturgy, [...] varied greatly, as the [...] "liturgical class" [...] itself varied greatly. [...] The size of the [...] "liturgical class" [...] can be estimated for classical Athens as a [...] range between 300 [...] and 1200 individuals, or as high as 1500-2000 if <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> not to confuse the number of people required to administer the system and the contingent of those who actually took up the liturgy. The number of individuals actively involved is necessarily greater than the total number of liturgies because of the temporary exemptions available {{and the size of the}} competitive liturgy system. Therefore, because of changes in wealth (whether related to economic happenstance or the division of inherited wealth) individuals of this [...] "liturgical class" [...] cannot be considered a closed group: it was constantly being renewed, although marginally, by the addition of the [...] "new rich" [...] and the decline of certain families who had previously been wealthy enough to participate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second part}} is finding e, the {{additional}} offset days {{that must be}} added to the date offset d to make it arrive at a Sunday. Since the week has 7 days, the offset must be in the range 0 to 6 and determined by modulo 7 arithmetic. e is determined by calculating [...] These constants may seem strange at first, but are quite easily explainable if we remember that we operate under mod 7 arithmetic. To begin with, [...] ensures that <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the fact that weekdays slide for each year. A normal year has 365 days, but , so 52 full weeks make up one day too little. Hence, each consecutive year, the weekday [...] "slides one day forward", meaning if May 6 was a Wednesday one year, it is a Thursday the following year (disregarding leap years). Both b and c increases by one for an advancement of one year (disregarding modulo effects). The expression [...] thus increases by 6—but remember that this is the same as subtracting 1 mod 7. And to subtract by 1 is exactly what is required for a normal year – since the weekday slips one day forward we should compensate one day less to arrive at the correct weekday (i.e. Sunday). For a leap year, b becomes 0 and 2b thus is 0 instead of 8—which under mod 7, is another subtraction by 1—i.e., a total subtraction by 2, as the weekdays after the leap day that year slides forward by two days.|$|E

60|$|The meagre {{packages}} {{of the common}} passengers had been thrown {{in a place of}} safety, with the sort of unreflecting instinct with which <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of our limbs when in danger.

A hundred hands were busy, and nearly as many throbbing hearts lent their impulses to the accomplishment of the one important object.|$|E

6000|$|It is not {{the whole}} truth that if <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the actors the plays {{will take care of}} themselves; nor is it any truer that if <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the plays the actors will take care of themselves. There is both give and take in the business. I have seen plays written for actors that made me exclaim, [...] "How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds makes deeds ill done!" [...] But Burbage may have flourished the prompt copy of Hamlet under Shakespeare's nose at the tenth {{rehearsal}} and cried, [...] "How oft the sight of means to do great deeds makes playwrights great!" [...] I say the tenth because I am convinced that at the first he denounced his part as a rotten one; thought the ghost's speech ridiculously long; and wanted to play the king. Anyhow, whether he had the wit to utter it or not, the boast would have been a valid one. The best conclusion is that every actor should say, [...] "If I create the hero in myself, God will send an author to write his part." [...] For in the long run the actors will get the authors, and the authors the actors, they deserve.|$|E

60|$|Here is {{a lesson}} for us all. You and I, and all men brought into the world with us a nature which fell in Adam; and, as it fell before we were born, it is certain enough to fall, again and again, after we are born, in this life; ay, and unless <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>care,</b> to fall lower and lower, every day, acting Adam's sin over again, until we surely die. This is what I mean--What God said to Adam and Eve, He says to every one of us. And what the devil said to Adam and Eve, he will say to every one of us.|$|E

Sometimes we have fights with these but, as a rule, we seldom attack them unless we are so strong {{that they do not}} dare to oppose us. Still, we do have fights sometimes, for these Shan guards are brave fellows. Their convoys are generally rich ones, for it would not pay small traders to hire men to protect them.|$|E

60|$|Not {{that we may}} not, {{to explain}} any {{phenomena}} of nature, make use of any probable hypothesis whatsoever: hypotheses, if they are well made, are at least great helps to the memory, and often direct us to new discoveries. But my meaning is, {{that we should not}} take up any one too hastily (which the mind, that would always penetrate into the causes of things, and have principles to rest on, is very apt to do) till we have very well examined particulars, and made several experiments, in that thing which we would explain by our hypothesis, and see whether it will agree to them all; whether our principles will carry us quite through, and not be as inconsistent with one phenomenon of nature, as they seem to accommodate and explain another. And at least that <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> that the name of PRINCIPLES deceive us not, nor impose on us, by making us receive that for an unquestionable truth, which is really at best but a very doubtful conjecture; such as are most (I had almost said all) of the hypotheses in natural philosophy.|$|E
6000|$|... 224. The {{general rule}} {{by which we}} are to {{determine}} the size is, to select the largest mass which will not overwhelm any object of fine form, within two hundred yards of it; {{and if it does}} not do this, we may be quite sure it is not too large for the distant features: for it is one of Nature's most beautiful adaptations, that she is never out of proportion with herself; that is, the minor details of scenery of the first class bear exactly the proportion to the same species of detail in scenery of the second class, that the large features of the first bear to the large features of the second. Every mineralogist knows that the quartz of the St. Gothard is as much larger in its crystal than the quartz of Snowdon, as the peak of the one mountain overtops the peak of the other; and that the crystals of the Andes are larger than either.[49] Every artist knows that the bowlders of an Alpine foreground, and the leaps of an Alpine stream, are as much larger than the bowlders, and as much bolder than the leaps, of a Cumberland foreground and torrent, as the Jungfrau is higher than Skiddaw. Therefore, if <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the near effect in any country, we need never be afraid of the distant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] the Easy Chair softly murmured again. [...] "The last essay {{he wrote}} in me was about Christmas. I have not {{forgotten}} one word of it all: how it began, how it went on, and how it ended! 'In the very promise of the year appears the hectic of its decay.... The question {{that we have to}} ask, forecasting in these summer days the coming of Christmas which already shines afar off, is this: whether while we praise Christmas as a day of general joy <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> to keep it so.... Thackeray describes a little dinner at the Timminses'. A modest couple make themselves miserable and spend all their little earnings in order to give a dinner to people for whom they do not care, and who do not care for them.... Christmas is made miserable to the Timminses because they feel that they must spend lavishly and buy gifts like their richer neighbors.... You cannot buy Christmas at the shops, and a sign of friendly sympathy costs little.... Should not the extravagance of Christmas cause every honest man and woman practically to protest by refusing to yield to the extravagance?' There!"
