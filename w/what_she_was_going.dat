500|$|Rachel's characterization, {{especially}} her Christmas greed {{even though}} she is Jewish, was singled out for criticism in many reviews. VanDerWerff wrote that the episode [...] " [...] Rachel being really excited about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get for Christmas, {{even though she}}'s Jewish", and her end-of episode shout of [...] "Happy Hanukah" [...] a [...] "last minute patch job" [...] to [...] "stay true to the characters as they were at one time". Sullivan also discussed her characterization and noted that she was [...] "a character who makes a point of her Jewish heritage often". He added, [...] "she was basically horrible and played against character the entire episode, so she could eventually realize that she was awful and change her ways." [...] Bell criticized Rachel's list of gifts, such as [...] "spray tan and teeth whitening", as [...] "back to square one" [...] after her nose-job storyline in the second season. Finn's contribution of a charity pig in Jewish Rachel's honor was deemed [...] "wrong on at least two levels" [...] by Chaney.|$|E
500|$|During Russ' trial, Mercedes {{decided to}} go to the court to testify for him due to Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox), who {{explained}} to Mercedes that her sister died because Justin Burton (Chris Fountain) was [...] "too gutless to come forward and tell the truth". This encouraged Mercedes to [...] "take a long, hard look at herself", and she realised that she was doing the same thing in the situation with Warren. On her way to the court however, Mercedes was [...] "all over the place". According to Metcalfe, everyone was shocked when Mercedes walked into the courtroom. She said that Mercedes was unsure of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to tell the court, [...] "but her alibi is vital to Warren's case - his fate lies in her hands". Metcalfe said that even if Mercedes and Russ ended their relationship, which they did shortly after she confessed the truth, would not matter because she believed that it would not take Mercedes [...] "long before she goes back to her old ways" [...] because [...] "that's just the type of person she is - Mercedes likes playing the field and having fun, and no man's going to change her" ...|$|E
500|$|One {{day in the}} mid-1990s, Smith was at {{her home}} talking {{to one of her}} {{daughter}}s on the phone. After telling her mother <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to that night, her daughter asked Smith what her plans for that night were. Because she did not have anything fun planned, Smith lied so her daughter wouldn't have to worry about her. After the conversation ended, Smith realized that she didn't need her own children worrying about her at the start of their adult lives and decided {{that it was time to}} return to her career. With country artist Marty Stuart (whom she later married in 1997), acting as the album's main producer, Smith signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1996. Although the label preferred her to record an album of duets, Smith decided to go by her own terms and record a solo studio album. In October 1998 she released her second self-titled studio album. Consisting of ten tracks, nine of them were co-written by both Smith and Stuart. Although the album attracted little attention, it was given high critical praise for its traditional and contemporary style. Kurt Wolff of the book Country Music: The Rough Guide commented that the album sounded [...] "far gutsier than anything in the Reba and Garth mainstream". Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the release four out of five stars, calling it [...] "a solid effort", also commenting, [...] "...it stands head and shoulders over most of the stuff that's come out of Nash Vegas in over a decade. Even if it doesn't sell a copy, it's a triumphant return for Smith. She hasn't lost a whit of her gift as a singer or as a writer." ...|$|E

"She {{wished to}} tell me," [...] 'said she, [...] "before my visitor left, {{that the name}} of the 'sweet' which she gave us at luncheon is la promesse, being merely a promise of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to do, when she gets about her {{everything}} she wants." ...|$|R

6000|$|The captain paid no {{attention}} to these remarks. [...] "If she doesn't want to send a telegram, I don't see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to town for in such a hurry. I suppose she thought she could get there sooner than a man could go on a horse," [...] he said.|$|R

Do you understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, Lady Meadowcroft," [...] I said, severely, [...] "I {{have not}} asked Miss Wade <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to do.
