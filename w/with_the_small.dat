Ongoing negotiations with the Royal Moroccan Air Force for 20 F-20s were canceled; along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> order by Bahrain. Later on, a bribery scandal would emerge from the attempts to market the F-20 to South Korea, leading to several Northrop managers resigning and the reprimanding of chief executive Thomas V.

On November 10, 1925, his father appeared as a witness on behalf of Billy Mitchell during Mitchell's court-martial in Washington, D.C.. He brought three-year-old Robin with him to court, dressed in an Air Service uniform, and posed with him for newspaper photographers before testifying.|$|E

5|$|Pryce {{started his}} career in Formula One <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> Token team, making his only start for them at the 1974 Belgian Grand Prix. Shortly after an {{impressive}} performance at the Formula Three support race for the 1974 Monaco Grand Prix, Pryce joined the Shadow team and scored his first points in Germany in only his fourth race. Pryce later claimed two podium finishes, his first in Austria in 1975 and the second in Brazil a year later. Pryce was considered by his team as a great wet-weather driver. During the practice session for the 1977 South African Grand Prix, run in wet conditions, Pryce was faster than everyone, including world champion drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt. During the race, he collided at high speed with a safety marshal, Frederik Jansen van Vuuren, and both men were killed. A memorial to Pryce was unveiled in 2009 in his home town of Ruthin.|$|E
5|$|Rail {{transportation}} {{in the village}} began in 1880 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> Whitson's Station on the New York City & Northern Railroad (later the New York and Putnam Railroad); the station was rebuilt by Walter Law in 1906 {{in the style of}} his Briarcliff Lodge, with Mission style furniture and rugs.

Law's Briarcliff station became the public library in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Starship Troopers had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on many later science fiction stories. John Steakley's 1984 novel Armor was, according to the author, born out of frustration <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> amount of actual combat in Starship Troopers and because he wanted this aspect developed further. The 1988 Gainax OVA series Gunbuster has plot elements similar to Heinlein's novel, depicting humanity arrayed against an alien military. Scholars have identified elements of Heinlein's influence in Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, as well. Hantke, in particular, compares the battle room in Ender's Game to Heinlein's prosthetic suits, stating that they both regulate but also enhance human agency. Suvin suggests parallels between the plots of the two novels, with human society in both stories at war against insect-like aliens, but states {{that the story of}} Ender Wiggin takes a very different direction, as Ender regrets his genocidal actions and dedicates his efforts to protecting his erstwhile targets.|$|E

On the night of 3/4 September, the final voyage to the landing beaches began. The landing was preceded by a short naval bombardment from five US destroyers.

5|$|The logic board, {{the central}} circuit {{board of the}} computer, {{was based on the}} Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using surface mount {{technology}} to 9×5inches (23×13cm), half the size of the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac.

5|$|The unique {{habitat of}} Lac Alaotra is {{threatened}} by pollution, destruction of marshes {{for the construction of}} rice fields, overfishing, and introduced species such as exotic fish, plants, the black rat (Rattus rattus), and the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), another small carnivoran. A bird restricted to the area, the Alaotra grebe (Tachybaptus rufolavatus), was declared extinct in 2010 and the population of the bamboo lemur fell by about 30% from 1994 to 1999. As a narrowly distributed species with a small population, S.durrelli is likely to be threatened by degradation of its habitat and perhaps competition <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> Indian civet and the black rat, but its conservation status has not yet been formally assessed. The DWCT is working to conserve the Lac Alaotra area and the region has been designated as a protected area.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the smaller}} ships from the convoy, an American {{merchant}} ship named Silenus, had separated from the main body in the storm and arrived at the Nicobar Islands. There she had encountered Caroline and the American captain had reported the location and value of the convoy to Féretier. Setting all sail, Féretier took Caroline to the north-west, and sighted the convoy at 05:30, {{only a few days}} after leaving the Nicobar Islands. The British ships, under the loose command of John Dale in Streatham, originally mistook the French frigate for the missing Victor and it was not until another half-hour had passed that Dale realised the danger his ships were in. Ordering the Indiamen to form a line of battle, Dale placed his ship in the centre, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> Lord Keith ahead and Europe behind. However, the lack of naval experience on the British ships resulted in the Indiamen sailing too far from one another in line, thus leaving them unable to provide effective mutual support.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{subsequent}} few days, wind shear caused the convection to wax and wane over Eline's center, limiting the thunderstorms {{to the southern}} periphery. The track shifted more to the west-northwest. On February11, Eline had weakened into a minimal tropical storm according to the MFR, about 1110km (690mi) south of Diego Garcia, and the JTWC operationally downgraded it to a tropical depression. Later that day, however, a decrease in shear allowed thunderstorms to refire. On February13, a weakness in the ridge caused the storm to {{turn back to the}} west-southwest. Moving back beneath an anticyclone, conditions became more favorable for strengthening, allowing outflow and a central dense overcast to form, with the beginnings of an eye feature. Eline quickly intensified into a severe tropical storm late on February13. At 00:00UTC the next day, the JTWC upgraded Eline to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane with 1‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). The MFR held off upgrading the storm, due to a passing trough increasing wind shear again. On February14, Eline passed about 85km (55mi) south of St. Brandon, and shortly thereafter resumed its strengthening after the shear dropped. Later that day, the storm bypassed Mauritius about 180km (110mi) to the northwest, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> structure sparing the island from the strongest winds. Early on February16, Eline attained tropical cyclone status, with 10‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph), while passing about 160km (100mi) northwest of Réunion. This was nine days after it had weakened to tropical storm status the first time.|$|E
