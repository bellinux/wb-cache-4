5|$|That day we saw horror, but we {{also saw}} quiet acts of courage. We saw this courage in a teacher named Liviu Librescu. With the gunman set to enter his class, this brave {{professor}} blocked the door with his body while his students fled to safety. On the Day of Remembrance, this Holocaust survivor gave his own life so that others may live. And this morning <b>we</b> <b>honor</b> his memory and we take strength from his example.|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, <b>we</b> <b>honor</b> the best in ourselves.|$|E

500|$|Diệm {{arrived at}} noon on May 8 at the National Airport in Washington, D.C. aboard the plane of U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Columbine III, a silver Constellation. Diệm's plane landed and he was {{personally}} received at the airport by Eisenhower, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Nathan Twining. It was {{only the second time}} in his presidency that Eisenhower had personally gone to the airport to greet a visiting head of state. Diệm was then given a 21-gun salute and driven by limousine to his residence. A crowd estimated at more than 50,000 lined the route taken by the Vietnamese leader's motorcade. On the day of his arrival, The New York Times editorialized that [...] "President Diệm... is a substantial partner in a going enterprise on behalf of free men in his country and in ours. <b>We</b> <b>honor</b> him and make him doubly welcome on that account." [...] Attempting to put a positive spin on the South Vietnamese leader's lack of emotion towards the crowd, Andrew Tully of The Washington Daily News informed his readers that Diệm's [...] "air of modest solemnity was far more impressive than any grinning, arm-waving performance could have been". Diệm's failure to respond to the greetings of the masses was not new; when he arrived back in Vietnam from exile to become prime minister in 1954, he did not bother to wave to well-wishers at Tan Son Nhut Airport.|$|E

Naturally molted eagle feathers are gathered by the tribe for legally permitted religious use. Victor Roubidoux, an Iowa tribal member, serves as the aviary manager. The tribe is currently raising funds to expand the aviary, since spaces for eagles filled up almost immediately with birds from throughout the United States.

For Mexicans of that generation, and generations to come, the San Patricios were heroes who came to their aid in an hour of need. Successive Mexican presidents have praised the San Patricios; Vicente Fox Quesada stated that [...] "The affinities between Ireland and Mexico {{go back to the}} first years of our nation, when our country fought to preserve its national sovereignty... Then, a brave group of Irish soldiers... in a heroic gesture, decided to fight against the foreign ground invasion", and Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo stated [...] "Members of the St. Patrick's Battalion were executed for following their consciences.

2500|$|It is {{the future}} of the students, not the future of the parents, that is imperiled by today's decision. If a parent keeps his child out of school beyond the grade school, then the child will be forever barred from entry into the new and amazing world of {{diversity}} that we have today. The child may decide that that is the preferred course, or he may rebel. It is the student's judgment, not his parents', that is essential if we are to give full meaning to what we have said about the Bill of Rights and of the right of students to be masters of their own destiny. [...] If he is harnessed to the Amish way of life by those in authority over him and if his education is truncated, his entire life may be stunted and deformed. The child, therefore, should be given an opportunity to be heard before the State gives the exemption which <b>we</b> <b>honor</b> today." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the event}} {{known by the}} critics as the [...] "Miracle of the Vistula," [...] the Polish Army {{under the command of}} Marshal Józef Piłsudski {{successfully}} repulsed a Red Army offensive outside of Warsaw in mid-August 1920. The defeat of the Russian army ensured the capital's protection and the survival of the young Second Polish Republic. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs Stanisław Szeptycki established the Feast of the Soldier (Święta Żołnierza), or Soldiers Day, in 1923. In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, [...] "n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, <b>we</b> <b>honor</b> the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence." [...] The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the 21st Mountain Division's evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat. Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, {{as well as for the}} armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.|$|E

Bush and the federal {{government}} to halt the designation of the proposed Marianas Trench Marine National Monument in the Northern Mariana Islands. The designation was opposed by Fitial, the government of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Carolinian Affairs Advisory Committee and the Guam Legislature. All feared harm to the local economy and cultural practices if the national monument was created. In her letter, Fitial wrote that the monument designation was avoidable and appealed to Bush, [...] "We are simple Americans, a globally responsible Commonwealth of the U.S. <b>We</b> <b>honor</b> and uphold a long tradition of coexistence with Mother Ocean. Island heritage passed down from our elders teaches us that we and nature are one." [...] Despite the appeals, President Bush created the national monument on January 6, 2009.
