500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Diving Bell and the Butterball", was {{met with}} mixed reactions. Marnell called the parody [...] "wildly unfunny", while Childs was {{critical}} of Homer turning into a paralyzed Spider-Man and stated that it was [...] "simply not very funny." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com was more ambivalent and said: [...] "I found this sketch to be simultaneously awesome and terrible because I have the maturity of a 6-year old and the intelligence of an average man." [...] The reference to the Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark was noticed by the producers of the musical. They [...] reacted by issuing a statement the following day: [...] "Everyone at 'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' was extremely flattered by last night’s tribute on 'The Simpsons.' 'The Simpsons' is an iconic American institution, and being part of last night's episode was an honor and dream come true." [...] Coincidentally, the previous aired episode of South Park, [...] "Broadway Bro Down", also had {{a reference to the}} musical, but the spokesperson for the Broadway show did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> that episode.|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "What Was Missing" [...] became {{controversial}} {{because of}} an allegedly implied past relationship between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum. The controversy largely began after an accompanying [...] "Mathematical" [...] recap—a studio-endorsed behind the scenes video series implied that there were lesbian relations between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and that the writing staff actively seeks input from fans. This incident was addressed by the show's producer, Fred Seibert, who said that [...] "in {{trying to get the}} show’s audience involved we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far." [...] Soon after, the video recap and the entire channel was pulled off of YouTube, although [...] "What Was Missing" [...] still airs during reruns. Seibert's decision to remove the video also proved controversial; Bitch magazine later wrote an article about how the episode [...] "handled female desire—female queer desire at that—in a subtle but complex way", but that the removal of the recap and the studio's perceived treatment of the controversy was detrimental towards the acceptance of queer romance in children's television. Ward later addressed the issue and gave a more neutral view; he said that, because there were [...] "so many extreme positions taken on it all over the Internet", he did not [...] "really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> it [...] it was a big hullaballoo." [...] In August 2014, Olson commented on the controversy, telling a crowd of fans gathered at a Barnes & Noble book signing from The Adventure Time Encyclopedia, that, according to Ward, Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had dated in the past, but that because the series airs in some areas where homosexual relationships are illegal, the show {{has not been able to}} officially make clear the relationship in the series itself.|$|E

[...] According to Noxon, the series is based on what really happens in the world of reality show production. Shapiro says, [...] "Viewers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> believe in fairy tales, and those reality shows tap into that want. Our show dismantles that want."

If I had it to do all over again... I wouldn't kill him. I regret it more and more as time goes on. I got rid of what? 20% of the gay characters at Marvel by killing off this ONE character.
