When using radioactive materials it is necessary to test for accidental contamination, whether from use of liquid unsealed sources or to check for leaking sealed sources.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel and versatile approach to robustly bind TiO 2 nanoparticles on thin film composite (TFC) membranes by using polydopamine, which is capable to self-polymerize on membranes {{as well as}} on the surfaces of nanoparticles. The traditional self-assembly method is used as a reference. The binding performance of both methods is investigated by rinsing and <b>wiping</b> <b>tests</b> and evaluated by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). In addition, the effects of the concentration of TiO 2 nanoparticles in the suspension as well as the polymerization time of dopamine on the binding performance are studied. It was observed that, for the same modification and rinsing conditions, the polydopamine method is able to bind significantly more TiO 2 on the membrane surface. According to the <b>wiping</b> <b>test,</b> the quantity of nanoparticles embedded in the polydopamine layer does not change. However, the traditional self-assembly method cannot stand the wiping force and no nanoparticles are left after wiping. The interesting hydrophilicity and the filtration performance of each modification step is further investigated. The polydopamine significantly increases the water contact angle of the polyamide thin film composite (TFC) membranes. The membranes modified by the traditional self-assembly method exhibit a significant flux loss compared to the original membranes. On the contrary, the polydopamine method can keep the membrane performance. Thus, this procedure can be considered as a novel and versatile method to bind TiO 2 nanoparticles on TFC membranes, and it can be easily adapted for a variety of membranes to bind nanomaterials without a complex surface pretreatment. status: publishe...|$|R

Implementation of this simple protocol provides understanding of interactions during the process and also has technological and economical impacts. It permits quality control (QC) of deposition efficiency by control of splat morphologies and aids in the definition of specifications for the powders used (for example, in terms of the lower and upper limits of the particle size distribution leading to the formation of a deposit with given processing parameters) allowing the optimization of the spray parameters to obtain high-integrity deposits...|$|E

Two methods arc selected and examined. The two methods. X-ray fluorescence and optical counting, can be used for detecting and quantifying the amount of mine dust on flat surfaces. X-ray fluorescence is based on element detection, a method that yields mine-dust mass measurement, whereas optical analysis is a particle counting technique that gives the number of mine-dust particles versus size. Samples with different amounts of mine dust are collected from the mine and/or generated with a modified glove-box at the lab by using tape-lift <b>tests,</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>tests,</b> and witness-plates.

According to NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) contamination should be monitored in nuclear medicine centers where radiopharmaceuticals are prepared and administrated at the end of each working session; otherwise, contamination spread to other areas not only equipment but also personnel and other people will be expected. The <b>wipe</b> <b>test</b> for the presence of radioactivity is accomplished by wiping the surface over an area approximately 100 cm² with an absorbent paper, then counting it in an appropriate radiation detector.

This method presents considerable advantages in comparison with standard procedures, as f. ex. reduction of radioactive waste or area covering investigation of the inspected building. A system with a NaI(Tl) and a HPGe-detector was applied. With the high-resolving system it can be shown that also low limit values can be kept with short measurement time. With the NaI(Tl) -detector system it was demonstrated that with limit values lower than 1 Bq/m" 3 there may be problems observing the limit values. The investigation showed that especially the high-resolving system for the release measurement of buildings (f. ex. floors, walls, complete rooms) is well-suited. The in-situ gamma-scanning shows big advantages in its economy as f. ex. no sampling and only short measurement times are required. The sharp limitation of the existing contamination and the reduction of radioactive waste involved herewith are further advantages which justify the application of this measurement technique. (orig.)

The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assisted in the investigation by providing epidemiologic and laboratory support to the state and local health departments. Although the initial investigation found MP inside the homes, it was unclear if the residents were exposed. CDC used a new biological monitoring method to measure urinary p-nitrophenol (PNP), the metabolite of MP. This biological monitoring measures the internal dose from exposure to toxic chemicals from all routes. Laboratory analyses demonstrated that the urine of residents contained moderate to high levels of PNP, with median, mean, and highest reported concentrations of 28, 240, and 4, 800 g/L, respectively, thus confirming exposure of the residents.

Local desensitization of TRPV 1 in sensory neurons by prolonged, high dose stimulation is re-engaged in clinical practice to achieve analgesia, but the effects of such treatments on the vascular TRPV 1 are not known. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Newborn rats were injected with capsaicin for five days. Sensory activation was measured by eye <b>wiping</b> <b>tests</b> and plasma extravasation. Isolated, pressurized skeletal muscle arterioles were used to characterize TRPV 1 mediated vascular responses, while expression of TRPV 1 was detected by immunohistochemistry. KEY RESULTS: Capsaicin evoked sensory responses, such as eye wiping (3. 6 ± 2. 5 versus 15. 5 ± 1. 4 wipes, p< 0. 01) or plasma extravasation (evans blue accumulation 10 ± 3 versus 33 ± 7 µg/g, p< 0. 05) were reduced in desensitized rats. In accordance, the number of TRPV 1 positive sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia was also decreased. However, TRPV 1 expression in smooth muscle cells was not affected by the treatment. There were no differences in the diameter (192 ± 27 versus 194 ± 8 µm), endothelium mediated dilations (evoked by acetylcholine), norepinephrine mediated constrictions, myogenic response and in the capsaicin evoked constrictions of arterioles isolated from skeletal muscle.

Using a short-lived radionuclide, a method was developed to quantify such leakage. A Becton Dickinson FACS Aria TM cell sorter with an Aerosol Management System was run in normal and failure modes using a radioactive technetium- 99 m saline solution. The air outside of containment and the surfaces inside and outside were tested for radioactive contamination. An intrinsic highresolution germanium gamma-ray detector and associated gamma-ray spectroscopy system were used to quantify the radioactivity in the starting solution and on air sampling filters. A liquid scintillation counter was used to quantify the radioactivity on wipe tests and on filter disks positioned inside and outside the instrument, and in collected liquid samples. Radiation safety precautions were in place and no significant exposures to operators or statistically significant leakage outside of containment occurred. Based on the specific activity of the radioactive solution, the level of radioactive contamination detected provides an estimate of the volume of generated aerosol inside or outside containment.

40|$|Background  The role {{of nickel}} in causing hand {{dermatitis}} in some occupations {{has been difficult}} to assess due to problems with reliable measurement of the exposure to nickel in the workplace and lack of a definitive threshold for nickel allergic contact dermatitis. It is not uncommon to find nickel allergy on patch testing {{but it is difficult to}} determine whether this is of relevance to occupational nickel exposure or simply a reflection of past exposure to nickel-plated jewellery or other nonoccupational nickel exposure. Objectives  To devise a simple and reproducible method to quantify the amount of nickel on the skin and to apply the technique to measure dermal nickel exposure in various occupational settings. Methods  A rapid and simple sampling procedure was developed for determination of nickel on the skin of workers potentially exposed to nickel by exposing individuals to nickel-releasing coins and measuring exposure by immersing the exposed thumbs and index fingers directly into graduated sample tubes containing ultrapure water and aqueous nickel extracts. The solutions were analysed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry after stabilization with nitric acid. The method shows advantages over alternatives such as <b>wipe</b> <b>testing</b> and tape stripping in terms of extraction efficiency, speed and ease of operation in the field. A pilot survey of dermal nickel exposure for workers in several occupational settings was conducted. Results  The study suggested that a ‘normal’ level of nickel on the skin is < 10 ng cm− 2. Coin handling induced an appreciable increase in the amount of nickel on the skin within 2 min. Experiments indicated a linear relationship between coin handling (exposure time) and measured dermal nickel levels following standardized coin handling. A pilot survey, conducted among cashiers, shop assistants, bar staff, hairdressers and workers in the nickel industry revealed dermal nickel concentrations ranging from < 0 · 9 to 7160 ng cm− 2.

Given the effects of ionizing radiation on human health, rules and regulations have been enacted to avoid contamination, that in working with radioactive materials should be followed to minimize them.. Material and Method: After mapping of nuclear medicine centers in the province, areas that should be studied for measuring the amount of radioactive contamination were determined. The site selection for the tests {{were based on the}} area in which the possibility of further contamination were existance. After measuring the background count rate the radioactive {{contamination in}} studied areas were performed using <b>Wipe</b> <b>Test..</b> Result: The mean level of background contamination in centers 1, 2 and 3 were 1. 75 ± 0. 150 μCi, 4. 43 ± 0. 615 μCi and 2. 47 ± 0. 055 μCi, respectively. In center 1, only region of Hood pollution was much higher than the permissible limit. In center 2, radioactive contamination of the waiting room, patient rooms, warehouse radiotracer, control room, hood, desk and floor center was exceeded. Also, in center 3, contamination of the doorway, hallway patients, control room, hood, desk, sink, cabinets, room and floor imaging injection (control), respectively, were higher than the permissible limits.. Conclusion: In centers 1 and 2, most of the radioactive contamination occurred under the hood due to labeling of radiopharmaceuticals activity. Also, in center 3, the highest contamination rate belonged to patients’ corridor that could be due to frequent the area.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{contamination}} sites exist {{in this country}} where the area and volume of material to be remediated is very large, approaching or exceeding 10 {sup 6 } M{sup 2 } and 10 {sup 6 } M{sup 3 }. Typically, {{only a small fraction}} of this material is actually contaminated. In such cases there is a strong economic motivation to test the material with a sufficient density of measurements to identify which portions are uncontaminated, so extensively they be left in place or be disposed of as uncontaminated waste. Unfortunately, since contamination often varies rapidly from position to position, this procedure can involve upwards of one million measurements per site. The situation is complicated further in many cases by the difficulties of sampling porous surfaces, such as concrete. For example, on concrete the standard <b>wipe</b> <b>test</b> provides results that are strongly operator- and surface condition-dependent. The results are not usually available real time, because the wipe samples are sent to a remote laboratory for analysis, entailing a delay of days to weeks between sampling and results. Further, the cost of analysis of a clean sample is usually the same as that of a contaminated sample; analysis of clean samples thereby increases the total analysis costs considerably. Another method for surface/sub surface characterization is to obtain a boring or a drilling. This method also involves the off-site analysis of the drilled material, incorporating the time and economic penalties described above. Other disadvantages of drilling techniques are disfiguration of the surface and distribution of contamination through byproduct dust. It is for the above reasons that we have chosen to develop thermal sampling methods for characterization of concrete, transite, and contaminated bulk debris. The sampling system we describe has been designed to greatly reduce the economic penalty posed by these difficulties...|$|E

Methods The surfaces of 752 sites within nurse and patient areas in three hospitals located in a central area of Sapporo, Japan were evaluated by the ATP and stamp methods, and each surface was sampled 8 times in 2 months. These areas were located in different ward units (Internal Medicine, Surgery, and Obstetrics and Gynecology). Detection limits for the ATP and stamp methods were determined by spike experiments with a diluted bacterial solution and a <b>wipe</b> <b>test</b> on student tables not in use during winter vacation, respectively. Values were expressed as the fold change over the detection limit, and a sample with a value higher than the detection limit by either method was defined as positive. Results The detection limits were determined to be 127 relative light units (RLU) per 100 cm 2 for the ATP method and 5. 3 colony-forming units (CFU) per 10 cm 2 for the stamp method. The positive frequency of the ATP and stamp methods was 59. 8 % (450 / 752) and 47. 7 % (359 / 752), respectively, although {{no significant difference in}} the positive frequency among the hospitals was seen. Both methods revealed the presence of a wide range of organic contamination spread via hand touching, including microbial contamination, with a preponderance on the entrance floor and in patient rooms. Interestingly, the data of both methods indicated considerable variability regardless of daily visual assessment with usual wiping, and positive surfaces were irregularly seen. Nurse areas were relatively cleaner than patient areas. Finally, there was no significant correlation between the number of patients or medical personnel in the hospital and organic or microbiological contamination. Conclusions Ongoing daily hospital cleanliness is not sufficient in Japanese hospitals with a tendency toward long-term care...|$|E
50|$|Bum Boosa’s Bamboo Baby Wipes {{are made}} in China as of 2014 and were {{formerly}} made in the United States. They are the second baby wipes brand to be USDA certified as biobased. Bum Boosa Bamboo Baby Wipes are manufactured using the rayon or viscose method for turning cellulose from bamboo into usable fiber. During the chemical processing, hermetic containers trap and contain the chemicals which are recycled - not released into the factory, environment or atmosphere. In addition, Bum Boosa Baby <b>Wipes</b> have passed <b>tests</b> in the U.S.A. to determine the absence of 1,4 dioxane, formaldehyde, bispenol- A, and detection of elemental chlorine.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. This study tested an {{infection}} control protocol for photostimulable phosphor (PSP) sensors while simulating multiple uses. Methods. Dental hygiene students (n= 36) {{were randomly assigned}} to a control group (dry <b>wipe)</b> or <b>test</b> group (disinfectant <b>wipe).</b> A sterile, barriered sensor was placed in a peer patient's mouth to simulate an exposure. After simulation, the barriered sensors were disinfected, placed into a new barrier, and inserted into the same peer patient's mouth. Following the fourth placement and treatment, sensors were vortexed in specimen cups containing trypticase soy broth (TSB) and incubated at 37 C to detect contamination by oral bacteria. Results. Bacterial growth in TSB was monitored as a change in optical density and by quantitation of oral streptococci on Mitis-salivarius agar. The barrier-protected sensors were minimally contaminated (< 105 colony forming units/ml at baseline) regardless of treatment. After culture amplification, the control TSB had more samples that remained negative through 48 hours (5 / 18 vs. 0 / 18 for test group, p< 0. 05). Conclusion. Barrier envelopes used with the PSP sensors appeared to be an effective way of reducing microbial contamination...|$|R
40|$|Background The rise {{in health}} care-associated infections has placed a greater {{emphasis}} on cleaning and disinfection practices. The majority of policies advocate using detergent-based products for routine cleaning, with detergent wipes increasingly being used; however, there is no information about their ability to remove and subsequently transfer pathogens in practice. Methods Seven detergent <b>wipes</b> were <b>tested</b> for their ability to remove and transfer Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Clostridium difficile spores using the 3 -stage wipe protocol. Results The ability of the detergent wipes to remove S aureus, A baumannii, and C difficile spores from a stainless steel surface ranged from 1. 50 log 10 (range, 0. 24 - 3. 25), 3. 51 log 10 (range, 3. 01 - 3. 81), and 0. 96 log 10 (range, 0. 26 - 1. 44), respectively, following a 10 -second wiping time. All wipes repeatedly transferred significant amounts of bacteria/spores over 3 consecutive surfaces, although the percentage of total microorganisms transferred from the wipes after wiping was low for a number of products. Conclusions Detergent-based wipe products have 2 major drawbacks: their variability in removing microbial bioburden from inanimate surfaces and a propensity to transfer pathogens between surfaces. The use of additional complementary measures such as combined detergent/disinfectant-based products and/or antimicrobial surfaces need to be considered for appropriate infection control and prevention...|$|R
