500|$|Only sixteen Republicans {{remained}} in the Senate, most progressives, when Congress met in January 1937, but Borah retained much influence as he was liked and respected by Democrats. Many of Roosevelt's New Deal policies, such as the NRA, were struck down by the Supreme Court during Roosevelt's first term, {{but he had no}} opportunities to make an appointment to the court in his first four years. In 1937, he proposed what {{came to be known as}} the court-packing scheme, that for every justice over the age of seventy, an additional one could be appointed. This would give Roosevelt six picks, but would require Congress to pass legislation, to which Borah was immediately opposed, believing it would be the death of the Supreme Court as an independent institution. Although he refused to take the lead in the bipartisan opposition, Borah wrote a section of the committee report dealing with the history and independence of the court. When the matter came to the Senate floor, Borah was asked to make the opening speech, but again deferred to the Democratic majority, and Roosevelt's plan was defeated. [...] The court crisis had also been defused by the retirement of the Senior Associate Justice, Willis Van Devanter, a Taft appointee. [...] When Borah was asked if he had played a role in Van Devanter's retirement, he responded, [...] "Well, guess for yourself. <b>We</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same apartment house." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{governments of}} Bihar, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand have urged the Government of India {{to declare the}} nilgai as vermin; the {{proposal}} has been implemented in Bihar, where nilgai can now be hunted to minimise the damages incurred by locals. The Uttar Pradesh government has given farmers and firearm licence holders the right to cull the animals. However, animal rights activists {{in various parts of}} India were unhappy with the decision. Shivanshu K. Srivastava, a columnist and social activist, wrote that [...] "The culling of nilgais (blue bulls) in Bihar in July 2016 was so deplorable that it doesn't need any justification. The excuse given for this slew by the State government, the then environment minister Prakash Javadekar and the judiciary is so illogical that it mocks all the solutions available to stop the nilgais from destroying the farms. [...] <b>We</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 21st century and culling is only the very last option we have. The farmers can either opt for fencing around the farmlands or if it's unaffordable, then the government can give ordinances to relocate them to the forests." [...] The state governments have attempted other initiatives to curb the nilgai menace: in November 2015, the Rajasthan government came up with a proposal to allow shooting nilgai with non-lethal darts to inhibit fertilisation in their bodies, so as to regulate their increasing populations. As the name [...] "nilgai" [...] appeals to the religious sentiments of Hindus, the Government of Madhya Pradesh has sought to officially rename it as rojad (Hindi for [...] "forest antelope") and the Government of Haryana to rename it as roze in a bid to make their culling acceptable.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fine-tuned}} Universe {{argument has}} also been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination, as it assumes no other forms of life, {{sometimes referred to as}} carbon chauvinism. Conceptually, alternative biochemistry or other forms of life are possible. Regarding this, Stenger argued: [...] "We {{have no reason to believe}} that our kind of carbon-based life is all that is possible. Furthermore, modern cosmology theorises that multiple universes may exist with different constants and laws of physics. So, it is not surprising that <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> one suited for us. The Universe is not fine-tuned to life; life is fine-tuned to the Universe." ...|$|E

The concept of the [...] "Worlds" [...] {{is linked to}} the ancient Aztec belief that the world is renewed every five thousand years—a period called a [...] "Sun" [...] (currently <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fifth Sun). The date of the beginning of the [...] "Sixth World" [...] is based on the ancient Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, which when Shadowrun was developed was correlated as finishing a 5,200-year-long cycle on 24 December 2011. The understanding of the Maya that resulted in the use of the 2011 date and the use of the [...] "worlds" [...] concept is due to the influence of Frank Waters's 1975 book Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth World of Consciousness, whose elaborate cosmology is selectively utilized in the framework of the Shadowrun universe. Waters took his information about the date of the end of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar from the 1966 edition of Michael D. Coe's The Maya.|$|E
2500|$|Giddens' {{theory of}} {{structuration}} explores {{the question of}} whether it is individuals or social forces that shape our social reality. He eschews extreme positions, arguing that although people are not entirely free to choose their own actions, and their knowledge is limited, they nonetheless are the agency which reproduces the social structure and leads to social change. His ideas find an echo in the philosophy of the modernist poet Wallace Stevens who suggests that <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tension between the shapes we take as the world acts upon us, and the ideas of order that our imagination imposes upon the world. Giddens writes that the connection between structure and action is a fundamental element of social theory, structure and agency are a duality that cannot be conceived of apart from one another and his main argument is contained in his expression [...] "duality of structure". At a basic level, this means that people make society, but are at the same time constrained by it. Action and structure cannot be analysed separately, as structures are created, maintained and changed through actions, while actions are given meaningful form only through the background of the structure: the line of causality runs in both directions making it impossible to determine what is changing what. In Giddens own words (from New rules...) : ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2005, a {{group of}} more than 20 {{religious}} leaders from the Guilford [...] County area, [...] "including those of Christian, Jewish and Buddhist faiths", {{sent a letter to}} Superior Court Judge W.

[...] It went on to say [...] "In North Carolina, we continue to be people who take our religious beliefs and practices very seriously. But we no longer live in the Bible Belt. Today, <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bible-Talmud-Qur'an-Veda-Dhammapada-Guru Granth Sahib-Kitabi Iqan Belt.

[...] The executive director of FaithAction (an interfaith organization) Rev. Mark Sills, signed the letter and said that the Qur'an oath case [...] "struck us as an issue that needs to be confronted". He asked Christians to {{imagine what it would be}} like to live in a place where the Bible was not allowed for oaths, saying [...] "That just feels like a slap in the face." [...] Rev. Julie Peeples, pastor of Greensboro's Congregational United Church of Christ, signed the letter and said [...] "I think it's an opportunity to foster greater respect for all the traditions we have in Greensboro."
