5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
25|$|I {{think we}} were all pretty naive about what we, what we were achieving—we were having too much fun to get kind of caught up. We'd just {{released}} our second album overseas on an independent label; and, spent time in America as an independent act. And that was around about the time <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> our own label, just to, um, release, maybe, release a few, some bands of friends of ours, in bands.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} contour {{integration}} comprises {{a major part}} of complex analysis. In this context the direction of travel around a closed curve is important– reversing the direction in which the curve is traversed multiplies the value of the integral by 1. By convention the positive direction is counterclockwise. For example, the unit circle is traversed in the positive direction when we start at the point z = 1, then travel up and to the left through the point z = i, then down and to the left through 1, then down and to the right through i, and finally up and to the right to z = 1, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>started.</b>|$|E

500|$|Lead {{singer and}} guitarist Mikey Heppner, {{who listened to}} {{progressive}} rock in his youth, wrote things that he initially withheld from the band, because he felt that his bandmates would not understand him - he described his work as being [...] "way too proggy". Despite his initial doubt, they loved his work when he showed it to them. Thereafter, Heppner began describing the forthcoming record in progressive rock terms during interviews. He told the Whistler Question that it [...] "is a little more musically complex; deeper into the sort of metal side <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> out from", but that [...] "It still sounds like us". He also told Jam! that the new songs were [...] "leaning toward progressive (rock) territory".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. In 2007, Patrick Enright of MSNBC called the episode his eighth {{favorite of the}} show. He praised the references to Terminator 2 in the episode, as well as Lisa's self-referential quote about how, [...] "by next week, we'll be back to <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>started</b> from, ready for another wacky adventure." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the episode had [...] "some great existential musings" [...] from Lisa. They added that it also [...] "contains some nice moments highlighting {{the differences between the}} Simpsons and the Flanders." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said: [...] "I always remembered [...] to be a great episode – and I recalled correctly. Sure, the show goes with a less than creative presence; it’s an easy story to make characters behave in atypical ways. However, the development of the theme is terrific, as we learn the friendship of Homer Simpson is worse than the antagonism of Homer Simpson." [...] DVD Talk gave the episode a 4 out of 5 score. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B grade, claiming the [...] "rather large dose of sentimentality" [...] and [...] "fewer moments of absurdity" [...] in the episode gave it [...] "the feeling that it belongs in one of the series' earlier seasons". The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the second best episode of the show with a sports theme.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998 Housden re-established Little River Band with Wade and new {{contracted}} members Paul Gildea on vocals and guitars; Kevin Murphy on vocals, {{drums and}} percussion; and Adrian Scott on vocals and keyboards (ex-Air Supply) {{and brought back}} Roger McLachlan, who returned after 22 years, on bass guitar. McLachlan's second tenure was short lived; both he and Scott departed after a year, not accustomed to the band's touring schedule. Nelson returned in early 1999 and Glenn Reither joined on keyboards, sax and backing vocals [...] Gildea and Wade left next in early 2000 with Australian Greg Hind joining on vocals and guitars and Nelson taking over as lead singer. The line-up of Hind, Housden, Nelson, Murphy and Reither recorded two studio albums, <b>Where</b> <b>We</b> <b>Started</b> From (November 2000) and Test of Time (June 2004).|$|E

The formalization of all other concepts in abstract algebra is based on that of the group. We give an example of a formalization of a concrete group, the Klein 4 -group...|$|R
