5|$|A notable {{incident}} that occurred was {{the assassination of}} Lord Mayo, the Viceroy of India who had visited the islands on an inspection tour. He had visited the Ross Island penal settlement. The attack on Lord Mayo {{was carried out by}} Sher Ali, one of the convicts of the penal colony who <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sick leave; the assassination was carried out while Mayo was returning after a pleasant trip to Mount Harriet on the evening of 8 February 1872. Another political prisoner who suffered the longest period of 47 years of incarceration was Musai Singh who was released for good behavior in July 1907 {{on the occasion of the}} 50th anniversary of India's First War of Independence in 1857.|$|E
5|$|After an {{intensive}} planning, maintenance, and briefing period, {{the mission was}} scheduled for January 1, 1967. Poor weather caused a 24-hour delay, but even then, a solid overcast covered the North Vietnamese airbases at Phúc Yên, Gia Lam, Kép, and Cat Bai when the bogus strike force began arriving over the target area, five-minute intervals separating the flights of F-4s. Leading the first flight, Olds overflew the primary MiG-21 base at Phúc Yên and <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> second pass when MiGs finally began popping up through the cloud base. Although at first seemingly random in nature, it quickly {{became apparent that the}} MiGs were ground-controlled intercepts designed to place the supposed F-105s in a vise between enemies to their front and rear.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in July 1940, Gens was fired from his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to continue to live in Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in Vilnius, and although Gens <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> list to be sent to Soviet labor camps, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Ūsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital {{did not need to be}} informed of his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.|$|E

5|$|Ashford's {{importance}} as an agricultural and market town {{grew in the}} 13th century, and in 1243, King Henry III granted the town a charter to hold a market for livestock. The pottery industry expanded in the 13th and 14th centuries, with the main works based at what is now Potter's Corner, a few {{miles west of the}} town centre. Later evidence from examining waste suggests that production <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large scale. The Kent Archaeological society have discovered sandy ware at this location dating from around 1125 – 1250.|$|E

5|$|Banksia cuneata was {{declared}} critically endangered after a 1982 survey found only five populations comprising about 450 plants. The largest population, consisting of around 300 plants, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> conservation reserve, but all others were on road verges, and contained only 50–70 plants each. However, since then more {{plants have been}} located, and populations {{have been found to}} be gradually increasing in response to a number of conservation measures including fencing and baiting of rabbits. In recognition of its slight recovery, it is now considered endangered but no longer critically so.|$|E
40|$|Avian erythroblastosis {{virus has}} transduced two {{cellular}} genes, c-erb-A and c-erb-B. Using fractionated chicken chromosomes, {{we found that}} the two genes <b>are</b> located <b>on</b> different chromosomes in the chicken genome: c-erb-A <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> microchromosome, and c-erb-B <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large chromosome. The locations of two other cellular oncogenes (c-fps and c-myb) were also determined: c-fps <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> microchromosome, and c-myb <b>is</b> <b>on</b> chromosome of <b>an</b> intermediate size. Our results suggest that avian erythroblastosis virus had transduced the two cellular genes independently, conforming to previous indications that cellular oncogenes are dispersed among multiple chromosomes in every species that has been examined...|$|R

5|$|Braathen SAFE Flight 139 was an {{aircraft}} hijacking {{that occurred in}} Norway on 21 June 1985.

5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his way}} wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E

5|$|Captain Renaudin {{was said}} in a naval {{registry}} to have swum to safety. He had in fact abandoned his ship with the first British boat, leaving his men behind in disregard for military customs and the 1765 standing order that Captains had to be last to abandon ship, and though his account insinuates that he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> boat close to Vengeur when she foundered, he was actually dining in the mess of Culloden {{at the moment of}} the sinking. In 1795, Loutherbourg depicted the rescue of Vengeurs crew by British ships in his large canvas of the battle, Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury derives {{its name}} from the Anglo-Saxon Dyddi's burg, {{probably}} referring to a man known as Dyddi whose stronghold or township it <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> low cliff overlooking a place where the River Mersey could be forded. In the 13th century Didsbury was variously referred to as Dydesbyre, Dydesbiri, Didsbury or Dodesbury.|$|E
5|$|During the 1850s, Utica {{was known}} to aid more than 650 {{fugitive}} slaves; it {{played a major role}} as a station in the Underground Railroad. The city <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> slave escape route from the Southern Tier to Canada by way of Albany, Syracuse and Rochester. The route, used by Harriet Tubman to travel to Buffalo, guided slaves to pass through Utica on the New York Central Railroad right-of-way en route to Canada. Utica was the locus for Methodist preacher Orange Scott's antislavery sermons during the 1830s and 1840s, and Scott formed an abolitionist group there in 1843. Despite efforts by local abolitionists, pro-slavery riots and mobs, who wanted to protect the cotton mills, forced many abolitionist meetings to other cities.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{attempted}} assassination of Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, Vice President George H. W. Bush did not assume the presidential powers and duties as Acting President. Reagan {{was unable to}} invoke Section 3, {{because he was in}} surgery. Bush did not invoke Section 4, because he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> plane returning from Texas. Reagan was out of surgery by the time Bush arrived in Washington. In 1995, Birch Bayh, the primary sponsor of the amendment in the Senate, wrote that Section 4 should have been invoked.|$|E
5|$|For the regiment, {{expansion}} <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{more modest}} scale {{than that of}} the Great War. Ten battalions (see List of battalions of the King's Regiment (Liverpool)) were formed between 1939 and 1940, including the reconstituted 8th (Liverpool Irish) Battalion. Two of the battalions converted to armour and anti-air roles in 1941: the 11th became the 152nd Regiment in the Royal Armoured Corps, but continued to wear their King's Regiment cap badge on the black beret of the RAC, as did all infantry units converted in this way, while the 12th transferred to the Royal Artillery as 101st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment.|$|E

On board were three Scottish biologists, William Milne (a gardener-botanist from the Edinburgh Botanic Garden), John Macgillivray (naturalist) who collected fish and plant specimens, and Assistant Surgeon and zoologist Denis Macdonald. Together these men established much basic information on the geology, flora and fauna of the island.|$|E
