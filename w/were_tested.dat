40|$|This study {{explored}} the thought {{processes that are}} associated with reluctance in gay men to <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> for HIV antibodies. The sample comprised 97 men who had not <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> for at least four years; 69 had never <b>been</b> <b>tested.</b> They <b>were</b> asked to imagine that someone had suggested that they <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> very soon and to identify, from the list provided, any negative thoughts prompted by this suggestion. The most commonly reported thoughts <b>were</b> that <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> unnecessary because risks had not been taken, that it was unnecessary because there were no symptoms, {{and that there was no}} urgency to <b>be</b> <b>tested.</b> Data <b>were</b> explored by means of factor analysis and comparisons across subgroups differing in risk level. The results are interpreted as indicating the use of rationalizations to buttress a decision not to <b>be</b> <b>tested,</b> the powerful influence on HIV decision-making exerted by salient perceptible features, and the ‘status quo bias’. Techniques that could be used to encourage testing in gay men are discussed. <br /...|$|R
5|$|The Susan B. Anthony {{dollar is}} a United States dollar coin minted from 1979 to 1981, when {{the series was}} {{suspended}} due to poor public acceptance, and then again in 1999.

5|$|The AV-8A's {{abilities}} in air-to-air combat <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> by the Marine Corps by conducting mock dogfights with McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs; these exercises trained pilots {{to use the}} vectoring-in-forward-flight (VIFF) capability to outmanoeuvre their opponents and showed that the Harriers could act as effective air-to-air fighters at close range. The success of Harrier operations countered scepticism of V/STOL aircraft, which had been judged to be expensive failures in the past. Marine Corps officers became convinced of the military advantages of the Harrier and pursued extensive development of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The prototypes for the M-1 series were Do 17M V1 (Werk Nr 691) and Do 17M V2 (Werk Nr 692) which <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> with bomb {{loads of}} a medium bomber.
