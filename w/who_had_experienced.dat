5|$|Ap Bac had {{far-reaching}} {{consequences for}} the South Vietnamese government and the American involvement in Vietnam. The battle was a milestone for the Viet Cong. For individual Viet Cong soldiers, the battle demonstrated they could defeat nominally superior ARVN forces, well equipped as they were with up-to-date military hardware and significant support and funding from the United States. Militarily, the morale and confidence of Viet Cong commanders and soldiers, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> serious setbacks in the previous year, were greatly boosted. Politically, the Viet Cong 261st and 514th Battalions were able to exploit the prestige gained from having inflicted disproportionate losses on the ARVN forces to exercise greater influence in their areas of operations.|$|E

25|$|Vancomycin has {{traditionally}} been considered a nephrotoxic and ototoxic drug, based on observations by early investigators of elevated serum levels in renally impaired patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> ototoxicity, and subsequently through case reports in the medical literature. However, {{as the use of}} vancomycin increased with the spread of MRSA beginning in the 1970s, the previously reported rates of toxicity were recognized as not being observed. This was attributed to the removal of the impurities present in the earlier formulation of the drug, although those impurities were not specifically tested for toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Women {{are more}} likely than men to {{experience}} sexual harassment, especially for those working in traditionally masculine occupations. In addition, a study indicated that sexual harassment negatively affects workers' psychological well-being. Another study found that level of harassment at workplaces lead to differences in performance of work related tasks. High levels of harassment were related to the worst outcomes, and no harassment was related to least negative outcomes. In other words, women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> a higher level of harassment were more likely to perform poorly at workplaces.|$|E

30|$|Interest in {{art therapy}} {{commenced}} {{in the care}} of traumatised adults and {{it should be noted that}} there is limited research on the effectiveness of art therapy in general.

Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> {{the brunt of the}} Cultural Revolution and its dislocations in their teens and young adulthood, including the exposure to and participation in yangge performances, began to reach mandatory retirement age in the mid-1990s, or were laid off from state-run enterprises following privatization. Some also began experiencing marital stress as husbands began having extramarital affairs with younger women, left home {{for long periods of time}} to work elsewhere, or both. They returned to dance as a way to stay fit, relieve boredom and socialize.|$|E
25|$|Celtic {{struggled}} in the 1977–78 season and Stein was persuaded to stand down. He {{was allowed to}} nominate his successor, Billy McNeill, and Stein thought an agreement was in place for him to join the Celtic board of directors. Celtic instead offered a management position in their pools company, which Stein rejected as he believed he still had something to offer football. A testimonial match for Stein was played against Liverpool at Celtic Park on 14 August 1978. After the game, the Liverpool manager Bob Paisley encouraged Stein, who was three years younger than Paisley, to stay in football. There was also the example of Bill Shankly, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> an unhappy retirement since leaving Liverpool in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Missionaries {{were not}} {{reluctant}} to take military action if they considered it {{an effective way to}} Christianize Japan. They often associated military action against Japan with the conquest of China. They thought that well-trained Japanese soldiers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> long civil wars would help their countries conquer China. For example, Alessandro Valignano said to the Philippine Governor {{that it was impossible to}} conquer Japan because the Japanese were very brave and always received military training but that Japan would benefit them when they would conquer China. Francisco Cabral also reported to the King of Spain that priests were able to send to China two or three thousand Japanese Christian soldiers who were brave and were expected to serve the king with little pay.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} linked smoking to anxiety disorders, {{suggesting}} the correlation (and possibly mechanism) {{may be related}} to the broad class of anxiety disorders, and not limited to just depression. Current and ongoing research attempt to explore the addiction-anxiety relationship. Data from multiple studies suggest that anxiety disorders and depression play a role in cigarette smoking. A history of regular smoking was observed more frequently among individuals <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> a major depressive disorder at some time in their lives than among individuals who had never experienced major depression or among individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. People with major depression are also much less likely to quit due to the increased risk of experiencing mild to severe states of depression, including a major depressive episode. Depressed smokers appear to experience more withdrawal symptoms on quitting, are less likely to be successful at quitting, and are more likely to relapse.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{into the}} race, six drivers had a {{mathematical}} {{chance to win}} the title, the most ever. The points standings were led by Davey Allison, driving the #28 Ford for Robert Yates Racing, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> a roller-coaster season. Allison had won the season opening Daytona 500, and four other races. However, his season was nearly halted on more than one occasion, after bad wrecks at Bristol in April, The Winston in May and at Pocono in June. In August, he mourned the death of his brother Clifford, who was killed practicing for the Busch Series race at Michigan. Allison rebounded, and won the second to last race of the season at Phoenix. Allison was attempting to become the second second-generation driver to win the Winston Cup Championship - his father Bobby won the title in 1983. At the time, Lee and Richard Petty were the only father-son duo to have won the championship.|$|E
25|$|Cranmer {{assigned}} Ridley {{to perform}} the consecration, and Ridley refused {{to do anything but}} follow the form of the ordinal as it had been prescribed by Parliament. Ridley, it seems likely, had some particular objection to Hooper. It has been suggested that Henrician exiles like Hooper, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> some of the more radically reformed churches on the continent, were at odds with English clergy who had accepted and never left the established church. John Henry Primus also notes that on 24 July 1550, the day after receiving instructions for Hooper's unique consecration, the church of the Austin Friars in London had been granted to Jan Laski for use as a Stranger church. This was to be a designated place of worship for Continental Protestant refugees, a church with forms and practices that had taken reforms much further than Ridley would have liked. This development—the use of a London church virtually outside Ridley's jurisdiction—was one that Hooper had had a hand in.|$|E

25|$|One {{study from}} 1996 {{documented}} the interviews {{of a sample}} of junior {{high school students in}} the United States. The girls were less likely to state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys and girls <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> sexual intercourse, the proportion of girls and boys who had recently had sex and were regularly sexually active was the same. Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they have ever had sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem than boys. Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they were more likely than boys to believe that {{they would be able to}} control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how being sexually active could affect their future goals. In general, girls said they felt less pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys reported feeling more pressure.|$|E
25|$|Einstein was {{a proponent}} of civil rights. When he arrived in America, he objected to the mistreatment of African Americans. Einstein, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> heavy anti-Semitic {{discrimination}} in pre-World War II Germany worked {{with a number of}} leading civil rights activists and civil rights organizations (such as the Princeton chapter of the NAACP) to demand equality and denounce racism and segregation. Wherever he saw injustice, Einstein spoke out. When African-American singer and civil rights supporter Marian Anderson was denied rooms at hotels and forbidden to eat at public restaurants, Einstein invited her to his home. After a bloody racial riot in 1946 in which 500 state troopers with submachine guns attacked and destroyed virtually every black-owned business in a four-square-block area in Tennessee and arrested 25 black men for attempted murder, Einstein joined Eleanor Roosevelt, Langston Hughes, and Thurgood Marshall to fight for justice for the men. Later, 24 of the 25 defendants were acquitted.|$|E
25|$|During the September {{congress}} of 1988, 90% of party delegates (968 out of 1080) {{voted for a}} multi-party system of government. The BSPP announced they would be organising an election, but the opposition parties called for their immediate resignation from government, allowing an interim government to organise elections. After the BSPP rejected both demands, protesters again {{took to the streets}} on 12 September 1988. Nu promised elections within a month, proclaiming a provisional government. Meanwhile, the police and army began fraternising with the protesters. The movement had reached an impasse relying on three hopes: daily demonstrations to force the regime to respond to their demands, encouraging soldiers to defect and appealing to an international audience in the hope that United Nations or United States troops would arrive. Some Tatmadaw did defect, but only in limited numbers, mostly from the Navy. Stephen Solarz <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> the recent democracy protests in the Philippines and South Korea arrived in Burma in September encouraging the regime to reform, which echoed the policy of the United States government towards Burma.|$|E
