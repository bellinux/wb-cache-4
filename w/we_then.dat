25|$|How Should <b>We</b> <b>Then</b> Live? The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture (1976). Frank Schaeffer {{produced}} {{his father}} Francis Schaeffer's film series, which was released {{with a book}} by the same title.|$|E
25|$|To {{find the}} amplitudes for {{reflection}} and transmission for incidence from the left, we {{set in the}} above equations A→ = 1 (incoming particle), A← = √R (reflection), B← = 0 (no incoming particle from the right) and B→ = √(T k1/k2) (transmission). <b>We</b> <b>then</b> solve for T and R.|$|E

5000|$|We created {{man from}} an extract of clay. <b>Then</b> <b>We</b> made {{him as a}} drop {{in a place of}} settlement; firmly fixed (Uterus of woman). <b>Then</b> <b>We</b> made the drop into an alaqah (leech-like {{suspended}} blood clot), <b>then</b> <b>We</b> made the alaqah into a mudghah (chewed substances,little lump of flesh), <b>then</b> <b>We</b> made out of that mudghah bones, <b>then</b> <b>We</b> clothed the bones with flesh, and <b>then</b> <b>We</b> brought it forth as another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators. - Quran, Surah Al Mu'minun-23:12 ...|$|R
25|$|A typical {{application}} of the extendability of a uniform continuous function is the proof of the inverse Fourier transformation formula. We first prove that the formula is true for test functions, there are densely many of them. <b>We</b> <b>then</b> extend the inverse map to the whole space using the fact that linear map is continuous; thus, uniformly continuous.|$|E
25|$|If P and Q are {{two points}} on the curve, then we can uniquely {{describe}} a third point, P + Q, in the following way. First, draw the line that intersects P and Q. This will generally intersect the cubic at a third point, R. <b>We</b> <b>then</b> take P + Q to be −R, the point opposite R.|$|E
25|$|For example, when we combine both concepts, we can intuit {{that the}} number three is prime {{and that it is}} greater than two. <b>We</b> <b>then</b> deduce from this {{knowledge}} that there is a prime number greater than two. Thus, {{it can be said that}} intuition and deduction combined to provide us with a priori knowledge – we gained this knowledge independently of sense experience.|$|E
30|$|In (3.1), we put F(x,y)= 0 for all x,y∈ C and r_n= 1 for all n∈ N. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> have u_n=P_Cx_n=x_n. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> {{obtain the}} {{following}} theorem.|$|R

25|$|Example: We want to {{estimate}} the total income of adults living in a given street. We visit each household in that street, identify all adults living there, and randomly select one adult from each household. (For example, we can allocate each person a random number, generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, and select {{the person with the}} highest number in each household). <b>We</b> <b>then</b> interview the selected person and find their income.|$|E

5000|$|Consequently, if we wish {{to paint}} {{literally}} what <b>we</b> see, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> must paint the sum of rays reflected from the object. But {{in order to receive}} the total sum of rays from the desired object, we must select them deliberately -- because together with the rays of the object being perceived, there also fall into our range of vision reflected reflex rays belonging to other nearby objects. Now, if {{we wish to}} depict an object exactly as <b>we</b> see it, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> must depict also these reflex rays belonging to other objects -- and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> will depict literally what we see ...|$|R
