5|$|On {{the right}} <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> party, some of Goldwater's {{political}} positions included anti-communism, {{an emphasis on}} total victory in war and opposition to high taxes and government spending. He often criticized the politics {{of some of his}} more moderate contemporaries, including President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He criticized some aspects of Eisenhower's economic policy, citing his failure to balance the federal budget. After being written off as too right-wing to successfully wage a presidential campaign, Goldwater actively supported Richard Nixon's campaign against John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{remained}} in the minority when the 43rd Congress convened in 1873. Randall continued his opposition to measures proposed by Republicans, especially those intended to increase {{the power of the}} federal government. That term saw the introduction of a new civil rights bill with farther-reaching ambitions than any before it. Previous acts had seen the use of federal courts and troops to guarantee that black men and women could not be deprived of their civil rights by any state. Now Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts proposed a new bill, aimed at requiring equal rights in all public accommodations. When Sumner died in 1874, his bill had not passed, but others from the radical <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, including Representative Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, continued to work for its enactment.|$|E
5|$|With Roosevelt's help, Taft {{had little}} {{opposition}} for the Republican nomination {{for president in}} 1908, and easily defeated William Jennings Bryan for the presidency that November. In the White House, he focused on East Asia more than European affairs, and repeatedly intervened to prop up or remove Latin American governments. Taft sought reductions to trade tariffs, then {{a major source of}} governmental income, but the resulting bill was heavily influenced by special interests. His administration was filled with conflict between the conservative <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, with which Taft often sympathized, and the progressive wing, toward which Roosevelt moved more and more. Controversies over conservation and over antitrust cases filed by the Taft administration served to further separate the two men. Roosevelt challenged Taft for renomination in 1912. Taft used his control of the party machinery to gain a bare majority of delegates, and Roosevelt bolted the party. The split left Taft with little chance of re-election; he took only Utah and Vermont in Wilson's victory.|$|E
5000|$|These {{elections}} were {{a victory for}} the Bloc des gauches alliance between Socialists, Radicals, and <b>the</b> left <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> over <b>the</b> anti-Dreyfusard right <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>the</b> progressistes. The Bloc des gauches had been brought together to support the [...] "Republican Defense Cabinet" [...] (gouvernement de défense républicaine) formed by Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau following the assault on the newly elected President, Émile Loubet, on the Longchamp Racecourse on 4 June 1899, during the Dreyfus affair.|$|R

Peñaranda's support came from the traditional parties, the Liberals, and <b>the</b> two <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> who had formed a concordancia to stem <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement toward further reforms.|$|R

25|$|Anton Caspar Hesing (1823-1895) was a German-American {{newspaper}} publisher and politician {{who became a}} prominent figure in Chicago, Illinois {{during the second half}} of the 19th Century. The long-time publisher of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung and political boss of the pro-liquor <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, Hesing is remembered as one of the most influential figures of the 1870s in the emerging metropolis of Chicago.|$|E
25|$|Ford sought {{another term}} in the 1976 presidential election, but was {{challenged}} by Ronald Reagan, {{a leader of the}} conservative <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party. After a contentious series of primaries, Ford won his party's nomination at the 1976 Republican National Convention. In the general election, Carter defeated Ford by a narrow margin in the popular and electoral vote. Ford was the only one among the five vice presidents who succeeded to the presidency intra-term during the 20th century not to subsequently win a full term of his own. In polls of historians and political scientists, Ford is generally ranked as a below-average president.|$|E
50|$|A lifelong {{bachelor}} and County Meath farmer, Magan {{sold his}} farm and devoted {{all his time}} and money to the IRA. He was appointed IRA chief <b>of</b> staff by <b>the</b> IRA Army Executive at its convention in September 1948. The IRA had almost been destroyed in the 1940s and Magan immediately set out to reorganise the political and military <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Movement, namely <b>the</b> IRA and Sinn Féin, along with Michael Traynor, Paddy McLogan, and Tomás Mac Curtain.|$|R
50|$|By 1910 {{the split}} between <b>the</b> two <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party was deep, and this, in turn, caused Roosevelt and Taft to turn against one another, despite their {{personal}} friendship. The 1910 Midterm elections proved to be rather rough for <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> which seemed to further cement the growing divide among the party. Taft's popularity among progressives collapsed when he supported the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act in 1909, abandoned Roosevelt's anti-trust policy and fired popular conservationist Gifford Pinchot as head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bureau <b>of</b> Forestry in 1910.|$|R

25|$|The 1912 Oregon ballot for United State Senate was cluttered. In {{addition}} to the Democrat Harry Lane and Bob Selling, candidate of the conservative <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, progressive Republicans had other electoral alternatives, including candidates of the Progressive Party and the Popular Government Party. Meanwhile, Floyd Ramp stood for the Socialists and yet another candidate was nominee of the Prohibition Party. Astoundingly, each of these six candidates took more than 5% of the vote — a fact which enabled the Democrat Lane to win election with a plurality {{of the vote in}} solidly Republican Oregon. Intent on proving himself a man of the people, Harry Lane set what might be a record for campaign frugality in his victorious effort, with his entire race run for the princely sum of $75 plus travel expenses.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s the IRA {{once more}} {{came under the}} {{influence}} of left-wing thinkers, especially those such as C. Desmond Greaves and Roy Johnston active in the Connolly Association. This move to a class-based political outlook and the consequent rejection of any stance that could be seen as sectarian—including the use of IRA arms to defend one side, that side being the beleaguered Catholic communities of Belfast in the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969—was {{to be one of the}} factors in the 1969 split that led to the Provisional IRA <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> movement, with the latter subscribing to a traditional Catholic/nationalist analysis of the situation while the Officials subscribed to the Marxist view that internal strife among the working classes served only the interest of capital. The Irish Department of Justice had noticed the tensions in March 1969 and advised the Dublin government to use them to fragment the IRA.|$|E

500|$|Cleveland was {{the leader}} of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs, Free Silver, inflation, imperialism, and {{subsidies}} to business, farmers, or veterans on libertarian philosophical grounds. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era. Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism. He fought political corruption, patronage, and bossism. As a reformer Cleveland had such prestige that the like-minded <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, called [...] "Mugwumps", largely bolted the GOP presidential ticket and swung to his support in the 1884 election.|$|E
500|$|During his eight-year {{career in}} the House, Mathias {{established}} himself {{as a member of the}} liberal <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, which was the most influential at the time. He was the author of the [...] "Mathias Amendment" [...] to the unsuccessful 1966 civil rights bill on open housing. Concerning environmental issues, Mathias sponsored legislation to make the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal a national park, and supported other conservation initiatives along the Potomac River. He also served on the Judiciary Committee and the Committee on the District of Columbia. As a member of the D.C. Committee, Mathias was a proponent of establishing home rule in the District of Columbia.|$|E
500|$|From the {{beginning}} of his campaign, Goldwater fought an uphill battle to unseat an incumbent president under favorable economic circumstances. Goldwater consistently refused to moderate his views, which alienated {{a significant portion of the}} more moderate <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> party from his campaign. With the assistance of the media, who in large part also had an unfavorable opinion of Goldwater, President Johnson used this fissure in the party to portray [...] him as an extremist. In the general election, Goldwater lost in a landslide to Lyndon Johnson, carrying only six states to Johnson's 44 and 38% of the popular vote to Johnson's 61%.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 {{campaign}} season, in {{an effort}} to offer an alternative to Democratic policies and to unite distant <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, Gingrich and several other Republicans came up with a Contract with America, which laid out ten policies that Republicans promised to bring to a vote on the House floor during the first hundred days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Congress, if they won the election. The contract was signed by Gingrich and other <b>Republican</b> candidates for <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Representatives. <b>The</b> contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, tougher crime laws, and a balanced budget law, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.|$|R

500|$|Barkun {{argues that}} this {{statement}} is partly facetious (the claim of [...] "conspiracy" [...] and [...] "treason") and partly serious—the desire to encourage trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Europe, and Japan, for example—an ideal {{that used to be}} a hallmark of the internationalist <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party (known as [...] "Rockefeller Republicans" [...] in honor of Nelson Rockefeller) when there was an internationalist wing. The statement, however, is taken at face value and widely cited by conspiracy theorists as proof that the Council on Foreign Relations uses its role as the brain trust of American presidents, senators and representatives to manipulate them into supporting a New World Order {{in the form of a}} one-world government.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} nomination, Garfield {{was ordered to}} report to War Secretary Edwin Stanton in Washington to discuss his {{military}} future. [...] There, Garfield met Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, who befriended him, seeing him as a younger version of himself. The two men agreed politically, and both {{were part of the}} Radical <b>wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party. Once he took his seat in December 1863, Garfield was frustrated that Lincoln seemed reluctant to press the South hard. Many radicals, led in the House by Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, wanted rebel-owned lands confiscated, but Lincoln threatened to veto any bill that would do that on a widespread basis. Garfield, in debate on the House floor, supported such legislation and, discussing England's Glorious Revolution, hinted that Lincoln might be thrown out of office for resisting the bills. Although Garfield had supported Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, the congressman marveled that it was a [...] "...strange phenomenon in the world's history, when a second-rate Illinois lawyer is the instrument to utter words which shall form an epoch memorable in all future ages." ...|$|E
500|$|The next month, Hunter {{participated in}} the third GOP debate, {{featured}} on CNN. During the forum, he discussed his experience {{as chairman of the}} Armed Services Committee and voiced his support for the War in Iraq and the training of Iraqi battalions for security there. Hunter speculated that Iran was helping to arm the insurgency in Iraq. When asked what he would do as president if he discovered Iran was developing a nuclear weapon, Hunter stated that he [...] "would authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons [...] if {{there was no other way}} to preempt..." [...] After discussing foreign policy, Hunter turned his attention to the issue of immigration. He again mentioned the importance of a border wall and evoked the audience's memory about the fence he helped build in his congressional district, joking [...] "if they (illegal immigrants) get across my fence , we sign them up for the Olympics immediately." [...] At the end of the debate, Hunter took the opportunity to criticize the three frontrunners: John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney. He complained that Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts exerted too much influence on the three men, describing them as the [...] "Kennedy <b>Wing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{trying to}} explain how a solid Republican could lose a {{traditionally}} Republican state by such a large margin, political commentators cited numerous key factors. Kaine's campaign had many political advantages, including his association with the state's popular Democratic Governor Mark Warner and defense of Warner's 2004 budget priorities, his [...] "response ads" [...] to Kilgore's death penalty advertisements, which featured him speaking to voters about his religious convictions, his relentless in-person campaigning across the state, and his opposition to tax increases. In contrast, Kilgore's campaign had many political disadvantages, including a backlash over the death penalty ads that Kilgore's campaign ran in the fall, the relatively low poll numbers of then-President George W. Bush {{at the time the}} election, and a bitter division between the moderate and conservative <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> party over tax and spending priorities.|$|R
5|$|In 2004, Specter faced a {{challenge}} in <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> primary election from conservative Congressman Pat Toomey, whose campaign theme was that Specter was not fiscally conservative enough. The match-up was closely watched nationally, being seen as a symbolic clash between the conservative and moderate <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party. However, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state and national <b>Republican</b> establishment, including <b>the</b> state's other senator at the time, Rick Santorum, closed ranks behind Specter. Specter was supported by President George W. Bush. Specter narrowly avoided a major upset with 51% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary vote. Once Specter defeated the challenge from the right, {{he was able to}} enjoy great support from independents and some Democrats in his race against Hoeffel. Hoeffel trailed Specter in name recognition, campaign funds and poll results. Although the two minor candidates were seen as more conservative than Specter, they were only able to take 4% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vote and Specter was easily reelected.|$|R
