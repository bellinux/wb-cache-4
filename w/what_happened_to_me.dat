500|$|A botched {{pit stop}} at the Singapore Grand Prix had demoted Massa from first {{position}} {{to the back of}} field. With three races remaining in the Championship and a seven-point deficit, Massa remained confident about his title chances: [...] "If you look at <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in Singapore where my gap went from one point to seven so suddenly, then you have to consider it could easily go the other way as well." [...] Hamilton emphasised the value that a conservative racing strategy could hold for his title chances: ...|$|E

I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to me yesterday? <b>What</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I wanted to talk about serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E

500|$|Author Patrick Croskery {{described}} Animals as {{a unique}} blend of the [...] "powerful sounds and suggestive themes" [...] of Dark Side with The Wall portrayal of artistic alienation. He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm. Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: [...] "If you didn't care <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> And I didn't care for you", then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each. The lyrics ultimately {{paint a picture of}} dystopia, the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines.|$|E
500|$|A {{pneumatic}} value {{failure in}} the preceding race, the United States Grand Prix, had forced Häkkinen to retire from the Grand Prix. With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team." [...] Ferrari team principal Jean Todt and former World Champion Jody Scheckter called for Barrichello and Coulthard to race fairly as both drivers were ordered by their teams to assist their teammates in the Championship battle.|$|E

2500|$|Chapman {{worked in}} the prison as a legal clerk and kitchen helper. He was barred from {{participating}} in the Cephas Attica workshops, a charitable organization that helps inmates to adjust to life outside prison. He was also prohibited from attending the prison's violence and anger management classes due to concern for his safety. Chapman reportedly likes {{to read and write}} short stories. At his parole board hearing in 2004, he described his plans; [...] "I would immediately try to find a job, and I really want to go from place to place, at least in the state, church to church, and tell people <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and point them the way to Christ."

[...] Goodwin had previously reached a [...] "private settlement" [...] with McTaggart over the issue. In an article she wrote for Time magazine, she said, [...] "Though my footnotes repeatedly cited Ms. McTaggart's work, I failed to provide quotation marks for phrases that I had taken verbatim... The larger question {{for those of us}} who write history is to understand how citation mistakes can happen." [...] In its analysis of the controversy, Slate criticized Goodwin for the aggrieved tone of her explanation, and suggested Goodwin's worst offense was allowing the plagiarism to remain in future editions of the book even after it was brought to her attention.|$|E
