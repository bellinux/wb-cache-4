5|$|The Titan Oceanus was sketched by Erik San Juan and was {{originally}} intended to appear in God of War II in a completely <b>watery</b> form with no feet. This concept, however, was cut during development. Oceanus appeared in God of War III, with a similar appearance to the other Titans and {{with an emphasis on}} lightning instead of the original <b>watery</b> design. Oceanus's original <b>watery</b> design was the basis of the design for Poseidon's avatar sea construct for God of War III.|$|E
5|$|Many escapees from captivity {{can also}} be found in similar <b>watery</b> {{habitats}} around the world. Sightings are fairly common in Florida, although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed. In 2011, one specimen was spotted in the Central Coast of California.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or <b>watery</b> planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or <b>watery</b> planet would be at least 1.25 times as strong as on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius rubidus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to L.rufulus, but it has <b>watery</b> to whey-like latex and develops a strong odor of maple syrup or butterscotch when dried. Another lookalike is Lactarius thiersii, {{but it has a}} smaller cap and stem and has mild-tasting flesh and latex. The flesh and latex of Lactarius rufus have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo. Additionally, L.rufus typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base, and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than L.rufulus. L.vinaceorufescens has a yellowing latex.|$|E
5|$|Other bite {{symptoms}} {{that may occur}} in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, <b>watery</b> blood oozing from the puncture wounds, nausea and vomiting, subcutaneous bruising, blood blisters that may form rapidly, and a painful swelling of the regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases after a few days, except for the area immediately around the bite site. Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness and periods of semi- or unconsciousness is also reported.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, <b>watery</b> diarrhoea and low-grade fever. Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Dehydration {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is {{the most common cause of}} death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E
5|$|A popular snack in Kalimpong is the momo, steamed dumplings {{made up of}} pork, beef or {{vegetable}} cooked in a wrapping of flour and served with <b>watery</b> soup. Wai-Wai is a packaged Nepalese snack made of noodles which are eaten either dry or in soup form. Churpee, a kind of hard cheese made from yak's or chauri's (a hybrid of yak and cattle) milk, is sometimes chewed. A form of noodle called Thukpa, served in soup form is popular in Kalimpong. There are {{a large number of}} restaurants which offer a wide variety of cuisines, ranging from Indian to continental, to cater to the tourists. Tea is the most popular beverage in Kalimpong, procured from the famed Darjeeling tea gardens. Kalimpong has a golf course besides Kalimpong Circuit House.|$|E
5|$|Misthallery is a <b>watery</b> town {{in which}} {{traveling}} via gondola {{to move about}} the town's canals is commonplace. By these canals, the town is divided into five distinct regions: the Crossroads, the Market, the East District, Ely Street, and Highyard Hill. The Crossroads contain the library {{as well as the}} home of the mayor, Clark Triton. The town market is a shady place controlled by a mysterious entity known as the Black Raven, the East District contains an abandoned warehouse, and Ely Street as well as Highyard Hill are primarily residential areas. On the outskirts of Highyard Hill lies the manor owned by the former mayor's children, who live away {{from the rest of the}} village. The townspeople believe that the manor is home to a witch. The town is also rumored to contain the Golden Garden, hidden ruins of an ancient city.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of poisoning by A. ocreata are initially gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with <b>watery</b> diarrhea and vomiting which may lead to dehydration and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid-base disturbances. The initial symptoms resolve {{two to three days}} after ingestion of the fungus. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. Renal failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic renal damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of poisoning are typically gastrointestinal and neurological. Symptoms occur within 6–12hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms are gastrointestinal, with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and <b>watery</b> diarrhea {{which may be}} bloodstained. Dehydration may develop if the vomiting or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, lethargy, vertigo, tremor, ataxia, nystagmus, and headaches develop soon after; fever often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, symptoms do not progress from these initial symptoms, and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.|$|E
5|$|A popular food in Gangtok is the momo, a steamed {{dumpling}} containing pork, {{beef and}} vegetables cooked in a doughy wrapping {{and served with}} <b>watery</b> soup. Wai-Wai is a packaged snack consisting of noodles which are eaten either dry or in soup form. A form of noodle called thukpa, served in soup form is also popular in Gangtok. Other noodle-based foods such as the chowmein, thenthuk, fakthu, gyathuk and wonton are available. Other traditional Sikkimese cuisine include shah-phaley (Sikkimese patties with spiced minced meat in a crisp samosa-like case) and Gack-ko soup. Restaurants offer {{a wide variety of}} traditional Indian, continental and Chinese cuisines to cater to the tourists. Churpee, a kind of hard cheese made from cow's or yak's milk is sometimes chewed. Chhang is a local frothy millet beer traditionally served in bamboo tankards and drunk through bamboo or cane straws. Alcohol is cheap due to low excise duty in Sikkim. Beer, whiskey, rum and brandy are frequently consumed by both locals and non-locals.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark <b>watery</b> background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
5|$|Death caps {{have been}} {{reported}} to taste pleasant. This, coupled with the delay in the appearance of symptoms—during which time internal organs are being severely, sometimes irreparably, damaged—makes it particularly dangerous. Initially, symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with <b>watery</b> diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which may lead to dehydration if left untreated, and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid–base disturbances. These first symptoms resolve two to three days after the ingestion. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substance in the blood. Kidney failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic kidney damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial bleeding, pancreatic inflammation, acute kidney failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The series {{moves to}} outer space for season three, when the animal {{characters}} {{return to their}} world. Early in the series she and Cream befriend a plant-like creature, Cosmo the Seedrian, and they are frequently together. Sonic is kidnapped by the Metarex, plant-based robots, and Amy destroys one to rescue Sonic from drowning again. She continues her adventures with the gang, looking for scattered Chaos Emeralds and defeating Metarex. In one episode Amy nearly wins Sonic's heart with an alien race's love magic, but Tails and Cosmo trigger the magic before Sonic arrives; while their existing affection for each other increases, Amy yells at them. During the show's climax, Amy jumps to save Sonic from the Metarex's <b>watery</b> planet. She is knocked unconscious by the impact, but Chris saves them both. Cosmo fuses with the planet, forcing Tails to destroy her to save the galaxy, and Amy, Cream and Tails sob in despair as the other characters solemnly watch. Amy and Cream later bring Tails some snacks to cheer him up.|$|E
5|$|When the Kindred escort {{the agents}} {{out of the}} village, Mulder {{comments}} {{on the lack of}} children in the community and states that he recognizes some of the faces from photographs taken in the 1930s. Curious, he returns to the village that night, and hears chanting as a procession of the Kindred moves to a barn. Scully is led off by Brother Andrew, who claims {{to be able to give}} her information about the murderer, whom he calls Brother Martin. Downstairs in the barn, the group can be seen bathing Brother Aaron's body in <b>watery</b> clay. Mulder hides in a crevice, where he discovers that the sick man has been buried alive and has begun to take on feminine features. Meanwhile, Brother Andrew uses his power to seduce Scully. She is unable to resist, and is on the verge of succumbing before Mulder comes to her aid. The agents are again escorted out of the village.|$|E
5|$|The arid {{conditions}} of the spiny forest, which receives less than 600 millimeters of rainfall each year, largely shape Mikea economic activities. Nearly everything they consume is scavenged from the forest, and the average Mikea needs two hours or less to collect adequate food for the day. Their main source of food is tubers, particularly {{during the dry season}} when few other foods may be reliably available. Adults and children of both genders work to dig up using a metal-tipped digging stick (antsoro) and a digging bowl (kipao). The starchy ovy tuber is roasted or boiled before eating, while the Mikea eat the <b>watery</b> babo (or baboho) raw for hydration or use its water for boiling other foods; the tavolo tuber is dried and ground to make a flour that is sold at village markets. They also gather forest fruits, melons and honey, with the latter a particularly important source of income for the Mikea during the rainy season. To obtain water during the rainy season the Mikea capture rain run-off from the rooftops of their houses using hollowed-out logs or transport water on foot or zebu-drawn wagon from the villages, while during the cool dry season the Mikea consume their store of water-engorged babo tubers and drink water from natural or man-made wells when possible.|$|E
25|$|Based on Moerdijk's {{reference}} to the <b>watery</b> floor of the Hall of Heroes, {{as well as his}} statements about ancient Egypt, the floor opening may be identified with the <b>watery</b> , as in the creation theology of ancient African civilization. Rising out of this <b>watery</b> abyss, was the primeval mound, the Benben stone, to symbolize a new creation.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{distillation}} {{of various}} aromatic herbs and flowers {{can result in}} two products; an essential oil {{as well as a}} <b>watery</b> herbal distillate.
