5|$|Where {{pelicans}} {{interact with}} fishers, through either {{sharing the same}} waters or scavenging for fishing refuse, they are especially vulnerable to being hooked and entangled in both active and discarded fishing lines. Fish hooks are swallowed or catch in {{the skin of the}} pouch or webbed feet, and strong monofilament fishing line can become <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> bill, wings or legs, resulting in crippling, starvation, and often death. Local rescue organisations have been established in North America and Australia by volunteers to treat and rehabilitate injured pelicans and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E
25|$|Snakes {{have also}} been widely revered, such as in ancient Greece, where the serpent {{was seen as a}} healer. Asclepius carried a serpent <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> his wand, a symbol seen today on many ambulances.|$|E

50|$|On 7 January 2016, ISIL {{carried out}} a truck bomb attack against a police {{training}} center in Zliten, killing at least 60 and <b>wounded</b> <b>around</b> 200.|$|R
50|$|The attack {{reportedly}} <b>wounded</b> <b>around</b> 100 people. Five {{were seriously}} wounded while {{an elderly man}} originally from Morek, his daughter, and a little girl died from the attack.|$|R
25|$|Roller Reefing Sails, {{invented in}} 1789 by Stephen Hooper, use a canvas strip <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> a roller {{in the place}} of shutters. The mill {{does not have to be}} stopped in order to adjust the sails.|$|E
25|$|Two insects, the {{silkworm}} and {{the western}} honey bee, have been domesticated for over 5,000 years, often for commercial use. The silkworm is raised for the silk threads <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> its pupal cocoon; the western honey bee, for honey, and, lately, for pollination of crops.|$|E
25|$|More specifically, {{when the}} orbifold group G is a {{discrete}} subgroup of spacetime isometries, then {{if it has}} no fixed point, the result is usually a compact smooth space; the twisted sector consists of closed strings <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> the compact dimension, which are called winding states.|$|E
5000|$|Saro (Nepali:सरो) It is a long, solid, {{cylindrical}} structure {{made up of}} Falat' (Nepali:फलाँट) or Katus (Nepali:कटुस) wood. It {{is connected}} to 'Pora' {{at the end and}} is where 'Neti' is <b>wounded</b> <b>around.</b>|$|R
50|$|Turkish losses: 400 {{killed or}} <b>wounded.</b> <b>Around</b> 300 joined the French army, {{most of the}} rest moved to Baghdad, however around 40 settled in Great Britain with the help of British {{military}} commanders sympathetic to their cause.|$|R
25|$|Author Peter Williams records Australian {{casualties}} in the Buna area as including six ANGAU members killed. He records no Japanese ground forces killed until 25 July, when two were killed and six were <b>wounded</b> <b>around</b> Gorari.

25|$|With {{regard to}} dress, a sari (a long piece of fabric <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> the body) and salwar kameez are worn by women all over India. A bindi {{is part of}} a woman's make-up. Despite common belief, the bindi on the {{forehead}} does not signify marital status; however, the Sindoor does.|$|E
25|$|Tefillin (Hebrew: תְפִלִּין), {{known in}} English as phylacteries (from the Greek word φυλακτήριον, meaning {{safeguard}} or amulet), are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses, {{attached to the}} forehead and <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> the left arm by leather straps. They are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish women.|$|E
25|$|The delay, itself, {{comes from}} a special cable {{with a pair of}} {{conductors}} <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> a flexible, magnetically soft core. The coiling provides distributed inductance, while a conductive layer close to the wires provides distributed capacitance. The combination is a wideband transmission line with considerable delay per unit length. Both ends of the delay cable require matched impedances to avoid reflections.|$|E
50|$|Victims {{included}} 16-year old Luis Manuel “Boyet” Mijares (tortured brutally, with burn marks, all {{his nails}} pulled and removed, 33 ice pick <b>wounds</b> <b>around</b> his body, skull bashed in, eyeballs gouged out, genitals mutilated, then {{dropped from a}} helicopter),Archimedes Trajano and Juan Escandor.|$|R
40|$|Postoperative salivary {{contamination}} of surgical <b>wounds</b> <b>around</b> the mandible {{was found in}} several types of osteotomy and bone grafting procedure.

25|$|Electric {{machines}} come in {{two basic}} magnet field pole configurations: salient-pole machine and nonsalient-pole machine. In the salient-pole machine the pole's magnetic field is produced by a winding <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> the pole below the pole face. In the nonsalient-pole, or distributed field, or round-rotor, machine, the winding is distributed in pole face slots. A shaded-pole motor has a winding around part of the pole that delays the phase of the magnetic field for that pole.|$|E
25|$|Three {{miles of}} track <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> the site, with a spur running to a {{maintenance}} depot {{at the northern}} end of the zoo. Most of the track was laid at ground level, although there were elevated portions above terrain features. In spite of operating on four wheels similar to a bus, the system was often referred to as a monorail. Twenty-four vehicles were purchased for the system, sometimes operating in four-car trains during periods of increased demand.|$|E
25|$|Ancient rubber {{was made}} from latex of the rubber tree (Castilla elastica), which is {{indigenous}} to the tropical areas of southern Mexico and Central America. The latex was made into rubber by mixing it with the juice of what was likely Ipomoea alba (a species of morning glory), a process which preceded Goodyear's vulcanization by several millennia. The resultant rubber would then be formed into rubber strips, which would be <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> a solid rubber core to build the ball.|$|E
50|$|While {{prepping}} Cottrell's body, {{the doctor}} in charge, Katie Arlen, finds shrapnel <b>wounds</b> <b>around</b> his nether regions. While she is absent-mindedly examining these, another doctor rushes into the room to inform them that Howard is still alive. Katie looks down - to find herself holding Howard's erect penis.|$|R
50|$|Major Islamic {{terrorist}} attacks in Western Europe prior to 2014 were the 2004 Madrid train bombings, in which ten bombings against four commuter trains killed 191 people and <b>wounded</b> <b>around</b> 2,000, and the 7 July 2005 London bombings, in which four bombings against public transportation killed 52 people and wounded 784.|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} current probes, with cores that {{surround}} the conductor carrying current to be examined. One type has a hole for the conductor, and requires that the wire be passed through the hole; they are for semi-permanent or permanent mounting. However, other types, for testing, have a two-part core that permit them to be placed around a wire. Inside the probe, a coil <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> the core provides a current into an appropriate load, and the voltage across that load is proportional to current. However, this type of probe can sense AC, only.|$|E
25|$|On horse-drawn and mule-drawn canals, {{snubbing}} posts {{were used}} to slow or stop a boat in the lock. A 200-ton boat moving at a few miles an hour could destroy the lock gate. To prevent this, a rope was <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> the snubbing post as the boat entered the lock. Pulling on the rope slowed the boat, due to the friction of the rope against the post. A rope 2½ inches (6.3cm) in diameter and about 60 feet (18 meters) long was typically used on the Erie Canal to snub a boat in a lock.|$|E
25|$|Light {{troops were}} {{provided}} {{by a number of}} subject and allied peoples. Various Balkan peoples, such as Agrianes, Paeonians and Thracians, provided either light infantry or cavalry or indeed both. Typical light infantry peltasts would be armed with a number of javelins. The individual javelin would have a throwing thong attached to the shaft at or near its point of balance. The thong was <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> the shaft and hooked over one or two fingers. The thong made the javelin spin in flight, which improved accuracy, and the extra leverage increased the range achievable.|$|E
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 30 April 1999, the Admiral Duncan {{was the scene of}} a nail bomb {{explosion}} which killed three people and <b>wounded</b> <b>around</b> 70. The bomb was the third to be planted in a one-man campaign by a Neo-Nazi, David Copeland, who was attempting to stir up ethnic and homophobic tensions.|$|R
50|$|January 5: A {{suicide bomber}} in Kerbala detonated an {{explosive}} belt laced with ballbearings and a grenade, killing 51 and wounding 138. A suicide bomber in Ramadi blew himself up near {{a group of}} police and Army recruits, killed more than 60 and <b>wounded</b> <b>around</b> 70. Two other suicide car bombs explode in Baghdad.|$|R
50|$|Kitchener's force wheeled left in echelon {{to advance}} up Surgham ridge and then southwards. To protect the rear, a brigade of 3,000 mainly Sudanese, {{commanded}} by Hector MacDonald, was reinforced with Maxims and artillery {{and followed the}} main force at around 1350 m. Curiously, the supplies and <b>wounded</b> <b>around</b> Egeiga were left almost unprotected.|$|R
25|$|Distinctive {{representatives of}} {{craftsmanship}} {{on the island}} are Tenerife Lace (calado canario), which is drawn work embroidery, and the intricate doilies known as rosetas, or rosette embroidery, particularly from Vilaflor. The lace, often made for table linen, is produced by the intricate and slow embroidering of a stretched piece of cloth, which is rigidly attached to a wooden frame and is finished with illustrations or patterns using threads that are crossed over and <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> the fijadores, or pins stuck in a small support made of cloth. These decorated, small pieces are afterwards joined, to produce distinct designs and pieces of cloth.|$|E
25|$|Lipomas {{occur in}} many animals, but are {{most common in}} older dogs, {{particularly}} older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers and Miniature Schnauzers. Overweight female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors and most older or overweight dogs {{have at least one}} lipoma. In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs. Lipomas are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, and rarely in cats and pigs. However, a pedunculated lipoma can cause entrapment and torsion of the intestine in horses, causing necrosis, colic, and possibly death. The intestine becomes <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> the stalk of the lipoma and loses blood supply.|$|E
25|$|Passing is {{the most}} basic and common thread used in goldwork; it {{consists}} of a thin strip of metal <b>wound</b> <b>around</b> a core of cotton or silk. For gold thread this is typically yellow, or in older examples orange; for silver, white or gray. This is always attached by couching, either one or two threads at a time, and pulled through to the back to secure it. When multiple threads must be laid next to each other, a technique called bricking is used: {{the position of the}} couching stitches is offset between rows, producing an appearance similar to a brick wall. This same type of thread is used in making cloth of gold.|$|E
5000|$|After December 1985 Rome and Vienna airport attacks, {{which killed}} 19 and <b>wounded</b> <b>around</b> 140, Gaddafi {{indicated}} that {{he would continue to}} support the Red Army Faction, the Red Brigades, and the Irish Republican Army as long as European countries support anti-Gaddafi Libyans.The Foreign Minister of Libya also called the massacres [...] "heroic acts".|$|R
5000|$|There were seventy four {{air raids}} on Munich, with 6,632 people killed and 15,800 <b>wounded.</b> <b>Around</b> 90% of the Altstadt was {{severely}} damaged {{due to the}} policy of carpet bombing (flächenbombardement). At {{the start of the}} Großdeutsches Reich in 1939, Munich had a population of around 830,000, and was the fourth-largest city in Germany.|$|R
25|$|In 2001, Pierluigi Baima Bollone, a {{professor}} of forensic medicine in Turin, stated that the forensic examination of the wounds and bloodstains on the Shroud indicate that the image {{was that of the}} dead body {{of a man who was}} whipped, <b>wounded</b> <b>around</b> the head by a pointed instrument and nailed at the extremities before dying.|$|R
