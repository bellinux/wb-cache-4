[...] According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. [...] "He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But then he heard his voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar thou form: 'Tell me, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>saying</b> in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'"

The river had widened again, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> passing a little island set like a dark wedge {{in the middle of the}} stream. Two great white birds with red lights on them stood there on stilt-like legs, and the beach of the island was unmarked, save by the skeleton print of birds' feet. The branches of the trees on the bank looked more twisted and angular than ever, and the green of the leaves was lurid and splashed with gold. Then Hirst began to talk, leaning over the bow.|$|R

40|$|Buddhism is {{considered}} by many today as the non-violent religion par excellence. The concept of ahimsa (non-violence) coupled with the notion of pratityasamutpada (i. e. that everything is casually interconnected, with the implication that pain inflicted upon others is therefore really done to oneself and thus to be avoided) seems {{to be one of the}} main arguments for promoting Buddhism as an excellent method for promoting world peace. However this non-violent, serene picture of Buddhism is not the only picture. Buddhists on occasion speak of a need to use violence, and employ it. Buddhists kill. Sometimes they also kill each other. The history as well as the present of Buddhist Asia is bloodstained. How do Buddhists justify approving of and using violence? How do they legitimise their pro-violent utterances and actions when such actions ought to result in excommunication? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>saying?</b> There are several answers to this, some of which are presented in this article, with the primary focus on Buddhist Tibet...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} a method whereby a governmental policy maker can discover citizens ’ reaction to news stories. This is particularly relevant {{in the political}} world, where governments ’ policy statements are reported by the news media and discussed by citizens. The work here addresses two main questions: whereabouts are citizens discussing a news story, and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>saying?</b> Our strategy to answer {{the first question is}} to find news articles pertaining to the policy statements, and then perform internet searches for references to the news articles ’ headlines and URLs. We have created a software tool that schedules repeating Google searches for the news articles and collects the results in a database, enabling the user to aggregate and analyse them to produce ranked tables of sites that reference the news articles. Using data mining techniques we can analyse data so that resultant ranking reflects an overall aggregate score, taking into account multiple datasets, and this shows the most relevant places on the internet where the story is discussed. To answer the second question, we introduce the WeGov toolbox as a tool for analysing citizens ’ comments and behaviour pertaining to new...|$|E
