60|$|As to me, I {{was always}} {{steadily}} of opinion that this disorder {{was not in}} its nature intermittent. I conceived that the contest, once begun, could not be laid down again, to <b>be</b> resumed <b>at</b> our discretion, but that our first struggle with this evil would also be our last. I never thought we could make peace with the system; {{because it was not}} for the sake of an object we pursued in rivalry with each other, but with the system itself that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war.</b> As I understood the matter, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war,</b> not with its conduct, but with its existence,--convinced that its existence and its hostility were the same.|$|R
60|$|FRANKLYN. No: the {{soldiers}} and sailors won it, and left you to finish it. And you were so utterly incompetent that the multitudes of children slain by hunger {{in the first years}} of peace made us all wish <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> again.|$|R
2500|$|During the 1999 NATO {{bombing of}} Yugoslavia, Friedman wrote the {{following}} in The New York Times on April 23, 1999: [...] "Like it or not, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with the Serbian nation (the Serbs certainly think so), and the stakes {{have to be}} very clear: Every week you ravage Kosovo is another decade we will set your country back by pulverizing you. You want 1950? We can do 1950. You want 1389? We can do 1389 too." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{published a}} report outlining its National Security Strategy. [...] The document dropped the Bush era phrase [...] "global war on terror" [...] and reference to [...] "Islamic extremism," [...] and stated, [...] "This {{is not a}} global war against a tactic [...] — [...] terrorism, or a religion [...] — [...] Islam. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with a specific network, al-Qaeda, and its terrorist affiliates who support efforts to attack the United States, our allies, and partners." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 1991, Graham said in {{reference}} to the Persian Gulf War, [...] "As ... President Bush has said, it is not the people of Iraq <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with.

[...] He went on to say that out of the war in the Gulf may [...] "come a new peace and, as suggested by the President, a new world order." ...|$|E
60|$|There were {{loads of}} shiny reasons, which {{reminded}} me that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> and cleared for action, and that the interlude had been merely play. A companion rose alongside {{and wanted to know}} whether we had seen anything of her dummy.|$|R
5000|$|Justice William Paterson deemphasized {{the nature}} of the war, perfect versus imperfect, noting only that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> [...] "so far as we may proceed in hostile operations."

6000|$|BURGE. Why? Because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war.</b> That <b>is</b> {{what you}} fellows never would realize. The Hun <b>was</b> <b>at</b> the gate.

2500|$|The term [...] "English Socialism" [...] has {{precedents}} in his wartime writings; in {{the essay}} [...] "" [...] (1941), he said that [...] "the war and the revolution are inseparable...the fact that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> has turned Socialism from a textbook word into a realisable policy"– because Britain's superannuated social class system hindered the war effort and only a socialist economy would defeat Adolf Hitler. Given the middle class's grasping this, they too would abide socialist revolution and that only reactionary Britons would oppose it, thus limiting the force revolutionaries would need to take power. An English Socialism would come about which [...] "will never lose touch with the tradition of compromise and the belief in a law that is above the State. It will shoot traitors, but it will give them a solemn trial beforehand and occasionally it will acquit them. It will crush any open revolt promptly and cruelly, but it will interfere very little with the spoken and written word." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2013, {{two years}} after the {{assassination}} of Osama bin Laden, Barack Obama delivered a speech that employed the term global war on terror put in quotation marks (as officially transcribed by the White House): ″Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists. <...> But {{we have to recognize that}} the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. <...> From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation [...] — [...] and world [...] — [...] that we leave to our children. [...] So America is at a crossroads. [...] We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us. [...] We have to be mindful of James Madison’s warning that “No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.” [...] <...> In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that country’s security. <...> [...] Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless “global war on terror,” but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. [...] In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.″ Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that Congress had authorised the use of force, he went on to say, ″Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces. [...] <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first. [...] So this is a just war [...] — [...] a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense.″ ...|$|E

No, I don't seem to see it --Fritz," [...] he called to the aide-de-camp who had {{announced}} him, [...] "telegraph at once to the Topographical Staff at Berlin and find out if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with Canada. If we are"--he pointed at me--"throw her into the Bosphorus. If we are not, treat her with every consideration, with every distinguished consideration. But see that she doesn't get away. Keep her tight, till <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with Canada, as no doubt we shall be, wherever it is, and then throw her into the Bosphorus." ...|$|E

60|$|I felt that, {{even though}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with Russia, <b>we,</b> as a discovery-ship, {{had no right}} {{whatever}} to interfere in the capacity of a war-ship, and I was about to remonstrate with the captain at all hazards, when my thoughts were suddenly changed by the order being given to fire a shot across the stranger's bows. The gun <b>at</b> which I <b>was</b> stationed was run out.|$|R
60|$|We made no {{stay at the}} Cape {{longer than}} was needful to take in fresh water, but made {{the best of our}} way for the coast of Coromandel; <b>we</b> <b>were</b> indeed {{informed}} that a French man of war of fifty guns and two large merchant-ships were gone for the Indies; and as I knew <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with France, I had some apprehensions of them; but they went their own way, and we heard no more of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, sir," [...] replied Williamson with an {{offended}} look; [...] "I {{only thought}} that as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with France just now, {{it was my}} duty to report what I had seen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Under other circumstances," [...] he said, [...] "it {{might be}} {{my duty to}} inquire a little {{particularly}} as to the nationality of your vessel, Se¤or, for <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with the Mexicans, as you doubtless know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{other side}} of the mountain. There's a fence between the Hopper Country and the Horner Country, and a gate in the fence; but you can't pass through just now, because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with the Horners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] Weiss said, [...] "what about that paper we signed?

5000|$|According to the Anti-Defamation League, the Simon Wiesenthal Center {{called for}} Abbas to clarify his {{position}} on the Holocaust in 1995, but he did not do so at that time. Abbas' reported defence when asked about the book was telling: [...] "When I wrote The Other Side… <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with Israel. Today I would not have made such remarks… Today there is peace and what I write from now on must help advance the peace process." ...|$|R
60|$|During {{the long}} period of our stay in the refuge, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> kept closely in touch with what was {{happening}} in the world without, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> learning thoroughly the strength of the Oligarchy with which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war.</b> Out of the flux of transition the new institutions were forming more definitely and taking on the appearance and attributes of permanence. The oligarchs had succeeded in devising a governmental machine, as intricate as it was vast, that worked--and this despite all our efforts to clog and hamper.|$|R
6000|$|... {{could never}} mean to our brown companions {{what they meant}} to us; but they put on a polite air of being {{interested}} in the Graeco-Roman ruin, and were so gentle and friendly that one could almost feel they were fellow-men. Very likely they were; at any rate, until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with them I shall believe so.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Duke of Cumberland {{has appealed}} to our loyalty. Though <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with England we bear no animus toward her reigning house, {{and have no}} wish to see King George's crown {{snatched}} from him by that beardless young adventurer, who has no more right to the throne of England than you, milor, to that of France." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] he went on, [...] "was the {{individual}} {{act of a}} brave and faithful patriot. The {{time has come for}} us, too, to remember that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war.</b> I have striven for you with the weapons of diplomacy and I have failed. I ask you now to face the situation with me--to make use of the only means left to us." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tom Fowler, later vice {{president}} for radio with South Carolina Educational Television, made his debut on WMYB {{the night of the}} fire that killed three Apollo 1 astronauts. In 2002 he said, [...] "The Teletypes went nuts. I thought <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war.</b> That <b>was</b> the real start of an adventure." [...] WMYB's format was adult contemporary during most of its later years, when it used the call letters WQOK and WCSE. The format was oldies in 1985. The letters WKEL were approved but never used, since the station signed off in the late 1980s.|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly all Normans will be {{reckoned}} churls," [...] {{one of the}} gentlemen exclaimed indignantly. [...] "The fame of Harold's bravery, wisdom, and courtesy to all men is known in every court in Europe, and that the duke's vassal should have dared to imprison and chain him will excite universal indignation. Why, the rudest of our own Norse ancestors would not have so foully treated one so noble whom fate had cast into his hands. Had <b>we</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with England it would be shameful, but being <b>at</b> peace there <b>are</b> no words that can fitly describe the outrage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} {{returned}} from Germany after twelve months' stay there," [...] the young soldier replied. [...] "I went with an open mind. I have come back convinced that <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with Germany {{within a couple of}} years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{not a bad}} plan," [...] Malcolm said. [...] "They are not so {{likely to}} send orders there as to the {{northern}} ports. But {{it will not be}} easy to get a vessel to cross, for you see, now that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with England, there is little communication. However, we shall no doubt be able to arrange with a smuggler to take us across." ...|$|E
6000|$|Geoffrey {{shook his}} head. [...] "As far as I am concerned," [...] he said, [...] "as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with Spain, {{it would be}} fair if I met a Spanish ship at sea to capture and plunder it, but I am afraid the laws of war do not justify private plunder. I should be {{perfectly}} ready to go out and take service in a vineyard, or to earn my living in any way if it could be managed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, in {{the first}} place, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with them, and would prevent them gaining any advantage. In the second place, because Egypt is a step {{on the way to}} India. There we are {{fighting}} with one of the great native princes, who has, they say, been promised help by the French, who are most jealous of us, since we have destroyed their influence there, and deprived them of their chance of becoming masters of {{a large portion of the}} country." ...|$|E
50|$|Robert also devoted {{himself to}} a number of other enterprises. He made annual {{charitable}} donations of £500, chiefly to Roman Catholic priests and religious orders both in England and on the Continent. He was the first Chairman of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation, which was responsible for building the canal connecting Chelmsford to the sea near Maldon. He was a loyal and patriotic man, for {{at the end of the}} century, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with France, he raised a company of volunteers from the districts of Ingatestone, Brentwood, and Billericay; the banners of these volunteers were still hanging in Ingatestone Church in 1848.|$|R
5000|$|When Abbas was {{appointed}} the Palestinian {{prime minister in}} 2003, he wrote that the [...] "Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, {{a crime against humanity}} that cannot be accepted by humankind" [...] and that he does not deny it, and said that [...] "When I wrote The Other Side … <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with Israel. Today I would not have made such remarks". More recently, in 2013 he reasserted that part of his thesis that [...] "the Zionist movement had ties with the Nazis". In 2014, he stated the Holocaust was the “most heinous crime in the modern era”.|$|R
60|$|There {{was another}} thing. Oro had {{declared}} that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>war</b> with Germany. If this were so, {{how could he}} know it? Such knowledge would presume powers of telepathy or vision beyond those given to man. I {{could not believe that}} he possessed these; as Bickley said, it would be past experience. Yet it was most strange that he who was uninformed as to our national history and dangers, should have hit upon a country with which we might well have been plunged into sudden struggle. Here again I was bewildered and overcome. My brain rocked. I would seek sleep, and in it escape, or at any rate rest from all these mysteries.|$|R
