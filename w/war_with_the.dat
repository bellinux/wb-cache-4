5|$|In {{the context}} of the Austrian Empire's <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire, and similar Russian Empire's war, Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski, {{attempted}} to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans as an opportunity to strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This line of reasoning gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski.|$|E

5|$|After Dumouriez's {{victory at}} Jemappes in November 1792, the French armies rapidly overran {{most of the}} Austrian Netherlands. Rather than driving the Austrians {{to the west bank}} of the Rhine River, Dumouriez and the French {{government}} became preoccupied with a <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Republic. During the breathing space offered by her enemy, Austria assembled an army under the Prince of Coburg and struck back. After a French covering force was routed by Coburg at Aldenhoven, Dumouriez began gathering his army for a counterstroke.|$|E

5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E

Savimbi developed close relations with influential American conservatives, who saw Savimbi as a key ally in the U.S. effort to oppose and rollback Soviet-backed, undemocratic governments around the world. The conflict quickly escalated, with both Washington and Moscow seeing it as a critical strategic conflict in the Cold War.|$|E

The Austrian reestablishment was short-lived, however, and the territory was soon overrun by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars.|$|E
