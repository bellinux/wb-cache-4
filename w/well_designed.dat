5|$|Smaller squares do exist, {{including}} Dortmund Square, St Peters Square, Queen Square, Woodhouse Square and Hanover Square. While {{the rest}} of Leeds has large open parks, this is something the city centre lacks and most free recreational space is contained within these squares. Since 2000, both City Square and Millennium Square have been redeveloped with hard landscaping. In an interview with Martin Wainwright, the northern editor of The Guardian, architect Irena Bauman, praised City Square for being a <b>well</b> <b>designed</b> and well used public space, however she criticised The Plaza Tower development for its lack of public space, stating that the only space made available was for service vehicles.|$|E

40|$|In this Master Thesis <b>well</b> <b>design</b> for {{deepwater}} ERD wells {{have been}} reviewed. These wells present new {{challenges for the}} industry, which creates high demands for <b>well</b> <b>design</b> and materials. The constant push for &# 147;deeper&# 148; deepwater wells makes optimization critical. A literature study on deepwater completions has been done. Factors impacting the <b>well</b> <b>design</b> have been investigated through simulations in Landmark&# 146;s WellCat. The design {{has been based on}} Statoil design requirements and APIcalculation theory. A self-built model has been developed to simulate the well performance for a well located in the Gulf of Mexico. The chosen well has a water depth of 2, 300 m and a reservoir pressure above 1, 350 bar (20, 000 psi). It is thus classified as a High-Pressure High-Temperature well. The <b>well</b> is <b>designed</b> as an Extended Reach <b>Well.</b> <b>Well</b> <b>design</b> is dependent on several factors, such as: pressure and temperature, production plans (e. g. gas lift), water depth, present formations and their hydrocarbon content. Different requirements exist depending on where in the world the well is located, and for different expectancies for hydrocarbons in the different sections. These factors and requirements influence on <b>well</b> <b>design</b> have been studied. The study showed that the two requirement documents available were not modified for deepwater wells. Gaps in the present technology were identified and, where possible, suggestions for improved performance were made. A WellCat model was implemented to simulate the loads in the given well. A drillabilitystudy was done for the reservoir section. Some parameters were varied to investigate thechanges in the <b>well</b> <b>design.</b> Based on these results a final <b>well</b> <b>design</b> for the given well was found. Two new pipes would have to be made to handle the high pressures in thewell. </p...|$|R

5|$|The city of Valletta {{was founded}} on 28 March 1566 by Jean de Valette, the Grand Master of the Order of St. John. The city {{occupied}} about half the Sciberras Peninsula, a large promontory separating the Grand Harbour from Marsamxett Harbour, and was protected by tracce italiane fortifications, including a land front with four bastions, two cavaliers and a deep ditch. Although these fortifications were <b>well</b> <b>designed,</b> by the early 17th century they were {{not strong enough to}} resist a large attack due to new technological developments which increased the range of artillery.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of new technologies, by the 17th century it was realised that while Valletta's fortifications were <b>well</b> <b>designed,</b> they were not strong enough to withstand a heavy attack. Because of this, the Floriana Lines, encircling Valletta's original land front, were built from 1635 to the 1640s. In the 18th century, a suburb developed between the Floriana Lines and Valletta's land front, and it became known as Floriana, today a town in its own right.|$|E

40|$|Aquifer {{thermal energy}} storage (ATES) is a {{technology}} to sustainably provide space heating and cooling. Particularly in The Netherlands the number of ATES systems has grown rapidly in the past decade, often with the (re) development of urban areas. To meet objectives for greenhouse gas emission reduction the number of ATES systems is expected and required to further rise in future both in The Netherlands and elsewhere. To evaluate the lessons learned {{and the role of}} practical aspects in the Dutch development of ATES systems, in this study the geohydrological conditions and well characteristics for 331 (~ 15 % of total) Dutch ATES systems are evaluated with respect to optimal <b>well</b> <b>design</b> for maximal thermal energy recovery. The study shows that <b>well</b> <b>design</b> of most (70 %) ATES systems is suboptimal. The <b>well</b> <b>design</b> criteria that have been used thus far in practice, focus on allowing maximum flow/capacity, disregarding the effect of groundwater flow on efficiency and the effect of <b>well</b> <b>design</b> on subsurface space use. Instead, <b>well</b> <b>design</b> should be based on a more representative value for the storage volume that takes into account. Based on monitoring data and analysis of variations and uncertainties of the actual storage volume, a guideline is defined to reflect these in the storage volume used for design. Also a guideline for <b>well</b> <b>design</b> is introduced that accounts for both conduction and dispersion losses as well as advection losses in case of high ambient groundwater flow.

5|$|Sir Nigel Gresley's {{independent}} {{report on}} the Kand K1classes during the mainline stability trials stated that they were <b>well</b> <b>designed,</b> mechanically reliable and capable of hauling expresses at high speeds on well-maintained track, which meant {{that they could have}} been useful additions to the Southern Railway's suburban commuter fleet. However, they were undoubtedly prone to rough riding and instability, and not only on the poorest quality tracks. The restricted water capacity also limited their use outside the Southern Railway's Central section. The impending electrification of the Brighton Main Line, scheduled for 1932 also meant that fewer duties suitable for heavy passenger tank locomotives would be available in the 1930s. The lack of a suitable role for both classes was considered when {{the decision was made to}} rebuild them as U/U1 tender engines following the Sevenoaks disaster. In rebuilt form they continued to operate until the 1960s, and were capable of attaining speeds in excess of 70mph (110km/h) with a greater degree of stability.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent than}} normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on carbon monoxide poisoning treatment concluded that the role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, <b>well</b> <b>designed,</b> externally audited, multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a full <b>well</b> <b>design</b> and {{detailed}} tubing design {{has been developed}} for the HPHT well K- 14. Wellcat casing design software {{has been used for}} tubing string analysis. K- 14 has been designed using the same conditions as for wells in the Morvin HPHT field. The main issues related to this specific <b>well</b> <b>design</b> are the completion of the reservoir section, the tubing design with all relevant loads, and a HPHT <b>well</b> <b>design</b> with flexibility for intervention and stimulation by hydraulic fracturing. The reservoir drainage plan is based on wells with horizontal reservoir sections for optimal and cost effective recovery. The tubing has been designed and engineered for all the loads that the well may be exposed to during its lifetime. It is very important that all possible loads have been investigated, so the well complies with the HPHT requirements. The loads seen by the well can be divided in two groups: the loads induced by production and the loads during installation (qualification/pressure testing) and intervention. The focus of the <b>well</b> <b>design</b> has been to achieve optimal drainage with a simple and flexible solution to meet the requirements for intervention. Extreme loads may occur for wells in HPHT fields. There are additional aspects to consider when engineering these wells, such as steel and material degradation when exposed to high temperatures, and large temperature variations from production to bullheading with cold fluids. The effect of extreme temperature changes are seen by the liquids in the closed annuli, they will expand/contract resulting in an increase/decrease in pressure seen by the tubulars. The temperature variations will also affect sealing elastomers that are under high pressures, making them brittle and reduce/loose the sealing capacity.

40|$|Collector <b>well</b> <b>designs</b> are {{necessary}} to maximize groundwater uptake and riverbank filtration without negatively impacting an aquifer. Unfortunately, {{there is a lack}} of information and research regarding the implementation of collector <b>well</b> <b>design</b> parameters. In the past, collector well installation was too costly, but recent advances in well technology have made collector wells more cost effective. This research will contribute a set of guidelines to optimize riverbank filtration and groundwater remediation. This study models the hydrodynamics surrounding collector well configurations in riverbank filtration and groundwater remediation. Visual Modflow? was utilized to run a variety of numerical models to test four areas: flux along the laterals of a collector well, collector well interactions with a river, collector well yield, and collector well remediation capability. The two design parameters investigated were lateral length (25 m, 50 m, and 100 m) and number of laterals (3 and 4). The lateral flux tests confirm flux increases towards the terminal end of each lateral and pumping rate is the controlling factor in flux amount obtained along the laterals. The analysis of the flux-river interaction shows the main factor in determining flux amount is the initial river geometry, followed by the pumping rate, regional background flow, and collector <b>well</b> <b>design,</b> respectively. The models suggest that the 4 -lateral collector <b>well</b> <b>design</b> is more effective than the 3 -lateral design and in addition, 100 meter length laterals provide the highest amount of yield with the least amount of drawdown. The remediation tests investigate the application of vertical well equations to evaluate collector <b>well</b> <b>designs</b> in two areas: minimum pumping rate to capture line source of particles and first arrival time of particles. The remediation models show 100 meter length laterals provide both the lowest pumping rate and the highest residence time with the surrounding aquifer for maximum remediation. Ultimately, these models provide basic design guidelines and explain which designs are most effective, depending on the collector well purpose...|$|R
