Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer sent a telegram to Levinson encouraging him {{to remain in the}} city: [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that we are proud of having this exceptional series shot in your native state and stand ready to help toward a positive decision for additional production of the series."
