5|$|As a California Assemblyman, Ryan {{also served}} as the Chairman of {{legislative}} subcommittee hearings and presided over hearings involving his later successor as Congressman, Tom Lantos. Ryan pushed through important educational policies in California and authored <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{be known as the}} Ryan Act, which established an independent regulatory commission to monitor educational credentialing in the state.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{improvements}} Galileo Galilei made to the telescope, with a magnifying capability of 20×, {{he was able to}} see celestial bodies more distinctly than was ever possible before. This allowed Galilei to discover in either December 1609 or January 1610 <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be known as the Galilean moons.|$|E

5|$|Advances in {{microscopy}} {{also had}} a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838 and 1839, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be known as cell theory.|$|E
5|$|As vice president, Brundage {{served on}} a {{commission}} appointed at the IOC's London session in 1948 to recommend whether the 1906 Intercalated Games, held in Athens, {{should be considered a}} full Olympic Games. All three members of <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be known as the Brundage Commission were from the Western Hemisphere and met in New Orleans in January 1949. The commission found that {{there was nothing to be}} gained by recognizing the 1906 games as Olympic, and it might set an embarrassing precedent. The full IOC endorsed the report when it met later that year in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Country estates {{had been}} built in the area as early as the 1830s, and some of Louisville's great early mansions, {{predominantly}} in the Italianate style, were built along Broadway, very near Old Louisville, before the Civil War. Development from 1850 to 1870 occurred between Broadway and Kentucky Street, the northern extreme of <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be called Old Louisville. North-south city streets were extended throughout the area in the 1850s, and a mulecar line was extended down Fourth to Oak in 1865.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald had favoured {{the union}} {{coming into force}} on 15 July, fearing that the {{preparations}} would not be completed any earlier. The British favoured an earlier date and, on 22 May, {{it was announced that}} the Dominion of Canada would come into existence on 1 July. Lord Monck appointed Macdonald as the new nation's first prime minister. With the birth of the Dominion, Canada East and Canada West became separate provinces, known as Quebec and Ontario. Macdonald was knighted on that first observance of <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be known as Canada Day, 1 July 1867.|$|E
5|$|On {{that date}} 48 bombers, under secret {{orders from the}} president, crossed into Cambodian {{airspace}} and delivered their payloads in Operation Breakfast. During the next 14 months this operation was followed by Lunch, Snack, Dinner, Dessert, and Supper as American bombers flew 3,630 sorties and expended 100,000 tons of ordnance on the Base Areas in <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be called Operation Menu. During this time frame, the entire program was held as a closely guarded secret from Congress, the American people, and amazingly, from the Air Force itself.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be called the Great Migration.|$|E

5|$|Several {{periods of}} Protestant Christian revival nurtured a {{proliferation}} of new religious movements in the United States. In {{the latter half of}} the 19th century these included <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be known as the metaphysical family: groups such as Christian Science, Divine Science, the Unity School of Christianity and (later) the United Church of Religious Science. From the 1890s the liberal section of the movement became known as New Thought, in part to distinguish it from the more authoritarian Christian Science.|$|E
5|$|The United States Army Corps of Engineers assumed {{control of}} the nuclear weapons program in June 1942, and Compton's Metallurgical Laboratory became part of <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be called the Manhattan Project. Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. became {{director}} of the Manhattan Project on 23 September 1942. He visited the Metallurgical Laboratory {{for the first time}} on 5 October. Between 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under Herbert Anderson and Walter Zinn constructed 16 experimental piles under the Stagg Field stands.|$|E
5|$|The novelists of the {{dictator}} novel genre combined narrative strategies of both modern and postmodern writing. Postmodern techniques, constructed {{largely in the}} late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of causality. Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to {{the dictator}} novel genre pioneered <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be known as magical realism, although {{the use of this}} technique is not necessarily a prerequisite of the dictator novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism.|$|E

5|$|While {{waiting for}} the Convention to {{formally}} begin, James Madison sketched out his initial draft, which {{became known as the}} Virginia Plan and reflected his views as a strong nationalist. By the time the rest of the Virginia delegation arrived, most of the Pennsylvania delegation had arrived as well. They agreed on Madison's plan, and formed <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be the predominant coalition. By the time the Convention started, the only blueprints that had been assembled were Madison's Virginia Plan, and Charles Pinckney's plan. As Pinckney didn't have a coalition behind his plan, Madison's plan was the starting point for deliberations.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1876, several {{bills were}} {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives {{in an effort to}} resume the free coinage of silver. One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876. Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the Senate. The House bill allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck that provision. This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver certificates {{for the first time in}} United States history. The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The president's veto was overridden on February 28, 1878. <b>What</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be known as the Bland–Allison Act required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver per month, to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold/silver value ratio of 16:1, meaning that one ounce of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Rhodes, a {{sometime}} {{associate of}} McLaren {{and friend of}} the Sex Pistols, was similarly aiming to make stars of the band London SS. Early in 1976, London SS broke up before ever performing publicly, spinning off two new bands: the Damned and the Clash, which was joined by Joe Strummer, former lead singer of the 101'ers. On June 4, 1976, the Sex Pistols played Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be {{regarded as one of}} the most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig—they had formed Buzzcocks after seeing the Sex Pistols in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form Joy Division, the Fall, and—in the 1980s—the Smiths.|$|E

5|$|During the 1840s, Indiana {{completed}} {{the removal of}} the Native American tribes. The majority of the Potawatomi voluntarily relocated to Kansas in 1838. Those who did not leave were forced to travel to Kansas in <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> be called the Potawatomi Trail of Death, leaving only the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians in the Indiana area. The majority of the Miami tribe left in 1846, although many members of the tribe were permitted to remain in the state on lands they held privately {{under the terms of the}} 1818 Treaty of St. Mary's. The other tribes were also convinced to leave the state voluntarily through the payment of subsidies and land grants further west. The Shawnee migrated westward to settle in Missouri, and the Lenape migrated into Canada. The other minor tribes in the state, including the Wea, moved westward, mostly to Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{be known as the}} feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E
5|$|In 1714 Farrukhsiyar, the Mughal emperor, {{appointed}} Asif Jah I to be Viceroy of the Deccan, {{with the}} title Nizam-ul-Mulk (Administrator of the Realm). In 1724, Asif Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the Deccan Suba, named the region Hyderabad Deccan, and started <b>what</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{be known as the}} Asif Jahi dynasty. Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asif Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad. The death of Asif Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons, backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces, contended for the throne. The accession of Asif Jah II, who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768 he signed the treaty of Machilipatnam, surrendering the coastal region to the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent.|$|E
