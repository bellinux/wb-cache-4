5|$|Johnson and Larry Bird {{were first}} linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad {{defeated}} Bird's Indiana State {{team in the}} 1979 NCAA finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in {{three out of four}} NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily box score <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> he checked in the morning.|$|E

25|$|The title <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> {{that was}} written for the film. Antichrist was {{originally}} scheduled for production in 2005, but its executive producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen accidentally revealed the film's planned revelation: that earth was created by Satan and not by God. Trier was furious and decided to delay the shoot so he could rewrite the script.|$|E

25|$|Canine {{identification}} of a suspect can help police with their inquiries, and evidence of identification is accepted in some courts. The most approved method of identification is for the hound to jump up, and place its paws on the subject’s chest. In {{the case of a}} lost person or a known fugitive identification will not be significant, {{and in the case of}} a potentially violent, possibly armed, fugitive a bloodhound handler will not want his dog to approach the quarry for fear of injury to the bloodhound. Many bloodhounds reaching the end of a trail will show no interest in the person they have been trailing, and are difficult to train to identify. Leon Whitney recommended a method of initial training in which identification <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> learned, based on giving the young hound a scent-article from someone who walks a very short distance out of sight into a barn, where he stands with a piece of liver, while another person, also smelling of liver, stands nearby. The hound is led along the 'trail', and if it shows an inclination to go to the wrong person it is chastised, but gets the liver if it goes to the right one. When the hound goes to the right person almost infallibly, the number of people is increased, making the choice more difficult, and eventually the brief walks are extended into full trails.|$|E
500|$|When {{it opened}} on October 15, 1983, the Olympic Saddledome served {{to boost the}} morale of a city that was {{experiencing}} a significant downturn {{as a result of}} the international oil market collapse, high interest rates, and the federal government's National Energy Policy. [...] During the first event, an NHL game between the Flames and the Edmonton Oilers, the standard of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> booed by a population upset with the government's policies. The Oilers defeated the Flames 4–3 in front of a sold out crowd of nearly 17,000 fans.|$|E

Of course, if he's too friendly with me, then I think that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that was in his mind."

500|$|... "Radio Bart" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza, though series creator Matt Groening {{came up with the}} idea for it. The episode was based on the 1951 film Ace in the Hole, which sees the story of a down-and-out journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career. Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; [...] " [...] came in out of nowhere and just gave me, start to finish, the whole story." [...] Vitti said renting the film <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> he did after finishing the script. He remarked, [...] "It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so you think it would be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find." ...|$|E
500|$|Murray {{likens the}} song to [...] "the R {{equivalent}} of punk rock" [...] or superficially simple {{enough not to}} intimidate beginners. [...] It interested the eleven-year-old Bo Diddley: [...] "I think the first record I paid attention to was John Lee Hooker's 'Boogie Chillen,'... When I found John Lee Hooker on the radio, I said, 'If that guy can play, I know I can.' [...] I mean John Lee's got {{a hell of a}} style". [...] In an interview, Buddy Guy described learning to play [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] at age thirteen: [...] "that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I thought I learned how to play that I knew sounded right when someone would listen." [...] Guy later recorded a version with Junior Wells for their 1981 album Alone & Acoustic. [...] Albert Collins also recalled that it was the first song he learned to play.|$|E
25|$|And as I told you, these <b>are</b> <b>the</b> two {{secondary}} {{causes of}} the decline of art; <b>the</b> <b>first</b> being <b>the</b> loss of moral purpose. Pray note them clearly.

500|$|After Troutman's death, Ice Cube {{said that}} [...] "More Bounce To The Ounce" [...] {{introduced}} him to hip-hop. [...] "I was in the sixth grade, we'd stayed after school. We had this dude named Mr. Lock, {{and he used to}} bring in his radio with these pop-lockers. He used to teach [...] the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after-school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop-locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] yet. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down. I just think that was a rush of adrenaline for me, like a chemical reaction in my brain." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2012, Brian Tyler {{signed on}} to score the film. According to Tyler, he was {{approached}} more for his [...] "thematic" [...] scores such as The Greatest Game Ever Played, Annapolis and Partition rather than his [...] "modern" [...] action scores such as The Fast and Furious films, with Kevin Feige asking a theme that was recognizable and featured those dramatic tones. To employ the [...] "deeply thematic component with a strong melody," [...] the score employs mostly orchestra sounds. The main theme for Iron Man focuses on horns and trumpets, to be [...] "both a march and anthem." [...] Tyler mentioned that John Williams' work in Raiders of the Lost Ark <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> he thought as an influence, and the cue for the Well of Souls in Raiders influenced the Extremis motif, as Tyler felt it should enhance an spiritual side for having a [...] "technology so advanced that nears magic." [...] Echoing the Mandarin's amalgamated personality, his theme was religious music [...] "that borrows from many cultures," [...] from [...] "Monastic, Gothic, and Christian chants to music from the Middle-East." [...] The score was recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios. Tyler is the third primary composer to score an Iron Man film, following Ramin Djawadi of Iron Man and John Debney of Iron Man 2.|$|E
500|$|Choosing a {{name for}} the game <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> the team did before {{starting}} development. They decided on the name Sunset Overdrive because they felt it was unique, and captured the feeling of the [...] "grindhouse" [...] from the 1970s. The project was originally conceived as an open world survival game similar to DayZ. The initial version of the game did not feature the traversal system, nor the unusual weapons included in the final version, and was described as [...] "grounded" [...] by Murray. In this version, players were tasked with scavenging resources during daytime, and defending their base at night. This later evolved to become the game's cooperative multiplayer mode. It employed the animation model from Insomniac's previous game, Fuse. The direction of the game changed after the team watched a video based on Gorillaz, and Murray gave up the idea of a realistic survival game. He then asked the team to start prototyping ideas for a game that they thought would work. Some team members {{came up with the idea}} of having skateboarding elements in the game, which led the development team to start working and experimenting with a new traversal system. In hindsight, Murray described the shift in focus as an [...] "organic, evolutionary process". As the game's development progressed, the team began to draw on elements from other video game franchises such as Prince of Persia, Jet Set Radio, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and put the emphasis on momentum.|$|E

500|$|Originally titled as [...] "What Doesn't Kill You", [...] "Stronger" [...] {{was written}} by Jörgen Elofsson, Ali Tamposi, David Gamson, and Greg Kurstin in September 2010. In an {{interview}} with American Songwriter, Tamposi revealed that the song {{was inspired by the}} Friedrich Nietzsche adage ("That which does not kill us makes us stronger") that her mother told her as advice. Although Tamposi found the phrase as saccharine, she submitted it as an idea to Elofsson and Gamson during their writing sessions. Elofsson originally intended [...] "Stronger" [...] for Leona Lewis, who turned it down in the process. Tamposi's manager, Tom Maffei, then had one of his producers, Matty Trump, to produce a demo track later to be pitched to RCA A executive Jeff Aldrich, who later gave the song to Clarkson. Tamposi revealed that Clarkson had also altered a lyric from the track. Aldrich had then commissioned Greg Kurstin, whom Clarkson wanted to collaborate with, to produce and add additional writing to the final version. Kurstin recalled, [...] "I rethought the music part of it, I guess. It had a different tempo, beat, chords, and I kinda just came up with that guitar riff that goes into the verse, and that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that I kinda contributed just changed the feel of the song." [...] The song's uplifting theme of empowerment led Clarkson to name her fifth studio album Stronger. saying that it is one of her favorite songs in the album, she said, [...] "Everybody loves the message 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' It's a perfect representation of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Yoshihiro Togashi {{stated that}} he began working on Yu Yu Hakusho {{during a period of}} time around November 1990, though he forgot the exact time. As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and {{illustrate}} a manga based on his interests. Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tanteidan, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga. When first producing Yu Yu Hakusho, {{he did not have a}} clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title [...] "How to be a Ghost" [...] while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go-ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed [...] "YuYu-Ki (Poltergeist Chronicles)" [...] for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title SaiYu-Ki. Because a series with a similar name (Chin-Yu-Ki) had already begun publication, Togashi quickly created an alternative: [...] "YuYu Hakusho (Poltergeist Report)". He commented that he could have used [...] "Den (Legend)" [...] or [...] "Monogatari (Story)", but [...] "Hakusho (Report)" [...] <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that came to his mind. He contiguously developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. [...] "Yusuke Urameshi" [...] is a pun, [...] "Kazuma Kuwabara" [...] is a combination of two professional baseball players, and [...] "Hiei" [...] and [...] "Kurama" [...] are [...] "just names that popped into [...] head". When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei.|$|E

[...] Stories were said to [...] "abound of realtors, city officials and others showing off the city who found alternate routes into downtown just to avoid it." [...] Indeed, it {{has been called a}} [...] "black hole", a 'vacant carcass sitting at one of the most strategic corners of New Haven', [...] symbolizing [...] "blight and despair", and a [...] "symbol of an empty past with no promises of the future." ...|$|E

2500|$|Seven of {{the houses}} have similar furniture, with the beds and dresser in the same places in each house. The dresser stands against the wall {{opposite}} the door, and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> seen by anyone entering the dwelling. Each of these houses had the larger bed {{on the right side}} of the doorway and the smaller on the left. Lloyd Laing noted that this pattern accorded with Hebridean custom up to the early 20thcentury suggesting that the husband's bed was the larger and the wife's was the smaller. The discovery of beads and paint-pots in some of the smaller beds may support this interpretation. Additional support may come from the recognition that stone boxes lie to the left of most doorways, forcing the person entering the house to turn to the right-hand, [...] "male", side of the dwelling. At the front of each bed lie the stumps of stone pillars that may have supported a canopy of fur; another link with recent Hebridean style.|$|E
