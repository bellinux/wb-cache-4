500|$|Michael Binstein and Charles Bowden's 1993 book, Trust Me: Charles Keating and the Missing Billions, also {{presents}} Keating {{as a complex}} individual with contradictory tendencies, and concludes:Charlie Keating built things, and, at some level that haunts anyone who looks over his records, he thought his schemes would work. He did not simply rob a bank. He broke a bank with his dreams. If he is simply a thief, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> put the money into deals and projects instead of into his own pocket? If he is just a hardworking businessman simply {{trying to make a}} profit and create jobs, why the need for jets, fancy meals, big paychecks to his family? If he is such a devout communicant of his faith, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> peddle hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of junk bonds to old people when he knew his empire was in serious jeopardy? ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{observed}} {{the workings of}} what he thought an alarming tendency of the poetic imagination, as well as Shakespeare's possible aristocratic bias, Hazlitt then observes that, after all, traits of Coriolanus's character emerge, even in this dramatic context, that Shakespeare clearly shows {{to be less than}} admirable. For example, [...] "Coriolanus complains of the fickleness of the people: yet, the instant he cannot gratify his pride and obstinacy at their expense, he turns his arms against his own country. If his country was not worth defending, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> build his pride in its defence?" ...|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{was found}} dead in his cabin from a shotgun blast to his stomach on July 30, 1968. The Coroner's Office ruled it a suicide, and the Martin County Sheriff's Office deemed it a [...] "pretty {{clear-cut}} case". However, many Florida locals had their doubts. [...] "If it were [...] a suicide, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> do a head shot instead of a chest shot?" [...] asked Bessie DuBois. The theory was that he stuck the shotgun in the ground, leaned over and pulled the trigger, even though it would have taken considerable effort and flexibility on Nelson's part.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may well}} say that, David," [...] the woman {{answered}} with a certain pride in the vastness of her calamity. [...] "If it was another woman I couldn't bear to think of it. <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>He</b> <b>do</b> it? <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>He</b> set such traps for us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he can be}} a forger," [...] says Betsy, [...] "a wicked, wicked FORGER. <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> go away every day? {{to forge}} notes, to be sure. <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> go to the city? to be near banks and places, and so do it more at his convenience." ...|$|R

2500|$|Had Cruikshank been {{capable of}} {{constructing}} a story, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> not exercise his talent {{when he had}} no connection with Mr. Dickens or myself? But I never {{heard of such a}} tale being published ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Denver Westword, Brown said, [...] "One thing [...] gonna be asked is, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> jump on [...] so quickly {{and go back to}} D.C. so quickly when in ... Benghazi, he went to Las Vegas? Why was this so quick? ... At some point, somebody's going to ask that question." ...|$|E
2500|$|We have no {{definitive}} date for Abbo's death, {{though it has}} been assumed to be later than 922. Around that year Bishop Fulrad of Paris endeavored to publish a selection of Abbo's sermons. If the bishop was willing to publish his sermons while Abbo was still alive, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> choose not to endorse the De bellis? ...|$|E

2500|$|Celsus {{found it}} hard to {{reconcile}} Christian human God who was born and matured with his Jewish God {{who was supposed to be}} one and unchanging. He asked [...] "if God wanted to reform humanity, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> choose to descend and live on earth? How his brief presence in Jerusalem could benefit all the millions of people who lived elsewhere in the world or who had lived and died before his incarnation?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Ohno {{would later}} confess {{that he had}} subconsciously held back for fear of {{suddenly}} crashing into Davis or Smith, a common occurrence in the sport, pointing out {{that he did not}} need to win the race because he already had a spot on the team. Questions persisted that if Ohno had really held back, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> keep passing Biondo? [...] Some speculated that Ohno was holding off Biondo from challenging Smith, as Smith also needed to finish ahead of Biondo in order to secure a spot in the 1000 m for Salt Lake. Even this scenario would have been a violation of the rules of team skating. Both claims went unproven in the arbitration case, and all three were absolved of guilt.|$|E
2500|$|Xu Chu {{was known}} to be a {{cautious}} and serious person who did not talk much and was very mindful of rules and regulations. Once, Cao Cao's cousin Cao Ren came from Jing Province to meet Cao Cao – who had recently received the title of a vassal king, King of Wei (魏王), from Emperor Xian – in the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan). Cao Cao was still in his personal chambers, with Xu Chu standing guard outside, when Cao Ren arrived. Cao Ren asked Xu Chu to join him in the side room for a chat. However, Xu Chu replied, [...] "The King is coming out soon." [...] He then entered Cao Cao's chambers. Cao Ren was very unhappy with Xu Chu. Later, someone told Xu Chu, [...] "The General (Cao Ren) is a close relative and important subject of the King. He lowered himself when he asked to chat with you. How could you reject him?" [...] Xu Chu responded, [...] "He may be a close relative and important subject of the King, but he's in charge of external defences at the borders. I, Xu Chu, am in charge of internal security. If he wanted to chat with me, we could do so in public. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> ask to chat with me in private?" [...] Cao Cao was impressed and he favoured Xu Chu even more after he heard about the incident, so he promoted him to Central Resolute General (中堅將軍).|$|E

6000|$|Then {{she turned}} {{fiercely}} on him, and fought him. He {{was not to}} do this to her, it was monstrous.

6000|$|He {{then stood}} {{silent for a}} moment, having {{finished}} that task; but yet <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not sit down. <b>Why,</b> oh, <b>why</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> not sit down? <b>why,</b> O Undy, <b>does</b> <b>he</b> thus stand, looking at {{the surface of the}} table on which he is leaning? ...|$|R

6000|$|The more {{enduring}} Social Instincts {{conquer the}} less Persistent Instincts.—We have, however, not as yet considered the main point, {{on which the}} whole question of the moral sense hinges.

60|$|<b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>He</b> {{keep you}} alive? Surely because He expects {{something}} of you. And what <b>does</b> <b>He</b> expect of you?

Not from mere brute instinct, as beasts {{take care of}} their young when they are little, and then as soon as they are grown up cast them off and forget them. No. He takes care of his children because he wishes them to grow up like himself, to be a comfort and a help and a pride to him.|$|R
