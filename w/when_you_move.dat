This system is still Live Action because <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>move,</b> your character moves. This system is found commonly in [...] which fall under Theater-style LARPs. There are Parlor LARPs that still engage in combat, however, {{it is the largest}} genre of LARPing with no combat. An example of this LARP sans combat would be Wink Murder. Non-Combat is also a mechanic of other LARPs for players who want to immerse in the game world but are either incapable or unwilling to participate in combat. The rules of non-combat PC's differ from LARP to LARP.|$|E

According to Mathieson [...] "the band were {{starting}} to bristle at the extent of Kosky's involvement {{in every aspect of}} their stalled career." [...] Kosky felt he was a scapegoat for problems with the second album including its poorer commercial performance: [...] "Everyone was looking for a fall guy. It happened to be me and I left gracefully. I put my life into it for five years and I gambled a lot. Like any relationship, you find a time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> on." [...] Chris Robinson bought out Kosky's share of their partnership in Wah Wah Music and became the band's new manager.|$|E
2500|$|Spears {{talked about}} her {{feelings}} toward the conservatorship her father contains and how she feels about her life, and quotes [...] "There's no excitement, there's no passion... I have really good days, and then I have bad days. Even {{when you go to}} jail, you know there's the time when you're gonna get out. But in this situation, it's never ending. It's just like Groundhog Day every day." [...] Spears added [...] "I think it's too in control, If I wasn't under the restraints I'm under, I'd feel so liberated. When I tell them the way I feel, it's like they hear but they're really not listening. I never wanted to become one of those prisoner people. I always wanted to feel free." [...] The singer also commented on her feelings towards fans and her music style. [...] "It's weird because your music is a reflection of what you're going through," [...] she says. [...] "It's such a part of me, the record, 'cause of what I've gone through." [...] In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. [...] "If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, it all goes away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster," [...] she says. [...] "People think that when you go through something in life {{you have to go to}} therapy. For me, art is therapy, because it's like you're expressing yourself in such a spiritual way. [...] "Sometimes you don't need to use words to go through what you need to go through," [...] she continues. [...] "Sometimes it's an emotion you need to feel when you dance, that you need to touch. And the only thing that can touch it is <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> a certain way." ...|$|E

60|$|It was heavenly for Johnson to have {{something}} to do and to feel that he was of some use to his wife. He ran swiftly to Bridport Place, his footfalls clattering through the silent streets and the big dark policemen turning their yellow funnels of light on him as he passed. Two tugs at the night-bell brought down a sleepy, half-clad assistant, who handed him a stoppered glass bottle and a cloth bag which contained something which clinked <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>moved</b> it. Johnson thrust the bottle into his pocket, seized the green bag, and pressing his hat firmly down ran {{as hard as he could}} set foot to ground until he was in the City Road and saw the name of Pritchard engraved in white upon a red ground.

60|$|After a lapse {{of fifteen}} years he rediscovered this {{interesting}} world, about {{which so many}} people go incredibly blind and bored. He went along country roads while all the birds were piping and chirruping and cheeping and singing, and looked at fresh new things, and felt as happy and irresponsible as a boy with an unexpected half-holiday. And if ever the thought of Miriam returned to him he controlled his mind. He came to country inns and sat for unmeasured hours talking of this and that to those sage carters who rest for ever in the taps of country inns, while the big sleek brass jingling horses wait patiently outside with their waggons; {{he got a job}} with some van people who were wandering about the country with swings and a steam roundabout and remained with them for three days, until one of their dogs took a violent dislike to him and made his duties unpleasant; he talked to tramps and wayside labourers, he snoozed under hedges by day and in outhouses and hayricks at night, and once, but only once, he slept in a casual ward. He felt as the etiolated grass and daisies must do <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> the garden roller away to a new place.|$|E
60|$|But {{perhaps the}} best image {{of the absence of}} stale melancholy or wasted splendour, of the {{positive}} presence of what I have called temperate joy, in the Florentine impression and genius, is the bell-tower of Giotto, which rises beside the cathedral. No beholder of it will have forgotten how straight and slender it stands there, how strangely rich in the common street, plated with coloured marble patterns, and yet so far from simple or severe in design that we easily wonder how its author, the painter of exclusively and portentously grave little pictures, should have fashioned a building which in the way of elaborate elegance, of the true play of taste, leaves a jealous modern criticism nothing to miss. Nothing can be imagined at once more lightly and more pointedly fanciful; it might have been handed over to the city, as it stands, by some Oriental genie tired of too much detail. Yet for all that suggestion it seems of no particular time--not grey and hoary like a Gothic steeple, not cracked and despoiled like a Greek temple; its marbles shining so little less freshly than when they were laid together, and the sunset lighting up its cornice with such a friendly radiance, that you come at last to regard it simply as the graceful, indestructible soul of the place made visible. The Cathedral, externally, for all its solemn hugeness, strikes the same note of would-be reasoned elegance and cheer; it has conventional grandeur, of course, but a grandeur so frank and ingenuous even in its parti-pris. It has seen so much, and outlived so much, and served so many sad purposes, and yet remains in aspect so full of the fine Tuscan geniality, the feeling for life, one may almost say the feeling for amusement, that inspired it. Its vast many-coloured marble walls become at any rate, with this, the friendliest note of all Florence; there is an unfailing charm in walking past them while they lift their great acres of geometrical mosaic higher in the air than you have time or other occasion to look. You greet them from the deep street as you greet {{the side of a mountain}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> in the gorge--not twisting back your head to keep looking at the top, but content with the minor accidents, the nestling hollows and soft cloud- shadows, the general protection of the valley.|$|E

Then there was a French boy [...] Who said with seriousness that made them laugh, [...] "Ma friend, you ain't know what it is you're ask." [...] He doffed his cap and held it with both hands [...] Across his chest to make as 'twere a bow: [...] "We're giving you our chances on de farm." [...] And then they all turned to with deafening boots [...] And put each other bodily out of the house. [...] "Goodby to them! We puzzle them.
