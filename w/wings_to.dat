In a sunny field of flowers, Thumbelina meets a tiny flower-fairy prince just her size and to her liking, and they wed. She receives a pair of <b>wings</b> <b>to</b> accompany her husband on his travels from flower to flower, and a new name, Maia.|$|E
5|$|Between 1958 and 1960, the station's chapel {{was built}} by Brandt O'Dell. The {{building}} incorporated a nave with seating space for 350 people, and connecting <b>wings</b> <b>to</b> the hall and narthex. In 1962, the gymnasium {{was built on the}} site.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his field lacrosse career, Striebel played one season in 2003 of box lacrosse with the Philadelphia Wings in the National Lacrosse League. Streibel was traded by the <b>Wings</b> <b>to</b> the New York Saints in February 2003. He never appeared in a game for the Saints. Striebel has also played professional soccer for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers.|$|E

50|$|As {{part of the}} Grand Louvre project, the Louvre Palace {{was divided}} into three {{geographical}} zones (or wings), named for the pavilions through which they are entered from the reception area under the Pyramid in the Cour Napoléon: the Sully <b>wing</b> <b>to</b> the east (the 'old' Louvre, surrounding the Cour Carrée); the Richelieu <b>wing</b> <b>to</b> the north (on the rue de Rivoli); and the Denon <b>wing</b> <b>to</b> the south (bordering the Seine).|$|R
5|$|In {{iconographic}} {{representations of}} the myth of Shiva vis-à-vis Vishnu, Sharabha form has been built around Narasimha but substantially embellished with <b>wings</b> <b>to</b> represent Kali and Durga to denote the female powers (shaktis) of Shiva; Sharabha is also shown with a bird head and a serpent in his beak head.|$|E
5|$|Physically, some insects {{move their}} flight muscles {{directly}}, others indirectly. In insects with direct flight, the wing muscles directly {{attached to the}} wing base, so that a small downward movement of the wing base lifts the wing itself upward. Those insects with indirect flight have muscles that attach to and deform the thorax, causing the <b>wings</b> <b>to</b> move as well.|$|E
5|$|Required {{power was}} put up {{by a pair of}} {{afterburning}} Westinghouse XJ46-WE-02 turbojets, fed from intakes mounted high above the <b>wings</b> <b>to</b> avoid ingesting spray. When these engines were not ready for the prototypes, twin Westinghouse J34-WE-32 engines of just over half the power were installed.|$|E

5|$|The 'defects' of one organ are {{remedied}} by {{the structure}} of another. The elephant has, Paley argues, a short neck because its head is so heavy, but in compensation it has a long trunk, enabling it to reach out. Similarly the spider has no <b>wings</b> <b>to</b> enable it to chase its flying prey, but has a web, and organs adapted to produce it, which compensates for the lack.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defend by Christopher Daniels against Shocker in {{the sixth}} encounter. The {{duration}} of the match was eleven minutes and fifty-eight seconds. In the final moments, Shocker went for a suplex {{off the top of}} a padded turnbuckle, however Daniels countered the move and instead performed his signature maneuver the Angel <b>Wings</b> <b>to</b> retain the X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Samuelsson {{recorded a}} second consecutive 40-point campaign. In the ensuing playoffs, he scored the overtime-winning goal in Game 2 of the Semifinals against the Chicago Blackhawks. He advanced with the Red <b>Wings</b> <b>to</b> the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals, where they met the Penguins {{for the second}} consecutive year. Detroit was defeated in seven games, missing out on back-to-back championships. Samuelsson contributed 10 points in 21 playoff games.|$|E

500|$|The {{flanking}} wings contain {{service and}} secondary rooms—the family <b>wing</b> <b>to</b> the south-west; the guest <b>wing</b> <b>to</b> the north-west; the chapel <b>wing</b> <b>to</b> the south-east; {{and the kitchen}} <b>wing</b> <b>to</b> the north-east. [...] Each wing's external appearance is identical: three bays, each separated from the other by a narrow recess in the elevation. Each bay is surmounted by an unadorned pediment. The composition of stone, recesses, varying pediments and chimneys of the four blocks is almost reminiscent of the English Baroque style in favour ten years earlier, employed at Seaton Delaval Hall by Sir John Vanbrugh. One of these wings, as at the later Kedleston Hall, was a self-contained country house to accommodate the family when the state rooms and central block were not in use.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the angle}} of attack {{is less than the}} {{stalling}} angle any increase in angle of attack causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the <b>wing</b> <b>to</b> rise. As the wing rises {{the angle of}} attack and lift coefficient decrease which tend <b>to</b> restore the <b>wing</b> <b>to</b> its original angle of attack. Conversely any decrease in angle of attack causes a decrease in lift coefficient which causes the <b>wing</b> <b>to</b> descend. As the wing descends, the angle of attack and lift coefficient increase which tends <b>to</b> restore the <b>wing</b> <b>to</b> its original angle of attack. For this reason the angle of attack is stable when it is less than the stalling angle. [...] The aircraft displays damping in roll.|$|R

The angels' <b>wings</b> <b>to</b> Mary's left are visible, but not those to the right, probably because of later overpainting. In the underdrawing Mary's gown extends {{far to the left}} of the angel, but Christus apparently changed his mind about its execution.|$|E
5|$|A mutant with {{dragonfly}} wings {{which are}} tattooed {{on her body}} and possesses acidic saliva. The make-up team took four hours to apply Angel's wing tattoo on Kravitz, and the visual effects team had to erase the tattoo in case the scene required Angel with the computer-generated <b>wings.</b> <b>To</b> depict flight, Kravitz stood on elevated platforms and was dangled on wires, at times from a helicopter to allow for varied camera angles.|$|E
5|$|After a 40-point {{campaign}} in 2007–08, Samuelsson helped the Red <b>Wings</b> <b>to</b> a Stanley Cup championship. He recorded 13 points in 22 post-season games, {{including the first}} two goals in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Helping the Red Wings defeat the Penguins in six games, the victory made Samuelsson {{a member of the}} Triple Gold Club, having won gold medals at the Winter Olympics and World Championships two years prior. Also accomplishing the feat were teammates and fellow Swedes Henrik Zetterberg and Niklas Kronwall.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} his fourth {{season with the}} Wings in 2011–12, Daavettila signed his first European contract as a free agent, agreeing to a one-year deal with Frederikshavn White Hawks of the Danish AL-Bank Ligaen on June 13, 2012. However {{a little over a}} month later, due to personal reasons, Daavettila sought a release from his contract and was granted on July 30, 2012. On September 13, Daavettila agreed to remain in the ECHL, defecting from the <b>Wings</b> <b>to</b> fellow competitor the Colorado Eagles on a one-year deal.|$|E
5|$|After the {{foundation}} of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, the mosque underwent several major modifications. In 1951 King Ibn Saud (1932–1953) ordered demolitions around the mosque to make way for new <b>wings</b> <b>to</b> the east and west of the prayer hall, which consisted of concrete columns with pointed arches. Older columns were reinforced with concrete and braced with copper rings at the top. The Suleymaniyya and Majidiyya minarets were replaced by two minarets in Mamluk revival style. Two additional minarets were erected to the northeast and northwest of the mosque. A library was built along the western wall to house historic Qurans and other religious texts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach <b>wings</b> <b>to</b> the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, and would have been unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E

5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their <b>wings</b> <b>to</b> expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} conservatism, in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel to hone their designs to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly {{the most important factor}} in the design of modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear <b>wings</b> <b>to</b> this effect.|$|E
5|$|Despite the setback, {{the team}} {{returned}} to the Eastern Conference Finals during the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season and defeated the Philadelphia Flyers four games to two. They swept the heavily favored Detroit Red <b>Wings</b> <b>to</b> win New Jersey's first-ever Stanley Cup, as they brought the Cup across the Hudson River from New York, after the Rangers had won it the year before. The 1995 Devils team became the first to give the players a day with the Stanley Cup, a tradition that lives on with each Cup winner. Claude Lemieux was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoffs MVP. The success came amid constant rumors that the team would move {{for the third time}} in its history to Nashville.|$|E
