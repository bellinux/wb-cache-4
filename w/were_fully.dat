5|$|A {{scheme was}} devised during the Second World War to protect major cities from enemy bombing by {{lighting}} decoy fires on nearby open land. Manchester {{was protected by}} four of these Starfish sites as they were known, two of them on Chat Moss. RAF Balloon Command {{was responsible for the}} administration and manning of the sites, which <b>were</b> <b>fully</b> operational by 23January 1941. Each consisted of an air raid shelter for the crew along with various devices to simulate street lighting and the explosions of incendiary bombs. The effectiveness of the decoy sites is uncertain, and they were closed in 1943.|$|E

5|$|As {{successful}} self-determination movements {{spread throughout}} Africa after World War II, many Mozambicans became progressively nationalistic in outlook, and increasingly {{frustrated by the}} nation's continued subservience to foreign rule. For the other side, many enculturated indigenous Africans who <b>were</b> <b>fully</b> integrated into the Portugal-ruled social organization of Portuguese Mozambique, in particular those from the urban centres, reacted to the independentist claims {{with a mixture of}} discomfort and suspicion. The ethnic Portuguese of the territory, which included most of the ruling authorities, responded with increased military presence and fast-paced development projects.|$|E

However, many units remained de facto segregated, with African Americans mostly being pooled into service units and non-combat duties.

5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists <b>were</b> <b>fully</b> deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. From {{the ranks of the}} allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the temple}} {{building}} proper was the temple enclosure, {{surrounded by a}} rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder. On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties {{in the fourth century}} BC, when the walls <b>were</b> <b>fully</b> fortified in case of Persian invasion. In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks, so that the top of the wall undulated vertically. This pattern may have been meant to evoke the mythological waters of chaos.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{service in}} the bus tunnel began on September 15, 1990, on five routes serving the University District, North Seattle, and Renton.

The opening was preceded by soft openings of each individual station, beginning with Westlake station in August 1989, and ending with Convention Place station the day before the beginning of service. A ceremonial walk and run was held on September 9, 1990, and attracted 5,000 participants.|$|E

Following this, the Japanese submarines <b>were</b> <b>fully</b> occupied responding to Allied offensives and transporting supplies to isolated garrisons. As the threat to shipping declined, the RAN ceased running convoys in waters south of Newcastle on 7December 1943 and Sydney–Brisbane convoys ended on 10February 1944.|$|E

The Shogun also relied on troops supplied by allied domains, which were not necessarily as advanced in terms of military equipment and methods, composing an army that had both modern and outdated elements.|$|E

5|$|After Kiev, the Red Army {{no longer}} outnumbered the Germans {{and there were}} no more trained {{reserves}} directly available. To defend Moscow, Stalin could field 800,000 men in 83 divisions, but no more than 25 divisions <b>were</b> <b>fully</b> effective. Operation Typhoon, the drive to Moscow, began on 30 September 1941. In front of Army Group Center was a series of elaborate defense lines, the first centered on Vyazma and the second on Mozhaysk. Russian peasants began fleeing ahead of the advancing German units, burning their harvested crops, driving their cattle away, and destroying buildings in their villages as part of a scorched-earth policy designed to deny the Nazi war machine of needed supplies and foodstuffs.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the walls}} of the chapel were distempered over, hiding the murals from view. They were {{forgotten}} until its rediscovery in 1958. Due to their historical significance, an international search was conducted to locate the original painter in helping to restore the damaged and faded murals. Stanley was eventually found in 1959 and, after much persuasion, agreed to assist in the restoration project. He made three trips to Singapore between 1963 and 1988 to restore his former paintings. Due to Stanley's advanced age, only four of the original murals <b>were</b> <b>fully</b> restored. In the 1990s, the former site of the murals was gazetted as a Heritage Site by the National Heritage Board of Singapore.|$|E
