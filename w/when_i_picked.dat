Riegels told the Associated Press, [...] "I was running toward the sidelines <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> up the ball... I started to turn to my left toward Tech's goal. Somebody shoved me and I bounded right off into a tackler. In {{pivoting}} {{to get away from}} him, I completely lost my bearings." [...] Teammate and quarterback Benny Lom chased Riegels, screaming at him to stop. Known for his speed, Lom finally caught up with Riegels at California's [...] line and tried to turn him around, but he was immediately rushed by a wave of Georgia Tech players, and tackled by Frank Waddey and Vance Maree at the [...] line. [...] The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play so close to their own end zone, but Maree blocked Lom's punt for a safety, giving Tech a 2–0 lead.|$|E
