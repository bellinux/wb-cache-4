5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, <b>women</b> <b>have</b> depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in <b>women</b> <b>have</b> been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E

5|$|Endometrial cancer appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina <b>women</b> <b>have</b> a lower rates and Native Hawaiian <b>women</b> <b>have</b> higher rates.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to mortality, {{cancer is a}} cause of considerable morbidity in women. <b>Women</b> <b>have</b> a lower lifetime probability of being diagnosed with cancer (38% vs 45% for men), but {{are more likely to}} be diagnosed with cancer at an earlier age.|$|E
25|$|Carbetocin {{compared}} with oxytocin produced {{a reduction in}} women who needed uterine massage and further uterotonic drugs for <b>women</b> <b>having</b> caesarean sections. There {{was no difference in}} rates of PPH in <b>women</b> <b>having</b> caesarean sections or <b>women</b> <b>having</b> vaginal deliveries when given carbetocin. Carbetocin appears to cause less adverse effects. More research is needed to find the cost effectiveness of using carbetocin.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1975, {{numerous}} other empirical {{studies have found}} evidence of gender symmetry. For example, in the United States, the National Comorbidity Study of 1990-1992 found 18.4% of men and 17.4% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced minor IPV, and 5.5% of men and 6.5% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced severe IPV. In England and Wales, the 1995 [...] "Home Office Research Study 191" [...] found that in the twelve {{months prior to the}} survey, 4.2% of both men and woman between the ages of 16 and 59 had been assaulted by an intimate. The Canadian General Social Survey of 2000 found that from 1994 to 1999, 4% of men and 4% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship in which they were still involved, 22% of men and 28% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship which had now ended, and 7% of men and 8% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV across all relationships, past and present. The 2005 Canadian General Social Survey, looking at the years 1999-2004 found similar data; 4% of men and 3% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship in which they were still involved, 16% of men and 21% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV in a relationship which had now ended, and 6% of men and 7% of <b>women</b> <b>had</b> experienced IPV across all relationships, past and present.|$|R

5|$|In {{countries}} where <b>women</b> <b>have</b> to do paid work {{in order to}} feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many <b>women</b> <b>have</b> jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{black men}} and <b>women</b> <b>have</b> a higher incidence. Lung cancer rates are {{currently}} lower in developing countries. With increased smoking in developing countries, the rates are expected to increase {{in the next few}} years, notably in China and India.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries.

5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian <b>women</b> <b>have</b> a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. <b>Women</b> <b>have</b> higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease, women {{were less likely to be}} operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a lack of}} {{official}} support for a national team and women's football in general, <b>women</b> <b>have</b> self-organised their own teams and play games out of the sight of men.
