In 2011, she appeared nude in The Body Issue of ESPN The Magazine. Of the experience, she said, [...] "I'm an athlete—that's all I am. If a sex symbol is now a top female athlete, I think that's pretty amazing and it shows how far our country has come from the stick-thin models, from <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> most magazines." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Wiseau {{mentioned}} {{plans for}} a Broadway adaptation of the film, {{in which he would}} appear only on opening night: [...] "It will be similar to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the movie, except it will be musical. As well as, you will see… like, for example, Johnny, we could have maybe 10 Johnnys at the same time singing, or playing football. So, the decision have to be made at the time when we actually doing choreography, ‘cause I’ll be doing choreography, as well I’ll be in it only one time, that’s it, as Johnny." [...] He mentioned the plans again during a 2016 interview describing his idea for it to be a [...] "musical slash comedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Srikula adepts {{most often}} worship Lalita using the {{abstract}} Sri Chakra yantra, which {{is regarded as}} her subtle form. The Sri Chakra can be visually rendered either as a two-dimensional diagram (whether drawn temporarily {{as part of the}} worship ritual, or permanently engraved in metal) or in the three-dimensional, pyramidal form known as the Sri Meru. It is not uncommon to find a Sri Chakra or Sri Meru installed in South Indian temples, because – as modern practitioners assert – [...] "there is no disputing that this is the highest form of Devi and that some of the practice can be done openly. But <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the temples is not the srichakra worship you see when it is done privately." ...|$|E

500|$|Ruck {{says that}} with Cameron Frye, Hughes gave him [...] "the best part I {{ever had in}} a movie, and any success that I've had since 1985 is because he took a big chance on me. I'll be forever grateful." [...] "While we were making the movie, I just knew I {{had a really good}} part", Ruck says. [...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend to dwell on the ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> his movies." ...|$|E
500|$|The ride {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} July 2014 opening. Lance Hart from Screamscape {{was impressed with}} the fact that the King's Cross entrance was hidden from the rest of the Diagon Alley area. He also credited Universal for making the train look as realistic as possible: [...] "Clearly they went to great lengths to create these cars to be replicas of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the films, both on the outside as well as on the inside as you move down the hallway towards your cabin to take your seat". In terms of the overall experience Hart said, [...] "Universal has managed to turn what would simply be a method of transporting guests between their two parks into yet another must-see attraction ... tying together the overall story and theme of visiting Hogwarts at Islands of Adventure and Diagon Alley inside Universal Studios Florida".|$|E
500|$|Psycho is now {{considered}} to be the first film in the slasher film genre, and has been referenced in films numerous times; examples include the 1974 musical horror film Phantom of the Paradise, 1978 horror film Halloween (which starred Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh's daughter), the 1977 Mel Brooks tribute to many of Hitchcock's thrillers, High Anxiety, the 1980 Fade to Black, the 1980 Dressed to Kill and Wes Craven's 1996 horror satire Scream. Bernard Herrmann's opening theme has been sampled by rapper Busta Rhymes on his song [...] "Gimme Some More" [...] (1998). Manuel Muñoz's 2011 novel <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>in</b> the Dark includes a sub-plot that fictionalizes elements of the filming of Psycho, referring to Hitchcock and Leigh only as [...] "The Director" [...] and [...] "The Actress". In the comic book stories of Jonni Future, the house inherited by the title character is patterned after the Bates Motel.|$|E

500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing). Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough to do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. [...] "It just happened that this was an actual parade, which we put our float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand. Nobody knew what it was, including the governor." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Evangelical {{journalist}} Richard Abanes, who {{has written}} several books arguing against new religions and Mormonism, published a polemical text that made similar allegations to the video: Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick. Later editions incorporated comparisons and contrasts between Harry Potter and the more overtly Christian works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, [...] "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a simple question, 'Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that {{will enable them to}} replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?' If you go to The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in,</b> story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can't replicate it. But if you go to something like Harry Potter, you can find references to astrology, clairvoyance, and numerology. It takes seconds to go into a bookstore or library and get books on that and start investigating it, researching it, and doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 1 at 1:22p.m., Panetta, {{acting on}} the president's orders, {{directed}} McRaven {{to move forward with}} the operation. Shortly after 3p.m., the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing {{in a corner of the}} screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: [...] "Contrary to some news reports and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day." [...] Two other command centers monitored the raid from the Pentagon and the American embassy in Islamabad.|$|E

2500|$|Melman {{and other}} critics {{of the book and}} the film have said that the story's premise—that Israeli agents had second {{thoughts}} about their work—is not supported by interviews or public statements. In an interview with Reuters, a retired head of Israel's Shin Bet intelligence service and [...] former Internal Security Minister, Avi Dichter, likened Munich to a children's adventure story: [...] "There is no comparison between <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the movie and how it works in reality". [...] In a Time magazine cover story about the film on December 4, 2005, Spielberg said that the source of the film had second thoughts about his actions. [...] "There is something about killing people at close range that is excruciating," [...] Spielberg said. [...] "It's bound to try a man's soul." [...] Of the real Avner, Spielberg says, [...] "I don’t think he will ever find peace." ...|$|E
2500|$|February {{continued}} the pace. She {{began a series}} before the new Chicago Culture Club at the Church of the Epiphany (Chicago), and {{less than a week}} later gave a talk on Hamlet, and then another for a benefit dinner. Just a few days later she gave a talk for the Menoken Club. She ended the Arché club series with a talk on [...] "Degas, Raffaelli, and their theories". There was an individual talk on March 10 on The Tempest, followed by a [...] "salon day" [...] for the Arché club. Then she announced another series of lectures and {{continued the}} individual talks. The first series of talks during some recitals at individual's homes on Bethoven, Wagner, and Schumann each a week apart in what is now the Prairie Avenue District. Meanwhile, she gave a talk on [...] "Shakespeare's women" [...] at the new YWCA in what is now the Historic Michigan Boulevard District, Then she lectured on the subject of [...] "American Colonists". A week later she was talking for the Arché club. The last few days of March she addressed and reviewed Chicago artists, in which she was quoted extensively for in a column in The Inter Ocean newspaper of Chicago. Papers also noted that by April the talks had outgrown the space of rooms in churches. Nevertheless, benefits were still held in churches, such as for the YWCA with a talk about John Ruskin, also a Spiritualist. Another publicized talk at a home was on [...] "French Women of the Salon". She made a trip outside Chicago to Sterling, IL for a talk the next day. But she was back in time to give a talk in a week, and in a few days was giving a new talk entitled [...] "Nibelungen Lied(sic)". In May she gave two lectures. A repeat of one of the recitals comes in early June, held at the Hotel Windermere (Chicago). In a new turn of events, Ford challenged the Inter Ocean art critic on the virtues of impressionism - the critic opens with a line from Ford's letter to her [...] "After having told the world <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> Manet's pictures, don't you think you should do the graceful thing and tell what the artist sees?". Together they reviewed an exhibition, out of which the critic concedes [...] "… and truth to tell (Manet's defender) took home the palm." ...|$|E
