500|$|Lead singer Bart Millard has {{described}} the story behind [...] "So Long Self" [...] as [...] "...really simple: It’s Not About [...] It never has been and it never <b>will</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Just</b> like when maybe you had to break up with a girlfriend or a boyfriend growing up, or maybe {{the same thing happened}} to you, the ultimate breakup in life is when we breakup with ourselves. Because Christ said you have to die to self to follow him". The song is also lyrically about a break-up with sinful human nature.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{extended}} {{and ran for}} 90minutes, {{as opposed to the}} usual 60minutes. Michael Ausiello of TVLine reported that the producers included two extra musical performances to fill the extended time slot. Series creator Ian Brennan stated that he believed the extension was granted as there were two songs which would otherwise have been cut for length. He welcomed the additional 24minutes of screen time, and commented: [...] "We're always desperately cutting down our episodes. Even when we write them, and then in the editing room we're always throwing away stuff that I really love to get it down to time. [...] It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> really interesting content-wise for us [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Maura O'Malley of Bustle also lauded the {{development}} of the character ahead of season 12 saying, [...] "When the series began, Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life. She had graduated medical school, she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital, and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached, one night stand. What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is, she wasn't searching for love. Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities, while McDreamy was simply an added perk. Hopefully, the new season of Grey's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone, because Meredith is a strong, independent woman — and she <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> fine." ...|$|E

500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{disliked the}} episode, criticizing it as [...] "sloppy," [...] the science as [...] "repeating itself," [...] and the fringe element [...] as [...] "especially goofy"; he rated the episode 6.0/10. Writing for Mania.com, critic Stephen Lackey thought Anna Torv's {{performance}} [...] "felt forced", but heaped praise on John Noble. Lackey believes Torv and Joshua Jackson have good chemistry, and consequently partly disliked the episode {{because they had}} few scenes together. He also thought {{the case of the}} week was [...] "fairly entertaining," [...] but the storyline was [...] "just...passable", as he wanted the show [...] "to be done with all of the introductions and get more into the mystery of the pattern". He concluded his review, [...] "Hopefully, next week the story <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> a little more concise, Olivia and Peter back working together and maybe at some point Astrid will actually have something important to do". The Los Angeles Times thought the episode was [...] "solid if unexceptional", as he liked Walter but disliked the [...] "vacuum of personality" [...] that is Astrid.|$|E

500|$|You Only Live Twice was {{published}} in the UK on 16 March 1964, by Jonathan Cape and cost sixteen shillings. There were 62,000 pre-orders for the book, a significant increase over the 42,000 advance orders for the hardback first edition of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Richard Chopping, cover artist for The Spy Who Loved Me, was engaged for the design. On 17 July 1963, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape had written to Chopping about the artwork, saying: [...] "I have had a talk with Ian about the ideas for the ingredients of this design. He is very much in favour of the toad... but with a suitable array of oriental embellishrangment, i.e. toad plus Japanese flower arrangements, which he thinks should be sitting in a suitable piece of Japanese pottery, perhaps ornamented with a dragon motif. If you could manage a pink dragonfly sitting on the flowers, and perhaps just one epicanthic eye peering through them he thinks that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> splendid!" [...] Chopping's fee rose to 300 guineas for the cover, a rise from the 250 guineas he received for The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{said that}} [...] "Born Free" [...] was [...] "an intense episode {{that brought the}} Ice Truck Killer story to a {{satisfying}} conclusion." [...] He felt that the [...] "biggest shock of all" [...] was the reveal of Rudy as Dexter's brother, and described their confrontation as [...] "riveting". Goldman gave the episode an [...] "incredible" [...] rating of 9.5 out of 10. Paula Paige of TV Guide was [...] "impressed" [...] by Michael Hall's [...] "incredible acting ability," [...] praising his ability to transform from a [...] "stoic killer to overwrought brother {{in a matter of}} moments." [...] She said that the series went [...] "from being a good show to a fantastic show in the course of one season," [...] and hoped that [...] "the sophomore season <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> as terrific." [...] Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad felt {{that it would be a}} [...] "shame" [...] if Hall did not win a Golden Globe Award, saying that he [...] "certainly deserves it." [...] He understood why Rudy wanted to make Debra the brothers' first victim together; Rudy was jealous of the life that Dexter received and killing Debra was the symbol of that life dying. Although Toomey said that the episode was [...] "really well written," [...] he was troubled that no one made the connection between Dexter and Rudy when all they had to do was read Rudy's file, but Toomey speculated that it could be discovered the next season.|$|E

[...] When Moore asked about others' contributions, Farnsworth agreed, [...] "There are literally thousands of inventions important to television. I hold something in excess of 165 American patents." [...] The host then asked about his current research, and the inventor replied, [...] "In television, we're attempting first to make better utilization of the bandwidth, because we think we can eventually get in excess of 2000 lines instead of 525 ... and do it on an even narrower channel ... which will make for a much sharper picture. We believe in the picture-frame type of a picture, where the visual display <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> a screen.
