30|$|In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> {{address the}} robust joint {{optimization}} {{of the relay}} weights and the input covariance matrix of jamming signals for SRM, under both total and individual relay power constraints. Two CSI error models, the deterministically bounded error model and the stochastic error model, are considered. For the case of deterministically bounded error model, <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> maximize the worst-case secrecy rate. While for the case of stochastic error model, <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> maximize the outage constrained secrecy rate. The challenge of these SRM-based optimizations lies in their non-convexity. In the following sections, we provide a unified approach for solving these SRM-based optimizations.|$|R
