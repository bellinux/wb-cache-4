This tribal rebellion is sometimes regarded as first major bid for establishing independent Kurdistan in Iran, but scholars see revolt as attempt by a powerful tribal chief to establish his personal authority vis-à-vis the central government throughout the region. Although elements of Kurdish nationalism were present in this movement, historians agree these were hardly articulate enough to justify a claim that recognition of Kurdish identity was {{a major issue in}} Simko's movement, and he had to rely heavily on conventional tribal motives. It lacked any kind of administrative organization and Simko <b>was</b> <b>primary</b> <b>interesting</b> in plunder. Government forces and non-Kurds were not the only ones to suffer in the attacks, the Kurdish population was also robbed and assaulted. Simko's men do not appear to have felt any sense of unity or solidarity with fellow Kurds. Historian Ervand Abrahamian calls Simko as [...] "notorious" [...] for allegedly massacring thousands Assyrians and supposedly [...] "harassing" [...] democrats, and Mehrdad Izady holds him responsible for killing Alevite Kurds. Still, Kurdish ethnicists today revere Simko as a hero of independence.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} the delay {{performance}} of CSMA policies in wireless networks, where the delay {{is defined as}} the average time that a silent wireless link needs to wait until it accesses the channel for packet transmission. It is well-known that CSMA policies can incur an access delay that may be correlated over time and may grow exponentially with the network size. This discourages practical implementation of CSMA policies in even mid-sized networks. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on the delay performance of CSMA policies. We present recently developed results for two important interference models and show how CSMA policies can be used to ensure an access delay that is memoryless over time or that does not grow with the network size. The two interference models that <b>we</b> consider <b>are</b> <b>primary</b> interference and the “lattice interference graph”. Our results suggest that CSMA policies can achieve a delay performance, as well as a delay-throughput trade-off, that makes them viable to be used in practice. I...|$|R

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Chemistry. [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Supramolecular chemists {{can be thought of as}} the architects of the nano-scale world. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>primary</b> concerned with the design and construction of various nanostructures based upon geometric shapes of smaller building blocks and controlling intermolecular non-covalent bonding. Indeed, chemists have borrowed the ideas and principles from the biological and mathematical world to design a wonderful array of interesting molecular topologies. All of the important chemical and biological processes needed for life occur within molecular containers such as viruses, bacteria and biological cells. Although chemists are far from the development of artificial container structures that can reproduce the remarkable properties of biological cells, greater success has been achieved by modeling capsule structures based upon viruses. Supramolecular chemistry, the all-in-one self-assembly approach which combines the advantages of reversibility and error checking based upon self-complementary hydrogen bonding has resulted in the formation of nanometer-sized spheroidal structures. The following dissertation comprises three closely related sets of studies, the design and construction of large spherical multicomponent assemblies via the self-assembly approach. Chapter 2 will describe the formation of very large molecular capsules based upon the self-assembly of six macrocycles called the C-alkylpyrogallol[4]arenes. These molecular capsules are held together by numerous hydrogen bonds and enclose approximately 1200 Å³ of inner space. Chapter 3 will discuss a new design approach to large multicomponent metalligand coordination capsules. All the metal-directed self-assembly methods reported within the literature use metal-ions as the directing influence in ligand assembly (i. e. without the metal-ions, the ligands would not assemble into spheroidal structures). However the C-alkylpyrogallol[4]arene molecules can assemble into hexameric nanospheroids with or without the presence of metal-ions. Topologically any closed two-dimensional surface can principally be described as a sphere or as a torus-shaped structure. The relationship between the two topologies continues to grab attention for understanding numerous topological and chemical problems. Indeed, given the numerous torus-shaped structures formed by molecular covalent chemistry there are surprisingly few non-covalent equivalents and their synthesis represents an enduring challenge for synthetic chemists. Thus, chapter 4 will describe the self-assembly of six molecules called calix[4]arenes into a large torusshaped structure via hydrogen bonding. The toroidal structure is structurally related to the calix[4]arene nanospheroids...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{muscovite}} in granites is also raised by Dickson. Muscovite {{is common in}} felsic S-type granites, as stated by Chappell and White (1974), but how much <b>is</b> <b>primary</b> {{and how much is}} secondary <b>are</b> debatable. <b>We</b> currently think that very little <b>is</b> <b>primary</b> (above the solidus). <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not arguing that muscovite (whether primary or secondary), garnet, and andalusite are not found in S-types; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> arguing that these minerals may also be found in some I-types. Dickson is quite correct in saying that replacement of cordierite by micas results from hydration, which may also affect the alkali/aluminum ratio of the rock. However, he is not necessarily correct in his assertion that water must be introduced into the system; it may be magmatic water released from the magma near the solidus during cooling and crystallization. More systematic goechemical and isotopic work is required on petrographically well-documented granite suites before this question is resolved. ...|$|R

Does it only belong to the textile or can it transcend to it’s surroundings? The investigational process is experimental and explores combinations of colour and light in translucent materials, coloured through the techniques of heat transfer printing and dyeing. Swatches made are analysed in relation {{to each other and to}} light, with a focus on their visual performance. The final design examples discusses the idea of how textile, light and colour can be used to create, define and illuminate spatiality...|$|R

40|$|Few {{would deny}} that the {{business}} environment {{plays an important role}} in the success or failure of firms everywhere. Social, political, and economic institutions are crucial determinants of business environment and to a firm’s ability to set and implement strategies. Factors such as political stability, the health of the macro [...] -economy, the state of the infrastructure, and the availability of needed skills affect firms’ cost structures and ultimately their profits. African business environments are rapidly changing. From being viewed as the ‘hopeless Continent’ at the turn of the 21 st century, Africa is now seen as a place of many opportunities (Economist, 2000, 2010). The Successful African Firms and Institutional Change (SAFIC) project was born out of the recognition that although African business environments remain to some extent challenging, it is clear that they are changing rapidly. The research project aims to investigate how and why African firms are able to be successful in such changing business and institutional environments. The project also focuses on firm specific characteristics that are rarely discussed in the context of African firms. In this project, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> conducting <b>primary</b> research in three African countries: Kenya, Tanzania, and Zambia.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Human {{beings are}} {{condemned}} to freedom, according to Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness. Every individual creates {{his or her}} own identity according to choice. Because we choose ourselves, each individual is also completely responsible for his or her actions. This responsibility causes anguish that leads human beings to avoid their freedom in bad faith. Bad faith is an attempt to deceive ourselves that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> less free than <b>we</b> really <b>are.</b> The <b>primary</b> condition of the racist is bad faith. In both aware/blatant and aware/covert racism, the racist in bad faith convinces himself that white people are, according to nature, superior to black people. The racist believes that stereotypes of black inferiority are facts. This is the justification for the oppression of black people. In a racist society, the bad faith belief of white superiority is institutionalized as a societal norm. Sartre is wrong to believe that all human beings possess absolute freedom to choose. The racist who denies that black people face limited freedom is blaming the victim, and victim blaming is the worst form of racist bad faith. Taking responsibility for our actions and leading an authentic life is an alternative to the bad faith of racism...|$|R
