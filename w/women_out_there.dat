[...] A show spokesperson commented that the storyline would be [...] "handled sensitively" [...] and that it would not become [...] "a whodunnit". Some of the male residents came under suspicion and were forced to give DNA samples. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) briefly became the prime suspect, but DNA soon eliminated him from enquires.|$|E
2500|$|An on-line abuse panel (itself {{the subject}} of controversy) at the 2016 SXSW festival {{said that there was}} no {{technological}} {{solution to the problem of}} harassment given human nature; although policy changes have been made, the larger issue is more societal than platform-specific. Referring to the discussion at SXSW in a speech for Women's History Month, President of the United States Barack Obama said that [...] "We know that women gamers face harassment and stalking and threats of violence from other players. When they speak out about their experiences, they're attacked on Twitter and other social media outlets, even threatened in their homes." [...] Obama urged targets of harassment to speak out, praising the courage of those who had resisted online harassment. [...] "And what's brought these issues to light is that there are a lot of <b>women</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> especially young women, who are speaking out bravely about their experiences, even when they know they'll be attacked for it".|$|E
2500|$|In Kansas City Bomber Raquel Welch {{played a}} {{hardened}} derby star and single mother {{that tries to}} balance her desire for a happy personal life and her dreams of stardom. Life dubbed Welch the “hottest thing on wheels” for her role. The production of the film shut down for six weeks after Welch broke her wrist doing some of her own stunts. In the interim, she flew to Budapest and filmed a cameo in Bluebeard (1972) opposite Richard Burton. Although Kansas City Bomber was not considered a critical success, it vividly depicted gender relations in the early 1970s. In a 2012 interview with GQ, Welch reflected on the roller derby world depicted in the film: [...] "You have all those <b>women</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> but {{the men in the}} front office are really running it. Which I thought was a really nice metaphor for the way a lot of women felt about their lives at that time." ...|$|E

It was first announced on 18 May 2009 that actress Leslie Ash had been cast in the role, after a five-year break from acting due to complications arising from MSSA. Ash commented that the role was the first she had had to audition for since the age of nineteen, and although nervous: [...] "I am so pleased and happy they've given me this chance. They are very brave to have taken on a disabled actress. I can't wait to be back on set. It's the last piece of the jigsaw in my recovery. I'm finally back to where I was." [...] McHale commented: [...] "We're thrilled to have Leslie join us at Holby. We know she's going to be a terrific asset to the show and her character will bring another dimension to our already strong cast. Her stories are going to have our viewers guessing all the way." [...] Her first scenes were filmed in June 2009, for broadcast in October 2009. Asked how long she saw herself staying in Holby City, Ash replied: [...] "At the moment I’m really happy, so as long as they want me! I want it to go well so I can stay on.

It takes her eternity to realize her companion's true identity, even though the television keeps blaring out the truth. The duo try hard, but the romance never does light up the screen. Nor do the private lives of the mismatched couple throw up enticing moments that could hold the script together". Bollywood portal FilmiTadka wrote - [...] "Kucch Luv Jaisa starts off as a comedy movie, but takes a serious turn through performances of actors, for this film I would say great performers are thoroughly wasted, the script has various loopholes {{which could have been}} covered had the director invested some more time on script front, we at FilmiTadka give it 2 out of five stars." [...] Shubha Shetty-Saha of MidDay wrote in her review - [...] "While busy yawning through this two-hour plus movie, I kept wondering, which women are they talking about?

Is <b>there</b> a <b>woman</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who thinks she has found some purpose in life, only if she struts around in high heels?

Music historian Caroline Coon contends that before punk, women in rock music were virtually invisible; in contrast, in punk, she argues [...] "it would be possible to write the whole history of punk music without mentioning any male bands at all -- and I {{think a lot of people}} would find that very surprising."

Rebecca Barnard co-produced this album with Barney McAll, which deals with issues of loss and love. The track Everlasting deals with the death of her father, jazz musician, Len Barnard. Everlasting includes some mature pop songs infused with jazz, such as Born In A Shirt (a Russian metaphor for being born lucky). The tracks were all written by Barnard, except the track Seasong which is cover of a track by Robert Wyatt. The album was predominantly promoted by Barnard herself {{due to the lack of}} a promotional budget. Everlasting was made with the assistance of a VicARTS grant. Rebecca has said [...] "How incredible that we live in a society, where most of us are to be free to be. The government giving a 49-year-old woman money to write and record music. There are thousands of <b>women</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> deserving of this.

5000|$|In 1940, he was {{approached}} by Harcourt Brace {{to write a book}} on American theatre beyond Broadway. Funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, Houghton criss-crossed the U.S.A., visiting 70 stages. Children’s theatre, college campus theatre, outdoor history pageants, union workers’ theatre, summer stock, middle-American “nightclub” variety theatres, the “road” sites for touring Broadway hits, community theatres often more social than artistic: this montage was critiqued, applauded, reprimanded, and encouraged as evidence of theatrical aspirations more democratic than the commercial Broadway model. Enthused by these experiences, they heightened Houghton’s disappointment about the dearth of original plays by young Americans, and the failure of recognized American playwrights to ally themselves with regional theatres. In the resulting book, Advance From Broadway, Houghton asserted [...] "...my declaration of independence from the commercial theatre and a call for decentralization of our professional stage." [...] Houghton resonated to the parting advice of a [...] "living legend" [...] among theatre aficionados, Edward Sheldon, who had advised him: [...] "Seek out the people who put these things in motion. They’re what matter." [...] Many fine men and <b>women</b> were <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in America. [...] "It’s they I must remember." ...|$|R
