This stemmed from an incident involving the ambulance drivers' weapons during loading in Sydney.|$|E

25|$|In New Zealand, Anzac Day saw a {{surge in}} {{popularity}} immediately after World War II. However this was short-lived, and by the 1950s many New Zealanders had become antagonistic or indifferent towards the day.

Annoyance was particularly pronounced in 1953 and 1959, when Anzac Day fell on a Saturday. There was widespread public debate on the issue, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> calling for the public holiday to be moved to the nearest Sunday or abolished altogether. In 1966 a new Anzac Day Act was passed, allowing sport and entertainment in the afternoon.|$|E

25|$|Altered {{auditory}} feedback, so {{that people}} who stutter hear their voice differently, {{has been used for}} over 50 years in the treatment of stuttering. Altered auditory feedback effect can be produced by speaking in chorus with another person, by blocking out the person who stutters' voice while talking (masking), by delaying slightly the voice of the person who stutters (delayed auditory feedback) or by altering the frequency of the feedback (frequency altered feedback). Studies of these techniques have had mixed results, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> who stutter showing substantial reductions in stuttering, while others improved only slightly or not at all. In a 2006 review of the efficacy of stuttering treatments, none of the studies on altered auditory feedback met the criteria for experimental quality, such as the presence of control groups.|$|E
