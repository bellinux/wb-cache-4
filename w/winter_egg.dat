50|$|Anopheles walkeri has a {{multivoltine}} life cycle. It {{produces a}} hardy <b>winter</b> <b>egg</b> which differs morphologically {{from the more}} vulnerable summer eggs by having enlarged floats on the dorsal side. By overwintering in egg form, this species is able to mature through one full larval generation before hibernating adults of other species are able to become active. The multivoltine life cycle means this species is active during both the swampy, open water conditions of early spring, as well as {{later in the year}} after the swampland has become thickened with plant growth. It takes about 10 days to mature through the larval stages and pupate, dependent on temperature and water conditions. Adults will typically mate within a few hours of emergence from their pupated form. The females then begin to seek out a blood meal to provide necessary protein to facilitate egg development. The female will then rest while the eggs develop. Once mature, the eggs are oviposited and the female begins the process all over again, feeding and laying for the 40 days or so that it lives for.|$|E

50|$|The sexual form {{begins with}} {{male and female}} eggs laid on the {{underside}} of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one <b>winter</b> <b>egg</b> in the bark of the vine's trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs parthenogenetically in a leaf gall that she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that stops it from healing. This poison eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces by laying eggs for up to seven more generations (which also can reproduce parthenogenetically) each summer. These offspring spread to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge next spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form, else they perform the same role without wings. These nymphs start the cycle again by either staying on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same.|$|E

40|$|Oviposition site {{selection}} in insects {{is essential in}} terms of low egg mortality, high offspring survival and therefore a high reproductive output. Although oviposition height could be a crucial factor for the fitness of overwintering eggs, it has rarely been investigated. In this study the oviposition height of a polyphagous leaf beetle, Galeruca tanaceti Linnaeus in different habitats and {{at different times of}} the season was examined and its effect on egg clutch mortality was recorded. The leaf beetle occurs as an occasional pest on several agricultural plants. It deposits its eggs within herbaceous vegetation in autumn. Eggs are exposed to numerous biotic and abiotic mortality factors summarized as egg parasitism and winter mortality. Oviposition height of the leaf beetle was not uniform, but changed significantly with the structure of the habitat and during the season. Mean oviposition height per site (70. 2 ± 4. 9 cm) was significantly higher than mean vegetation height (28. 4 ± 2. 4 cm). Height of plants with egg clutches attached and oviposition height were significantly positively correlated. The results suggest that females try to oviposit as high as possible in the vegetation and on the plants selected. In accordance with this, the probability of egg parasitism and of <b>winter</b> <b>egg</b> clutch mortality significantly declined with increasing oviposition height. A preference of G. tanaceti for oviposition sites high up in the vegetation might therefore have evolved due to selection pressures by parasitoids and winter mortality...|$|E

40|$|The brown shrimp C. crangon {{supports}} a large commercial fishery in British, Belgian, Dutch, German and Danish waters. It produces egos {{throughout the year}} with two seasonal peaks in summer and winter, respectively. Uncertainty exists {{with regard to the}} relative importance of the two egg production seasons for the mass invasion of juvenile recruits of 10 - 20 mm length in May/June, which is the dominant seasonal signal in the German and Dutch Wadden Sea, and which is presumed to grow into the exploitable stock by the autumn, causing the typical rise of commercial catches at that time of the year. A simulation model was developed that predicts the daily abundance of juvenile recruits attaining a given length, typically in the range of 10 - 20 mm. The model uses: (i) experimental data on the development times of eggs and larvae and the growth rates of juveniles; (ii) field data on the seasonal temperature cycle in different years (1986, 1992 and 1993 or mean conditions) and areas (German and Dutch Wadden Sea) of the North Sea; and (iii) a calculated index of the relative seasonal egg production intensity of adult C. crangon. Predictions of the simulations are compared with field observations on the seasonal occurrence of juvenile recruits in the German and Dutch Wadden Sea. Using temperature data from German waters, in the simulations peak recruitment was predicted to occur 1 - 2 months later than that observed in the field. However, if seasonal temperature data from Dutch waters were used, the predicted time of the first mass occurrence of recruits matched the field observations more closely. Simulations revealed that the first mass invasion of juveniles originates almost entirely from the <b>winter</b> <b>egg</b> production.

40|$|AbstractA {{population}} of Theodoxus fluviatilis L in the littoral zone of Lake Esrom was investigated from November 1977 to February 1979. The population was sampled every {{month in the}} winter period and twice {{during the rest of}} the year. Biomass was estimated as ash-free dry weight (AFDW) of the organic matter both of the soft parts of the animal and the shell itself. The relation between AFDW (c) and shell length (l) was logc= 2. 9509 ×log (l) − 1. 7120. The population comprised more than 1 year-class, which could be separated by shell length, by a narrow band on the shells and the growth of algae on the shell. The life cycle lasted 212 - 3 years. The oldest animals had a shell length of 7. 0 – 7. 5 mm. A few individuals who were estimated to be 312 years had a shell length up to 8. 6 mm. Population density varied between 575 and 2115 individualsm− 2 on the stony substratum. The average was 1160 individualsm− 2. Mortality was low during the summer period. In winter many animals died due to the effect of ice and stormy weather on the stony substratum. Growth of the animals was estimated from the shell length. Maximum growth was observed from May to August with no growth during the <b>winter.</b> <b>Egg</b> capsules were found on the stones all year round. New capsules were found from late May to the middle of November. Most freshly laid capsules were observed in May–June and August–September. Capsules from the late summer hatched in spring and capsules laid in the spring hatched in August–September. The average annual net production for the whole population was estimated by three methods. The Allen curve method gave 1. 895 AFDWm− 2, the growth-increment method gave 1. 784 mgAFDWm− 2 and the Hynes method 2. 284 mgAFDWm− 2. Corresponding estimated P/B ratios were 1. 29, 1. 30 and 1. 57. Annual net-production of the four investigated year-classes was 16 mgAFDWm− 2 year− 1 for 1975, 224 mgAFDWm− 2 year− 1 for 1976, 1. 258 mgAFDWm− 2 year− 1 for 1977 and 287 mgAFDWm− 2 year− 1 for 1978. P/B ratios for the three oldest year-classes were, respectively, 0. 32, 0. 50 and 1. 67. A comparison with other investigations on gastropod life cycles, reproduction and P/B ratios is made and differences discussed.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aims of {{the present}} study are the {{analyses}} of zooplankton communities in the Bellingshausen Sea during the transition from the summer to the winter state. To characterize the "autumn state" our research focussed on the following issues: horizontal and vertical distribution, population structure, maturity of gonads, reproduction, gut content, feeding activity (natural phyto-plankton suspension, ice algae), as well as the significance of zooplankton for the particle flux with special emphasis on calanoid copepods and metamorphed larvae of benthic animals. Work at seaThe major gear employed for the distributional studies of mesozooplankton was the multiple opening and closing net equipped with five nets of 55 µm each. Stratified vertical hauls on the shelf and slope stations covered the entire water column between the surface and maximal 700 m, while at oceanic stations, the net was deployed down to 1000 m. The depth ranges were defined according to the temperature profiles at the respective station. Sampling was carried out in the high Antarctic Bellingshausen sea on a transect off Adelaide island towards the continental slope of the Antarctic Peninsula. Additional sampling was carried out in the sea-ice zone in the southern Bellingshausen sea. Altogether, 24 hauls were carried out resulting in a rich set of more than 120 samples. The net samples were preserved in 4 % buffered formalin, at some stations in 100 % ethanol for molecular genetic purposes. In order to study interactions between the pelagic and the benthos, we deployed the multiple opening and closing net, the mulibox corer (MUC) and the box corer (GKG) at four so-called process stations, and ran additionally feeding and defecation experiments. The MUC allows the simultaneous sampling of up to 12 cores, including the above benthic surface water column. Both the upper 5 cm sediment obtained with each core and the above water column were deep frozen (- 80 °C and 30 °C respectively); the water sample was sieved through 55 µm mesh size before. Where possible, the study of the benthos was complemented by sampling the benthic surface water layer using an epibenthic sledge (EBS) pulling two nets of 80 µm and 300 µm above the seafloor for 10 minutes. The EBS allows the study of demersally drifting larvae close to settlement. For the experimental, biochemical and histological work, live specimens were caught by means of a Bongo net (100 and 335 µm mesh size) over the entire water column. Feeding and defecation experiments were carried out at the process stations with the dominant zooplankton species (euphausiid larvae and the copepods Metridia gerlachei and Calanoides acutus). All experiments were run at 0 °C in a cooled laboratory container in dim light. The food offered was the natural phytoplankton suspension from the rosette samples of the upper 50 m and with ice algae from melted ice cores. The concentrations of chlorophyll a were determined {{at the beginning and end}} of the experiments and were measured on board. Additionally, subsamples for microscopic counting were also taken to obtain information on preferential feeding on different size classes. The respective species and size composition will be determined on these preserved samples in the laboratory in Bremerhaven. At a total of 18 stations egg production experiments were conducted with Metridia gerlachi. For each experiment, 36 females were incubated singly in cell wells (volume: 10 ml filtered seawater) for 24 h at 0 °C and checked for eggs every 8 hours. Other species such as Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas were only rarely found, and thus only a few females were incubated. In addition to the experiments, female Rhincalanus gigas, Calanoides acutus, Paraeuchaeta antarctica, Metridia gerlachei and few Ctenocalanus citer were preserved for histological analysis. Meroplanktonic larvae, mainly echinoderm and polychaete larvae, were deep frozen (- 80 °C) for further lipid and stomach content analyses in the laboratory. Preliminary ResultsIn general, we found low zooplankton abundances. Plankton communities were dominated at most stations by euphausiid larvae, by the large calanoid copepod Metridia gerlachei and by numerous small cyclopoid and calanoid copepod species. A thorough investigation of the samples will elucidate the seasonal development of the zooplankton community. These data will be discussed with respect to the life strategies of the species and relationships to hydrography and primary production. Up to this moment only some preliminary observations on the occurrence of invertebrate larvae can be presented. On the basis of preliminary observations of subsamples obtained from bongo net samples (mainly 100 + 300 µm mesh size), phoronid and polychaete larvae (mainly nereids and spionids) seemed to be by far most abundant at all stations. This might change with the analyses of the samples from the multinet with smaller mesh size (55 µm). Echinoderms were also found at several stations, represented by asteroid brachiolaria and ophiopluteus in the water column. For this group, it seemed likely that larvae were more abundant at stations situated close to the continental slope off Adelaide Island, but has yet to be proven. Molluscs were represented as veligers in the water column, whereas bivalves have as of yet only been found as settled juveniles in one multicorer sample already analysed. As representative of a rare taxonomic group with a low diversity in the Antarctic, priapulid larvae have been found in several samples on the station transect off Adelaide Island. Generally, it can be concluded that invertebrate reproduction in the Antarctic takes also place in autumn, and that the occurrence of pelagic larval development of benthic invertebrates in Antarctic autumn can no longer be questionable!All copepod species studied were actively swimming. However, first results of the experimental work show low feeding rates, probably indicating the onset of a decreasing metabolic rates towards the <b>winter.</b> <b>Egg</b> production of Metridia gerlachei was extremely low at all stations. Only a maximum of 2 out of the 36 females spawned within the 24 hours at rates between 4 and 35 eggs per female and day. Thus, mean population egg production rate was less than one egg f- 1 d- 1. This agrees with the overall low state of gonad development in M. gerlachii as revealed of a first check of the gonad morphology. The gonads of Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas also seemed to be also in a very reduced stage, and consequently egg production was always zero. Feeding experiments with about 200 Metridia gerlachii females and highly concentrated ice algae as food showed that although the females were feeding, the gonads remained immature. From macroscopic observation, no difference was dected between starving and feeding females. This, however, has to be confirmed by histological investigation...|$|E

Se estudia el ciclo partenogenético y se presentan hembras sexuales de esclerotización procuticular. Se estudia la aparición de machos y la formación de "efipios primitivos" con huevos latentes.   Se presenta adicionalmente un ciclo lateral con hembras y machos de esclerotización hipodérmica, Las hembras de este ciclo producen al {{principio}} huevos partenogenéticos pero cambian después a la formación de huevos latentes. The {{present study}} about Cyclestheria hislopi (Baird, 1859) reports this form for Colombia {{and contributes to}} the knowledge of its natural history with emphasis in the life cycles. The study deals with the parthenogenetic cycle and presents sexual females characterized by procuticular sclerotisation, the apparition of males {{and the formation of}} "primitive ephippium" with <b>winter</b> <b>eggs.</b> Adicionally an incomplete lateral cycle is described with females and males characterized by hypoderrnical sclerotisation. The females of this cycle first may produce parthenogenetic eggs but later will change to form <b>winter</b> <b>eggs.</b> Die vorliegende Studie ueber Cyclestheria hislopi (Baird, 1859) weist die Art fuer Kolumbien nach und traegt zur Kenntnis ihrer Naturgeschichte bei, wobei der Schwerpunkt auf die Lebenszyklen gelegt wird. Es wird der parthenogenetische Zyklus beschrieben und es werden sexuelle Weibchen mit prokutikulaerer Sklerotisierung vorgestellt sowie ueber das Auftreten von Maennchen und die Bildung von "Primitivephippien" mit Wintereiern berichtet. Es wird ausserdem ein unvollstaendiger Seitenzyklus erwaehnt mit Weibchen und Maennchen, die Hypoderrnissklerotisierung aufweisen. Die Weibchen dieses Zyklus koennen mit der Bildung schlupffaehiger parthenogenetischer Eier beginnen, gehen dann aber zur Bildung von Dauereiern ueber. </p...|$|R
