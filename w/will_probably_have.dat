5|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{came to an}} {{end when}} the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly shrunk to a white dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The long-term prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of stars is very high. In a billion years or so, the triple <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. If this happens, PSR B1620-26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet.|$|E
5|$|Languages evolve and diversify over time, and {{the history}} of their {{evolution}} can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European family is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as English, Russian and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin, Bodo and the other Chinese languages, and Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, and Zulu, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken mostly in Southern India include Tamil and Telugu. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> become extinct by the year 2100.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{from the}} {{impression}} that even thus the comic element needed strengthening, or from the very natural desire to provide a good part for Mr. Denny, the author has introduced, in the M'Crankie, a figure which, though wholly unnecessary {{to the development of}} the plot, and in his surprising mixture of Scottish characteristics scarcely credible in any period, <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> as much to say to the success of the new piece as any of the characters. It is true that the absurdities of the part would be more acceptable in one of the frankly extravagant inventions of the older librettist than in a more professedly historical, and one which presents in all other respects, faithful pictures of the place and period chosen.|$|E

500|$|A {{controversial}} {{element of}} the CCE's plans was {{the extension of the}} railway to Golders Green. The route of the tube tunnels took the line under Hampstead Heath and strong opposition was raised, concerned about the effect that the tunnels would have on the ecology of the Heath. The Hampstead Heath Protection Society claimed that the tunnels would drain the sub-soil of water and the vibration of passing trains would damage trees. Taking its lead from the Society's objections, The Times published an alarmist article on 25 December 1900 claiming that [...] "a great tube laid under the heath will, of course, act as a drain; and it is quite likely that the grass and gorse and trees on the Heath will suffer from the loss of moisture... Moreover, it seems to be established beyond question that the trains passing along these deep-laid tubes shake the earth to its surface, and the constant jar and quiver <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> a serious effect upon the trees by loosening their roots." ...|$|E

[...] By contrast, Henry Adaso of About.com coined the collaboration of Jay Z and Knowles on [...] "Hollywood" [...] as the worst one on the entire album. Louis Pattison of New Musical Express considered Knowles voice as [...] "commanding" [...] on the song. Azeem Ahmad of musicOMH wrote: [...] "Despite the poignancy of the imagery evoked, [...] {{a little bit too}} contrived, clichéd and poppy.

2500|$|Wyndham's {{performance}} was praised, {{and the play}} must have generated considerable interest: [...] On 24 December, the drama critic of The Illustrated London News had not yet seen the play, but had heard that the play was [...] "brilliantly successful, and <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> a very long run; {{so there will be}} plenty of time to criticise it at leisure after the feverish pantomimic Boxing-Night week.

2500|$|Instead, {{electrons}} are dislodged {{only by the}} impingement of photons {{when those}} photons reach or exceed a threshold frequency (energy). Below that threshold, no electrons are emitted from the material regardless of the light intensity or {{the length of time}} of exposure to the light (rarely, an electron will escape by absorbing two or more quanta. However, this is extremely rare because by the time it absorbs enough quanta to escape, the electron <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> emitted the rest of the quanta.). To make sense of the fact that light can eject electrons even if its intensity is low, Albert Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but rather a collection of discrete wave packets (photons), each with energy hν. This shed light on Max Planck's previous discovery of the Planck relation (...) linking energy (E) and frequency (ν) as arising from quantization of energy. The factor h is known as the Planck constant.|$|E
2500|$|However, both Benko and Webb {{advocate}} what Webb {{calls the}} [...] "barrage technique": analyze a forced sequence of moves, then play them quickly. Webb explains, [...] "For example, {{if you have}} an obvious exchange of pieces available, don't play it immediately, but first decide on your next move, and then play them both at once. ... The aim is to catch your opponent with a move he hasn't considered. He <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> considered most sensible moves in the position on the board, but since he doesn't know what your first move is going to be, he can't prepare replies to your second or third moves. The effect of an unexpected second move bashed out instantaneously can be shattering, even if it isn't particularly good." [...] (Both Benko and Webb emphasize that a player who has a winning position should not play quickly in his opponent's time pressure. Likewise, GM Luděk Pachman remarks, [...] "It is best to continue with one's sound strategic plan, and if one has the better position, it is completely illogical to fish in the murky waters of the opponent's time trouble.") ...|$|E
