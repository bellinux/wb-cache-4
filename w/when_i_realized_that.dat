The conversation is mostly guided by Shatner, who prompts Nimoy to discuss issues he had regarding {{the legitimacy of}} consistently portraying an extraterrestrial, and other struggles with his acting career at the time. [...] "It took me a while," [...] Nimoy says, [...] "but I got rid of all that anger <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> I never {{had to worry about}} work ever since Star Trek went on the air."

He developed [...] "a major drinking habit, probably during the second or third year" [...] of the series, he says, and had his secretary bring him alcohol in paper cups at the end of each day of filming. Nimoy suggests that he became dependent on alcohol because of the deterioration of his marriage to Sandra Zober, his first wife. He says that, since divorcing Zober in 1987 and marrying actress Susan Bay in 1988, he has been a teetotaler.|$|E

So, when the MiGs broke to the left, and the engagement began. I chose one of the MiGs and followed him with my radar. I don't think that we ever exceeded 4G's during the whole engagement.

The shoot, which took twelve hours, was [...] "both physically and mentally tough" [...] for Lovato; she would [...] "break down and cry" [...] between takes because of the song being so personal to her. On set, Lovato and Pellington were accompanied by the hair and make-up artists and Lovato's management. Due to the lack of people involved, Lovato felt that it was [...] "pretty easy to get to that emotional place" [...] that was needed for the song. Lovato also wanted to give the video an [...] "emotionally raw feel", stating, [...] "That video was an emotional release for me, like therapy... I kept crying, I was so emotionally invested...That's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized,</b> <b>that's</b> what music videos are all about."

Yes, it is in times such as this, when the magnitude of the grace lavished upon one’s life by the Almighty God becomes more vivid. Like David in Psalm 124 (here I am referring to the Biblical David and not the Director of our School, Prof Modise) I am persuaded to say: “If the Lord had not been on my side when the storms of life raged against me, when poverty sought to define who I am and who I will become, I would have been swallowed alive. But praise be to the Lord who has not allowed lack to define my destiny. Yes, I have escaped like a bird out of the fowler’s snare; the snare has been broken, and I have escaped”.

After a few moments more of the groaning of the winch and clanking of the chain there was a sharp sound of stone meeting stone; then there was silence. I listened acutely, but could not hear near me the slightest sound. Even the cautious, restrained breathing around me, of which up to then I had been conscious, had ceased. Not knowing, in the helplessness of my ignorance, what I should do, I remained as I was, still and silent, for a time that seemed endless. At last, overcome by some emotion which I could not at the moment understand, I slowly sank to my knees and bowed my head. Covering my face with my hands, I tried to recall the prayers of my youth. It was not, I am certain, that fear in any form had come upon me, or that I hesitated or faltered in my intention. That much I know now; I knew it even then. It was, I believe, that the prolonged impressive gloom and mystery had at last touched me to the quick. The bending of the knees was but symbolical of the bowing of the spirit to a higher Power. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> had <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> much, <b>I</b> felt more content than I had done since I had entered the church, and with the renewed consciousness of courage, took my hands from my face, and lifted again my bowed head.|$|R
