At {{the time it was}} rapidly ramping up its sports sponsorship (it also owned the Quebec Nordiques before they moved from the World Hockey Association to the NHL) and would become a huge benefactor to the CFL itself, inking television rights deals that would reach $11 million annually by 1984. Reports at the time suggest the league became spoiled by the partnership and that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> dried up in 1987, the transition was difficult. For the Argos, the Carling O'Keefe years were marked by their first modern-era Grey Cup in 1983.|$|E
25|$|The third {{economic}} downturn was the {{depression of the}} late 1830s to 1843, following the Panic of 1837, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> supply in the United States contracted by about 34 percent with prices falling by 33 percent. The magnitude of this contraction is matched only by the Great Depression. A fundamental cause of the Panic of 1837 was depletion of Mexican silver mines. Despite the deflation and depression, GDP rose 16 percent from 1839 to 1843, partly because of rapid population growth.|$|E
25|$|Round-tripping: Here, {{money is}} {{deposited}} {{in a controlled}} foreign corporation offshore, preferably in a tax haven where minimal records are kept, and then shipped back as a foreign direct investment, exempt from taxation. A variant on this is to transfer money to a law firm or similar organization as funds on account of fees, then to cancel the retainer and, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> is remitted, represent the sums received from the lawyers as a legacy under a will or proceeds of litigation.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the war in July 1921, the IRA was {{hard-pressed by}} the {{deployment}} of more British troops into the most active areas and a chronic shortage of arms and ammunition. It has been estimated that the IRA had only about 3,000 rifles (mostly captured from the British) during the war, with a larger number of shotguns and pistols. An ambitious plan to buy arms from Italy in 1921 collapsed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> did not reach the arms dealers. Towards {{the end of the}} war, some Thompson submachine guns were imported from the United States; however 450 of these were intercepted by the American authorities and the remainder only reached Ireland shortly before the Truce.|$|E

For a second time, Arthur is faced with a police investigation and with all the evidence stacked against him, he is soon arrested and ends the year behind bars.

25|$|Laidlaw {{and other}} {{directors}} fanned {{out through the}} townships speaking at taxpayer meetings in support of bonuses for the railways. His messianic style at these meetings often generated so much enthusiasm that motions were immediately approved to grant large sums {{in support of the}} lines. On the morrow the local politicians often had second and more sober thoughts and sought to control the process themselves, trying to dictate where and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> would be spent, and on what. Long drawn out campaigns ensued with businessmen and progressive farmers whose lots would be near the line advocating large unconditional grants, and those in more distant locations opposing the free bonuses of tax money. Generally the response of the settlers, anxious to expand opportunities for trade and travel, was generous. But, when strongly opposed, Laidlaw's combative and insulting responses could generate such opposition that townships delayed contributing money for years, or refused entirely.|$|E
25|$|She was {{the only}} {{daughter}} of Dr George Mitford, or Midford, who apparently trained as a medical doctor, and Mary Russell, a descendant of the aristocratic Russell family who grew up near Jane Austen and was an acquaintance of hers when young. At ten years old in 1797, young Mary Russell Mitford won her father a lottery ticket worth £20,000, but by the 1810s the small family suffered financial difficulties. In the 1800s and 1810s they lived in large properties in Reading and then Grazeley (in Sulhamstead Abbots parish), but, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was all gone after 1819, they lived on a small remnant of the doctor's lost fortune and the proceeds of his daughter's literary career. He {{is thought to have}} inspired Mary with the keen delight in incongruities, the lively sympathy, self-willed vigorous individuality, and tolerance which inspire so many of her sketches of character. She cared for her mother and father until their deaths and supported them and herself by proceeds from her writing.|$|E

500|$|Popes are {{empowered}} to grant plenary indulgences, which provide complete satisfaction for any remaining temporal punishment due to sins, {{and these were}} purchased on behalf of people {{believed to be in}} purgatory. This led to the popular saying, [...] "As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs". Theologians at the University of Paris had criticized this saying late in the fifteenth century. Earlier critics of indulgences included John Wycliffe, who denied that the pope had jurisdiction over purgatory. Jan Hus and his followers had advocated a more severe system of penance, in which indulgences were not available. Johannes von Wesel had also attacked indulgences late in the fifteenth century. Political rulers had an interest in controlling indulgences because local economies suffered <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> for indulgences left a given territory. Rulers often sought to receive a portion of the proceeds or prohibited indulgences altogether, as Duke George did in Luther's Electoral Saxony.|$|E
500|$|In 1913, Ricketts {{opened the}} glens and their waterfalls to the public, {{charging}} $1for parking. Although this fee was unpopular, it remained {{in place until}} the land became a state park. After Ricketts died in 1918, the Pennsylvania Game Commission bought [...] from his heirs, via the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company, between 1920 and 1924. This became most of Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 13, west of the park in Sullivan County. These sales left the Ricketts heirs with over [...] surrounding Ganoga Lake, Lake Jean and the glens area of the park. An area encompassing [...] was approved as a national park site in 1935, and the National Park Service operated a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at [...] "Ricketts Glynn" [...] (sic). The funding to create a National Park at Ricketts Glen was [...] "sidetracked" [...] in 1936 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was redirected to the Resettlement Administration for [...] "direct relief". Similar projects at French Creek, Raccoon Creek, Laurel Hill, Blue Knob, and Hickory Run were also defunded (all are now Pennsylvania state parks). The financial difficulties of the Great Depression and World War II brought {{an end to this}} plan for development.|$|E

I would never accuse the graphical interface of being stolen. I never made comments to the effect that I had credit (genius) taken from me... The lines I heard spoken were not things I would say but carried the right message, at least partly... I felt a lot of the real Jobs in the trailer, although a bit exaggerated." [...] Wozniak did not ask to see the final script because he did not [...] "think that would be appropriate... it is the creative work of the producer and writer and actors and director and others." [...] He also noted that the trailer's reference to Jobs' initial rejection of his daughter Lisa evoked an emotional response: [...] "It was hard on me, even being quiet, when Jobs refused to acknowledge his child <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> didn't matter, and I can almost cry remembering it." [...] In September 2015, after seeing a rough cut of the film, Wozniak stated that he felt like he [...] "was actually watching Steve Jobs and the others [...] not actors playing them, I give full credit to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin for getting it so right." [...] In an interview with San Francisco Chronicle on February 10, 2016, Wozniak claimed that the film's scenes between him and Jobs never occurred in reality. Wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team onstage, as was shown in the movie. However, he added that Jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards the group. When asked about the accuracy of the film's portrayal of Jobs, Wozniak replied: [...] "In real life, to real people, that's the way he could be, very sharp, (although) never quite as much as in the movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Britain {{borrowed}} everywhere {{it could}} and made heavy purchases of munitions and supplies in India during the war.

Britain's sterling balances around the world amounted to £3.4 billion in 1945; [...] India's share was £1.3 billion (equivalent to $US 74 billion in 2016 dollars.) In this way the Raj treasury accumulated very large sterling reserves of British pounds that was owed to it by the British treasury. However, Britain treated this as a long-term loan with no interest and no specified repayment date. Just <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> would be made available by London was an issue, for the British treasury was nearly empty by 1945. [...] India's balances totalled to Rs. 17.24billion in March 1946; of that sum Rs. 15.12billion [...] was split between India and Pakistan when they became independent in August 1947.

The situation was aggravated by the severe financial crisis that occurred between 1890 and 1891, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> sent from emigrants in Brazil decreased by 80% with the so-called crisis of encilhamento following the proclamation of the republic in Brazil two months previously, an event that was followed with apprehension by the monarchic government and with jubilation by the defenders of the republic in Portugal.
