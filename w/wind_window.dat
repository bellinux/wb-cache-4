5000|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>window</b> is the 120- to 180-degree {{arc of the}} sky {{downwind}} of {{the rider}} in which the kite can be flown. Roughly one fourth of a sphere's surface. If the rider is facing downwind on a flat surface, like the ocean, the <b>wind</b> <b>window</b> consists of roughly all the area the rider can see, from the rider's peripheral vision on one side, along the horizon to the other side, and then directly overhead {{back to the first}} side. If the rider somehow puts the kite out of the window—for example, by riding downwind very quickly and sending the kite directly overhead and behind—the kite will stall and frequently fall out of the sky.|$|E

50|$|Fixed bridle kites have a fixed {{angle of}} attack which is set by the bridle. Small {{adjustments}} may be possible by adjusting the bridle with the kite on the ground, however the {{angle of attack}} is not adjustable whilst the kite is airborne. A high angle of attack setting results in more power from the kite, but {{at the expense of}} speed and ability to fly close to the wind. A low angle of attack results in less power, but speed is increased and the kite can fly a lot closer {{to the edge of the}} <b>wind</b> <b>window.</b> Fixed bridle kites may be used with handles or a bar, with handles typically being preferable for activities such as kite jumping and kite buggying, and a bar being preferable for kite landboarding.|$|E
25|$|The first {{settlers}} of Woodford County occupied crude log cabins, {{with the}} cracks between the rough-hewed timber {{in the walls}} filled up with clay to help retain heat and block the <b>wind.</b> <b>Windows,</b> if they existed at all, were made of oiled papers, while doors and floors were constructed of rough boards split from trees and attached together with wooden pegs. Construction of the cabins was primitive, with the floor plan generally involving a single room heated with a fireplace.|$|R
50|$|To keep prices down, {{the car at}} launch {{was very}} basic with sliding windows, single {{windscreen}} wiper and no external boot lid. Access to the boot was by folding down the rear seat, which had the backrest divided in two. The 1954 De luxe got <b>wind</b> up <b>windows</b> and the Gold Star model of 1957 an opening boot lid. From mid-1955 all the Eights finally got <b>wind</b> up <b>windows.</b> At launch the car cost £481 including taxes on the home market.|$|R

40|$|Airborne {{wind energy}} {{is a new}} {{research}} field that aims to harvest winds at high altitudes. The pumping kite concept investigated at the Delft University of Technology is based on leading edge inflatable kites that divide a generation cycle into three phases: traction, retraction, and transition. This research project aims to optimise the trajectory flown by the kite to increase the cost-competitiveness of the system. Thus, the complete system was simulated, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted. The results {{show that there is}} an area in the <b>wind</b> <b>window</b> that maximises the power production of the cycle. This area is defined by the wind speed, the shape of the figure, and the reel in/out force. Based on the findings, an algorithm that seeks the optimal path during the flight was developed. In the case study, the algorithm led to a 100 % increase in cycle power and a 16 % increase in the average traction power. European Wind Energy Maste...|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, 1965 saw {{the release}} of the {{redesigned}} Australian Morris Mini Deluxe. The new model featured redesigned doors with conventional interior handles and <b>wind</b> up <b>windows</b> (with quarter vents), hydrolastic suspension, key operated starter, a remote gearshift mechanism (like the Cooper) and the engine was upgraded to the 998 cc version. Production of the Australian Morris Mini Deluxe continued until 1969 when it was replaced with another Australian only model, the Mini K the [...] "K" [...] stands for Kangaroo. The K received the more powerful 1098 cc engine (from the Morris 1100) as well as 4-speed synchromesh transmission and upgraded instruments. It was claimed that the Mini K was produced with 80% local content. Both of the Australia only round-nosed minis were based on the UK Mark I Mini with the production changes from the Mark II Mini never being used in Australia. Production of the round-nosed mini in Australia halted in 1970 with {{the release of}} the new Mini Clubman. The Australian Mini Clubman utilised the same locally designed <b>wind</b> up <b>windows</b> and exterior door hinges as the Morris Mini Deluxe.

40|$|International audienceA {{performance}} prediction program {{dedicated to}} merchant ships {{was developed to}} assess fuel saving abilities of a kite. The solving of the parameterization presented led to kite velocities and tethers tensions prediction continuously along a flight path within the <b>wind</b> <b>window,</b> including especially wind gradient and ship velocity. Both static and dynamic flight cases were considered regarding optimization strategy for kite tow efficiency. For dynamic flight case azimuth, elevation and orientation of the trajectory are continuously optimized in the present algorithm. Magnitude orders of towing forces induced by the kite were compared to those obtained in the literature. Especially in upwind conditions, which are the most frequent point of sail for fast vessels, results are dramatically improved. Finally, using a 320 m 2 kite on a 50, 000 dwt tanker, the fuel saving predicted is about 10 % for a wind velocity of 9. 77 m s− 1 (Beaufort 5) and reaches more than 50 % for a wind velocity of 15. 68 m s− 1 (Beaufort 7) ...|$|E
40|$|Designs for {{low-energy}} buildings increasingly incorporate operable {{windows for}} {{the benefits of}} personal control, environmental quality, and architectural value. In practice, however, there are unresolved debates about whether operable windows can be integrated with mechanical systems to optimize both comfort and energy efficiency. Signals that inform occupants about when to open and close their windows (usually red/green lights) have become a popular solution. These systems essentially propose a compromise between manual and automatic control philosophies, asserting that information from the building can influence behavior while retaining the fundamental benefit of personal control. Results from interviews, site visits and surveys of 16 U. S. case studies show mixed results. Signals {{play a role in}} window use behavior for only a minority of occupants under normative management/education practices. However, greater participation is possible given efforts to communicate the tangible benefits of the devices. Office type (shared or private), visibility of the signals from workstations, reliability of the signal modes, and a range of personal circumstances (noise, <b>wind,</b> <b>window</b> hardware) also influence participation. If conceived as reinforcement to an internal policy rather than as an element of the building controls, this technology holds promise {{for a wide range of}} building and user types, and the programming can be flexible and adaptable as circumstances change in our rapidly changing built environment...|$|E

5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Audax Hillman Minx in 1956, initially Rootes only produced the 4 door sedan. In 1957, Rootes UK introduced an estate version of the Audax Minx. With four doors, <b>winding</b> <b>windows</b> for the rear seat passengers, and the two-piece tailgate hinged at the top and bottom, this was much more “sedan like” than the Mark Hillman Minx estates had been. Isuzu chose not to build the Rootes estate, but to introduce its own. Known as the Hillman Express, the Isuzu estate was quite different from the Rootes UK version. It had a different roofline (more like the Mk Estate cars), two doors, sliding rear passenger windows, horizontal bars on the load-area side-windows, and a single-piece, side-opening tailgate [...] The front seat was also split oddly - not down the middle, but one third of the way across, on the driver’s side. Factory brochures show clearly that Isuzu marketed the Express as a multi-purpose vehicle: delivery van during the week, family estate at the weekend.|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. High {{frequency}} magnetic components have {{financial and}} physical advantages compared to low frequency magnetic components. Although high frequency magnetic components {{have been used}} for quite some time, the design and analysis of these components remain complicated. This can be ascribed to the effect of eddy currents and thermal constraints due to the smaller cooling area of such components. Planar magnetic components have long been preferred due to the higher manufacturing output, better quality control and the favorable flat shape of the component. Many studies have been conducted on planar magnetic components with respect to the energy storage capacity, air gap shape and placement, low permeability materials, to replace the air gaps, the placing of the conductors in the <b>winding</b> <b>window,</b> etc. The designs that are commonly used for planar magnetic components today, {{are the ones that are}} proven to work and not necessarily the ones that are optimal. In this study a thermal model is presented to ease the design of DC inductors. A lot of emphasis is placed on heat extraction resulting from losses in the embedded conductors through the core. This is an unconventional way to extract heat from the planar structure and leads to a new approach towards design planar inductor design...|$|R
