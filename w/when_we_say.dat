[...] A prisoner interviewed by Moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse: [...] "'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved" [...] by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realized he may never get his life in order, compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison.

Lightnings flash. The snow heaps against the door. It grows bitterly cold. What shall he do? He can't stay there and freeze to death. Let me illustrate. Two darkies, walking down Broadway, saw a quarter of a dollar on the sidewalk. One of the colored gentlemen said to his companion, 'Sambo, don't you freeze to dat quarter. I seed it first.'

Departing from a categorial analysis of the question, we introduce the new notion of equipollence between logical systems. We use several examples to illustrate our proposal and to support its comparison to other proposals in the literature, namely homeomorphisms [7], and translational equivalence (or synonymity) [6]...|$|R
