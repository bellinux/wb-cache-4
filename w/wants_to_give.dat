500|$|One of {{the main}} {{concepts}} of Sora's character in the series is that, according to Nomura, he is a normal boy instead of a supernatural being, {{even though he is}} deeply connected with other characters from the series. With Sora, Nomura <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> players the message that even though they are not [...] "important people", they have the opportunity to accomplish great things. This was emphasized in Birth by Sleeps secret ending, which Nomura hoped players would find because it showed Sora's potential to influence everyone's lives. In early versions of development of Birth by Sleep, Nomura thought that Ventus would actually be Sora before being reborn, but due to negative feedback from overseas, that plot line was discarded. Nomura has stated that Sora's name can be interpreted as [...] "sky", since the Japanese word [...] means sky. This name was also chosen to symbolize Sora's role and his personality, as well as his close relationship with Riku and Kairi, making their three names together [...] "sky, land, and sea." [...] He was also described by Nomura as having an outgoing personality, which allows him to make friends throughout the series. Of all of the characters Nomura has designed, Sora is his favorite, calling him [...] "special" [...] after having worked to develop the character over many games.|$|E

She shows that she feels sorry for the man. He in turn appreciates her sympathy. The train is wrecked, and the sheriff, who is handcuffed to Bill, is killed. Bill takes the key of the handcuffs from the pocket of the dead man, frees himself, and is about to escape, when he notices that the little girl, abandoned by her nurse, is lying unconscious in the car, which is now on fire. The convict risks his life to save the child, and carries her out in his arms. He takes her to her nurse and is recognized by a policeman and taken in custody, his chance for freedom lost. The child, who is the daughter of the governor, although Bill does not know it, is restored to her parent.
