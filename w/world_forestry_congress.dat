25|$|The <b>World</b> <b>Forestry</b> <b>Congresses</b> are an {{international}} effort aimed at influencing and stimulating reflection {{and analysis of}} the different factors, conditions, techniques, methodologies as well as professional or personal positions, thinking and ideas concerning global silviculture science. As such, each WFC has contributed to create awareness, to review and/or to formulate new approaches to technical, scientific or policy actions within the forestry sector.|$|R

25|$|Every 6 {{years since}} 1926, FAO {{and a host}} member state hold the <b>World</b> <b>Forestry</b> <b>Congress.</b> It is a forum for the sharing of {{knowledge}} and experience regarding the conservation, management {{and use of the}} world's forests, and covers such issues as international dialogue, socio-economic and institutional aspects, and forest policies.|$|E
25|$|The 2nd <b>World</b> <b>Forestry</b> <b>Congress</b> was convened at Budapest in 1936. These two {{conferences}} {{have been}} milestones {{in the development}} of international co-operation in forestry. The impetus which they gave has become evident in the ever-growing common effort for a solution of the many problems affecting forestry and forest products. The Third Congress was planned for 1940 with the Government of Finland as host. The war, however, intervened and the Congress had to be postponed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>World</b> <b>Forestry</b> <b>Congress</b> (WFC) is {{the largest}} and most {{significant}} gathering of the world's forestry sector and it has been held every six years since 1926 {{under the auspices of the}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), organized by the government of the host country. It is a forum for the sharing of knowledge and experience regarding the conservation, management and use of the world's forests, and covers such issues as international dialogue, socio-economic and institutional aspects, and forest policies.|$|E

500|$|Brown was {{influenced}} by the Progressive movement as applied to business. He paid his workers above the prevailing wage, instituted safety programs, hired a doctor to care for loggers in the camps, and, prior to [...] modern workers' compensation laws, had the company pay for hospitalization of injured workers. [...] He also attempted to improve camp conditions for the workers by banning card games and requiring the loggers to take showers, but those particular reform efforts [...] "were not well received." [...] The Brown family took considerable interest in the city of Berlin. Various family members started a public kindergarten, built a community club with a gym, swimming pool, and bowling alley, provided soup to the sick, and gave Christmas presents to local children. [...] Brown himself helped found a number of civic and business self-help organizations including the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, established in 1901; the New Hampshire Timberlands Owners Association, a fire-protection group established in 1910; and similar fire-protection groups in Maine and Vermont. He set up a series of effective forest-fire lookout towers, possibly the first in the nation, and by 1917 had helped establish a forest-fire insurance company. [...] In 1909, after helping draft the legislation creating New Hampshire's State Forestry Department, [...] he {{became a member of the}} New Hampshire Forestry Commission; and its chair from 1910 until 1952, playing a significant role in shaping the forestry practices and laws of the state. Brown also served on the boards of several industry groups, including the American Forestry Association, Society of American Foresters, Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, and the Forest Research Council. He represented the U.S. at the first <b>World</b> <b>Forestry</b> <b>Congress</b> held in Rome in 1926.|$|E

In short, we run the very real risk of undermining a resource base that is fundamental to the future development of the Earth. This must {{not be allowed to}} occur. Our responsibility extends not only to all people now living on the planet, but also to future generations. Therefore, I cannot but applaud the selection of [...] "Forests, a heritage for the future" [...] as the theme for the Tenth <b>World</b> <b>Forestry</b> <b>Congress.</b> As co-organizer of the Congress, along with the Government of France, FAO has committed substantial human and financial resources to ensuring that this will be the most widely followed Congress to date. The fruits of this effort are already evident; the number of voluntary papers was forecast as approximately 300 but more than 700 have been received. In the same vein, I would also wish to note that FAO has chosen [...] "Trees for life" [...] as the theme for World Food Day, 16 October 1991." ...|$|E

50|$|Ellen Call Long was {{an early}} member of the Southern <b>Forestry</b> <b>Congress,</b> {{which was founded in}} DeFuniak Springs, Florida, at the annual Chautauqua winter conference in 1884. It was {{as a result of this}} group’s efforts that Arbor Day first gained {{recognition}} in states throughout the south, including Florida. Long was appointed as Secretary of the group, and was among the delegates present when they joined the American <b>Forestry</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1888. At the meeting of the American <b>Forestry</b> <b>Congress</b> held in Atlanta in 1888, she presented a paper titled “Notes of Some of the Forest Features of Florida,” which was later published in the Proceedings. Describing fires as absolutely essential for the growth of longleaf pine forests in the south, it was one of the earliest published pieces to advocate for controlled burning at a time when the accepted forestry standards called for total fire suppression. She went on the further draw the connection between the suppression of fire and the development of hardwood hammocks in lands that were once longleaf pine forests. Although the published piece received little attention at the time, it would be widely cited by early advocates of fire ecology such as Roland Harper and Herbert Stoddard as a seminal work in the field.|$|R
