25|$|When Liu Bei was {{appointed}} as the Chancellor (相) of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Dezhou, Shandong), Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were appointed as Majors of Separate Command (别部司马), each commanding detachments of soldiers under Liu. The {{three of them}} shared a brotherly-like relationship, {{to the point of}} sharing the same room. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu also stood guard beside Liu Bei <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at meetings. They followed him on his exploits and protected him from danger.|$|E
25|$|Zhang Fei {{was from}} Zhuo Commandery (涿郡), {{which is in}} present-day Zhuozhou, Hebei. In the 180s, {{towards the end of}} the Han dynasty, he and Guan Yu became Liu Bei's followers. As Guan Yu was many years older than Zhang Fei, Zhang {{regarded}} him as an elder brother. When Liu Bei was later appointed as the Chancellor (相) of Pingyuan (平原; present-day Pingyuan County, Dezhou, Shandong) by the Han imperial court, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu served as Majors of Separate Command (別部司馬) under him. The three of them shared a brotherly-like relationship, to the point of sharing the same room. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu also stood guard beside Liu Bei <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at meetings. They followed him on his exploits and protected him from danger.|$|E

6000|$|They all saw {{now that}} he had {{something}} to tell. 'I am going away,' <b>he</b> said <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b> 'I am going to enter on board a man-of-war, and perhaps it will be the Victory.' ...|$|R
500|$|At {{subsequent}} hearings, {{each side}} submitted replications (affidavits) with {{his version of}} the evidence. Ashford sought for the Court to rule that the evidence against Thornton was strong and that the defendant was thus ineligible to wage battle; Thornton sought the opposite. Much of the case was argued between 6 and 8 February 1818, but one of Ashford's counsel, Joseph Chitty, asked for and received more time so he could reply to the other side's arguments, and the matter was adjourned until 16 April. Chitty then responded but was so often interrupted in his argument by the judges that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> according to Sir John Hall in his book on the affair, [...] "it was clear to everyone in Court that his client had lost his case".|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{singing to}} his own [...] "necessarily limited, both rhythmically and melodically," [...] piano accompaniment, such as can be heard on the 1967 {{recording}} of [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone", for Guralnick are always special occasions, because [...] "it was always a measure of his engagement <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at the keyboard to play." [...] Describing his piano technique as [...] "staccato style," [...] Jorgensen finds that on [...] "Without Love" [...] from the 1969 sessions, [...] "his gospel-flavored treatment took it {{to a level of}} spirituality rarely matched in his career." [...] Presley also played the instrument on the [...] "impassioned version" [...] of the sessions' next song, [...] "I'll Hold You in My Heart," [...] of which Guralnick writes that [...] "there is something magical about the moment that only the most inspired singing can bring about, as Elvis loses himself in the music, words no longer lend themselves to literal translation, and singer and listener both are left emotionally wrung out by the time the song finally limps to an end." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Vindication" [...] {{were written by}} Rockenfield. Wilton has said: [...] "I'm sure he had some demons in his mind to avenge or vindicate <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to write that one." ...|$|E
50|$|Born in Brooklyn, New York in 1955, Kirkland was six <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at a piano keyboard. After {{years of}} Catholic schooling, Kirkland {{enrolled}} at the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied classical piano performance, classical theory and composition.|$|R
60|$|One day Monsieur Ducroz {{seemed to}} be in great pain. He had been {{scarcely}} able to drag himself up the many stairs to Philip's room: and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> arrived <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> heavily, his sallow face drawn, with beads of sweat on his forehead, trying to recover himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{come to my}} room," [...] said Sir Harry, gruffly, {{and led the way}} into his own sanctum. <b>When</b> there, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in his {{accustomed}} arm-chair without offering George a seat, but George soon found a seat for himself. [...] "And now what is it?" [...] said Sir Harry, with his blackest frown.|$|R
2500|$|On February 6, 2009, Rose {{gave his}} first {{interview}} {{in nine years}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> with Billboards Jonathan Cohen. Rose {{said that there was}} no chance that he would ever agree with a reunion with Slash: ...|$|E
2500|$|On 31 October {{the same}} year, Fox {{responded to the}} King's address to Parliament with [...] "one of his finest and most {{animated}} orations, and with severity to the answered person", so much so that, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> no member of the Government would attempt to reply.|$|E
2500|$|Defender Richard Dunne later {{spoke of}} how {{he was unaware of}} the extent of Henry's {{involvement}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> with him on the pitch {{at the end of the}} match and admitted the handball. Dunne properly viewed the incident for the first time on a computer in his team's dressing room. He also described how [...] "heartbreaking" [...] the whole experience was, his lack of interest in the draw or who France's opponents might be in the finals and how [...] "disappointing" [...] it would be when the tournament eventually took place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! {{a little}} water won't hurt 'em. I've been soaked myself more than once. If they can't take a joke let 'em go," [...] and Tom {{continued}} to stalk on until {{he came to a}} flat rock, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> suddenly <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to rest, at the same time putting both hands to his head.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> and Olly <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{to their}} frugal breakfast, he was uneasily {{conscious}} of several oddities of her dress, not before noticeable, {{and even some}} peculiarities of manner.|$|R
60|$|Toby {{had risen}} to his feet <b>when</b> <b>he</b> began to make his speech, {{and while he was}} {{speaking}} Mr. Stubbs had crawled over into his chair. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> finished <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again without looking behind him, and of course sat plump on the monkey. There was a loud outcry from Mr. Stubbs, a little frightened noise from Toby, an instant's scrambling, and then boy, monkey, and chair tumbled off the platform, landing on the ground in an indescribable mass, from which the monkey extricated himself more quickly than Toby could, and again took refuge {{on the top of the}} tent pole.|$|R
2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} the words [...] "he shall write {{a copy of}} this law in a book" [...] in [...] to teach that when he went to war, he was to take it with him; on returning, he was to bring it back; when he sat in judgment, it was to be with him; and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to eat, it was to be before him, to fulfill the words of [...] "and it shall be with him and he shall read in it all the days of his life." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> entered <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at {{a vacant}} table, and, having ordered a stoup of wine, looked round. The man had joined {{a knot of}} young fellows like himself, seated at a table. They were dissipated-looking blades, and were talking loudly and boisterously.|$|R
60|$|Before {{the servant}} {{could get to}} the priest's lodgings a visitor had applied there for admission, and had been {{immediately}} received by Father Rocco himself. This favored guest was a little man, very sprucely and neatly dressed, and oppressively polite in his manner. <b>He</b> bowed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> <b>he</b> bowed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> answered the usual inquiries about his health, and he bowed, for the third time, when Father Rocco asked what had brought him from Florence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eels {{are great}} favourites, and are tamed and fed till they attain an {{enormous}} size. Taoarii had several {{in different parts}} of the island. These pets were kept in large holes, two or three feet deep, partially filled with water. I have been several times with the young chief, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> has <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> by the side of the hole, and by giving a shrill sort of whistle, has brought out an enormous eel, which has moved about the surface of the water and eaten with confidence out of his master's hand." ...|$|R
60|$|Brooke {{did as he}} suggested, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> Devine {{passed a}} strip of paper across to him.|$|E
60|$|He {{went into}} the house and Mrs. Austin went after him. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at a writing table, she stood opposite.|$|E

60|$|They got {{the sail}} up somehow, though {{by the time}} they had {{finished}} the sloop's lee rail was in the sea, and then flung themselves upon the mainsail. They were breathless with the effort before they had tied two reefs in it, and Frank wondered at the change in their surroundings <b>when</b> at length <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in the well.|$|R
6000|$|Both {{men were}} {{conscious}} of the contrast, and M. Fourier did his very best to approach Mme. la Duchesse with a semblance of dignity, and to kiss her hand in something of the approved courtly manner. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> had finally <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> and mopped his streaming forehead, M. le Comte said with kindly condescension: ...|$|R
6000|$|Costello led {{him into}} the great rush-strewn hall, where were none of the comforts which had begun to grow common among the gentry, but a feudal gauntness and bareness, {{and pointed to the}} bench in the great chimney; and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> filled up a horn noggin {{and set it on the}} bench beside him, and set a great black jack of leather beside the noggin, and lit a torch that slanted out from a ring in the wall, his hands {{trembling}} the while; and then turned towards him and said: 'Will Dermott's daughter come to me, Duallach, son of Daly?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I like him," [...] said Bradley, {{leaning forward}} {{to absorb the}} speaker's torrent of impassioned utterance. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> the members applauded.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Calvert made no objections, {{though he}} noticed that she laid the {{envelope}} on a table across the room <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
60|$|But Daylight {{was bent}} on having his way, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{it was with}} her beside him and his arm around her.|$|E
60|$|Clavering turned away, with pulses {{throbbing}} furiously {{and rage}} in his heart, {{though he had}} known what the cost would be <b>when</b> <b>he</b> staked everything he hoped for on Larry's destruction; while his neighbours noticed a change in Torrance <b>when</b> <b>he</b> once more <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{at the head of}} the table. He seemed several years older, and his face was very grim.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the end of}} the week, when Gillingham {{had gone}} back to his school near Shaston, Phillotson, as was his custom, went to Alfredston market; ruminating again on Arabella's {{intelligence}} as he walked down the long hill which he had known before Jude knew it, though his history had not beaten so intensely upon its incline. Arrived in the town he bought his usual weekly local paper; and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in an inn to refresh himself for the five miles' walk back, he pulled the paper from his pocket and read awhile. The account of the [...] "strange suicide of a stone-mason's children" [...] met his eye.|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> left alone, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at a {{table and}} took his head into his hands. He had not spared himself of late and the marshal had been working all his aides-decamp {{particularly}} hard. The last three weeks of campaigning in horrible weather had affected his health. <b>When</b> over-tired <b>he</b> suffered from a stitch in his wounded side, and that uncomfortable sensation always depressed him. [...] "It's that brute's doing, too," [...] he thought bitterly.|$|R
