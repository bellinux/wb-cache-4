5|$|Production resumed in 1934, due {{to another}} congressional act; this one {{requiring}} the Mint to purchase {{large quantities of}} domestic silver, a commodity whose price was at a historic low. This Act assured producers of a ready market for their product, with the Mint gaining a large profit in seigniorage, through monetizing cheaply purchased silver—the Mint in fact paid for some shipments of silver bullion in silver dollars. Pursuant to this authorization, over seven million silver Peace dollars were struck in 1934 and 1935. Mint officials gave consideration to striking 1936 silver dollars, and in fact prepared working dies, but as there was no commercial demand for them, none were actually struck. <b>With</b> <b>Mint</b> Chief Engraver Sinnock thinking it unlikely {{that there would be}} future demand for the denomination, the master dies were ordered destroyed in January 1937.|$|E

5|$|Sometime {{after the}} December 1920 hearing {{requested}} by the ANA, {{the chairman of the}} U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, Charles Moore, became aware of the proposed congressional action, and decided to investigate. Moore, together with Commission member and Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser, met <b>with</b> <b>Mint</b> Director Baker on May 26, 1921, and they agreed that it would be appropriate to hold a design competition for the proposed dollar, {{under the auspices of the}} Commission. This was formalized on July 26 with the Commission's written recommendation to the Mint that a competition, open only to invited sculptors, be used to select designs. The winner of the competition was to receive $1,500 prize money, while all other participants would be given $100. On July 28, President Harding issued Executive Order 3524, requiring that coin designs be submitted to the Commission before approval by the Treasury Secretary. In early September, following the failure of the bill, Baker contacted Moore, putting the matter aside pending congressional action.|$|E

25|$|In 845, in the Huichang period, the Emperor Wu Zong, {{a fervent}} {{follower}} of Taoism, destroyed the Buddhist monasteries {{and used the}} copper bells, gongs, incense burners and statues to cast coins in various localities.

The New Tang History states that Li Shen, governor of Huainan province, requested that the empire might cast coins bearing the name of the prefecture in which they were cast, and this was agreed. These coins <b>with</b> <b>mint</b> names on the reverses, known as Huichang Kai Yuans, are of poor workmanship and size compared with the early Kai Yuans.
