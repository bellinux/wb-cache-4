5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf {{was the basis}} for {{creating}} the others. A muscle system, which gave the appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom. They also added characteristics, such as <b>wet</b> <b>hair</b> clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this look before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.|$|E
500|$|... "Wintour's {{approach}} hit a nerve—this {{was the way}} {{real women}} put clothes together (with the likely exception of wearing multi-thousand-dollar T-shirts)," [...] one reviewer says. On the June 1989 cover, another model was shown in <b>wet</b> <b>hair,</b> with just a bathrobe and no apparent makeup. Photographers, makeup artists, and hairstylists got credited along with the models. In August 2014, Gigi Hadid paid tribute to Wintour's first cover.|$|E

He said, [...] "She is so unbelievably gorgeous in that video that is all over TV right now [...] The wet wedding dress and the <b>wet</b> <b>hair</b> and ... come on, man! Who knew? She is so hot. She looks so good in it." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy opined that the music video is Clarkson's best video to date. The music video had a successful run at Total Request Live where it topped the chart for 33 days, a record that Clarkson holds for the longest stay by a female artist at {{number one on the}} chart.|$|E

50|$|P. corylifolia L., or Bu Gu Zhi in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine (TCM) is an herb used to tonify the kidneys, particularly kidney yang and essence.

60|$|He {{kept his}} seat, and shrank {{closer to the}} fire. Heathcliff rose, {{and went into the}} kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for Hareton. Hareton responded, and {{presently}} the two re-entered. The young man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks and his <b>wetted</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On August 26, 2014, Lopez {{uploaded}} [...] "Booty" [...] on her Audiomack account. It {{was released}} on September 23, 2014, for digital download. Lopez also posted the single's cover art, featuring both artists posing in swimsuits and heels, with <b>wet</b> <b>hair</b> and sultry stares and their derrieres nearly touching. Jim Farber of New York Daily News wrote that the single's cover art [...] "doubles the pleasure and doubles the fun, playing off {{the idea of a}} high-level booty summit as the two singers model the same swimwear and same flanks." [...] Azalea's verses replace those of Pitbull, whose verses were about Lopez's buttocks-related skills. Azalea instead talks about her own skills, with the rapper singing, [...] "They begging me drop down on ‘em, but right now, Iggy on the top/The last time the world seen a booty this good, it was on Jenny from the Block".|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} Gomez lying seductively on a bright, lime-green, velvet couch; wearing a loosely tied, robe-like fuchsia dress, [...] her eyes look sad {{and she is}} {{seemingly}} awaiting the arrival of her partner. Gomez wears a [...] floral, pink and lavender dress. The video then alternates between scenes of Gomez writhing around on a hardwood floor in ripped denim and a white T-shirt. In the next scene, Gomez [...] undresses and takes a shower in slow-motion; though not explicitly nude, the scene focuses {{on her head and}} shoulders. Gomez is later depicted towering over a camera in a warehouse, before returning to scenes of her writhing around and expressing her inner longing. Gomez is also pictured with <b>wet</b> <b>hair,</b> sitting on a bar stool against a bare wall, wearing a wet white T-shirt; imagery reminiscent of single's cover art. It then alternates between a scene in which she wallows on an old-fashioned leather couch wearing a silk dress. Throughout the video, Gomez is pictured singing for the camera, often making direct eye contact with the viewer and seemingly lost in deep thought.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was shot on August 23, 2014 and was {{directed}} by Hype Williams. During an interview at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, Jennifer Lopez stated about the video, [...] "It's a lot of booty." [...] On September 4, 2014, Lopez teased the music video, giving a 30-second preview, where Lopez and Azalea were dressed in [...] "barely-there bikinis that highlighting and their glorious derrieres," [...] according to Marc Inocencio of Ryan Seacrest.com. He continued, [...] "The preview also includes shots of the singer writhing on the floor, spanking her assets, flirtatiously dancing with Iggy, and covering herself in {{what appears to be}} lubricant." [...] Christina Garibaldi of MTV News went on to comment that, [...] "The teaser has Lopez tossing aside all inhibitions as she proudly shows off her famous backside in a skin-tight, black bikini complete with fishnet stockings. J.Lo continues to flaunt her assets as she rubs herself down with water (or oil, we can’t determine), smokes a cigarette and shows everybody how she twerks. J. Lo and director Hype Williams turn up the sexiness by bringing in Iggy Iggs into the mix as the two ladies dance together in black-and-white bathing suits with slicked back <b>wet</b> <b>hair,</b> as Jennifer playfully touches her fellow big-booty collaborator." [...] The full video premiered on September 18, 2014.|$|E

40|$|A {{real-time}} THz {{color scanner}} {{has the potential}} to further expand the application scope of THz spectral imaging based on its rapid image acquisition rate. We demonstrated three possible applications of a THz color scanner in the biomedical field: imaging of pharmaceutical tablets, human teeth, and human hair. The first application showed the scanner’s potential in total inspection for rapid quality control of pharmaceutical tablets moving on a conveyor belt. The second application demonstrated that the scanner can be used to identify a potential indicator for crystallinity of dental tissue. In the third application, the scanner was successfully used to visualize the drying process of <b>wet</b> <b>hairs.</b> These demonstrations indicated the high potential of the THz color scanner for practical applications in the biomedical field...|$|R

5000|$|An early {{example of}} this usage in {{mainstream}} literature occurs in the 1933 novel The Young and the Evil by Charles Henri Ford and Parker Tyler: [...] "While waiting Karel <b>wet</b> his <b>hair</b> and put his handkerchief smeared with mascara behind a pipe.

60|$|In {{the porch}} where Ursula stood {{there was a}} great noise of girls, who were tearing off their coats and hats, and hanging them on the racks bristling with pegs. There was a smell of wet clothing, a tossing out of <b>wet,</b> draggled <b>hair,</b> a noise of voices and feet.|$|R
60|$|The drizzle {{had turned}} to a deluge, a veritable heavy summer downpour, with {{occasional}} distant claps of thunder and incessant sheet-lightning, which ever and anon illumined with its weird, fantastic flash this heaving throng, these begrimed faces, crowned with red caps of Liberty, these witchlike female creatures with <b>wet,</b> straggly <b>hair</b> and gaunt, menacing arms.|$|R

60|$|He {{was away}} a long time--so long that the half-penitent Mrs. Hatchard was {{beginning}} to think of giving first aid to the wounded. Then she heard him coming slowly back along the passage. He entered the room, drying his <b>wet</b> <b>hair</b> on a hand-kerchief.|$|E

25|$|Louse eggs hatch 6–9 {{days after}} oviposition. Therefore, a common {{recommendation}} is to repeat treatment with a pediculicide {{at least once}} after 10 days, when all lice have hatched.

It was something very different from this, and more than this, that made him look so solemn in her eye.|$|R
