Ellen Barry went in to tell the police to come out but beckoned her to go outside while they found their firearms. Byrne called for the man to come out, threatening to burn the place down if they did not. Byrne sent in Sherritt's widow and when she entered the bedroom the police grabbed her and put her underneath the bed with them.|$|E

500|$|During Bomar's {{senior season}} (when {{he moved to}} halfback), the Commodores tied the Quantico Marines 13–13. Bomar, picking up a fumble, ran 84 yards for a touchdown. According to a {{newspaper}} account, [...] "It was Lynn Bomar's gigantic figure that broke up {{what looked like a}} Marine cakewalk. After receiving the kickoff, the Marines drove steadily to Vanderbilt's 10-yard line as Goettge repeatedly completed short passes. At the 10, Groves dropped back. The pass from center was low. He missed it. He reached for the ball. It trickled off his fingers. The Commodores were boring in. Wakefield <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> Then Bomar came charging through. He picked up the ball and with a twist was out of Groves' grasp. He came out of the bunch with a long, charging run. Then he seemed a little undecided. One fleeting glance behind him and he struck out. Up came his free arm to brush off his headgear. His thin, yellow hair stood out. On he swept like a thundercloud of vengeance across the goal. Bedlam broke loose." [...] Captain and guard Tuck Kelly was injured during the game, making Bomar the interim captain two weeks later against the Georgia Bulldogs.|$|E
500|$|As in {{the case}} of the first Mortal Kombat game, the content of Mortal Kombat II became the subject of a great deal of {{controversy}} regarding violent video games. Nancian Cherry of Toledo Blade wrote that both games had [...] "an army of critics too: people upset by the bone-crunching, blood-spurting, limb-ripping violence depicted on the small screen." [...] According to IGN, [...] "Mortal Kombat II wore its notoriety as a badge of honor, boasting about it in promotional materials, and even parodying it in-game." [...] The game was banned in Germany, where MKII was put in the index by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons (BPjM) and all versions of the game except for the Game Boy version were subjected to being confiscated from the nation's market for violating the German Penal Code by showing excessive violence and cruel acts against representations of human beings. Due to regional censorship, the game was also released with green-colored blood and black-and-white fatality sequences in Japan; it was at that time a unique occurrence of a western game being censored in Japan, not the reverse. Years later, Boon recalled: [...] "I've always had the position that the rating system was a good idea and should be put in place. Once Mortal Kombat II came out, there was a rating system in place. We were an M-rated game, and everybody knew the content that <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> so it became almost a non-issue." [...] Tobias agreed, saying that they [...] "were content with the M for mature on our packaging." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} at the Darryl F. Zanuck Building on the 20th Century Fox lot in West Los Angeles, where {{the cast and}} crew of The Simpsons gathered on a Monday morning in October 1993. Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show (Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, and Hank Azaria) sat down with executive producer David Mirkin and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine what shape the script <b>was</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> was [...] "genuine hearty laughter at various points" [...] during the script run-through, said Ray Richmond, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on what got laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: [...] "At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements." [...] Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the [...] "astounding versatility" [...] of the actors became clear; [...] "Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to Barney without taking a breath and minus any evident vocal similarities." [...] Mirkin said the episode was also a tour de force for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge's two sisters, and Marge's mother. He added that even though she enjoyed the process, it was tough on Kavner's voice because those characters talk with [...] "gravelly voices".|$|E

2500|$|The Live Alive {{album was}} {{released}} on November 17, 1986, and the only official live Double Trouble LP made commercially available during Vaughan's lifetime, though it never appeared on the Billboard 200 chart. Though many critics claimed {{that most of the}} album was overdubbed, engineer Gary Olazabal, who mixed the album, asserted that most of the material was recorded poorly. Vaughan later admitted that it was not one of his better efforts; he recalled: [...] "I wasn't in very good shape when we recorded Live Alive. At the time, I didn't realize how bad a shape I <b>was</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> were more fix-it jobs done on the album than I would have liked. Some of the work sounds like [...] the work of half-dead people. There were some great notes that came out, but I just wasn't in control; nobody was." ...|$|E

2500|$|Albarn began {{recording}} {{material for}} a new Gorillaz album around June 2008. He travelled to Beirut in March 2009 to record with the National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. The following month, he recorded with Derby-based orchestra sinfonia ViVA. Grime MCs Kano and Bashy, who feature on [...] "White Flag", both had the flu during recording. Kano said [...] "We weren't feeling great, the music was out of our comfort zone, {{it could have been}} a complete disaster". Bobby Womack knew nothing about Gorillaz and was initially unsure about the collaboration, however, his daughter liked Gorillaz and convinced him to do it. Womack was told to sing whatever was on his mind during the recording of [...] "Stylo". [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> for an hour going crazy about love and politics, getting it off my chest", said Womack. After an hour of recording, Womack, a diabetic, started to pass out. He was sat down and given a banana, before waking up minutes later. [...] "Sweepstakes", the first song Mos Def recorded with Gorillaz, was done in one take. Mos Def described the song as [...] "one of the greatest things as an MC that I've ever done". Mick Jones and Paul Simonon completed their portion of the title track [...] "Plastic Beach" [...] in a day.|$|E
