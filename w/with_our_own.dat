25|$|I want to {{conclude}} with a few remarks about the domestic scene {{and the role of}} Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> candidates. We are not alone in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} {{evolved from}} a community mural workshop in which the participants designed and painted the portable mural “Masks of God, Soul of Man” for the Bernal Heights Library. The group signed the piece as Precita Eyes Muralists because the project was a collaborative effort. The name of the organization {{comes from the fact}} that most of the muralists were from Precita Valley. Precita is a diminutive form of the Spanish word ‘presa,’ which means dam; the word ‘Precita’ means little dam. The ‘Eyes’ in the name are what we perceive the visual world <b>with,</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> eyes.|$|E

25|$|Quasars are {{believed}} to be powered by accretion of material into supermassive black holes in the nuclei of distant galaxies, making these luminous versions of the general class of objects known as active galaxies. Since light cannot escape the black holes, the escaping energy is actually generated outside the event horizon by gravitational stresses and immense friction on the incoming material. Central masses of 105 to 109 solar masses have been measured in quasars by using reverberation mapping. Several dozen nearby large galaxies, with no sign of a quasar nucleus, have been shown to contain a similar central black hole in their nuclei, so it is thought that all large galaxies have one, but only a small fraction are active (with enough accretion to power radiation), and it is the activity of these black holes that are seen as quasars. The matter accreting onto the black hole is unlikely to fall directly in, but will have some angular momentum around the black hole that will cause the matter to collect into an accretion disc. Quasars may also be ignited or re-ignited when normal galaxies merge and the black hole is infused with a fresh source of matter. In fact, {{it has been suggested that}} a quasar could form as the Andromeda Galaxy collides <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> Milky Way galaxy in approximately 3–5 billion years.|$|E

500|$|Patrick J. Ford of The American Conservative said WALL-Es {{conservative}} critics missed {{lessons in}} the film that he felt appealed to traditional conservatism. He argued that the mass consumerism in the film was not {{shown to be a}} product of big business, but of too close a tie between big business and big government: [...] "The government unilaterally provided its citizens with everything they needed, and this lack of variety led to Earth's downfall." [...] Responding to Coffin's claim that the film points out the evils of mankind, Ford argued the only evils depicted were those that resulted from losing touch <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> humanity and that fundamental conservative representations such as the farm, the family unit, and wholesome entertainment were in the end held aloft by the human characters. He concluded, [...] "By steering conservative families away from WALL-E, these commentators are doing their readers a great disservice." ...|$|E

The appearance of President Arthur's annual message to Congress in December 1883 caused the Rochester Herald to opine that he had written The Bread-Winners [...] "because a careful comparison of his message with the story shows many words common to both". Another Upstate New York paper, the Troy Times, evoked Parson Weems's tales of George Washington: [...] "We cannot tell a lie. [...] We wrote The Bread winners [...] <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> little hatchet. [...] If any one doubts it, we can show him the hatchet."

He was satisfied overall with the club's transfer activity during the summer, in particular praising goalkeeper Willy Caballero. When asked about Wenger's comments about Manchester City, he retorted: [...] "As a manager we have enough problems <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> teams to be talking about other teams."

500|$|Fellow {{songwriter}} Neil Finn (Crowded House) has said, [...] "There {{is something}} unique and powerful {{about the way}} Kelly mixes up everyday detail with the big issues of life, death, love and struggle – not a trace of pretence or fakery in there". Ross Clelland, writing for Rolling Stone, described Kelly: [...] "hile he was (rightly) lauded {{for his ability to}} sing of injustice without ranting, or deal with the darker sides of human nature non-judgementally, often overlooked was the fact he could write a damn fine melodic hook to go with those words". Tim Freedman (The Whitlams) acknowledges Kelly, Peter Garrett (Midnight Oil), and John Schumann (Redgum) as inspiring him by [...] " [...] our suburbs <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> myths and social history". However, Kelly has been quoted as saying [...] "Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel like I have got it nailed yet". In 2007 Kelly donated his 'Lee Oskar' harmonica to the Sydney Powerhouse Museum. The museum's statement of significance cites Kelly's talent as a songwriter, his distinctive voice, and his harmonica playing, particularly on Live, May 1992.|$|E

[...] Basile criticized its characters especially the use of foam to create the characters and the way Santa Claus was depicted saying [...] "...he looks like a pig with liver spots." [...] The animators responded to this comment about their interpretation of Santa Claus, saying [...] "We definitely wanted to keep an element of strangeness, almost scary aspects in the story." [...] Caballero explained that the idea of making Santa Claus look tired and strange came when they saw a drawing of him by Marc Ceccarelli or Luke Brookshier. Caballero said, [...] "We thought that was a great idea. So we came up <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> little back story where Bikini Bottom is the last stop for Santa. He's tired, he wants to get home, take his shoes off ... We honed in on the old descriptions of Santa being a jolly old elf. We pictured him as humanoid, but not necessarily directly human." ...|$|E
500|$|The Protector's agrarian {{policy and}} proclamations were {{inspired}} {{by a group of}} intellectuals sometimes called [...] "the commonwealth men". These were highly critical of landlords and left many commoners with the impression that enclosures were unlawful. As one of England's major landowners, Dudley soon feared that this would lead to serious trouble and discreetly tried to warn Somerset. By the summer of 1549 there was widespread unrest or even rebellion all over England. The Marquess of Northampton had been unable to restore order in and around Norwich, so John Dudley was sent to get hold of Kett's Rebellion. Dudley offered Robert Kett a pardon on the condition that the peasant army disband at once. This was rejected and the next night Dudley stormed the rebel-held city with a small mercenary contingent and drove the rebels out after fierce street fighting; 49 prisoners he had immediately hanged. Two days later Kett, who had his main camp outside the city, confronted the royal army, resulting in a slaughter of over 2,000 peasants. In the following weeks Dudley conducted courts-martial which executed many rebels, perhaps up to 300. For the enraged and humiliated local gentry this was still not enough punishment, so Dudley warned them: [...] "Is there no place for pardon? ... What shall we then do? Shall we hold the plough ourselves, play the carters and labour the ground <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> hands?" ...|$|E

500|$|There was a noted {{effort on}} the part of Corps staff and other Transylvanian exiles (Ion Agârbiceanu, Laurian Gabor, Octavian Tăslăuanu etc.) to {{encourage}} the rapid integration of Podil-formed units into the Romanian line of defense. After a quick session of retraining, the Corps units were attached to the 11th Division, which was recovering in Iași. It was, however, decided that the formations, particularly those from Transylvania, were to be kept distinguished from the rest under the common command structure. An official act of 1918 explained the rationale behind this act: [...] "Transylvanians should fight as Transylvanians [...] against the Hungarian state, so as to assert, clearly and beyond all doubt, that the Romanian nationals of the Hungarian state do not recognize its authority. To have fought against Hungary, however the war may end, ought to have been a badge of honor for the Romanian nation in Hungary and a moral reinforcement during the battles to come". When it was proposed that men from the Corps be assigned noms de guerre so as to avoid execution if captured, Deleu reacted strongly: [...] "We intend to be the army of Transylvania! We aim to be the conscience of Transylvania, which is for absolute freedom and The Union! We do not want [...] a conquered land, we wish to liberate ourselves <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> forces! Hangings? Let them hang us! But let them be aware that Transylvania herself is fighting for liberty and The Union!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for TV Squad, writer Richard Keller gave the episode a mixed to {{positive}} review, calling the installment [...] "pretty unique", {{but that it}} also had its flaws. He enjoyed {{the fact that the}} episode revealed the relationship between Shawn and Henry, that it [...] "reflects the relationship many of us have <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> fathers". He also enjoyed the [...] "fleshing out" [...] of Gus's character, that [...] "we now see Gus as quite the brainiac" [...] and [...] "rather than saying nothing but 'No, Shawn'... Gus actually contributes quite a bit to this episode". However, Keller also criticized parts of the episode, saying that he disliked the [...] "whole fake psychic concept". Keller also criticized Timothy Omundson's character Carlton Lassiter, saying [...] "he just doesn't fit into the whole show", and [...] "Omundson's makes Lassiter look like a cartoon character". In a comment for TV Guide, the show was called [...] "a diamond in the rough", and writer Matt Roush called star James Roday [...] "a delight". The episode was included in Yahoo! TV's list of the nerdiest episodes of Psych. Reviewer Tucker Cummings said that [...] "the wordplay in this episode great" [...] and that [...] "it gives you a great insight into how Gus and Shawn's friendship has functioned (or dysfunctioned) over the years". In addition, she said that the episode's murder-mystery plot [...] "is actually really engrossing" [...] when compared to later episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|After weak {{sales in}} 2009 of several {{titles in the}} Guitar Hero series, Activision {{proceeded}} to make several changes with their internal development teams. The company dissolved RedOctane, bringing {{in some of the}} staff directly into Activision. Activision further shuttered Neversoft's Guitar Hero division, pending the completion of Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, with further development in the series to be created by some former Neversoft members and Vicarious Visions. Brian Bright, former Neversoft member and current project lead, noted that part of the poor sales of Guitar Hero in 2009 was a result of a loss of focus with Guitar Hero 5, stating that [...] "we were trying to please everyone out there and I think in the end you end up not pleasing any one person a lot". With Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, Bright wanted to bring the game back to please the fans of the earlier Guitar Hero games, specifically the highly successful [...] To that end, the team developed a soundtrack [...] "more focused on rock 'n' roll" [...] than the variety of genres within Guitar Hero 5. The songs are more guitar-centric, as proven to be the most popular instrument choice based on Guitar Hero 5. Bright noted they used player statistics from previous games to shape Warriors of Rock; for example, according to Bright, within a month of release, 40% of the players of Guitar Hero 5 were playing on Expert mode, and felt this was the audience they needed to cater to. Bright also stated that the aim of Warriors of Rock was to create a game with [...] "its own identity" [...] from both previous Guitar Hero titles and other rhythm games; [...] "Rather than go head-to-head <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> games and our competitors, we decided we wanted to make something different." ...|$|E
