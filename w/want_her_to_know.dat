6000|$|... "I {{would begin}} by asking her pardon for {{worrying}} her with my invention when I knew she disliked problematic mechanics. Then I would tell her, in as few words as possible, that I had expected this little instrument {{to give me}} fame and fortune, and therefore I <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> all about it; and then, before she could ask me why I <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> this, I would tell her it was because I wished to lay that fame and fortune at her feet. After that, {{in the best way}} my ardent feelings should dictate, I would offer myself <b>to</b> <b>her</b> without fortune, without fame, just the plain John Howard who loved her with all his heart. If she accepted me, I would tell her that the invention had not worked as I had intended it should, and therefore I should put it behind me forever." ...|$|R

In an {{interview}} with The Republican, Proal revealed that she wrote the song for her friend. she said, [...] "She unfortunately lost her mother and I kind of wrote that as an apology because I wasn't around - I was in Los Angeles, I just <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I was still thinking about her." ...|$|R

Mr. Nash hereupon dropped into a chair by the arm of her sofa, their companion went away, and Mrs. Dallow turned her glance upon her new acquaintance without a perceptible change of position. Then she emitted with rapidity the remark: [...] "It's very awkward when people are told one's clever." ...|$|R

Phil and Rita {{spend the rest of the}} day together, with Phil impressing her with his apparent overnight transformation through his contributions to the festivities and helpful nature to the townsfolk. That evening at the town's Groundhog Day dinner-dance, she [...] "wins" [...] Phil with the high bid at the charity bachelor auction. Phil makes a beautiful ice sculpture of Rita's face, and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is doomed to continue awakening alone each morning forever, he <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that he is finally happy, because he loves her.

6000|$|... "Why is it impossible?" [...] he asked, {{smiling in}} spite of an inward displeasure. And as Olive gave him no answer, only gazing {{at him with a}} cold audacity which he had not {{hitherto}} observed in her, he added a little explanation.

I <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I have made up my mind--since yesterday--to leave this place; I shall take the train at noon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Must I {{remind you}} {{again of the}} time when you were angry?" [...] she rejoined. [...] "You said your mother was bent on {{separating}} us.

But until I had made this test I did not <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what the instrument was intended to do; it was barely possible she might play a trick on me and speak in English. But if the thing succeeded I would tell her everything.

60|$|He {{put her in}} {{the corner}} of the bench so she would have to face him, and he began to talk as if there were no black trouble between them.

Ringing up Lola's apartment, her roommate tells him she now had enough cash for a plane ticket and had flown out early that morning. As they talk, a tow truck outside is removing his car. He says to the girl: [...] "I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> tell <b>her</b> that I love <b>her.</b> I <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I was going to begin again. It sounds stupid, I know. But a person can always try." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{employment}} of seemingly supernatural events or an “invisible hand” {{to keep the}} truth from being discovered {{is not a new}} strategy being employed by Parsons, but is consistent with other gothic novels of the time such as The Castle of Otranto and The Mysteries of Udolpho (...) [...] The concept of the invisible hand is evident when Matilda discovers lines written in the window which detail the grief and torment of Victoria, who at the time Matilda reads it, is unknown <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> The anonymity of the writer of the lines etched into the window provides another example of how identities in this novel are kept secret. As the reader of the lines, Matilda is able to learn only what the writer <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> while the other aspects of the author’s life are kept secret and hidden (...)

6000|$|She did {{not answer}} immediately, but meditated again, with her {{eyes fixed on the}} {{opposite}} wall.

She may be dead. If she were I should long to know where she was buried; and to know whether my brother lives, so that we can remember her together. But I will try not to grieve. I have thought much for so many years of her being dead. And I shall have her with me in my mind, as I have always had. We can never be really parted. I think I have never sinned against her. I have always tried not to do what would hurt her. Only, she might be sorry that I was not a good Jewess." ...|$|E

60|$|But Dorothea's {{mind was}} rapidly {{going over the}} past with quite another vision than his. The thought that she herself might be what Will most cared for did throb through her an instant, but then came doubt: {{the memory of the}} little they had lived through {{together}} turned pale and shrank before the memory which suggested how much fuller might have been the intercourse between Will and some one else with whom he had had constant companionship. Everything he had said might refer to that other relation, and whatever had passed between him and herself was thoroughly explained by what she had always regarded as their simple friendship and the cruel obstruction thrust upon it by her husband's injurious act. Dorothea stood silent, with her eyes cast down dreamily, while images crowded upon her which left the sickening certainty that Will was referring to Mrs. Lydgate. But why sickening? He <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that here too his conduct should be above suspicion.|$|R
