5|$|In Final Fantasy IV, {{the player}} {{controls}} a large {{cast of characters}} and completes quests to advance the story. Characters move and interact <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> enemies on a field map, which may represent a variety of settings, such as towers, caves, and forests. Travel between areas occurs on a world map. The player can use towns to replenish strength, buy equipment, and discover clues about their next destination. Conversely, the player fights monsters at random intervals on the world map and in dungeons. In battle, the player has the option to fight, use magic or an item, retreat, change character positions, parry, or pause. Certain characters have special abilities. The game {{was the first in}} the series to allow the player to control up to five characters in their party; previous games had limited the party to four.|$|E
5|$|The {{gathering}} of the dignitaries at the station and {{the departure of the}} trains was a major event. Every hotel room and lodging-house in Liverpool was full the night before. From 9.00am onwards the area around the station was filled <b>with</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> crowds thronged the trackside at Liverpool to watch the trains depart. One group of men had each paid two shillings for access to the best vantage point, the top of a chimney near the tunnel leading to Crown Street railway station; they were hoisted up by rope and board shortly after dawn to watch proceedings.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bears}} of Yosemite were once famous for {{breaking}} into parked cars to steal food. They were also an encouraged tourist sight {{for many years}} at the park's garbage dumps, where bears congregated to eat park visitors' garbage and tourists gathered to photograph the bears. Increasing encounters between bears and humans and increasing damage to property led to an aggressive campaign to discourage bears from relying on human food or interacting <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> their property. The open-air dumps were closed; all trash receptacles were replaced with bear-proof receptacles; all campgrounds were equipped with bear-proof food lockers so that people would not leave food in their vehicles, which were easy targets for the powerful and resourceful bears. Because bears who show aggression towards people usually are eventually destroyed, park personnel have continued {{to come up with}} innovative ways to have bears associate humans and their property with unpleasant experiences, such as being hit with rubber bullets. Today, about 30 bears a year are captured and ear-tagged and their DNA is sampled so that, when bear damage occurs, rangers can ascertain which bear is causing the problem.|$|E

25|$|In Christianity, God is {{the creator}} and {{preserver}} of the universe. God {{is the sole}} ultimate power in the universe, but is distinct from it. The Bible never speaks of God as impersonal. Instead, it refers to him in personal terms– who speaks, sees, hears, acts, and loves. God is understood to have a will and personality and is an all powerful, divine and benevolent being. He is represented in Scripture as being primarily concerned <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> their salvation.|$|E

At that time, Cen Wenzhao was {{spending}} time associating <b>with</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> Emperor Taizong was not pleased. He considered demoting Cen Wenzhao out of the capital, but Cen Wenben interceded on his brother's behalf, stating that his mother favored Cen Wenzhao the most, and not having his brother around would cause his mother much distress. Emperor Taizong thus changed his mind, keeping Cen Wenzhao in the capital after summoning him and rebuking him.|$|E

25|$|Marsh {{was also}} {{drawn to the}} ports of New York. In the 1930s the harbors were {{extremely}} busy <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> commerce due to the country's necessity for economic recovery. The Great Depression brought about a decline in raw materials and therefore the demand for those materials grew dramatically, resulting in bustling harbors in big cities such as New York. Marsh would sketch the seaports, focusing on the tugboats {{coming in and out}} of the harbor, and capturing the details of the boats such as the masts, the bells, the sirens, and the deck chairs.|$|E
25|$|The Orange and the Dutchess sailed from Newburgh for {{the last}} time on Nov. 3, 1963, packed <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> cars. The bells on board and on shore tolled as the boats crossed the river in the early evening chill against the {{imposing}} silhouette of the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge, which had opened the day before. Ten minutes later, when the ferries docked in Beacon and disgorged their cargo, people got in their cars or hopped on the waiting buses and went home, over the new bridge. The ferries, built in the early 1900s at the Newburgh shipyards, were sold and, in time, scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Extraversion is {{the state}} of {{primarily}} obtaining gratification from outside oneself. Extraverts tend to enjoy human interactions and to be enthusiastic, talkative, assertive, and gregarious. Extraverts are energized and thrive off being around other people. They take pleasure in activities that involve large social gatherings, such as parties, community activities, public demonstrations, and business or political groups. They also tend to work well in groups. An extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> find less reward in time spent alone. They tend to be energized when around other people, and they are more prone to boredom when they are by themselves.|$|E

Prince Naruhito of Japan arrived in Brazil on June 17 {{to participate in the}} celebrations. He visited Brasília, São Paulo, Paraná, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. Throughout his stay in Brazil, the Prince was received by a crowd of Japanese immigrants and their descendants. He broke the protocol of the Japanese Monarchy, which prohibits physical contact <b>with</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> greeted the Brazilian people. In the São Paulo sambódromo, the Prince spoke to 50,000 people and in Paraná to 75,000. He also visited the University of São Paulo, where people of Japanese descent make up 14% of the 80,000 students. Naruhito gave a speech in Portuguese.|$|E

It is appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness and can be provided as the main goal of care or along with curative treatment. Although it {{is an important part of}} end-of-life care, it is not limited to that stage. Palliative care can be provided across multiple settings including in hospitals, at home, as part of community palliative care programs, and in skilled nursing facilities. Interdisciplinary palliative care teams work <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> their families to clarify goals of care and provide symptom management, psycho-social, and spiritual support.|$|E
25|$|On the {{negative}} side, {{studies show that}} some former military brats struggle to develop and maintain deep, lasting relationships, and can feel like outsiders to U.S. civilian culture. The transitory lifestyle can hinder potential for constructing concrete relationships <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> developing emotional attachments to specific places, as can the stresses of having a parent deployed to a war zone and also the psychological aftermath of war in dealing with returning veteran parents. In some cases {{there is also the}} loss of a parent in combat, or a drastic change in a parent due to a combat related disability. A military brat may personally know another child or teenager, or even a few other peers, whose parents have become war casualties (wounded or killed). A significant minority of ex-military brats may exhibit symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, etc.|$|E

25|$|At first Genie {{usually did}} {{not listen to}} anyone unless someone {{directly}} addressed her or if Curtiss played classical music on the piano, and if someone spoke to her she almost never acknowledged the other person and usually walked away after a while. In {{an effort to get}} Genie to listen to other people Curtiss began reading children's stories to her, and at first she did not seem to engage, but one day in mid-October 1971 Curtiss saw that Genie was clearly listening and responding to her. After that she paid attention to people even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. She became somewhat more sociable in her interactions <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> became somewhat more responsive, although she still frequently showed no obvious signs that she heard someone. Her reactions to most stimuli became more rapid, but even by the end of her stay she sometimes took several minutes before giving a response to somebody.|$|E
25|$|Known as {{a classic}} example of a Gentle Giant, the Saint Bernard is calm, patient and sweet with adults, and {{especially}} children. However St. Bernards, like all very large dogs, must be well socialized <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> other dogs in order to prevent fearfulness and any possible aggression or territoriality. The biggest threat to small children is being knocked over by this breed's larger size. Overall they are a sweet, gentle, calm, loyal and affectionate breed, and if socialized are very friendly. Because of its large adult size, it is essential that proper training and socialization begin while the St. Bernard is still a puppy, so as to avoid the difficulties that normally accompany training large dogs. An unruly St. Bernard may present problems for even a strong adult, so control needs to be asserted {{from the beginning of the}} dog's training. While generally not instinctively protective, a St. Bernard may bark at strangers, and their size makes them good deterrents against possible intruders.|$|E
25|$|During {{the siege}} of 1941 – 1944, the only ways to supply the city and suburbs, {{inhabited}} by several millions, were by aircraft or by cars crossing the frozen Lake Ladoga. The German military systematically shelled this route, called the Road of Life, so thousands of cars <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> food supplies had sank in the lake. The situation in the city was especially horrible {{in the winter of}} 1941 – 1942. The German bombing raids destroyed most of the food reserves. Daily food ration was cut in October to 400grams of bread for a worker and 200grams for a woman or child. On 20 November 1941, the rations were reduced to 250 and 125grams respectively. Those grams of bread were the bulk of a daily meal for a person in the city. The water supply was destroyed. The situation further worsened in winter due to lack of heating fuel. In December 1941 alone some 53,000 people in Leningrad died of starvation, many corpses were scattered in the streets all over the city.|$|E
