The goal is to create a web application, which returns to user the most appropriate food supplements, how he or she should take them, what <b>to</b> avoid, <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> etc. <b>For</b> implementation, we used validated and extended web technologies. For users and system administrators we use HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript, while PHP and MySQL perform the background work. For each user, the application stores data and increases the database. We then use that database and user input to calculate probability of a certain medical condition using the formula of conditional probability...|$|R

In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> of the 2003 Act which allows crofting communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller. Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis.|$|R
