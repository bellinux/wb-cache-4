In the Cumberland and border cottages the door is {{generally}} protected by two pieces of slate arranged in a gable, giving the purest possible type of the first form. In elaborate architecture such a projection hardly ever occurs, and in large architecture cannot with safety occur, without brackets; but by cutting away the greater part of the projection, we shall arrive at the idea of a plain gabled cornice, of which a perfect example will be found in Plate VII. of the folio series. With this first complete form we may associate the rude, single, projecting, penthouse roof; imperfect, because either it must be level and the <b>water</b> <b>lodge</b> lazily upon it, or throw off the drip upon the persons entering.|$|E

50|$|About 1834 {{he started}} the study and the {{geological}} investigation of his region - Sarthe and Mayenne. He never stopped working on them until his death. These investigations, and discussions with Louis Cordier, drove him to Anjou (Maine-et-Loire)where coal was craft mined. Thus, in 1839, Triger seriously began {{to look at the}} Loire river and the way to reach solid rock underneath about 20 meters of <b>water</b> <b>lodged</b> soil. After having read many articles on compressed air, he was convinced that he could use it in order to dig through this layer of soil. His success does not lie on the idea of using compressed air, but in the invention of the airlock - to pass from the compressed zone to the zone of ambient air pressure. And especially the finding of a practical way to utilize the technique on an industrial scale. With the financial and administrative support of Emmanuel de Las Cases, 5 steel tubes (the definitive shaft lining) were drilled by this invention, which was subsequently adapted and applied over and over again to dig foundations, bridges and many tunnels.|$|R
