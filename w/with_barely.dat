5|$|MSU's (private, non-Morrill Act) {{endowment}} {{started in}} 1916 when the Engineering Building burned down. Automobile magnate R.E. Olds helped the program stay afloat {{with a gift}} of $100,000. There {{was a time when}} MSU lagged behind peer institutions in terms of endowments. As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools, <b>with</b> <b>barely</b> over $100 million in endowment funds.|$|E
5|$|The final {{fight of}} Johnson's early period, {{during which the}} stake money was {{relatively}} low, was his comprehensive win over a ponderous fighter called Fry for a prize of 50guineas at Kingston. The fight, which lasted less than 30minutes, ended with Fry badly beaten up and Johnson <b>with</b> <b>barely</b> a scratch on him. This fight did not attract many supporters of the sport; it took place on 6June 1786 and was therefore during the period when the wealthy were away from London.|$|E
5|$|Slim and streamlined, {{the silky}} shark has a fairly long, rounded snout <b>with</b> <b>barely</b> {{developed}} flaps of skin {{in front of}} the nostrils. The circular, medium-sized eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Short, shallow furrows are present at the corners of the mouth. Fourteen to 16 and 13–17tooth rows are found {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively (typically 15 for both). The upper teeth are triangular and strongly serrated, with a notch in the posterior edge; they are erect at the center and become more oblique towards the sides. The lower teeth are narrow, erect, and smooth-edged. The five pairs of gill slits are moderate in length.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} {{as part of}} his promise to Bhuvan, Lakha takes a diving one-handed catch. However, the British score almost 300 runs, losing only three wickets by the lunch break. Kachra is brought back to bowl and, bowling with a now-worn ball, takes a hat-trick, which sparks the {{collapse}} of the British batting side. The villagers soon start their innings. Bhuvan and Deva (a Sikh, who has played cricket earlier when he was a British sepoy) give their team a solid start. Deva misses out on his half-century when a straight-drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler's hand onto the stumps at the non-striker's end, where Deva is backing up too far. When Lakha comes on to bat, he is hit on the head by a bouncer and falls onto his stumps. Other batsmen get out rashly trying to score a boundary off each delivery. Ismail (Raj Zutshi), a good batsman, retires hurt as he is hit on the leg. The villagers' team ends the day with four batsmen out of action <b>with</b> <b>barely</b> a third of the required runs on board.|$|E

25|$|In the hugely {{entertaining}} drawn Ulster Final, Tyrone {{were four}} points ahead of rivals Armagh <b>with</b> <b>barely</b> three minutes remaining, {{and had been}} on top throughout the match. However, Armagh's deadly marksman, Steven McDonnell scored a goal, and Oisín McConville scored an equalising point to send the match to a replay, on a scoreline of 0–14 for Tyrone, to Armagh's 2–8.|$|E
25|$|At Thiacourt, the U.S. Army troops {{began using}} Springfield and Browning Automatic Rifles. Prior to that, British Enfields and French Cha Chat {{automatics}} had been used. <b>With</b> <b>barely</b> three weeks training with the newer rifles, the 80th troops were {{thrust into the}} third and final phase of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.

25|$|On the {{purchase}} of the land from Light's estate in 1805, William Edward Phillips began the works of a Georgian-styled mansion called Suffolk Park. He was not, {{at the time of the}} mansion's construction, governor to the island, but became so in later years. It was an ostentatious statement in a settlement <b>with</b> <b>barely</b> 120 European residents, many of whom were trades people and merchants.|$|E
25|$|Anquetil's {{head was}} a computer. It started working: in 500 metres, Poulidor wouldn't get his 56 seconds. I'll never forget what {{happened}} when Jacques crossed the line.

However, he had actually made a decision to retire a year earlier, having suffered a loss to Azumafuji, another future yokozuna.|$|E

25|$|Akureyri has a subpolar {{oceanic climate}} (Cfc) {{bordering}} a subarctic climate (Dfc) with cold though not severe winters and mild summers. The snow cover starts forming in late October and melts in April, yet snow can {{lie on the}} mountain peaks around Akureyri for the whole year. Akureyri is a very cloudy town, averaging only 1047 sunshine hours annually, <b>with</b> <b>barely</b> any sunshine between November and February, but precipitation is much lower than in southern Iceland because the prevailing winds are from the south — it is {{as little as a}} fifth as much as in Vík í Mýrdal.|$|E
25|$|During the migrations, or Völkerwanderung (wandering of the peoples), {{the earlier}} settled populations were {{sometimes}} left intact though usually partially or entirely displaced. Roman culture {{north of the}} Po River was almost entirely displaced by the migrations. Whereas the peoples of France, Italy, and Spain continued to speak the dialects of Latin that today constitute the Romance languages, {{the language of the}} smaller Roman-era population of what is now England disappeared <b>with</b> <b>barely</b> a trace in the territories settled by the Anglo-Saxons, although the Brittanic kingdoms of the west remained Brythonic speakers. The new peoples greatly altered established society, including law, culture, religion, and patterns of property ownership.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2005, a new post-6:00p.m. {{advertising}} style was developed for older audiences, which used a much simpler logo and sleeker packaging <b>with</b> <b>barely</b> any gross-out tactics. In the spring of 2006, the simple logo first appeared on YTV's promos and even appeared on credits of newer original programming. In 2007, this look was adopted for the entire channel. In September 2009, the logo was changed slightly: it featured new colours, and the background was simplified. Variations to the bumpers were reduced. Instead, there are large, opaque digital on-screen graphics telling viewers which programs are coming next, and promotions of the programs. In September 2012, the logo was changed aesthetically.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Vicksburg Campaign most of Johnston’s army was transferred back to the Army of Tennessee. By August 10, 1863, Colonel McCray had requested transfer to the Department of the Trans-Mississippi and reported to General Kirby Smith, at Shreveport Louisiana by mid September. Several additional consolidations occurred in McNair’s Brigade during the month of August and were made official September 1, 1863. Depleted by deaths and desertions, the 31st Arkansas Regiment and the 4th Arkansas Infantry Battalion were permanently consolidated with the 4th Arkansas Infantry Regiment on September 1, 1863. <b>With</b> <b>barely</b> enough men left to fill up two companies in the consolidated regiment, the 31st Arkansas boys served under the 4th Arkansas Regiment’s Colonel Henry Gaston Bunn {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|At the {{milestone}} Third Plenum of the National Party Congress's 11th Central Committee {{which opened}} on December 22, 1978, the party leaders decided {{to undertake a}} program of gradual but fundamental reform of the economic system. They concluded that the Maoist version of the centrally planned economy had failed to produce efficient economic growth and had caused China to fall far behind not only the industrialized nations of the West but also the new industrial powers of Asia: Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In the late 1970s, while Japan and Hong Kong rivaled European countries in modern technology, China's citizens had to make do <b>with</b> <b>barely</b> sufficient food supplies, rationed clothing, inadequate housing, and a service sector that was inadequate and inefficient. All of these shortcomings embarrassed China internationally.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the looming threat of war, Nymphe was recommissioned {{under the command of}} Captain Edward Pellew on 11 January 1793. However, by the time Pellew arrived at Portsmouth on the 15th, the press gangs had swept the town clean of seamen. Pellew prepared his ship for sea, and did his best to recruit a crew. When, as expected, the government of revolutionary France declared war on Great Britain on 1 February 1793 Nymphe was still in dock, and not ready for sea until the 6th. Nymphe finally sailed on the 12th, <b>with</b> <b>barely</b> more than half her complement, which included 32 marines, and 80 Cornish tin-miners, all mere landsmen. Pellew was obliged to bring his crew up to strength by boarding several of the merchant vessels he was escorting in the Channel and impressing experienced sailors.|$|E
