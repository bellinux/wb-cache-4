5|$|Independent Maya {{frequently}} attacked Christianised Maya {{settlements and}} encouraged such settlements {{to abandon their}} new religion and resist the Spanish.

5|$|Michael Ryan, {{director}} of The YoungCuts Film Festival, {{noted that there}} was a precedent for the film in the Air Pirates lawsuit, in which Disney spent eight years in court with some underground cartoonists who had published an underground comix parody in which Mickey Mouse and the other Disney characters engaged in explicit sex and used illegal drugs, among other behavior they avoided in Disney's own narratives. He suggested that Disney buy the rights and release the film itself, which it could easily do as its announced interest would guarantee it a monopsony on the film since no other distributor would want to match Disney's deep pockets or its feared legal response. As a Disney release, Escape from Tomorrow would have a large potential audience of both Disney enthusiasts and antagonists, Disney <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>making</b> money from property it already owns instead of someone else and the company's apparent willingness to go in the joke would take some of the satiric edge off.|$|E
