Some critics, including former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, charged that the number had been tampered with in order to benefit Obama one month before the U.S. presidential election. [...] Solis said, [...] "I'm insulted <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> that because we have a very professional, civil service organization where you have top, top economists that work at the BLS. They've been doing these calculations. These are our best trained and best-skilled individuals working in the BLS, and it's really ludicrous to hear that kind of statement."

500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of people who identify as transgender, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters. Food that Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after {{he had sex with}} her caused him to [...] "violently" [...] vomit for 30 unbroken seconds. Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. [...] "It always distresses me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, very happy with the 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual [...] character that has ever been on television, dare I say." [...] In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer Brent Hartinger graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode deserves credit for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot." [...] The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that [...] "GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD’s Entertainment Media Team is addressing these with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point." [...] In a September 2010 interview in Details, MacFarlane expressed surprise at the negative reaction, stating [...] "I don't meet a lot of stupid homosexuals." [...] He repeated that he still felt Ida was a [...] "very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and [...] "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" [...] Eames (Digital Spy) believed the episode was [...] "surprisingly kind" [...] to the transgender community for [...] "Family Guy standards".|$|E

Mikulski said that [...] "it brings {{tears to my eyes}} to know women are working so hard and being paid less" [...] and that [...] "it makes me emotional <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> that...

2500|$|Moreno's lyrics were {{described}} by Time as [...] "suggesting emotions rather than announcing them". Moreno himself described his lyrics as ambiguous and sometimes impersonal, saying: [...] "I {{like to be}} ambiguous when writing to a certain extent, and throwing something so brash [...] against that and playing with it. And also making it sound dimensional. Giving the feeling off that it is raw and it is emotional, but it's not just connected with our personal story. It's not merely about our career and our lives, it's bigger than that. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> the music, I get inspired to paint the lyrical pictures you describe, but I'm not always talking about myself".

Money is part of it; and yes, I believe God wants us to excel ... to be blessed so we can be a bigger blessing to others. I feel very rewarded. I wrote a book and sold millions of copies; and Victoria and I were able to help more people than we ever dreamed of.

2500|$|The {{band played}} only two gigs in 1995. This allowed Duritz {{to write a}} set of songs that became the band's second album, Recovering the Satellites. [...] Released October 15, 1996, it was heavier than August and Everything After, perhaps due to the {{addition}} of second guitarist Dan Vickrey, who had joined in early 1994. A response to the sudden fame that [...] "Mr. Jones" [...] had brought, it contains lyrics such as [...] "These days I feel like I'm fading away / Like sometimes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> myself on the radio" [...] (from [...] "Have You Seen Me Lately?") and [...] "Gonna get back to basics / Guess I'll start it up again" [...] (from [...] "Recovering the Satellites"). Dealing with the theme of Duritz's unease with his newfound fame, the album was described as [...] "a concept album of sorts about {{trying to pick up}} the pieces of a family, a social life and a psyche shattered by fame." [...] This album contained the hit single [...] "A Long December" [...] which received medium to heavy FM airplay.|$|E

2500|$|Thirdly, {{the writing}} {{sessions}} {{were affected by}} Patrick's struggles with addiction, concerning alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. While Patrick had struggled {{with it in the}} past, it became particularly bad upon dealing with the pressure of recording a follow-up to the platinum selling Title of Record. Patrick would stay up for multiple days at a time without sleep, spending entire days indulging in his addictions instead of working on the album. The album's first single, [...] "Where Do We Go From Here" [...] addressed said struggles; the track was self-referential in Patrick's struggles to create the album in the face of his addiction, knowing that the money being spent in the prolonged period, and the drugs being taken, were not sustainable activities. The track [...] "God Damn Me" [...] was written in between Patrick's blackouts one night when he was so heavily intoxictated that a friend kept on stopping in to wake him up {{to make sure he was}} still alive. In 2013, Patrick would reflect on the writing sessions, stating [...] "I went through a music phase where I was writing as I experienced my life within drugs and alcohol....I cringe <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> some of it because a lot of the lyrics I feel like ugh what was I thinking. There’s a lot of stuff I would have changed if I had been a little bit more clear headed." ...|$|E

And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing.
