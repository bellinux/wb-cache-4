In the meantime the Peugeot 304 soldiered on until 1980, complemented since late 1977 by its replacement. Once the 304 was being produced in tandem with its successor it could be priced more aggressively, so that customers who till 1976 <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> a 204 were able to afford what was virtually the same car with a larger engine and a larger boot/trunk.|$|E

25|$|Those early {{guardian}} {{dogs were}} not the distinct breed we know today. Rather, the Estrela developed {{over a period of}} hundreds of years. Shepherds <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> to breed the dogs that had the characteristics necessary to survive in their mountain environment and to do their job: large size, strength, endurance, agility, a deep chest, ability to tolerate a marginal diet, the set of the legs, a powerful mouth, a tuft of hair around the neck, an easy, jog-like gait, a warm coat, and a watchful, mistrustful, yet loyal temperament. Since the region was isolated, there was little breeding with non-native dogs, leading to the purity of the breed.Life changed little for the people and dogs of the region, even into the 20th century. The isolation of the region meant the breed was relatively unknown outside it until the early 1900s, and even then, they were mostly ignored in early dog shows. The Portuguese admired foreign breeds much more than their own. Shepherds often castrated their dogs to prevent them from leaving their flocks to mate. These factors had a negative effect on the Estrela. So from 1908 to 1919, special shows called concursos were held to promote and preserve the Estrela breed in the region. During this period there was some attempt at a registry (of which there is no surviving record). Special livestock guardian working trials were included in these shows. The trial consisted of an owner/shepherd bringing his dog into a large field with many flocks of sheep. The dog was observed by judges for its reactions coming into the field and as the shepherd was ordered to move the flock, which inevitably produced stragglers. The dog was expected to move from his spot of guarding to bring the stragglers back, and then assume a leadership position {{at the head of the}} flock.|$|E

500|$|In 1955, Chamberlain joined KU. At KU, Chamberlain {{became a}} player for the Kansas Jayhawks {{freshman}} team under coach Phog Allen, whom he admired, {{and also a}} member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, where he was the president of his pledge class. Announced as [...] "looking lighter than his 240 pounds, [...] reach 9'6" [...] up in the air , and [...] 7'2", his debut was highly anticipated, and he delivered: in Chamberlain's debut game for the freshman squad, the freshman Jayhawks were pitted against the varsity Jayhawks, who were favored to win their conference that year. Chamberlain dominated his older college mates by scoring 42 points (16–35 from the field, 10–12 on free throws), grabbing 29 rebounds and registering four blocks. Chamberlain's prospects of playing under Allen ended, however, when the coach turned 70 shortly after and was forced to retire by KU regulation. Chamberlain had a bad relationship with Allen's successor, Dick Harp, fueled by resentment and disappointment: Chamberlain biographer Robert Cherry has doubted whether Chamberlain <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> KU if he had known that Allen was going to retire.|$|E
