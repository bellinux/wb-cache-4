During synchronous infection of BSC 40 cells with wild-type virus, immunoreactive E 11 protein accumulated {{in parallel with}} the onset of late protein synthesis. Immunoblotting of extracts of wild-type virions showed that the E 11 protein was encapsidated within the virus core. A normal temporal pattern of viral protein synthesis was observed in cells infected <b>withts</b> 49 at the nonpermissive temperature (40 °) and normal-appearingts 49 progeny virions were observed by electron microscopy. Sequencing of the E 11 gene ofts 49 revealed a single amino acid substitution, Gly(66) Arg, in the mutant E 11 polypeptide. The steady-state level of E 11 protein duringts 49 infection was much lower than that observed during infection with wild-type virus. This was the case at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. We discuss two possible explanations for the thermosensitive growth ofts 49 : (i) that virus infectivity requires a threshold level of active E 11 protein or (ii) that E 11 function is conditionally essential...|$|R

However, the developmental time course over which posture is stabilized relative {{to the base of}} support during a dynamic manual precision task has not been examined. Postural-manual integration was assessed in 7 -year-olds, 10 -year-olds, and adults using a postural-manual task in which task precision (target!tting size) and postural dif!culty (reaching distance to a target) were manipulated. The main dependent variable was postural time-to-contact (TtC). Results indicated systematic age effects in which TtC was shortest in the 7 -year-olds, increased in the 10 -year-olds, and was longest in the adults. Across all age levels, TtC was longer when performing a precision!t compared with a nonprecision!t and when!tting at a near target compared <b>with!tting</b> at a far target. Finally, TtC increased {{over the course of the}} manual!tting task, suggesting that posture became increasingly stable as the hand approached the opening.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the relation between the skin temperature of the palm and sensory cold-warmth after contact with some materials. Ten men and ten women were selected and introduced to 21 kinds of material for a contact test of 30 min without seeing the specimens in a climate-controlled room at 25 ‡± 1 ‡C and 65 % relative heemidity. The palm-contacted test materials and skin temperature of the palm, central fingertip, and back of the palm were measured during the experiment. A sensory evaluation test was applied to evaluate the contacted sensory cold-warmth. Results showed that the maximum temperature decrease of the fingertip (Td) was positively related to the natural logarithm of the material's specific gravity (lnρu) and to the natural logarithm of the material's thermal conductivity (lnλ). There were also negative linear relations between the contacted sensory cold-warmth (S) with lnρu and lnλ; and there was a negative linear relation betweenS <b>withTd</b> and betweenS with the value ofTd by λ. The thermal osmotic coefficient (b) of wood and wood-based materials ranged from 3.63 to 3.97, and the materials were qualified as good thermal insulation materials. Furthermore, there was a negative linear relation betweenS andb. Accordingly, it is possible to evaluate the contacted sensory cold-warmth relying on the basic thermal properties of material.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{analysed}} the intracellular localisation of {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 ribonucleotide reductase during infection of cultured cells by indirect immunofluorescence using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific for the R 1 and R 2 subunits. Three different viruses were used to infect cells, wild-type strain 17 +and two temperature-sensitive mutants,ts 1222, which produces R 1 only, andts 1207, which expresses a normal R 2 and an altered R 1 that fails to interact with R 2 at the nonpermissive temperature because of an amino acid substitution in R 1. R 1 was detected 2 hr postinfection with all three viruses and remained evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. R 2 was not observed until 4 hr postinfection and, {{in contrast to the}} even distribution of R 1, was localised in discrete cytoplasmic foci close to the nucleus. In double-labelling experiments both R 1 and R 2 were found in these foci where they presumably associate to form the active enzyme. As expected R 2 was not detectable in cells infected <b>withts</b> 1222. Ints 1207 -infected cells it formed wild-type-like foci, indicating that interaction with R 1 is not required for R 2 focus formation. R 1 was present in a twofold excess over R 2 in wild-type-infected cells. We suggest that the uncomplexed R 1 could perform a role associated with the protein kinase present in the N-terminal domain...|$|R
40|$|As an affective factor, test-taking anxiety {{has been}} {{investigated}} in different contexts in thepast two decades. However, the mixed results {{of the relationship between}} test-taking anxiety andL 2 learners&rsquo; test performance show that the instrumentation for the assessment of test-takinganxiety and the factors comprising the construct of test-taking anxiety trait requires moreinvestigation in order to shed more light on the issue. To this end, a test-taking anxietyquestionnaire (Sarason, 1975) [27] and a general English test were administered to 164 ESPstudents of Engineering enrolled in a B. A. program to document (a) the degree of their test takinganxiety, (b) the relationship between test-taking anxiety and test performance, and (c) the factorloadings of anxiety based on exploratory factor analysis. The results show that L 2 learners&rsquo; testanxiety is rather low, with most of its components having no significant negative correlation <b>withtest</b> performance. The results of exploratory factor analysis reveal the loading of test anxiety traiton the rather overlapping three factors of specific test anxiety, general test anxiety, and test preparation anxiety. However, out of these factors, general test anxiety, due to its functioning at the higher-order affective level, has a significant negative correlation with test performance. By contrast, test preparation anxiety, in view of facilitating test performance, manifests a positive, albeit non-significant, correlation with test performance. The results have two implications: (a) as the correlations and loadings on test anxiety factors proved to be of both negative and positive types, the anxiety questionnaire is not monolithic and hence it is not a proper measure in case the linear relationship between test anxiety and test performance is the focus of the study; and (b) test anxiety does not seem to much influence on test performance at the micro- test-specific level...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} (T 2 D) has increased rapidly worldwide {{during the last two}} decades. Lifestyle and behavioral factors such as diet, exercise and self-care have {{a crucial role in the}} prevention and managementof T 2 D. The motivation behind the desire to change is a cornerstone of adopting a healthier lifestyle. Motivationalinterviewing (MI) is a counseling technique that emphasizes to individuals incentives to change rather than just givinginformation. There is a lack of scientific evidence to indicate whether MI is a suitable form of care among patients <b>withT</b> 2 D. The aim of this study was to identify the outcomes of Motivational Interviewing in the context of care of adults withtype 2 diabetes. Methods: A descriptive review of studies published between January 2001 and March 2011 describing motivationalinterviewing in the care of patients with type 2 diabetes was conducted by interrogating electronical databases (CINAHL,Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus) and conducting a manual search. Two researchers selected the studiesand assessed their quality independently. Results: Five studies were selected for inclusion in this review. Our results show that studies describing MI used as a formof therapy in the care of T 2 D patients yield mixed results. Statistically significant effects for some clinical outcomes andamong behavioral and psychological outcomes were reported. Conclusions: The studies reviewed indicate that although MI seems to be a promising form of care among patients <b>withT</b> 2 D, further research into applying MI within T 2 D care is urgently needed. </p...|$|E
