25|$|Remington Rand was a {{potential}} sponsor during the show's conception and counseled against the show's suggested title, Wally and the Beaver, believing viewers <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> show was a nature program. The show was ultimately sponsored by Ralston Purina, with General Electric (the GE logo was clearly visible on all kitchen appliances) and Chrysler Corporation sponsoring the later seasons (Ward Cleaver was often seen driving the newest Plymouth Fury during the opening credits or coming home from work, starting in Season 3. In the first two seasons, he drove a 1957 Ford).|$|E
25|$|The show's set {{included}} {{a door in}} the background. During the show, Sales would answer {{a knock at the}} door and interact with an actor seen only as an arm. Occasionally, the person at the door was a celebrity, such as Burt Lancaster or Fess Parker. Once, while the show was being broadcast live from Detroit, Sales' studio crew pulled a prank on him: when he opened the door, he saw a topless dancer partially covered with a balloon. Some reports say the gag was furthered by the crew switching the studio monitors so that Sales <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> stripper image was going out over the air. A second, nonbroadcasting, camera captured the uncensored version, while a stagehand moved a balloon back and forth in the doorway, giving at least some indication to the home viewers what was supposed to be behind the door. Sales was forced to try to keep the show going without revealing the risque scene backstage. The prank was recreated when the show originated in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles prank footage survives.|$|E
500|$|This Week editor, Roger Bolton, {{initially}} {{believed there}} was little merit in investigating the shootings. Based on the official account of events that was presented {{in the immediate aftermath}} of the shootings, Bolton believed that most people <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> IRA members [...] "deserved what they got". Bolton's interest, however, was piqued by Sir Geoffrey Howe's statement, and the revelation in it that the deceased were unarmed and were not in possession of a bomb. Shortly afterwards, he dispatched two of This Weeks journalists, Julian Manyon and Chris Oxley, to Gibraltar and Spain (respectively) to gather more information on the shootings. Bolton believed that the Milltown Cemetery attack and the corporals killings, two events in Belfast which resulted from the Gibraltar killings, provided [...] "even more compelling reasons" [...] to investigate the shootings; the team considered switching the focus of the programme to the effects the shootings had in Belfast, but decided to continue with the original project.|$|E

500|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, Cope advertised the idea of the towel to fans on the radio and evening {{television}} news, using the phrase [...] "The Terrible Towel is poised to strike!" [...] However, Atkins grew nervous that fans <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> towel was a jinx if the Steelers lost the game. Cope agreed to poll players on their view of the towel. Linebacker Jack Ham told Cope, [...] "I think your idea stinks"; Ernie [...] "Fats" [...] Holmes was also against the idea. Also against the idea of the Towel was Andy Russell, who mirrored Cope's original thoughts, [...] "We're not a gimmick team. We've never been a gimmick team." [...] Cope simply replied, [...] "Russell, you're sick." [...] Growing nervous about the negative feedback, Cope, who had already advertised the towel on the news multiple times, polled the rest of the players with a [...] "banana-republic vote".|$|E
500|$|Jackson faced {{numerous}} {{disagreements with}} the song's co-producer. It {{has been reported}} that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak {{to be part of the}} collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. [...] "I said, 'Michael we've got to cut that intro'" [...] Jones later recalled. [...] "He said: 'But that's the jelly! ... That's what makes me want to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's what makes me want to dance', well, the rest of us just have to shut up." [...] Jones also wanted to change the track's title to [...] "Not My Lover", as he believed that people <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the finished product sounded close to the demo. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted him neither and the two fell out for several days.|$|E
500|$|Coe's {{interpretation}} {{was repeated}} by other scholars {{through the early}} 1990s. In contrast, later researchers said that, while {{the end of the}} 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration, it did not mark the end of the calendar. [...] "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," [...] said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. [...] "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention." [...] In 1990, Mayanist scholars Linda Schele and David Freidel argued that the Maya [...] "did not conceive this {{to be the end of}} creation, as many have suggested." [...] Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, stated that, [...] "We have no record or knowledge that [...] <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> world would come to an end" [...] in 2012. Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, [...] "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," [...] and, [...] "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in." [...] "There will be another cycle," [...] said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the Tulane University Middle American Research Institute. [...] "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this." [...] Commenting on the new calendar found at Xultún, one archaeologist said [...] "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Bate {{described}} a simple device in his 1634 book [...] "The Mysteries of Nature and Art".

The description seems rather close to a simple four-phase animation device depicted and described in Henry V. Hopwood's 1899 book Living Pictures (see picture). Hopwood gave no name, date or any additional information for this toy that rotated when blown upon. However, Bate's device {{as seen in the}} accompanying illustration seems not to have actually animated the images, but rather to have moved the images around spatially.|$|E

2500|$|Through Being Cool was {{recorded}} with producer Steve Evetts in June 1999 at Trax East Recording Studio in South River, New Jersey. Newman {{was close to}} having a breakdown on a few occasions, as he was nervous, and not used to being in a studio, saying it [...] "was intense". Evetts always kept the band [...] "in line. Definitely the guru of the whole thing", Newman revealed. Recording and mixing was done over a total of eleven days. The two half-days were booked {{as a result of}} Conley losing his voice recording the vocals. Conley noted that other people <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> band was [...] "rushing, but we were just having a blast". The band, attempting to finish the album, would do s, relaxing in the control room, and sleeping in the lounge. Conley said that the band was [...] "really psyched" [...] at how the songs sounded. Evetts also engineered the album, while Alan Douches mastered it at West West Side.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Justice Rehnquist, {{joined by}} Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas, argued the Law School's admissions policy {{was an attempt}} to achieve an unconstitutional type of racial balancing. [...] The Chief Justice {{attacked}} the Law School's asserted goal of reaching a [...] "critical mass" [...] of minority students, finding the absolute number African-American, Hispanic, and Native American students varied markedly, which is inconsistent with the concept in that one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> same size critical mass would be needed for all minority groups. [...] He noted that [...] "rom 1995 through 2000, the Law School admitted... between 13 and 19... Native American, between 91 and 108... African American, and between 47 and 56... Hispanic... One would have to believe that the objectives of 'critical mass' offered by respondents are achieved with only half the number of Hispanics, and one-sixth the number of Native Americans as compared to African Americans." [...] Citing admissions statistics, the Chief Justice noted the tight correlation between the percentage of applicants and admittees of a given race and argued that the numbers were [...] "far too precise to be dismissed as merely the result of the school paying 'some attention to [...] numbers.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Several critics {{theorized that}} another {{probable}} {{factor in the}} film's box office failure was the confusion related to its title. Cyriaque Lamar of Cracked.com notes that [...] "udiences expecting mystical weirdness a la The Exorcist walked out of theaters" [...] which in turn forced distributors to put [...] "ads that Sorcerer was 'NOT A FILM ABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL'." [...] Film critic Gene Siskel thought Sorcerer was a [...] "very bad title". To him the title might have indicated a certain likeness to The Exorcist and thought the audiences {{at the time were}} either bored with yet another film about exorcisms or that was precisely what they wanted and upon seeing the movie, they got confused, asking themselves [...] "where's the devil?" [...] Siskel also thought each of the production companies <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> other one would handle the promotion, and nobody perceived it as a [...] "sole project of their own, it was dropped in-between them." [...] On the other hand, Roger Ebert expressed his disappointment about the movie's box office performance by saying that [...] "you could make more than that just by opening in the first week, people stumbling into a wrong theater looking for Bruce Lee," [...] as well as blamed Universal and Paramount for the lack of support. Friedkin stated that his attitude throughout the making of the film [...] "alienated the top management of two studios", and as a consequence they did not feel compelled to support it.|$|E
