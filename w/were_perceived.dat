5|$|China before westernization {{was another}} society that {{segregated}} men from women. Historical Chinese culture has not recognized {{a concept of}} sexual orientation, or a framework to divide people based on their same-sex or opposite-sex attractions. Although {{there was a significant}} culture surrounding homosexual men, there was none for women. Outside their duties to bear sons to their husbands, women <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as having no sexuality at all.|$|E
5|$|For ten centuries {{after the}} fall of the Roman Empire, {{lesbianism}} disappeared from literature. Foster points to the particularly strict view that Eve—representative of all women—caused the downfall of mankind; original sin among women was a particular concern, especially because women <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as creating life. During this time, women were largely illiterate and not encouraged to engage in intellectual pursuit, so men were responsible for shaping ideas about sexuality.|$|E
50|$|Theories on emotion {{have focused}} on perception, {{subjective}} experience, and appraisal. Predominant theories of emotion and emotion perception include what type of emotion <b>is</b> <b>perceived,</b> how emotion <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> somatically, and at what stage of an event emotion <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> and translated into subjective, physical experience.|$|R
50|$|This {{suggests}} that for sound to <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> at 7-8 Hz, the 7-8 Hz SPL {{would have to}} be 12.3 dB higher than the 92.0 dB SPL required at 15.5 Hz, which means that the 7-8 Hz SPL would require at least 104 dB of SPL to <b>be</b> <b>perceived.</b> For 3 Hz to <b>be</b> <b>perceived,</b> the SPL would need to add another 12.3 dB, or reach 116 dB of SPL, to <b>be</b> <b>perceived.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{literature}} {{has noted that}} [...] "inositol" [...] <b>is</b> sometimes <b>perceived</b> as sweet and/or salty. In general, the inositols will <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as sweet due to their equat-trans-hydroxyl pairs. The muco-inositol isomer <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> as both sweet and salty. It <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> as salty due to its pair of diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pairs. This pair of hydroxyl groups can form a dimer with the diaxial-trans-hydroxyl pair of the hydrated sodium-ion receptor.|$|R
5|$|In July 2012, Romney {{visited the}} United Kingdom, Israel, and Poland, meeting leaders {{in an effort}} to raise his {{credibility}} as a world statesman. Comments Romney made about the readiness of the 2012 Summer Olympics <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as undiplomatic by the British press. Israeli Prime Minister (and former BCG colleague) Benjamin Netanyahu, embraced Romney, though some Palestinians criticized him for suggesting that Israel's culture led to their greater economic success.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{individual}} murderers <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> to {{have been}} so heinous that standard punishments like beheading or to be broken on the wheel were not regarded as sufficiently commensurate with their crimes, and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised. The case of Pavel Vašanský (Paul Wasansky in German transcript) may serve as an example here.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's work became {{increasingly}} controversial among literary critics, {{teachers and parents}} from the 1950s onwards, because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books, particularly the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> to lack literary merit. Her books have been criticised as being elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic and {{at odds with the}} more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.|$|E
50|$|If the lag between {{consecutive}} presentations {{is prolonged}} further, ('beta' / 'optimal') motion <b>is</b> <b>perceived.</b> The line in position A <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> {{to move to}} position B. In the original experiments of Wertheimer (1912), a lag of 60 ms {{was found to be}} optimal to obtain this kind of percept. If the lag is further prolonged, two forms of partial movement can be perceived: dual movement and singular movement. In dual movement, two lines <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> that both move, but not in a continuous way (like from A to B). In singular motion, two lines <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> of which only one is moving. Finally, from a lag of around 200 ms in the original study onwards, the two lines <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> to occur in succession—first A, then B.|$|R

5|$|France's {{claim to}} Madagascar as its {{protectorate}} was officially recognized by Britain in the Anglo-French agreement of 1890. Between 1890 and 1894, the French sought to aggressively claim {{what they believed}} to be the territorial rights established by the treaty. However, these French land claims and settlements <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> by Ranavalona and Rainilaiarivony as an unjustifiable encroachment upon Malagasy sovereignty. Ultimately Charles Le Myre de Vilers was sent to persuade the queen and her prime minister to submit to the French interpretation of the treaty with the intent to launch a war and take the island by force if an agreement was not reached. The French offer was flatly refused and diplomatic relations between France and Madagascar were broken off in November 1894.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Pelé {{publicly}} {{accused the}} Brazilian football administrator Ricardo Teixeira of corruption after Pelé's television company was rejected {{in a contest}} for the Brazilian domestic rights to the 1994 World Cup. Pelé accusations led to an eight-year feud between the pair. As {{a consequence of the}} affair, the President of FIFA, João Havelange banned Pelé from the draw for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Las Vegas. Criticisms over the ban <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> to have negatively affected Havelange's chances of re-election as FIFA's president in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{had been}} a {{fruitful}} and successful international venture, although the Canadians had on occasion been resentful of British actions that <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as high-handed and insensitive. One such action came in November 1945 when the British government suddenly announced that Cockcroft {{had been a}}ppointed {{the head of the}} new Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Britain without any prior consultation {{and at a time when}} the NRX reactor was still under construction. Cockcroft did not depart Canada until September 1946, but it was a sure sign of waning British interest in collaboration with Canada. The British suggested he be replaced by the British physicist Bennett Lewis, who was eventually appointed, but only after the Canadian-born Walter Zinn turned the job down.|$|E

Critic James Hirsh has stated that, [...] "as a result, the play dramatises not two but four main figurative locales: Rome as it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> from a Roman point of view; Rome as it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> from an Egyptian point of view; Egypt as it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> form a Roman point of view; and Egypt as it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> from an Egyptian point of view." ...|$|R
5|$|Throughout Charles's reign, {{the issue}} of how far the English Reformation should {{progress}} was constantly brought to the forefront of political debate. Arminian theology emphasised clerical authority and the individual's ability to reject or accept salvation, and was consequently viewed as heretical and a potential vehicle for the reintroduction of Roman Catholicism by its Calvinist opponents. Charles's sympathy to the teachings of Arminianism, and specifically his wish to move the Church of England away from Calvinism in a more traditional and sacramental direction, <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> by Puritans as irreligious tendencies. In addition, Charles's Protestant subjects followed news of the European war closely and grew increasingly dismayed by Charles's diplomacy with Spain and his failure to support the Protestant cause abroad effectively.|$|E
5|$|A style more melodic {{and more}} akin to the hard rock of bands like Rainbow, Magnum, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake was equally {{represented}} during the NWOBHM. The music of Def Leppard, Praying Mantis, White Spirit, Demon, Shy, Gaskin, Dedringer and many others, contained hooks as much as riffs, often retained a closer link with blues rock, included power ballads and featured keyboards, acoustic instruments and melodic and soaring vocals. After {{the peak of the}} movement in 1981, this style was favoured by the media and gained greater acceptance among the British audience; it became prevalent when bands usually playing the more aggressive style of metal adapted to the more popular sound, which resembled that of mainstream American acts. These changes in musical direction disoriented some fans and led them to reject those bands which <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in the pursuit of success.|$|E
5|$|Peng was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Mao's rise to power during the January 1935 Zunyi Conference. Peng continued to consolidate the communists' base area after arriving in Shaanxi, campaigning in neighboring Shanxi and Gansu. In April 1937, Peng was named vice commander-in-chief of all Chinese communist forces, outranked only by Zhu De, who was named commander-in-chief. Peng's promotion was supported by Lin Biao, who had been actively supporting Peng for promotions to senior leadership as early as May 1934. In early 1935 Lin responded to widespread discontent within the Red Army over Mao's evasive tactics (which <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> inside the Red Army as unnecessarily exhausting) by publicly proposing that Peng take overall command of the Red Army; but Mao, who had recently been promoted to the position, attacked Peng and Lin for challenging him and successfully retained his position.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} whether students at two universities perceive social power differences {{between male and}} female business faculty.

Results of a survey involving 892 students at two universities indicate that male faculty members <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> as having greater expert power, while no gender differences exist on referent, reward and coercive power.

5|$|The colony's small Afrikaner {{community}} was {{split on the}} issue of war. Some supported the United Kingdom out of loyalty to Rhodesia, but others were still bitter about the Anglo-Boer War and showed little interest in fighting the Germans. In the rural areas, where Afrikaner nationalism was strongest, the Germans <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> by some Boer farmers as potential liberators from British domination. Southern Rhodesian Afrikaners were often accused of undermining the British war effort. While some leaders of the community publicly came out in support of the war and offered to provide troops, others put pressure on Afrikaans-speakers not to volunteer. When recruitment for the Rhodesia Native Regiment began in 1916, there were reports of potential black recruits being urged not to join up by their Afrikaans-speaking employers.|$|E
5|$|The natives {{launched}} a furious mass assault against Santa María de Comayagua. The depleted garrison fought {{its way out}} under cover of night and {{set out on a}} desperate march to Gracias a Dios, leaving the town to be sacked – not even the livestock were spared. All across the province the Spanish were short of soldiers, arms and supplies, except at the Peñol de Cerquín, which remained the focus of Spanish attention. In {{a very short period of}} time, Spanish control had collapsed across Honduras; only two small Spanish pockets remained – at Gracias and San Pedro. Montejo sent Gonzalo de Alvarado to San Salvador to seek assistance, which was readily supplied in the form of 100 Indian auxiliaries, 1000 Indian carriers, livestock, arquebuses, crossbows, gunpowder, ammunition, shields, spears, armour and iron. Further supplies were forthcoming from San Miguel, but similar requests sent to Guatemala were largely rebuffed, as a response to Montejo's policies which <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as undermining the rights of Guatemalan colonists.|$|E
5|$|Between 8 and 10 May 1926, regular {{elections}} to the Third Seimas were held. For {{the first time}} since 1920, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, which strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy, did not obtain a majority. The Lithuanian people were disillusioned with this party, as its members had been involved in several financial scandals: Juozas Purickas had been using his diplomatic privileges in Moscow to deal in cocaine and saccharin; Eliziejus Draugelis and Petras Josiukas had purchased cheap low-quality smoked pig fat from Germany instead of buying from Lithuanian farmers; and the Minister of Finance, Vytautas Petrulis, had transferred a large sum of money from the state budget to his personal account. The party's strategies for coping with an economic crisis <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as ineffective. An additional tension arose when the Concordat of 1925 between Poland and the Holy See unilaterally recognized Vilnius as an ecclesiastical province of Poland, despite Lithuanian requests to govern Vilnius directly from Rome. Although it was not traditionally a Vatican policy to establish an arrangement of this type, the decision was objected to strongly by many Lithuanians. The decision implied that the Pope had recognized Polish claims to Vilnius, and this created a loss of prestige for the Christian Democrats. Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were severed, and they did not improve when Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized Lithuanian ecclesiastical provinces in April 1926 without regard to Lithuanian proposals and demands.|$|E

5|$|The 1945 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season produced multiple landfalling tropical cyclones. It officially began on June16 and lasted until October31, dates delimiting {{the period when}} a majority of storms <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> to form in the Atlantic Ocean. A total of 11 systems were documented, including a late-season cyclone retroactively added a decade later. Five of the eleven systems intensified into hurricanes, and two further attained their peaks as major hurricanes. Activity began {{with the formation of}} a tropical storm in the Caribbean on June20, which then made landfalls in Florida and North Carolina at hurricane intensity, causing one death and at least $75,000 in damage. In late August, a Category3 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale struck the Texas coastline, with 3 deaths and $20.1 million in damage. The most powerful hurricane of the season, reaching Category4 intensity, wrought severe damage throughout the Bahamas and East Coast of the United States, namely Florida, in mid-September; 26 people were killed and damage reached $60 million. A hurricane moved ashore the coastline of Belize in early October, causing one death, while the final cyclone of the year resulted in 5 deaths and $2 million in damage across Cuba and the Bahamas two weeks later. Overall, 36 people were killed and damage reached at least $82.85 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} {{was the product}} of opposition which emerged to the liberal reforms of Emperor Joseph II in the 1780s. These <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as an attack on the Catholic Church and the traditional institutions in the Austrian Netherlands. Resistance, focused in the autonomous and wealthy Estates of Brabant and Flanders, grew. In the aftermath of rioting and disruption, known as the Small Revolution, in 1787, many dissidents took refuge in the neighboring Dutch Republic where they formed a rebel army. Soon after the outbreak of the French and Liège revolutions, the émigré army crossed into the Austrian Netherlands and decisively defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Turnhout in October 1789. The rebels, supported by uprisings across the territory, soon took control over virtually all the Southern Netherlands and proclaimed independence. Despite the tacit support of Prussia, the independent United Belgian States, established in January 1790, received no foreign recognition and the rebels soon became divided along ideological lines. The Vonckists, led by Jan Frans Vonck, advocated progressive and liberal government, whereas the Statists, led by Hendrik Van der Noot, were staunchly conservative and supported by the Church. The Statists, who had a wider base of support, soon drove the Vonckists into exile through a terror.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania Avenue (often known {{simply as}} The Avenue) and Fremont Avenue were the major scenes for Baltimore's black musicians from the 1920s to the 1950s, and was an early home for Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, among others. Baltimore had long been a major stop on the black touring circuit, and jazz musicians {{frequently}} played on Pennsylvania Avenue {{on the way to}} or from engagements in New York. Pennsylvania Avenue attracted African Americans {{from as far away as}} North Carolina, and was known for its vibrant entertainment and nightlife, as well as a more seedy side, home to prostitution, violence, ragtime and jazz, which <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> as unsavory. The single most important venue for outside acts was the Royal Theatre, which was one of the finest African American theaters in the country when it was opened as the Douglass Theater, and was part of the popular performing circuit that included the Earle in Philadelphia, the Howard in Washington, D.C., the Regal in Chicago and the Apollo Theater in New York; like the Apollo, the audience at the Royal Theater was known for cruelly receiving those performers who didn't live up to their standards. Music venues were segregated, though not without resistance - a 1910 tour featuring Bert Williams resulted in an African American boycott of a segregated theater, hoping the threat of lost business from the popular show would cause a change in policy. Pennsylvania Avenue was also a center for black cultural and economic life in Baltimore, and was home to numerous schools, theaters, churches and other landmarks. The street's nightclubs and other entertainment venues were most significant however, including the Penn Hotel, the first African American-owned hotel in Baltimore (built in 1921). Even the local bars and other establishments that didn't feature live music as a major feature generally had a solo pianist or organist. The first local bar to specialize in jazz was Club Tijuana. Major music venues at this time included Ike Dixon's Comedy Club, Skateland, Gamby's, Wendall's Tavern, The New Albert Dreamland, the Ritz, and most importantly, the Sphinx Club. The Sphinx Club became one of the first minority-owned nightclubs in the United States when it opened in 1946, founded by Charles Phillip Tilghman, a local businessman.|$|E
