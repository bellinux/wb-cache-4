The reverse side, however, has no known predecessors in Merovingian or Visigothic coinage. Although by the late 6th century, Merovingian and Visigothic kings <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> their names on their coins, no surviving coins from either kingdom name a bishop. The design of the figure is derived from Byzantine imperial coins, and the cross itself is large and closely resembles an altar cross.|$|E

In 1899, although he had completed all of the required courses for a degree in science from Columbia except for mathematics, he decided to forgo his studies {{in favor of an}} invitation from Osborn to work at the New York Zoological Park which was about to open.

Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla's part. Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually mounted to $20,000 ($ in today's dollars). He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915 and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{took the}} new ball with Miller and {{delivered}} 59 overs {{in the second}} innings to take 4/147 in Lindwall's absence. Johnston bowled without success {{in the first half}} of the innings; the closest he came to a wicket on the third afternoon when Len Hutton and Denis Compton <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> on a century partnership was when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point. On the fourth day, England continued to make steady progress and Johnston was unsuccessful although he was able to make the ball move sideways in the morning under cloudy conditions. He was then attacked by Hardstaff, who drove several fours through the off side and forced Bradman to remove Johnston. He returned to remove Barnett and English captain Norman Yardley late on the fourth day as the hosts’ neared 300. Barnett was caught by Miller in the slips and Johnston took a return catch to remove the English skipper. Johnston bowled 30 overs, the most of any bowler for the day, as England reached the penultimate evening on 345/6, a lead of one run. The next morning, Johnston removed Evans and bowled Jack Young to end England's innings at 441 on the final day. Johnston bowled the most overs of any player and was the leading wicket-taker for the match as Australia took a 10 leadthe Australian batsmen reached the target of 98 with eight wickets in hand.|$|E

25|$|Chief Commissioner's Province (1874–1905): In 1874, the Assam {{region was}} {{separated}} from the Bengal Presidency, Sylhet was added to it and its status was upgraded to a Chief Commissioner's Province. The capital was at Shillong. The people of Sylhet protested the inclusion in Assam. Assamese, which was replaced by Bengali as the official language in 1837, was reinstated alongside Bengali. In 1889, oil was discovered at Digboi giving rise to an oil industry.

25|$|In 1906, the Factory and Workshop Act 1901 was {{amended to}} include laundries, {{and under the}} Labour Exchanges Act 1909 labour exchanges were set up {{in order to help}} {{unemployed}} people find work, by providing centres where a large number of employers and the unemployed could post jobs and apply for them respectively. By February 1910, eighty-three labour exchanges were open, and proved to be invaluable in helping people find employment. In 1913 these labour exchanges <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> around 3000 people into a job each day. Another measure taken was the 1909 Development Fund, which was an attempt to provide work in times of Depression. This fund was devoted to increasing employment opportunities through measures such as afforestation and the provision of smallholdings in the countryside. In addition, the government encouraged the adoption of Fair Wages contracts by local authorities. In 1908, special regulations were made for electrical safety.|$|E

25|$|In July 1840, Prescod {{wrote to}} the Colonial Office in Barbados {{as a leader of}} the {{coloured}} community. He was protesting at the high prices that landowners <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> on small plots of land. This was important, since the white owners were using this as a device to prevent other races from entering the land-owning middle class. Moreover, the ability to vote was linked to land ownership. Investigations by the Colonial Office confirmed Prescod's suspicions and the landowners were indeed buying up any small plots of land that did become available, even if this meant some small hardship for themselves. He was successful in getting a change in the law but the effect was minimal. In 1840 there were 1,153 voters; historian Hilary Beckles calculates there was still less than five per cent of the population voting after the bill was passed on 6 June 1840, with the number of eligible voters in 1849 showing only a moderate increase to 1,322.|$|E
25|$|At Bristol, {{the visiting}} captain Stephen Fleming from Nottinghamshire won the toss and chose to bat—a wise choice, {{as it turned}} out, as only Mark Hardinges took wickets, but he conceded many runs in the process, {{finishing}} with four for 115. Gloucestershire were toothless, conceding 28 runs off no-balls, while their No. 5 David Hussey was deprived of a century when the team collapsed around him, finishing on 98 not out. With a run rate of above four in their 469 all out, they <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> pressure on the hosts, who started sedately without losing wickets. However, a spell from Ryan Sidebottom resulted in three wickets falling with only one run being scored, and that gave Northamptonshire the edge in the game. Gloucestershire were eventually bowled out for 250, as Mark Ealham removed the tail with three for 26 off 16 overs (with ten maidens), and, being forced to follow on, Gloucestershire lost both openers before stumps to have scored three runs for two wickets.|$|E
25|$|Whilst on {{the surface}} the new Potsdamer Platz appears so far to have {{lived up to its}} {{expectations}} as a futuristic centre of commerce at the heart of Europe's youngest capital city, there has been much debate as to just how successful it really is. Certainly its long term success and viability have become much harder to judge since the recent worldwide economic downturn, a situation compounded by the actions of its two principal owner-occupiers. Daimler and Sony caused a major surprise on 2 October 2007 when both announced that they <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> their respective complexes at Potsdamer Platz on the market. Whilst neither intended to move out, both felt it preferable to rent the space from new owners rather than continue to be the owners themselves (and so be responsible for the buildings' upkeep and maintenance). Daimler had recently come through a painful separation from their former American subsidiary Chrysler and needed a quick injection of cash in order to refocus on automotive production. Ironically, the announcement came on the ninth anniversary of their complex's official opening, a fact not lost on many people. Sony meanwhile, put their decision down to a need to review their global strategy {{in the face of a}} fast-changing worldwide economic climate. The implications for Potsdamer Platz were ominous, with suggestions that overall confidence in the project was faltering, and more pessimistic claims that the development had largely failed in its original intentions.|$|E

25|$|By the 11th century, Petatlán was {{inhabited}} by the Cuitlatecos, the Chumbias and the Pantecas. Many of these inhabitants migrated from the north, through Zacatula. The original settlement of Tecpan {{is thought to}} have been founded in 1326 by a Mexica tribe which migrated from the north. However, in the 14th century, much of the area, along with another Guerrero region called Tierra Caliente, came {{under the control of the}} Cuitlatecos, with their capital at Mezcaltepec. Other cultures in the area included the Tolimecas, Chubias, Coixas, Pantecas and Cuitlecas. The two largest settlements of this dominion were Cuitlatepan, near Zihuatanejo, and Petatlán. In the 15th century, both the rising Aztec Empire and Purépecha Empire <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> pressure onto the Cuitlateco dominion, which eventually brought it to an end. The Purépecha held some areas of the Costa Grande, including Zihuatanejo Bay, which was used as a kind of retreat on what is now Playa Las Gatas. The Aztecs took Cuitlatepan in 1497 and much of the rest of the Costa Grande by 1504, renaming Cuitlaetepan to Cihuatlán, and forming a tributary province which roughly coincides with the Costa Grande today. The Aztec conquest caused much of the population to flee and abandon the cities of Petatlán and Cihuatlán. For this reason, little remains of them today. Aztec control of the area was loose and some small areas still remained allied with the Purépecha.|$|E
25|$|Thursday {{qualifying}} {{was held}} in similar weather conditions to practice, but {{was interrupted by a}} brief shower of rain close {{to the end of the}} session. Alesi carried his form over from free practice, nudging the crash barriers lining the circuit on more than one occasion to set a provisional pole position time of 1:23.754. Berger was also impressive, power-sliding through Casino Square, to the delight of the crowd, on his way to the third-fastest time, although he complained that Alesi had held him up on what he thought would have been his quickest lap of the session. The form of the Ferraris came as something of a surprise, as the 41T2's unique V12 engine configuration theoretically produced less torque than its rivals, a disadvantage on a circuit as tight as Monaco. Alesi said that he believed the results of the session were due to the extreme effort that he and Berger <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> into their driving overcoming any deficiencies with the car. The Ferraris were split by Schumacher, who felt that the rain shower had prevented him from fulfilling his potential, as he did not complete his full quota of 12laps as a result of the track conditions becoming slower. His teammate, Herbert, took provisional sixthplace. Of the Williams drivers, Hill was fourth, but Coulthard admitted that he was still learning the track on his way to 11th, 2.8seconds slower than Alesi's best. Häkkinen continued McLaren's promising form with a provisional fifthplace, but was fined $10,000 for ignoring yellow flags during the season. Blundell was back in eighth after crashing into the barriers in the closing minutes of the session.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Gophers {{would start}} {{the game with}} the ball on a chilly {{afternoon}} in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The stout Badgers defense would get right to work forcing a three–and–out.

The Gopher defense would hold up and force Wisconsin to kick a 31-yard field goal by K Jack Russell. Minnesota would then punt again after only three offensive plays. Wisconsin moved the ball to about midfield but were forced to punt. The Golden Gophers took over at their own 4-yard line {{and picked up a}} couple of first downs but once again had to punt. The Badgers then had their own three–and–out and punting the ball back to the Gophers who took over right aroung midfield as the first quarter came to a close. On the first play of the second quarter, Minnesota QB Philip Nelson threw a 9-yard pass to WR Maxx Williams but the ball the stripped by Badgers S Nate Hammon and recovered by LB Derek Landisch at the Badgers 32-yard line. Three plays later, Wisconsin QB Joel Stave threw and interception to Gophers CB Aaron Hill who returned it 39 yards for a touchdown. Wisconsin would move the ball into Minnesota territory but were forced to punt it back to Minnesota. The Golden Gophers <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> together a nice drive but on third down and 11 from the Wisconsin 36-yard line, LB Brendan Kelly hit the Gophers QB Nelson and forced a fumble that was recovered by Badgers LB Chris Borland. Five plays later, Wisconsin was in the end zone with a 1-yard touchdown run by James White. The Badgers defense moved the Gophers offense back and forced a three–and–out. The Badgers then used a 12 play drive and got down to the Minnesota 2-yard line but were forced to kick a 20-yard field goal by Jack Russell.
