25|$|The {{two main}} {{philosophical}} approaches to animal rights are utilitarian and rights-based. The former is exemplified by Peter Singer, {{and the latter}} by Tom Regan and Gary Francione. Their differences reflect a distinction philosophers draw between ethical theories that judge the rightness of an act by its consequences (consequentialism/teleological ethics, or utilitarianism), and those {{that focus on the}} principle behind the act, almost regardless of consequences (deontological ethics). Deontologists argue that there are acts <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> perform, even if failing to do so entails a worse outcome.|$|E

500|$|The council {{decided to}} name the new {{underpass}} Tittle Cott, a move that was met with dismay by local residents. The Castleford Area Voice for the Elderly, an over-50s group, organised a campaign to have the name Tickle Cock restored. The group's chairman, Margaret Shillito, {{was quoted in the}} press as saying [...] "the old plaque was wrong, it had the wrong name on and we were offended by it". Brian Lewis was quoted as saying [...] "I feel <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> alter names and Tickle Cock has a very clear message behind it". A public meeting was held at which a [...] "large majority" [...] voted in favour of reverting to the original name, a decision that persuaded the council to replace the bridge's plaque with one bearing the legend Tickle Cock.|$|E

500|$|Positions on genetic {{determinism}} often {{correlate with}} social politics, and {{few of us}} are neutral or even changeable on the issues. Wade recognizes that his ideas may not be acceptable to everyone but warns that [...] "to falter in scientific inquiry would be a retreat into darkness". He seems to be warning, appropriately enough, against benighted political correctness. But <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> become casual about how comparable [...] "slopular" [...] science and very similar speculative evolutionary reasoning by leading scientists fed a venomous kind of darkness not too many decades ago. Wade's post-hoc tales often put him in step with a long march of social darwinists who, with comfortable detachment from the (currently) dominant culture, insist that we look starkly at life in the raw and not blink at what we see.|$|E
500|$|What British {{observers}} had forecast as a {{clash between}} two of world football's greatest powers turned into a walkover as England were despatched 6–3, with Hungary scoring after less than a minute. The unbeaten home record was obliterated, along with any pretence that England had nothing to learn from overseas rivals—they were totally outplayed by the fluid, fast-paced game of the Hungarians, which McKinstry comments was not dissimilar to Tottenham's push-and-run. Ramsey scored his third and final international goal in the game, from the penalty spot, and refused to accept that England had been outclassed, saying: [...] "Four of those goals came from outside the penalty area. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> have lost." [...] He never played for England again. He had won a total of 32 caps, scored three goals (all penalties), and captained his country three times.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to this letter, Madison visited Jefferson at Monticello {{during the first week}} of September. Their discussion was important in that it persuaded Jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from the Union, which is expressed at the end of the excerpt above. At the very least, Virginia or Kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified the Federalist attacks against the secessionist tendencies of the Democratic-Republicans. Madison won over Jefferson, who shortly thereafter wrote to Wilson Cary Nicholas that: [...] "From [...] I retreat readily, not only in deference to [...] judgment but because as <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> think of separation but for repeated and enormous violations, so these, when they occur, will be cause enough of themselves." [...] Adrienne Koch and Harry Ammon, examining Jefferson's later writing, conclude that Madison had a significant role [...] "in softening Jefferson's more extreme views." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the band}} began work with Tony Hoffer producing, {{the album was}} {{produced}} by Stephen Street (The Smiths, Blur). Overall, seven different recording studios and four producers were used during the two years spent recording A New Morning, with costs estimated at around £1million. The album was a commercial disappointment which failed to enter the top 20 and it was never released in the US. A New Morning sharply divided fans of the band {{even more so than}} Head Music and critical reaction was decidedly lukewarm. Furthermore, the mainstream public interest had long disappeared. Only two singles, [...] "Positivity" [...] and [...] "Obsessions", were released, the fewest singles taken from any of the band's albums, and neither charted particularly well. Anderson has since stressed his disappointment with Suede's final album, stating [...] "We made one Suede album too many. 'A New Morning' is the only one I don't believe in as much as the other Suede records and I totally believed in the first four, even 'Head Music' which divided the fans." [...] Mat Osman told journalist Jon Cronshaw in October 2013 that: [...] "“It sounded like a Suede album that had been made by a committee – it was quite bland. We’re all quite ashamed of it". Anderson went further in his criticism in 2016, saying: [...] "It’s a poor record and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> have released it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three Korean women {{filed suit}} in Japan in December 1991, {{around the time of}} the 50th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, {{demanding}} compensation for forced prostitution. In 1992, documents which had been stored since 1958 when they were returned by United States troops and which indicated that the military had played a large role in operating what were euphemistically called [...] "comfort stations" [...] were found in the library of Japan's Self-Defense Agency. The Japanese Government admitted that the Japanese Army had forced tens of thousands of Korean women to have sex with Japanese soldiers during World War II. On January 14, 1992, Japanese Chief Government Spokesman Koichi Kato issued an official apology saying, [...] "We cannot deny that the former Japanese army played a role" [...] in abducting and detaining the [...] "comfort girls," [...] and [...] "We would like to express our apologies and contrition". Three days later on January 17, 1992 at a dinner given by South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, the Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told his host: [...] "We Japanese should first and foremost recall the truth of that tragic period when Japanese actions inflicted suffering and sorrow upon your people. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> forget our feelings of remorse over this. As Prime Minister of Japan, I would like to declare anew my remorse at these deeds and tender my apology to the people of the Republic of Korea." [...] He apologized again the following day in a speech before South Korea's National Assembly. On April 28, 1998, the Japanese court ruled that the Government must compensate the women and awarded them [...] each.|$|E

5000|$|Immediately after forming, {{the band}} spent eight months {{recording}} their self-titled EP. After positive local reviews, the band toured {{with a variety}} of bands, including: Appleseed Cast, the Mercury Program, Pedro the Lion, the American Analog Set, Broken Social Scene, Smog, Minus the Bear, and Pinback. Soon after, the band began to record their debut album, <b>We</b> <b>Should</b> Have <b>Never</b> Lived Like We Were Skyscrapers, with John Congleton. Late at night on February 14, 2004, Chris Saathoff was killed in a hit and run accident as he was leaving a Ponys show at a local bar, the Empty Bottle, with his girlfriend. After their benefit shows in honor of their friend, Chin Up Chin Up regrouped to finish recording their album, <b>We</b> <b>Should</b> Have <b>Never</b> Lived Like We Were Skyscrapers, in which some of the bass lines Chris Saathoff had previously recorded while composing the album were used where possible. The album was released in 2004 on Flameshovel Records. Chin Up Chin Up released This Harness Can't Ride Anything on October 10, 2006.
