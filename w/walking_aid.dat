5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} to Ramsay Street, Bridget makes friends with Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) {{and she joins}} his {{football}} team, despite opposition from bully Justin Hunter (Chris Toohey). Bridget joins Declan Napier when he begins joyriding. During a race with Justin, they are pursued by the police. They return home thinking they escaped, {{only to find the}} police waiting for them. Bridget is banned from seeing Declan, but she sneaks out to meet him at the park, where they argue. On her way home, Bridget trips and falls into the road in front of a car being driven by Susan Kennedy. Susan blacks out, a result of suffering from multiple sclerosis, and hits Bridget. She drives off, unaware of what she has done. Bridget is found and rushed to the hospital, where she undergoes emergency surgery for a bleed on her brain. She remains unconscious, until Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) visits and pleads with her to wake up. Bridget's hand moves and she awakes the next day. However, she cannot feel anything down the left side of her body and she is told that she could be permanently disabled. Susan realises that she caused the accident and comes forward. She is arrested and put on trial. Bridget remembers that she fell into the road and that the accident was not Susan's fault, and she tells the court. During a rehabilitation class at the swimming pool, Bridget meets Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). Following a disastrous date with Declan, where Bridget is given the impression that Declan cannot handle her disability, Bridget begins dating Josh. Following a roof collapse at an illegal dance party, Bridget and Josh are both trapped in rubble. Declan carries Josh out before coming back for Bridget. Another collapse traps Declan and Bridget together and Declan tells her that he does not have a problem with her disability. Shortly after, Bridget begins to walk without her <b>walking</b> <b>aid</b> and her mobility returns.|$|E

DESIGN: A cluster-randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The Umeå Dementia and Exercise (UMDEX) study was set in 16 nursing homes in Umeå, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-one women and 45 men (mean age 85  years) with dementia, of whom 145 (78 %) habitually used <b>walking</b> <b>aids.</b> INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to the high-intensity functional exercise program or a seated attention control activity. MEASUREMENTS: Blinded assessors measured 4 -m usual gait speed with <b>walking</b> <b>aids</b> if any gait speed (GS), and without <b>walking</b> <b>aids</b> and with minimum amount of support, at baseline, 4  months (on intervention completion), and 7  months. RESULTS: Linear mixed models showed no between-group effect in either gait speed test at 4 or 7  months.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} change in {{ambulatory}} ability, need for <b>walking</b> <b>aids,</b> and {{activities of daily living}} (ADL) after femoral neck, intertrochanteric, or subtrochanteric fractures and to examine the determinants of these functional outcomes. Design: A prospective observational cohort study. Setting: A multicenter study involving 1 university hospital and 2 community hospitals. Patients: A consecutive cohort of 552 patients (mean age, 78. 3 years; range, 50 - 105) who underwent surgery for a hip fracture. Main Outcome Measures: Ambulatory ability, need for <b>walking</b> <b>aids,</b> and ADL index, 4 and 12 months after surgery. Results: At both 4 months and 1 -year follow-up time points, there was a significant decrease in ambulatory ability and the ADL index score and also an increase in the need for <b>walking</b> <b>aids</b> in comparison with the prefracture status. Ambulatory ability, but not ADL, significantly recovered between the 4 -month and 1 -year follow-up. One year after fracture, the prefracture functional status was regained by 57 % of the patients, but approximately 13 % of the formerly ambulating patients were unable to walk. The prefracture status was the most important determinant of ambulatory ability, need for <b>walking</b> <b>aids,</b> and ADL. Comorbidities, a poor cognitive status, and non-weight-bearing status after surgery were also negative predictors. Neither the fracture pattern nor its specific surgical treatment was predictive of any functional outcomes. Conclusions: Regardless of the type of fracture or surgical treatment used, 57 % of the patients do not regain their prefracture ambulatory ability. Recovery of ambulatory ability can occur until 1 year postoperatively. The prefracture status and cognitive level are the most important determinant of all functional outcomes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the differences in}} gait characteristics and gait symmetry of post-polio syndrome (PPS) patients ambulating with or without shoes and between subgroups walking with different <b>walking</b> <b>aids</b> and orthoses, study the correlation of these data with personal data, illness condition, physical health, frequency of using aids and orthotics and frequency of falls, and derive recommendations for standardization of reporting these data. MethodTwenty-six PPS subjects ambulated with their own walking devices. We calculated spatio-temporal parameters and symmetry indices (SI) of gait using a data acquired by a motion capture system. We compared inter-subject differences in gait pattern for PPS groups that differed by questionnaire-obtained data of demographics, physical activity, polio history, falls and <b>walking</b> <b>aids.</b> Additional inter-subject comparisons were performed between normal subjects (n= 16), PPS patients walking with shoes with/without an ankle-foot-orthosis (n= 11), PPS patients walking with knee-ankle-foot-orthosis (n= 5), and PPS patients walking with a walker/crutches (n= 10). We also compared intra-subject variability in PPS subjects {{who were able to}} repeat the trials barefoot. ResultsOur main results show that subjects who reported participating in physical activity twice a week or more had significantly better step time and double support symmetry. Subjects who use <b>walking</b> <b>aids</b> on a daily basis had significantly higher gait cadence and shorter stride time. Also, subjects that do not require knee-ankle-foot orthoses and/or <b>walking</b> <b>aids</b> walked with a smaller base width and better symmetry in stance and swing durations than PPS subjects who require these aids. ConclusionsThe gait pattern of PPS patients is related to numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

40|$|The {{authors would}} like to thank the {{researchers}} of the AMACS project for the data collection as well as the persons who participated in the research by giving their permission to be monitored during several months. Due to the rapidly aging population, developing automated home care systems is a very important step in taking care of elderly people. This will enable us to automatically monitor the health of senior citizens in their own living environment and prevent problems before they happen. One of the challenging tasks is to actively monitor walking habits of elderlies, who alternate between the use of different <b>walking</b> <b>aids,</b> and to combine this with automated fall risk assessment systems. We propose a camera based system that uses object categorization techniques to robustly detect <b>walking</b> <b>aids,</b> like a walker, in order to improve the classification of the fall risk. By automatically integrating the application specific scenery knowledge like camera position and used walker type, we succeed in detecting <b>walking</b> <b>aids</b> within a single frame with an accuracy of 68 % for trajectory A and 38 % for trajectory B. Furthermore, compared to current state of the art detection systems, we use a rather limited set of training data to achieve this accuracy and thus create a system that is easily adaptable for other applications. Moreover, we applied spatial constraints between detections to optimize the object detection output and to limit the amount of false positive detections. Finally, we evaluate the output on a walking sequence base, leading up to a 92. 3 % correct classification rate of walking sequences. It can be noted that adapting this approach to other <b>walking</b> <b>aids,</b> like a <b>walking</b> cane, is quite straightforward and opens up the door for many future applications. status: publishe...|$|R
