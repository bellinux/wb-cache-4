5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> the camshafts and crankshaft main bearings.|$|E
5|$|About a {{week before}} the wedding of couple Grace and Keir Johnston of Colonsay, Scotland, the bride's mother, Cecilia Bleasdale, took a {{photograph}} of a dress she planned to <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> the wedding and sent it to her daughter. After disagreements over the perceived colour of the dress in the photograph, the bride posted the image on Facebook, and her friends also disagreed over the colour; some saw it as white with gold lace, while others saw it as blue with black lace. For a week, the debate became well known in Colonsay, a small island community.|$|E
5|$|In {{the novels}} Halo: Fall of Reach and Halo: The Flood, it is {{told that the}} Grunts are methane {{breathers}} and described as dog-like. They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the breathing apparatuses they usually <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E
50|$|An {{adornment}} {{is generally}} an accessory or ornament <b>worn</b> <b>to</b> enhance the beauty or {{status of the}} wearer. They are often <b>worn</b> <b>to</b> embellish, enhance, or distinguish the <b>wearer,</b> and <b>to</b> define cultural, social, or religious status within a specific community. When <b>worn</b> <b>to</b> show economic status, the items are often either rare or prohibitively expensive to others. Adornments are usually colourful, and <b>worn</b> <b>to</b> attract attention.|$|R
50|$|Sportswear design must {{consider}} the thermal insulation needs of the wearer. In hot situations, sportswear should allow the <b>wearer</b> <b>to</b> stay cool; while in cold situations, sportswear should help the <b>wearer</b> <b>to</b> stay warm.|$|R
50|$|A hairshirt (or Cilice) is an {{undergarment}} <b>worn</b> <b>to</b> induce discomfort, {{and thereby}} lead the <b>wearer</b> <b>to</b> spiritual purity, salvation, or atonement for sin. Similarly, hairshirt environmentalism {{refers to the}} belief that denial of material comfort will lead to environmental sustainability.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, a young roguish prince, Fiyero, {{has arrived}} at Shiz. Galinda is charmed when Fiyero shares his life {{philosophy}} ("Dancing Through Life"). They all decide {{to have a}} party that evening. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to invite her to the party, but she convinces him instead to ask Nessarose out of pity, leaving her free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose is delighted and tells her sister how she and Boq {{are meant to be}} together and how Galinda helped it happen. When Galinda offers Elphaba a hat to <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> the party, Elphaba begins to wonder if she was wrong about her roommate.|$|E
5|$|Some plants, {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible silica (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) to defend themselves against vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. Plants take up silicon from the soil and deposit it in their tissues {{in the form of}} solid silica phytoliths. These mechanically reduce the digestibility of plant tissue, causing rapid <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> vertebrate teeth and insect mandibles, and are effective against herbivores above and below ground. The mechanism may offer future sustainable pest control strategies.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} {{locomotives}} Nos. 6256 and 46257 Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S and City of Salford were given many new features. In order {{to raise the}} mileage between general overhauls from 70,000 to 100,000, measures were taken to decrease <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> the axle bearings and hornguides {{through the use of}} roller bearings and manganese steel linings. Other modifications included further superheating area, a redesigned rear frame and cast steel trailing truck, rocking grate, hopper ashpan and redesigned cab-sides.|$|E

50|$|Clubwear is provocative, revealing, or fetish {{clothing}} that is <b>worn</b> <b>to</b> nightclubs featuring a sensual atmosphere {{with a very}} relaxed dress code. There are various types of clothing items that could be <b>worn</b> <b>to</b> clubs based on {{the location of the}} club, the club's dress code and the weather.|$|R
50|$|They {{are usually}} <b>worn</b> <b>to</b> furry {{conventions}} such as Anthrocon. Some fursuits of existing characters {{are made for}} the purposes of cosplay and are <b>worn</b> <b>to</b> anime or gaming conventions. They are also worn in public, though this typically requires a spotter {{to ensure the safety of}} the performer.|$|R
5|$|The most {{difficult}} scene for Whedon to film was Willow panicking in her dormitory room. Her obsession {{about what to}} <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> visit Buffy was inspired by Whedon's own experiences {{when he was at}} a loss for what tie to wear for a friend's funeral. He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying {{that she was able to}} be consistently emotional in every take and make him and the crew cry every time. Whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on the DVD commentary while watching Hannigan in the scene.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} at least one report of {{deliberate}} vandalism to the structure, but the primary concern relating to visitors to the site {{is the possibility of}} damage caused through tread wear. The site is not heavily trafficked and any <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> the structure since the 1980s would likely be mitigated by the protection from the natural re-establishment of plant growth over its surface. Updates by the North York Moors National Park authority and English Heritage suggest that natural weathering and grazing sheep represent greater erosion risks to the structure than do human agents.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, two trams were {{involved}} in an accident and sent to Firema for reparations. However, the company filed for bankruptcy, and as of October 2010 the trams were still not repaired or returned to Oslo. In 2010, Commissioner for Environmental Affairs and Transport JÃ¸ran Kallmyr (Progress Party) stated that the SL95 trams were being considered for replacement, {{at the same time}} as the much older SL79. Problems with the units included excessive noise, excessive amount of time out of order, rust, cracks in the axles, and increased <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> the infrastructure because they weighed too much. All except two of the SL95 trams were temporarily grounded on 29 April 2013 when it was discovered that rust had damaged the joints between the articulated sections on several trams.|$|E

25|$|The Ruger SR9 {{can safely}} be dry fired {{with an empty}} {{magazine}} in the pistol. A Ruger-issued warning states that, due to the disconnector, dry firing the pistol without the magazine inserted will cause unnecessary <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> the striker block, but published firearms industry information notes that the SR9's disconnect can be deactivated simply by removing some of the disconnector linkage.|$|E

25|$|Durham is a hilly city, {{claiming}} to be built upon the symbolic seven hills. Upon the most central and prominent position high above the Wear, the cathedral dominates the skyline. The steep riverbanks are densely wooded, adding to the picturesque beauty of the city.

25|$|Note: The US Army {{phased out}} the M60D {{in favor of}} the M240D and {{subsequently}} M240H. While the mount system designation remains the same, the mount itself has been extensively redesigned to accommodate the ammunition magazine and a bag for catching expended ammunition casings and ammunition links, as well as an improved roller on the pintle to prevent excessive and premature <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> the mount assembly.|$|E
25|$|Since CD-Rs {{in general}} cannot be logically erased to any degree, the {{disposal}} of CD-Rs presents a possible security issue if they contain sensitive / private data. Destroying the data requires physically destroying the disc or data layer. Heating the disc in a microwave oven for 10â15 seconds effectively destroys the data layer by causing arcing in the metal reflective layer, but this same arcing may cause damage or excessive <b>wear</b> <b>to</b> the microwave oven. Many office paper shredders {{are also designed to}} shred CDs.|$|E
