40|$|The <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Ving {{construction}} occurs only 36 {{times in}} the 1, 000, 000 -word Great Britain component of the ICE corpus.

The be Ving part may encode a durative event (“You <b>'re</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transcribing all of this <b>are</b> you”; “are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> eating at your parents’ or here”), a repeated event (“And I said well I think Rebecca <b>'s</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> into her M Phil lectures”) or a punctual event (“And I <b>was</b> just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> telling people what <b>to</b> do which <b>was</b> fine”).
