5|$|In 1889, Miloš's {{descendant}} King Alexander visited Jovanović at his Vienna {{studio and}} requested {{a painting of}} the revolt to commemorate its 75th anniversary. With his rise in stature, the artist had found himself producing numerous replicas of his earlier Orientalist works. According to biographer Nikola Kusovac, Jovanović grew bored with painting replicas and considered taking up a different genre. Alexander's request presented Jovanović <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to deviate from Orientalism and try his hand at history painting. The Takovo Uprising was his first historical composition.|$|E

5|$|Two {{attempts}} by the Japanese to extend their defensive perimeter {{in the south and}} central Pacific were thwarted in the battles of Coral Sea (May 1942) and Midway (June 1942). These two strategic victories for the Allies provided them <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to take the initiative and launch an offensive against the Japanese somewhere in the Pacific. The Allies chose the Solomon Islands, specifically the southern Solomon Islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida as the location for their first offensive.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> of self-renewal. Hajj serves {{as a reminder of}} the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of four hours, a series of blunders in {{planning}} and communication had caused Lee's forces to launch three failed frontal infantry assaults across hundreds of yards of open ground, unsupported by Confederate artillery, charging toward firmly entrenched Union infantry and artillery defenses. These errors provided Union forces <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to inflict heavy casualties. In {{the aftermath of the}} battle, however, the Confederate press heralded Lee as the savior of Richmond. In stark contrast, McClellan was accused of being absent from the battlefield, a harsh criticism that haunted him when he ran for president in 1864.|$|E

The model predicts that legislators <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>opportunity</b> cost of government service will receive better committee assignments. Using data that spans 12 Congresses (97 th to 108 th), I find that when the opportunity cost of Senate service is measured by previous occupation, freshmen senators <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high <b>opportunity</b> cost for serving (those who were lawyers) were given good committee assignments, while freshmen senators <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low <b>opportunity</b> cost for serving (professors, and those with relatives already in politics) were given worse committee assignments.

5|$|Simultaneously, the Germans had {{launched}} Operation Luttich, a desperate and ill-prepared armoured thrust towards Mortain, beginning on 6August 1944. This was halted {{within a day}} and, despite the increasingly dangerous threat presented by the Anglo–Canadian advance on Falaise, the German commander Field Marshal Günther von Kluge was prohibited by Hitler from redeploying his forces. Thus, as American armoured formations advanced towards Argentan from the south, the Allies were presented <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to encircle large sections of the German Seventh Army. The First Canadian Army was ordered south, while the Americans prepared to move on Chambois on 14August. Simonds and Crerar quickly planned a further offensive that would push through to Falaise, trapping the German Seventh Army in Normandy.|$|E

After the successful Battle of Smolensk, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily divert its Panzer groups {{to aid in}} the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev. This pause provided the Red Army <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to mobilise fresh reserves. The Moscow offensive, which resumed in October 1941, ended disastrously in December. On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Four days later, Germany declared war on the United States.|$|E
5|$|Haryanto held a three-second {{advantage}} over Visoiu who had worn his tyres, {{and he was}} unable to maintain the pace. Matsushita overtook Visoiu as a result. Vandoorne was overtaken Visoiu on the pit lane straight with the assistance of DRS {{at the start of the}} 16th lap. Vandoorne began to push hard and lapped one second faster than his teammate Matsushita. He moved in front of Matsushita for second place after starting lap 18, providing him <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to attempt to catch Haryanto during the remainder of the event. Haryanto responded and pulled away from Vandoorne. His teammate Matsushita struggled with pace and was passed by Rossi for third place. Berthon recovered from his poor start and moved ahead of Rossi, with the assistance of DRS, at the start of the final lap. Haryanto crossed the start/finish line after 23 laps to win his first GP2 Series race in his 70th attempt. Vandoorne finished second, ahead of third-placed Berthon. Rossi secured fourth, with Leal fifth. Matsushita, Visoiu, and Negrão rounded out the points-scoring positions. King, Pic, Stanaway, Markelov, de Jong, and Sirotkin filled the next five positions, while Lynn, Nato, Evans, Amberg, Stöckinger, Marciello, Sørensen, and Gasly were the last of the classified finishers.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{most likely}} {{realised}} that this situation presented them <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to destroy an isolated {{part of the}} Persian fleet. Herodotus is not clear on where the Allies planned to meet this detachment, only that they resolved to do so. One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of Euboea, and hope that the other Allied ships, patrolling the coast of Attica, followed the Persians {{as they entered the}} Straits of Euboea from the south; then the Persians might themselves be caught in a trap. Alternatively, the Allies may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by Artemisium, on its journey from Aphetae. Either way, they decided to make a demonstration towards the Persian lines during what remained of the day, to convince the Persians that they were planning to stay at Artemisium. Herodotus also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess Persian seamanship and tactics. The Allies probably waited until late afternoon so that there was little chance of being drawn into a full scale engagement; {{they did not want to}} suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the Persian detachment. These decisions finally led to the beginning of the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis, {{who took}} part in the war, were sometimes, {{motivated}} by grievances, not directly related to Black Hawk's objectives. One such incident was the Indian Creek massacre. In the spring of 1832, Potawatomis living along Indian Creek were upset that a settler named William Davis had dammed the creek, preventing fish from reaching their village. Davis ignored the protests, and assaulted a Potawatomi man who tried to dismantle the dam. The Black Hawk War provided the Indian Creek Potawatomis <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> for revenge. On May 21, about fifty Potawatomis and three Sauks from the British Band attacked Davis's settlement, killing, scalping, and mutilating fifteen men, women, and children. Two teenage girls from the settlement were kidnapped and taken to Black Hawk's camp. A Ho-Chunk chief named White Crow negotiated their release two weeks later. Like other Rock River Ho-Chunks, White Crow was trying to placate the Americans while clandestinely aiding the British Band.|$|E
5|$|Things {{then take}} {{a turn for the}} very worst, as McLaren unsuccessfully {{attempts}} to kill Waingro, who in turn betrays the team to the police. When Hanna arrives on the scene unexpectedly with the police, McLaren and his crew engage them in a mid-street shootout, in which most of McLaren's crew are killed. After making an unlikely escape, McLaren is presented <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to leave Los Angeles for a new life with Eady, but he decides to first take revenge for Waingro's betrayal. However, after McLaren tracks down Waingro to a hotel room, he is ambushed by Hanna and his team. Waingro takes advantage of the confusion to shoot McLaren through a closed door. While Hanna advises Waingro of his options in jail, for a string of previous murders, Waingro resists arrest and tries to pull a gun. In self-defence, Hanna forces Waingro through a hotel window, and Waingro falls fifteen floors to his death. In the final sequences, Hanna is reunited with his wife.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939, Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa—the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union—on 22 June 1941. Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage, destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft {{in the first month}} of fighting. Hitler and his top staff were sure that the campaign would be over by Christmas, and no provisions were made for reserves of men or equipment. But, by July, the Germans had only 1,000 planes remaining in operation, and their troop losses were over 213,000 men. The choice was made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow. After the long, but successful, Battle of Smolensk, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev. The pause provided the Red Army <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to mobilize fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it {{to be one of the}} major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 with the Battle of Moscow. Poor weather conditions, fuel shortages, a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe, and overstretched supply lines were also factors. Hitler did not give permission for even a partial retreat until mid-January 1942; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the French invasion of Russia in 1812.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2011 playoffs as {{the first}} seed in the West, the Canucks were matched against the Blackhawks for the third {{straight}} year. After opening the series with three straight wins, the Canucks lost the next three, forcing a seventh game. After he was pulled in favour of Schneider during Games 4 and 5 – having allowed six and four goals, respectively – Luongo started Game 6 on the bench. During the third period, Schneider suffered an injury, forcing Luongo to finish the game. He made 12 saves in relief of Schneider before Blackhawks forward Ben Smith scored in overtime. Although Schneider was available to play for Game 7, Vigneault chose to start Luongo. He made 31 saves in the deciding game, helping the Canucks to a 2–1 overtime win. His efforts included a cross-ice save on a one-timer from forward Patrick Sharp during a Blackhawks powerplay early on in the extra period. Going head-to-head against fellow Vezina Trophy nominee Pekka Rinne and the Nashville Predators in round two, Luongo kept Nashville to 11 goals over 6 games to help the Canucks advance. He maintained his performance in the Conference Finals against the San Jose Sharks, allowing 13 goals over 5 contests, including 54 saves in the fifth and deciding match, a game that went to double overtime. Luongo's efforts helped the Canucks reach the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time in}} 17 years. He opened the series against the Boston Bruins stopping all 36 shots in a 1–0 win for his third shutout of the post-season. As the series shifted to Boston's TD Garden with a two-games-to-none Canucks lead, Luongo surrendered eight goals in Game 3. The following contest, he was pulled for the third time in the playoffs after allowing 4 goals on 20 shots. Amidst heavy scrutiny from the media and Canucks fans, Luongo recovered for Game 5, stopping all 31 Bruins shots in a 1–0 win. It was his 15th win and 4th shutout of the post-season, tying both of Kirk McLean's single-year playoff team records, previously set in 1994. <b>With</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to clinch the Stanley Cup in Game 6, however, he was pulled again after allowing three goals in less than three minutes in the first period; the game ended in a 5–2 loss. Starting for the deciding seventh game, he allowed 3 goals on 20 shots, including one shorthanded goal, as the Canucks lost 4–0.|$|E
