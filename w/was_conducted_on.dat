5|$|Following Operation Source, {{the task}} of attacking Tirpitz was {{assigned}} to the Home Fleet's aircraft carriers. Following months of preparations, a successful attack (Operation Tungsten) involving two strike forces of 20 Fairey Barracuda dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> 3 April 1944. While Tirpitzs crew suffered heavy casualties during this operation, the battleship was not badly damaged. Nevertheless, she was placed out of action for several additional months while repairs were completed.|$|E

The D-21B reached Lop Nor and back to the recovery point, but the hatch had a partial parachute failure and was lost at sea with its photographs.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conflicting}} {{conclusions of the}} first two, a third post-mortem <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock {{on behalf of the}} Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood. Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final post-mortem that Tomlinson had fallen to {{the ground in front of}} a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence that this had happened. The IPCC ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. The runway is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts of the runway were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> the remaining parts of the runway. An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E

5|$|From 1943 to 1945, he coordinated Manhattan Project work on {{plutonium}} purification and production. He also coordinated {{development of}} techniques to industrially refine polonium {{for use with}} beryllium in the triggers of atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project, part of which <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> the estate of his wife's family. Shortly before the war ended, {{he took over the}} management of the Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Monsanto pulled out of Oak Ridge in December 1947, but became the operator of the Mound Laboratories in 1948. Secretary of State Dean Acheson appointed Thomas to serve on a 1946 panel to appraise international atomic inspection, which culminated in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1953 he was appointed as a consultant to the National Security Council, and served as U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
5|$|Groves and Conant {{were hoping}} to harness his {{industrial}} expertise {{for the benefit of}} the project. They offered him a post as a deputy to Robert Oppenheimer, at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, but he did not wish to move his family or give up his responsibilities at Monsanto. Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at Los Alamos, the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, Radiation laboratory in Berkeley, and Ames Laboratory in Iowa. Monsanto's Central Research Department began to conduct research on behalf of the Manhattan Project as part of the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project, some of which <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> the estate of his wife's family.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 2011, the Australian Minister for Defence Materiel, Jason Clare, {{announced}} that the Sea Kings would be withdrawn from service in December 2011; having flown in excess of 60,000 hours in operations in Australia and overseas in that time. The farewell flight <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> 15 December 2011, three Sea Kings flew over Sydney Harbour and across to Canberra, passing Lake Burley Griffin and the Australian War Memorial before landing at Nowra. On 16 December 2011, the Chief of Navy presided over the ceremonial decommissioning of 817 Squadron RAN at NAS Nowra. Five of the withdrawn helicopters have been made available for sale.

5|$|Operation Paravane was a British {{air raid}} of World War II that inflicted heavy {{damage on the}} German {{battleship}} Tirpitz. The attack <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> 15 September 1944 by 21 Royal Air Force heavy bombers, which flew from an airfield {{in the north of}} the Soviet Union. The battleship was struck by one bomb, and further damaged by several near misses. This damage rendered Tirpitz unfit for combat, and she could not be repaired as it was no longer possible for the Germans to sail her to a major port.|$|E
5|$|Operation Trident and the {{follow-up}} Operation Python were offensive operations {{launched by the}} Indian Navy on Pakistan's port city of Karachi during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Operation Trident saw the first use of anti-ship missiles in combat in the region. The operation <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> the night of 4–5 December and inflicted heavy damage on Pakistani vessels and facilities. While India suffered no losses, Pakistan lost a minesweeper, a destroyer, a cargo vessel carrying ammunition, and fuel storage tanks in Karachi. Another destroyer was also badly damaged and eventually scrapped. India celebrates its Navy Day annually on 4 December to mark this operation.|$|E
5|$|Pohl's {{tenure as}} fleet {{commander}} was brief; by January 1916 hepatic cancer had weakened {{him to the}} point where he was no longer able to carry out his duties. He was replaced by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5–7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the Hoofden. Prinzregent Luitpold was also present during an advance to the Amrun Bank on 2–3 April. Another sortie <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> 21–22 April.|$|E

5|$|The Admiralty {{accepted}} that Barracudas were {{too slow to}} be effective against the Kaafjord area following the failure of Operation Goodwood. As a result, the task of attacking the battleship was transferred to RAF Bomber Command. The first heavy bomber raid against Kaafjord (Operation Paravane) <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> 15 September 1944, with the bombers flying from staging bases in northern Russia. This attack inflicted irreparable damage on Tirpitz, and she was transferred south to the Tromsø area {{to be used as}} an immobile coastal defence battery. The battleship was sunk there with heavy loss of life by another Bomber Command raid on 12 November.|$|E
5|$|The EO-13 crew {{departed}} on 22 July, {{and soon}} after Mir passed through the annual Perseid meteor shower, during which the station was hit by several particles. A spacewalk <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> 28 September to inspect the station's hull, but no serious damage was reported. Soyuz TM-18 arrived on 10 January 1994 carrying the EO-15 crew (including Valeri Polyakov, who was to remain on Mir for 14 months), and Soyuz TM-17 left on 14 January. The undocking was unusual in that the spacecraft was to pass along Kristall {{in order to obtain}} photographs of the APAS to assist in the training of space shuttle pilots. Due to an error in setting up the control system, the spacecraft struck the station a glancing blow during the manoeuvre, scratching the exterior of Kristall.|$|E
5|$|The episode filmed {{for eight}} days. In one sequence, Carl Grimes sparks up a {{cigarette}} lighter and drops {{it onto a}} horde of walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers. Greg Nicotero, the special effect director for The Walking Dead, used black panels to capture {{the elements of the}} fire; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers. To reduce the chances of getting burned, the stuntmen put on several layers of flame retardant suits. The first layer consisted of a dry Nomex undergarment; this was followed by several layers of Nomex clothing that were gelled. Since the sequence <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> multiple occasions, the stuntmen were coated with gel containing cationic polymers. The last layer was a raincoat, which would separate the gel from the stuntmen's clothing and allowed them to be engulfed in flames for several seconds without injury.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the majority of studies <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> pollinators have <b>been</b> performed in adult honeybees (Apis mellifera). Very few studies have <b>been</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> wild bees, most of which are solitary and raise their young in burrows and small colonies. There are also few studies that have <b>been</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> brood, larvae, or the queen, making it difficult to determine the impact of pesticides on different members of the colony and life stages of the bee. Although a number of field and semi-field studies have <b>been</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> imidacloprid and bees, these studies have design and implementation deficiencies, which make them unusable. Thus, the chronic effects of imidacloprid in the field are still unknown.|$|R
