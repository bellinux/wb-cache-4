40|$|In {{times when}} {{universities}} are becoming less self-evident, these organizations may be confounded {{in terms of}} which aspects of its activities and performances they should communicate with their stakeholders. A related question – central to our study – is how they communicate. This paper analyses the style of one particular type of communication: <b>welcome</b> <b>addresses</b> of key spokespersons of UK universities. Building on the pertinent image and identity literature and using Speech Act Theory, we expected to find differences between universities by prestige and age and over time. We found that older universities use different styles compared to younger universities, {{and that there were}} also differences by prestige. We also found considerable changes over time. The findings suggest we should not see these <b>welcome</b> <b>addresses</b> as purely ceremonial, but as intentional messages with communication styles that reflect the organizational attributes of the university...|$|R

2500|$|Young Jagjivan {{attended}} {{a local school}} in January 1914. Upon the premature death of his father, Jagjivan and his mother Vasanti Devi were left in a harsh economic situation. He joined Aggrawal Middle School in Arrah in 1920, where the medium of instruction was English for the first time, and joined Arrah Town School in 1922. It was here that he faced caste discrimination for the first time, yet remained unfazed. An often cited incident occurred in this school; there was a tradition of having two water pots in the school, one for Hindus and another for Muslims. Jagjivan drank water from the Hindu pot, {{and because he was}} from an untouchable class, the matter was reported to the Principal, who placed a third pot for [...] "untouchables" [...] in the school. Jagjivan broke this pot twice in protest, until the Principal decided against placing the third pot. A turning point in his life came in 1925, when Pt. Madan Mohan Malviya visited his school, and impressed by his <b>welcome</b> <b>address,</b> invited him to join the Banaras Hindu University.|$|E

40|$|The {{transformation}} {{to a more}} market-oriented steering {{approach in}} European higher education challenges universities and other higher education institutions to consider developing branding or image management activities. The existing literature focuses either on the content or the style, but we argue that an integrated perspective is needed to fully grasp the processes underlying branding. In a comparative case study of ten UK higher education institutions with varying reputations – five highly reputed versus five low(er) reputed institutions – we demonstrate how and why branding is deployed in <b>welcome</b> <b>addresses</b> of institutional leaders. Our findings indicate that isomorphic tendencies are visible, although brand differentiation could also be identified between highly and lowly reputed institutions. Our findings provide support for the competitive group perspective on branding activities...|$|R
