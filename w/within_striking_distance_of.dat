5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactic of}} {{continuous}} forward patrolling {{was so successful}} that the advancing force's every move was known to the defenders, but the light horsemen were substantially outnumbered and could not stop the advance. By daylight on 3 August, the German, Austrian and Ottoman force had occupied Katia and were <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> Romani, Dueidar, Hill 70 and the Suez Canal. Their line ran north-east and south-west from the Bardawil Lagoon to east of Katia, with their left flank thrown well forward.|$|E
5|$|Moscow {{itself was}} also hastily fortified. According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and {{teenagers}} worked building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million {{cubic meters of}} earth with no mechanical help. Moscow's factories were hastily converted to military tasks: one automobile factory {{was turned into a}} submachine gun armory, a clock factory manufactured mine detonators, the chocolate factory shifted to food production for the front, and automobile repair stations worked fixing damaged tanks and military vehicles. Despite these preparations, the capital was <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> German tanks, with the Luftwaffe mounting large-scale air raids on the city. The air raids caused only limited damage because of extensive anti-aircraft defenses and effective civilian fire brigades.|$|E

5|$|On 23 September, General Mark W. Clark, the Commander-In-Chief of United Nations Forces in Korea, came aboard Iowa. Clark {{observed}} Iowa {{in action}} as her guns shelled the Wonsan {{area for a}} third time, accounting {{for the destruction of}} a major enemy ammunition dump. On 25 September, Iowa fired her guns at an enemy railroad and 30-car train. The following month, Iowa was part of the force involved in Operation Decoy, a feint to draw enemy troops into Kojo and bring them <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the battleships' big guns. During the operation, Iowa provided anti-aircraft support to , an amphibious force command ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{draft was}} largely {{made up of}} aging veterans, giving the Buccaneers little basis for success. The lack of medical information provided on players in the expansion draft contributed heavily to the team’s problems, as they finished the season with 17 players on injured reserve. They were last {{in the league in}} points scored, touchdowns, and rushing touchdowns. After a 19-point 4th-quarter performance brought them <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> a victory in week 8 against the Kansas City Chiefs, they were blown out of every game the rest of the season. Subsequent expansion teams were given a more generous allotment of draft picks and expansion draft opportunities, in part to avoid a repeat of the Buccaneers’ difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Operation Winter '94 {{pushed back}} {{the front line}} of the VRS by about , {{capturing}} much of the Livanjsko field. The attack failed to achieve its primary objective but it brought the Croatian forces <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the Drvar–Knin road. Operation Winter '94 was followed by Operation Leap1 (Operacija Skok1) on 7 April 1995, which improved HV positions on Mount Dinara on the southern rim of the field, dominating the area around the RSK capital. The Croatian forces renewed their advance with Operation Leap2 between 4 and 10 June, allowing them to directly threaten Bosansko Grahovo on the Drvar–Knin road, and to secure the remainder of the valley. The improved Croatian dispositions around Livanjsko field provided a springboard for further offensive action on this front during Operation Summer'95.|$|E
25|$|Following the Soviet Union's {{withdrawal}} from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 {{had put the}} Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were <b>within</b> easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.|$|R

50|$|The {{great egret}} feeds {{in shallow water}} or drier habitats, feeding mainly on fish, frogs, small mammals, and {{occasionally}} small reptiles and insects, spearing them with its long, sharp bill {{most of the time}} by standing still and allowing the prey to come <b>within</b> its <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> its bill which it uses as a spear. It will often wait motionless for prey, or slowly stalk its victim.|$|R
5|$|Pressey became {{captain of}} the Missouri team as a junior. CBS Sports listed him as a 2012 first team preseason All-American and the 8th best player in its preseason top 100. Sports Illustrated also named him to its preseason All-American first team. CBS also named him the second best point guard (behind Isaiah Canaan). Pressey was both a preseason John R. Wooden Award top 50 {{selection}} and a preseason Naismith Award top 50 selection in 2012. Pressey was the preseason SEC {{player of the year}} selection by the SEC media and a first team All-SEC selection by the coaches.

5|$|With the {{addition}} of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster in March 1945, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to Tinian, an island in the northern Marianas <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> Japan, in May and June 1945. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian all 51 civilian and military personnel of Project Alberta. Furthermore, two representatives from Washington, D.C. were present on the island: the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell of the Military Policy Committee.|$|E
5|$|Before {{they could}} deploy, the two mounted {{divisions}} of Desert Mounted Corps had to ride between , {{to bring them}} <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> Beersheba at dawn on 31 October. Chauvel arrived at the Asluj Desert Mounted Corps headquarters during the afternoon of 30 October, when arrangements were completed for {{the continuation of the}} marches by the Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions. The Anzac Mounted Division was at Asluj, the Australian Mounted Division was at Khalasa (three hours' march behind) and the 7th Mounted Brigade was at Bir el Esani. The No. 11 Light Armoured Motor Battery (LAMB) was sent ahead of the Anzac Mounted Division to a position on the north slopes of the Gebel el Shereif to guard their flank as they moved forward. The divisional headquarters at Asluj closed at 17:30, and the last Anzac divisional troops left the railway station a half-hour later.|$|E
50|$|Rattlesnakes are {{primarily}} ambush hunters; they coil and lie waiting for prey to approach <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance.</b> The diet <b>of</b> C. willardi includes small mammals, lizards, birds, and large centipedes. The young feed primarily on large centipedes (Scolopendra spp.) and lizards, whereas adults feed primarily on mammals and birds.|$|R
25|$|Pele {{played the}} ball well ahead of Alberto, using space intelligently, so that the fast fullback ran on and shot without pausing, in full stride, smashing {{the ball into the}} Italian net. So {{effective}} was Brazil's use of width, that no Italian defender is even <b>within</b> reasonable <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> Alberto until the last moment. The principle of width stretched and drew the Italian defence. The principle of depth—fresh men moving up from the rear—allowed Brazil to exploit the gaps created by width.|$|R

5|$|Colonel Bouquet, delayed in Pennsylvania while {{mustering}} the militia, finally set {{out from}} Fort Pitt on October 3, 1764, with 1,150 men. He marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country, <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> a number of native villages. Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, the Ohio Native Americans were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Native Americans return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, {{many of whom had}} been adopted into Native families. Because not all of the captives were present, the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Native Americans agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Singapore Harbour was codenamed Operation Jaywick, {{the brand name}} of a popular {{lavatory}} deodoriser, and {{had nothing to do}} with guerrillas or fifth columnists. It had been carried out by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon from 'Z' Special Unit, a group of AngloAustralian commandos who had sailed from Western Australia to Singapore in an old Japanese fishing boat, the Krait, named after a Malayan snake. Once <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the harbour, the commandos took to folboats (folding canoes), and paddled into the docks under cover of night. Using limpet mines, they sank six Japanese ships of 2,0005,000 tons, including several tankers, and then slipped away to their rendezvous with the Krait, finally returning successfully to Australia. (The Krait is now preserved and on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney). The Japanese could not conceive that a force could penetrate their lines of defence and have the audacity to attack their shipping. They therefore concluded that it must have been an internal operation, carried out by Chinese guerrillas organised from Changi Prison.|$|E

60|$|Rikki-tikki smashed two eggs, {{and tumbled}} {{backward}} down the melon-bed {{with the third}} egg in his mouth, and scuttled to the veranda {{as hard as he}} could put foot to the ground. Teddy and his mother and father were there at early breakfast, but Rikki-tikki saw that they were not eating anything. They sat stone-still, and their faces were white. Nagaina was coiled up on the matting by Teddy's chair, <b>within</b> easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> Teddy's bare leg, and she was swaying to and fro, singing a song of triumph.|$|R
60|$|Gassion {{conducted}} {{the movements of}} the army so adroitly that he had brought it to <b>within</b> almost <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish divisions before Marshal l'Hopital perceived {{the fact that it was}} so placed that a battle was almost inevitable. He besought Enghien to fall back while there was yet time, pointing out the orders that had been given that a battle was not to be hazarded, and the terrible misfortunes that would fall upon France in case of defeat. Enghien, however, was deaf to his advice, and refused to acknowledge his authority.|$|R
50|$|A primary {{complaint}} about Jupiter {{was that the}} design's shorter range placed it <b>within</b> relatively easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> Soviet weapons, both missiles and aircraft. Thor, based in the UK, would likely have more warning of an impending attack. This is precisely {{the reason that the}} Army spent considerable effort on making Jupiter mobile, in order to make surprise attacks difficult without prior aerial reconnaissance missions.|$|R
25|$|Venegas was now greatly alarmed. He {{raised a}} {{battalion}} of volunteers, which he stationed at Paseo de Bucareli, on {{the western edge of}} the city. However, in a moment of apparent indecision, Father Hidalgo, after a series of triumphs and <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the poorly defended capital, ordered a retreat toward Vallodalid.

25|$|If all {{our efforts}} for an {{agreement}} fail, {{and if it}} is not possible to obtain this equality in such matters as I have indicated, then any Government of this country—a National Government more than any, and this Government—will see to it that in air strength and air power this country shall no longer be in a position inferior to any country <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> our shores.|$|E
25|$|It {{was already}} too late. The Japanese armies in Central Burma had lost most of their equipment, and their cohesion. They {{would be unable to}} stop the Fourteenth Army {{exploiting}} to <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> Rangoon. Furthermore, with the loss of Mandalay, the Burmese population finally turned against the Japanese. Uprisings by guerilla forces and a revolt by the Burma National Army, which the Japanese had formed two years previously, would contribute to the eventual Japanese defeat.|$|E
50|$|Nearly 35,000 strong, well {{motivated}} and supremely confident, the Zulu were a formidable force {{on their own}} home ground, despite the almost total lack of modern weaponry. Their greatest assets were their morale, unit leadership, mobility and numbers. Tactically the Zulu acquitted themselves well in at least 3 encounters, Isandhlwana, Hlobane and the smaller Intombi action. Their stealthy approach march, camouflage and noise discipline at Isandhlwana, while not perfect, put them <b>within</b> excellent <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> their opponents, where {{they were able to}} exploit weaknesses in the camp layout. At Hlobane they caught a British column on the move rather than in the usual fortified position, partially cutting off its retreat and forcing it to withdraw.|$|R
50|$|One of the West's main {{concerns}} was {{the significant}} threat Iraq posed to Saudi Arabia. Following Kuwait's conquest, the Iraqi Army was <b>within</b> easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> Saudi oil fields. Control of these fields, along with Kuwaiti and Iraqi reserves, {{would have given}} Saddam control over {{the majority of the}} world's oil reserves. Iraq also had a number of grievances with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis had lent Iraq some 26 billion dollars during its war with Iran. The Saudis had backed Iraq in that war, as they feared the influence of Shia Iran's Islamic revolution on its own Shia minority. After the war, Saddam felt he shouldn't have to repay the loans due to the help he had given the Saudis by fighting Iran.|$|R
40|$|Rural and {{regional}} Australia {{have had a}} hard time of late. The economies of Sydney and Melbourne are growing, but {{much of the rest of}} their states are not. The population of regional areas is stagnating and agriculture is struggling. Perhaps worst of all there is a feeling that no-one in Canberra or in the booming coastal periphery cares about this. The people of Orange have apparently spoken. Outside Sydney, behind what seems like an impervious sandstone curtain, not all is well. Even the largest towns in regional New South Wales are struggling to retain their populations and have faced difficult economic times through the present decade, although the drought years have faded away. Agriculture still matters, for employment and exports, but mechanisation has cost jobs. Farming is still how people see rural {{and regional}} Australia, but it is certainly not the only thing. There is more to rural Australia than agriculture, and most places have shifted away from the mass production of agricultural commodities - move over the wheat-sheep belt - towards the marketing of rural lifestyles and landscapes. Farming becomes valuable as scenery. City people can be tempted for weekends away and old-fashioned farm stays have evolved. But that works most easily for NSW coastal towns - like Berry and Kiama - that are <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distances</b> <b>of</b> capital cities. More distant inland places have had to work a little harder to diversify. Ironically, Orange is one of the towns that have led the way in terms of change. An enormously successful FOOD (Food of Orange District) festival has drawn in city crowds and tempted some to remain. At the other end of the state, the Tamworth Country Music Festival has grown every year and been a massive boost to regional income...|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the rivalry between the United States and the USSR {{accelerated}} markedly. Nuclear arms production proliferation increased as significantly as the Soviet Union exploded its first nuclear bomb in 1949, and in 1953, their first hydrogen bomb. The Korean War broke {{out and the}} US adopted the strategy of massive retaliation following any use of nuclear weapons. This policy boosted the strategic value of Scandinavia as a potential location for strategic bombers <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the USSR.|$|E
25|$|During 1968–1969, Tyrannosaurus Rex {{had become}} a modest success on radio and on record, and they {{released}} three albums, the third of which, Unicorn, came <b>within</b> <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the UK Top 10 Albums. While Bolan's early solo material was rock and roll-influenced pop music, by now he was writing dramatic and baroque songs with lush melodies and surreal lyrics filled with Greek and Persian mythology as well as poetic creations of his own. The band became regulars on Peel Sessions on BBC radio, and toured Britain's student union halls.|$|E
25|$|In August 1916 the EEF {{victory at}} Romani ended the {{possibility}} of land-based attacks on the Suez Canal, first threatened in February 1915 by the Ottoman Raid on the Suez Canal.

50|$|Herbert now APD-22 sailed for the Pacific, {{reaching}} San Diego for amphibious {{training and}} continuing on to Cape Sudest, New Guinea, via Pearl Harbor 23 March 1944. She disembarked troops {{for the initial}} invasion at Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, 22 April and then spent a month on convoy escort duty before landing troops for the invasion of Biak Island 27 May. Landings at Warsai in the Cape Sansapor area 30 July followed further patrol and escort duty, and 15 September found Herbert off Morotai. Troops landed under naval cover to secure the airfield, which was <b>within</b> easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the Philippines, next major step in the island-hopping war across the Pacific. On 17 October, 2 days before the initial landings at Leyte Gulf, Herbert landed Rangers on Homonhon Island which controlled {{the entrance to the}} Gulf. The destroyer remained in the Philippines, under almost constant Japanese air attack, throughout the rest of 1944; and, in January 1945, landed support troops at Lingayen Gulf.|$|R
50|$|In 1967-68, {{a fantastic}} season for FA Cup football, Colchester were dreadful in the League. A trip to Torquay earned United a First Round replay at Layer Road which they won 2-1 {{to set up}} a local derby at Chelmsford. New Writtle Street was packed with 16,400 as United {{despatched}} the Southern Leaguers by 2-0. Once again Layer Road hosted a top flight side as West Bromwich Albion visited in the Third Round. An all ticket crowd of just under 16,000 saw United take an early lead through Stratton only for the Baggies to equalise with a questionable penalty. United sank by 4-0 at The Hawthorns in the replay. With all the attention on the FA Cup, U's League form had dipped. From being <b>within</b> a <b>striking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> a promotion place, Colchester lost 15 of their remaining 22 games after Boxing Day 1967 winning just once. Colchester's third relegation in eight seasons was too much and Franklin was sacked just two days after the season's end.|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to the Confederate attack on Fort Stedman, {{on the afternoon of}} March 25, at the Battle of Jones's Farm, Union forces of II Corps and VI Corps (Sixth Corps) captured Confederate picket lines near Armstrong's Mill and extended the left end of the Union line about [...] closer to the Confederate fortifications. This put the VI Corps which was holding this section of the line <b>within</b> easy <b>striking</b> <b>distance,</b> about , <b>of</b> the Confederate line.
