Both [...] "brooding" [...] and hopeful {{at the same}} time, Jay Jason of Comicbook.com believes that the song's lyrics are inspired by the popular saying [...] "If you love someone, let them go." [...] Stevens' voice quavers with emotion when he sings the phrase [...] "I never needed anybody in my life". Amanda Greever of The Daily Times insists that the song's lyrics will move all listeners to tears. Featuring lyrics that revolve around heartache and heartbreak, [...] "Evermore"'s chorus reads: [...] "Now I know she'll never leave me/Even as she runs away/She will still torment me/Call me, hurt me/Move me, come what may/Wasting in my lonely tower/Waiting by an open door/I'll fool myself, she'll <b>walk</b> <b>right</b> in/And be with me for evermore", which Stevens performs vulnerably. The track also discusses themes such as true love, sacrifice and learning to understand love. Stevens sings within the vocal range of a [...] "deep, resonating baritone" [...] throughout the song, which lasts a total duration of three minutes and fourteen seconds; Channel NewsAsia contributor Genevieve Sarah Loh compared Stevens' voice, whose notes are suspended by the instrumentation, to [...] "melted-chocolate", gradually becoming more human-sounding as the song progresses. Belting comfortably, Stevens' voice {{has been compared to}} that of Terrence Man, the actor who originated the role of the Beast in the Broadway adaptation and recorded [...] "If I Can't Love Her". Some traces of Auto-Tune can be heard in Stevens' performance.|$|E

"The {{garden is}} divided into two {{portions}} – the fruit garden and the vegetable garden; good wide slips of ground are also carried all round outside the walls for cultural purposes and a nice young orchard of thriving trees occupies a space between the garden and a public road. The ground in the fruit garden has been made almost if not quite level that in th vegetable garden has a regular and even fall. Immense quantities of earth had to be moved to secure these forms of surface and it was turned to account thus:- At the boundary of the fruit garden a thick retaining wall was built; in front of this the back wall for a range of glass running right across the garden was built leaving room for fruit rooms, sheds stoke holes etc. between the two walls. All the spare earth was thus used to fill up the space between the two walls and to carry a terrace <b>walk</b> <b>right</b> across the garden, eight or ten feet above the vegetable ground." ...|$|E
