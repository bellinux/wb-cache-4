500|$|Full albums {{were also}} made {{available}} as downloadable content; the remaining songs from Abbey Road, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Rubber Soul {{have since been}} released on the consoles' respective store services. While there is potential for the entire Beatles catalogue to be made available, this will be unlikely, according to John Drake of Harmonix. Drake identified the costly development process as a potentially prohibitive factor: [...] "Every time we do one song, it's not like Rock Band where <b>we</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the masters {{to come in and}} just author them... its like, send people to Abbey Road, use the original tape, separate them out... it costs thousands of dollars." [...] Drake asserted that Harmonix would take sales of the currently announced albums into consideration before continuing development of downloadable content. Harmonix's Foster stated that solo acts from the Beatles' members will not be included as downloadable content for The Beatles: Rock Band; however, he did not rule out the possibility of these acts appearing in other Rock Band games. A three pack of songs from Paul McCartney's 2009 live album, Good Evening New York City, was made available for the main Rock Band series on 5 January 2010. John Lennon's [...] "Imagine" [...] {{is a part of the}} Rock Band 3 soundtrack, with the full Imagine album arriving later as downloadable content in celebration of Lennon's 70th birthday. A pack featuring Paul McCartney's band Wings was also released as DLC for Rock Band 3 on 28 December 2010.|$|E
500|$|The film {{generated}} {{some political}} controversy. Republican members of Congress {{complained about the}} film's obviously leftist politics, and demanded that Will H. Hays, President of the Motion Picture Production Code, establish guidelines regarding propagandization for the motion picture industry. Critical reaction {{at the time was}} mixed. While at least one reviewer felt the film was reminiscent of motion pictures like Citizen Kane and Rebecca, Hedda Hopper called it [...] "Citizen Kane with all the art scraped off". Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, concluded that while {{the first half of the}} film was very good, the latter half felt slow and failed to deliver emotional punch. Crowther called the film [...] "a courageous and timely drama" [...] and praised Tracy and Hepburn for performances that featured [...] "taut solemnity". But the script seemed uneven dramatically ("...the nature of this story is a murder mystery and yet the interest is centered much more upon the dead man than on the hunt"), and a critical problem was that the audience [...] "is informed much sooner than the journalist what the nature of Forrest was, and the story drags while <b>we</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the journalist to catch up." [...] Crowther still enjoyed Cukor's direction, which he felt sustained mystery even when little existed. Like Crowther, the Chicago Tribune and other critics pointed out that the picture seemed slow. The Hartford Courant, meanwhile, raved about the film: [...] "Hepburn and Tracy have given us a great film in Keeper of the Flame... Great because of the courage and daring it took to make it, the magnificent production it has been given, the excellent acting within it, and the exciting, tense story it contains." [...] Generally speaking, the film was better received in the eastern half of the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Many deaths followed, as {{the direct}} results of {{starvation}} and exhaustion, while the local German troops carried out selective shootings. The survivors were sent {{back over the}} river, and the German commanders expressed irritation over the methods applied by their counterparts. Romanian authorities subsequently introduced ghettos or transit camps. After the annexation of Transnistria, there ensued a systematic deportation of Jews from Bessarabia, with additional transports of Jews from the Old Kingdom (especially Moldavia-proper). Based on an assignment Antonescu handed down to General Ioan Topor, the decision involved specific quotas, and the transports, {{most of which were}} carried out by foot, involved random murders. In conjunction with Antonescu's expansionist ambitions, {{it is possible that the}} ultimate destination for the survivors, once circumstances permitted it, was further east than the Southern Bug. On 11 October 1941, the chief of the Federation of Jewish Communities, Wilhelm Filderman issued a public letter to Antonescu asking him to stop the deportations, writing: [...] "This is death, death for no reason except that they are Jews." [...] Antonescu replied to Filderman in a long letter explaining that because the entire Jewish community of Bessarabia had allegedly collaborated with the Soviets during the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia, his policies were a justified act of revenge. On 11 November 1941, Antonescu sent Filderman a second letter stating no Jews would be allowed to live in the [...] "liberated territories" [...] and as for the Jews of the Regat: [...] "We decided to defend our Romanian rights because our all-too-tolerant past was taken advantage of by the Jews and facilitated the abuse of our rights by foreigners, particularly the Jews...We are determined to put an end to this situation. We cannot afford to put in jeopardy the existence of our nation because of several hundred thousand Jews, or in order to salvage some principle of humane democracy that has not been understood properly." [...] The deportees' remaining property was nationalized, confiscated or left available for plunder. With its own Jewish population confined and subjected to extermination, Transnistria became infamous in short time, especially so for its three main concentration camps: Peciora, Akhmechetka, Bogdanovka, Domanovka and Obodovka. Manned by Romanian Gendarmes and local Ukrainian auxiliaries who acted with the consent of central authorities, Transnistrian localities became the sites of mass executions, particularly after the administrators became worried about the spread of typhus from the camps and into the surrounding region. At a Cabinet meeting on 16 December 1941 to discuss the fate of the Jews of Transnistria, Antonescu stated: [...] "The question of the Yids is being discussed in Berlin. The Germans want to bring the Yids from Europe to Russia and settle them in certain areas, but there is still time before this plan is carried out. Meanwhile, what should we do? Shall <b>we</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> a decision in Berlin? Shall <b>we</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> a decision that concerns us? Shall we ensure their safety? Pack them into catacombs! Throw them into the Black Sea! As far I am concerned, 100 may die, 1, 000 may die, all of them may die" [...] Between 21-24 and 28–31 December 1941, Romanian gendarmes and Ukrainian auxiliaries killed about 70, 000 Jews at the Bogdanovca camp; the massacre was Antonescu's way of dealing a typhus epidemic that had broken out among the Jews of Transistria owing to the poor living conditions that had been forced to endure. [...] The last wave of Jewish deportations, occurring in June 1942, came mainly from the Cernăuți area in Northern Bukovina.|$|E
2500|$|Considerable media {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the ideology and pathology of Zehaf-Bibeau. Along with Martin Couture-Rouleau and Justin Bourque, he has been labelled a [...] "lone-wolf terrorist". Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau were [...] "both self-radicalized and adrift in their lives and connected in their sympathy to radical Islamic ideology." [...] Other opinions diverged from simply calling Zehaf-Bibeau a terrorist. Vancouver Sun columnist Ian Mulgrew commented on how the incident, as well as a failed bombing attempt in Victoria by persons motivated similarly to Zehaf-Bibeau, showed 'gaping holes' in the social security net. [...] "These incidents are examples not of Muslim extremism but of the lack of community support for the dysfunctional of any faith who, with a lack of proper attention or the wrong catalyst, become dangerous. I know which approach would make me feel safer, what I would call real security measures: a social safety net that caught those in obvious need before they went postal, people like Zehaf-Bibeau." [...] Green Party leader Elizabeth May said in the House of Commons: [...] "I would put money on these being the acts of isolated, disturbed and deeply troubled men who were drawn to something crazy. I do not believe that it was a vast network, or that the country is more at risk today than it was last week. However, that is my opinion. I can be wrong...I am undoubtedly going to be wrong again, but what I would like to suggest is that <b>we</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> answers from the police before we make assumptions, and that we speak calmly, truthfully and openly to all Canadians." ...|$|E
