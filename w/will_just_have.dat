25|$|Treatment of {{anorexia}} involves restoring {{a healthy}} weight, treating the underlying psychological problems, and addressing behaviors that promote the problem. While medications do not help with weight gain, {{they may be}} used to help with associated anxiety or depression. A number of types of therapy may be useful including an approach where parents assume responsibility for feeding their child, known as Maudsley family therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Sometimes people require admission to hospital to restore weight. Evidence for benefit from nasogastric tube feeding, however, is unclear. Some people <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> a single episode and recover while others may have many episodes over years. Many complications improve or resolve with regaining of weight.|$|E
500|$|Under {{the auspices}} of State Secretary Wilhelm Stuckart the Reich Interior Ministry {{produced}} an initial memo for the planned annexation of a strip of eastern France in June 1940, stretching {{from the mouth of}} the Somme to Lake Geneva, and on July 10, 1940, Himmler toured the region to inspect its Germanization potential. According to documents produced in December 1940, the annexed territory would consist of nine French departments, and the Germanization action would require the settlement of a million Germans from [...] "peasant families". Himmler decided that South Tyrolean emigrants (see South Tyrol Option Agreement) would be used as settlers, and the towns of the region would receive South Tyrolean place-names such as Bozen, Brixen, Meran, and so on. By 1942 Hitler had, however, decided that the South Tyroleans would be instead used to settle the Crimea, and Himmler regretfully noted [...] "For Burgundy, we <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to find another [...] ethnic group." ...|$|E
500|$|In A Midsummer Night's Dream, Theseus, the Duke of Athens, is {{preparing}} to marry Hippolyta. Peter Quince decides to entertain her and hires a group of actors nicknamed the Rude Mechanicals to perform Pyramus and Thisbe, a love story. Robin {{is one of the}} Rude Mechanicals, the tailor, who gathers with his colleagues to prepare their production. Robin at first is told to play the part of Thisbe's mother, but Peter Quince points out that a love story needs moonlight shining on the lovers to have any real effect on the audience. After Nick Bottom suggests looking in the almanac for a time when the Moon might shine on their performance, the players apparently decide that they <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> Robin act as Moonshine. Robin's role as Moonshine in The Mechanical's performance of Pyramus and Thisbe before Theseus' court is often highlighted by scholars as among the funnier parts of the play. Although the court makes fun of all the players, Starveling is mocked the most by Hippolyta, who is very vocal in her opinion that his attempt to be moonshine is a ridiculous failure, although very humorous. [...] He is also the only mechanical to be cut off in his monologue as opposed to being mocked afterwards, causing him to fluster and summarise his lines rather than giving them. [...] This summary is usually played angrily or irritably, but has also been performed as the climax of Starveling's potential stage fright. [...] Starveling is the member of the group that seems to be afraid of just about anything. [...] Starveling is the most ambiguous in taking sides in the power struggle between Bottom and Quince. [...] While Snout affirms whatever Quince says and Flute always looks to Bottom for the final word on something (Snug is too slow to be bothered), Starveling seems to try to agree completely with both, as impossible as it is to do so.|$|E

500|$|First Contact {{garnered}} positive reviews on release. Ryan Gilbey of The Independent {{considered the}} film wise {{to dispense with}} the cast of The Original Series: [...] "For the first time, a Star Trek movie actually looks like something more ambitious than an extended TV show," [...] he wrote. Conversely, critic Bob Thompson felt that First Contact was more {{in the spirit of}} the 1960s television series than any previous installment. The Globe and Mail Elizabeth Renzeti said that First Contact succeeded in improving on the [...] "stilted" [...] previous entry in the series, and that it featured a renewed interest in storytelling. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "First Contact does everything you'd want a Star Trek film to do, and it does it with cheerfulness and style." [...] Adrian Martin of The Age noted that the film was geared towards pleasing fans: [...] "Strangers to this fanciful world first delineated by Gene Roddenberry <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to struggle to comprehend as best they can," [...] he wrote, but [...] "cult-followers will be in heaven". The New York Times Janet Maslin said that the [...] "film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees" [...] of the series, while Variety Joe Leydon wrote that the film did not require intimate knowledge of the series and that fans and non-fans alike would enjoy the film. While Renzetti considered the lack of old characters from the previous seven movies a welcome change, Maslin said that without the original stars, [...] "The series now lacks [...] much of its earlier determination. It has morphed into something less innocent and more derivative than it used to be, something the noncultist is never less likely to enjoy." [...] For one thing, this film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees. }} Conversely, Roger Ebert called First Contact one of the best Star Trek films, and James Berardinelli found the film the most entertaining Star Trek feature in a decade; [...] "It has single-handedly revived the Star Trek movie series, at least from a creative point of view," [...] he wrote.|$|E

2500|$|On October 31, 2000, Twiztid {{released}} {{their second}} studio album and second overall album, Freek Show. In {{his review of}} the album, Allmusic's Brad Mills wrote that [...] "this kind of music appeals to a small sector of hip-hop listeners and will probably do well within [...] niche market, but the average hip-hop listener <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> {{to understand that this}} {{is a different kind of}} album." [...] The album peaked at #51 on the Billboard 200. Twiztid released their first compilation album and third overall album, Cryptic Collectionon November 13, 2000.|$|E

2500|$|Yet at no {{time was}} Dupont's Andalusian {{expedition}} altogether scrapped. Savary continued to issue vague orders promising reinforcements at an undisclosed date while Napoleon fumed {{at the prospect of}} abandoning even Andújar to the Spaniards. With events hanging in the air, Dupont chose to hold his ground along the Guadalquivir, sacking and occupying the town of Bailén and the provincial capital of Jaén, instead of completing his retrograde movement to the strong positions atop the sierra's defiles. Napoleon wrote lightly, [...] "even if he suffers a setback, ...he <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to come back over the Sierra." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 23, 2007, Bryant {{became the}} {{youngest}} player (29 years, 122 days) to reach 20,000 points, {{in a game against}} the New York Knicks, in Madison Square Garden. This record has since been broken by LeBron James. Despite an injury to his shooting hand's small finger, described as [...] "a complete tear of the radial collateral ligament, an avulsion fracture, and a volar plate injury at the MCP joint" [...] that occurred in a game on February 5, 2008, Bryant played all 82 games of the regular season instead of opting for surgery. Regarding his injury, he stated, [...] "I would prefer to delay any surgical procedure until after our Lakers season, and this summer's Olympic Games. But, this is an injury that [...] and the Lakers' medical staff <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to continue to monitor on a day-to-day basis." [...] In early September 2008, Bryant decided not to have surgery to repair the injury.|$|E

2500|$|Her loss in The Voice of the Philippines did {{not stop}} her career as Morissette went on with TV guestings, mall tours, and other {{activities}} together with her fellow Voice of the Philippines finalists. Despite her departure from the competition, comparisons between her and Sarah Geronimo, her mentor, continued to hound her. This was not helped {{by the fact that}} the two have a striking resemblance to each other, an observation which Sarah herself acknowledged during the blind audition, and was noticed as early as her 2010 audition for Talentadong Pinoy. Moreover, even at the outset two judges in the audition noted similarities in the vocal style of the two singers, which was unsurprising given that Amon has always acknowledged Geronimo as a major influence on her, to the point of calling Sarah as her [...] "idol". [...] In an interview, Amon clarified that in the beginning she felt hurt from the comparisons, but at present she considers it an honor. She further elaborated that she <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to do [...] "something different" [...] and find the means to break away from the shadow of her former mentor, and thus establish her own identity.|$|E
2500|$|While {{he stated}} {{the song was}}n't [...] "full throttle" [...] as her past singles, Nick Levine of Digital Spy said the song was danceable, commenting it [...] "manages to be chunky and zesty at the same time." [...] He further complimented its {{dancefloor}} appeal, saying, [...] "it's enough to have K.Ro fearing for her 'Commander' title," [...] while preferring the subsequent release of uptempo songs, stating, [...] "At this rate, Burkey's big mobiles-in-the-air moment <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to wait." [...] Giving the song a perfect five out of five stars review, a Popjustice writer called the song [...] "jaunty." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Chart Blog said called the song [...] "deliriously happy, {{to the point of}} being simple-minded, and conjures up instant images of warmth and sunshiney freedom in everyone that hears it." [...] McAlpine also pointed out her label's wise decision to release it right at the ending of summer, with fans pining for more of the vacation season and waiting until Christmas. FemaleFirst said [...] "the track is set to cause a long-lasting heat wave when it hits radio in July" [...] and [...] "will also be blazing club floors across the country once again." [...] The review went on to say that the single [...] "has cemented her place as the UK’s prime female recording artist." ...|$|E
