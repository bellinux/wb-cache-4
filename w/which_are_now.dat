5|$|A {{century of}} storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> encased in the Ross Ice Shelf as it inches towards the Ross Sea. In 2001 {{glaciologist}} Charles R. Bentley {{estimated that the}} tent with the bodies was under about 75feet (23m) of ice and about 30miles (48km) from {{the point where they}} died; he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea, and perhaps float away inside an iceberg.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} decline {{began with the}} {{abolition}} of the Zaporozhian Host by Catherine II of Russia. In 1786 the Russian Imperial government closed the monastery and confiscated its valuable treasures. The remaining Zaporozhian Cossacks soon afterwards left Zaporizhia, and moved to the Kuban region. There they founded the Kuban Cossack Host, which still exists to this day. The cossacks were able to leave with some of the monastery's manuscripts, some of <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> kept in the Krasnodar Krai Archive.|$|E

5|$|A wider survey, {{but less}} sensitive, {{was carried out}} {{as part of the}} Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey; a section of this was then {{observed}} for longer to create the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, which was the most sensitive optical deep field image for years until the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field was completed in 2012. Images from the Extreme Deep Field, or XDF, were released on 26 September 2012 to a number of media agencies. Images released in the XDF show galaxies <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> believed to have formed in the first 500 million years following the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Both written {{history and}} {{molecular}} genetic {{studies indicate that}} the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia. Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.|$|E
5|$|Cannon also {{transformed}} naval warfare: the Royal Navy, in particular, {{took advantage}} of their firepower. As rifling became more commonplace, the accuracy of cannon was significantly improved, and they became deadlier than ever, especially to infantry. In World War I, a considerable majority of all deaths were caused by cannon; they were also used widely in World War II. Most modern cannon {{are similar to those}} used in the Second World War, including autocannon—with the exception of naval guns, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> significantly smaller in caliber.|$|E
50|$|The {{forests are}} {{home to more than}} 300 species of birds {{including}} golden eagle, thick-billed parrot (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> endangered having <b>been</b> trapped for collections), military macaw and tufted jay, and were once home to the imperial woodpecker <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> thought to <b>be</b> extinct.|$|R

5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for vandalism. The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the work of young people, noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E
5|$|Chatteris is sited in {{particularly}} fertile agricultural land, and as such, the town's {{local economy}} is {{largely based on}} this industry. Alan Bartlett and Sons Ltd, a major British grower and packer of root vegetables has a large facility in the town with over 2,500 hectares under cultivation, much of it growing parsnips and the Chantenay and Bushytops carrot. The company is a demerger of Albert Bartlett & Sons, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> based in Scotland. Rustler Produce Ltd, also based in Chatteris, is another major player in this industry, {{and a number of}} smaller vegetable producers and processors operate in the Chatteris area.|$|E
5|$|Eighteen {{of these}} pits {{were found to}} contain the remains of human skeletons, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> stored in the Weston-super-Mare Museum in Weston-super-Mare. Eighteen full skeletons were found, of which ten show {{evidence}} of a violent death (including sword cuts in the skulls). It {{is possible that the}} Romans or the Belgic raiders attacked the fort and killed the inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|It is a migratory {{passerine}} which {{winters in}} southern and western Europe, southern Asia and north Africa. Greenish-brown above and off-white below, it is named onomatopoeically for its simple chiff-chaff song. It {{has a number}} of subspecies, some of <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> treated as full species. The female builds a domed nest on or near the ground, and assumes most of the responsibility for brooding and feeding the chicks, whilst the male has little involvement in nesting, but defends his territory against rivals, and attacks potential predators.|$|E
5|$|Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, {{but a small}} {{minority}} experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> available to amateurs (e.g. the One-Mile Telescope).|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the common}} pleas court judges up for {{re-election}} were endorsed by both parties, but in the one contested race, Democrat John Morgan Davis defeated incumbent Republican Thomas Bluett.
