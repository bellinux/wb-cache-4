40|$|The <b>waterheater</b> with {{pulsating}} {{combustion chamber}} of 20 kW {{nominal thermal output}} has been worked out at the Technical University of Warsaw. The heat ballance as well as thermal and technical characteristics of the prototype of the <b>waterheater</b> were tested. Results of heat ballance calculation correspond with good accuracy {{with the results of}} testing. The <b>waterheater</b> works on gasoline. The overall of testing. The <b>waterheater</b> works on gasoline. The overall efficiency of the <b>waterheater</b> is 0. 8; the coefficient of heat exchange - 0, 1 kJ/m 2 sK; the noise level - 95 dB. The <b>waterheater</b> is characterized by eagy starting, small thermal inertia and small specific weight. Slight modifications are needed to elevate the overall efficiency and to reduce the noise level...|$|E
40|$|Energy saving {{is one way}} {{to reduce}} energy USAge without {{decreasing}} the results. This way can be obtained byusing the hybrid air conditioning. Other than energy saving, the hybrid air conditioning also can reduce theeffects of global warming by condenser waste heat recovery. This research aims to investigate the effect ofvariations flow rate in water heater tank to the system temperatures of hybrid air conditioning using helical coiltype of dummy condenser with 1 / 4 ˝ diameter of copper pipe. Experimental method is used in this research. Thetest was conducted with several water flow rate variations (1 / 3, 2 / 3, and 3 / 3 valve openings) and using coolingload of 2000 Watt as residential cooling load simulation. The result showed that the water temperature in <b>waterheater</b> tank was changed in every water flow rate variations. The highest water temperature was obtained at 39. 77 ˚C for 0 valve opening (full-closed valve), but, the lowest water temperature was obtained at 32. 57 ˚C in 3 / 3 valve opening (full-open valve) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{dwellings}} with collective {{ventilation systems}} users often install mechanical exhaust hoods {{in order to}} improve the exhaust flow rate. In this research the impact of such devices on the work of the gas water-heater appliance (usually installed in the kitchen) is assessed. Field testing was carried out in order to evaluate the performance of natural ventilation systems in a multi-storey building and its adequacy to provide conditions for the work of the gas <b>waterheater.</b> The combination of mechanical ventilation in hoods and natural exhaust of combustion products of gas water-heater was also tested and critical conditions that lead to the safety stop of the gas water-heater were evaluated. A computer simulation program was used to predict the occurrence of safety problems {{in the work of the}} gas water-heater with different mechanical exhaust rates and two different air permeability of the building envelope. It is shown that it is possible to reduce negative impact of mechanical devices increasing the envelope air permeability, but this action will largely increase building heat loss...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} is to analyze the general aspects of cases with carbon {{monoxide}} intoxication in order to improve the approach to future patients. Material and Methods: The hospital records of 84 children (mean age 4. 71 ± 2. 64 years; 48 male, 36 female) who had been admitted to Paediatric Emergency Department for carbon monoxide intoxication between October 2007 and February 2009, were retrospectively evaluated in a descriptive analysis. Results: The source of carbon monoxide intoxication was heaters, <b>waterheaters</b> and fi re in 82. 1 %, 7. 1 % and 6 % of cases, respectively. There was a statistically signifi cant difference between the carboxyhemoglobin levels of the patients according to the clinical classifi cation (p< 0. 05). The intoxication caused by heaters was observed signifi cantly in November, December and January (p< 0. 001), between 16 : 00 - 24 : 00 hours (p< 0. 001) and among more than one member of a family (p< 0. 001). A medium level correlation was detected between the treatment approach and clinical classifi cation (r= 0. 50, p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Carbon monoxide intoxication, in the presented series, was found to develop accidentally; mostly in the Winter season; during night hours when the family members gathered together. The carboxyhemoglobin levels were appropriate with the developing clinical findings. Carboxyhemoglobin level solely was not enough for achieving the diagnosis and planning the treatment...|$|R
