5000|$|The <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> {{is said to}} {{have one}} of the most tender and flavorful meats of all the abalone species. It was not {{discovered}} until 1940. Scripps Institution of Oceanography biologists conducted surveys of <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> deep water habitat in the early 1970s, finding high concentrations of about one <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> per square yard. Such densities were comparable to abundance of shallower species of abalone found in previously unfished or protected areas. Unfortunately, the high demand for the species led to a [...] "boom-and-bust" [...] fishery, which decimated the populations of this species in seven years.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> {{usually has}} between 3-5 open holes (respiratory pores) in its shell.

50|$|Like many gastropods, <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> have {{a complex}} life cycle {{involving}} larval stages. Fertilized eggs hatch into larvae; these larvae eventually metamorphose into the adult form and settle from the plankton to a hard substrate.As broadcast spawning gastropods, <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> reproduce by releasing their eggs and sperm {{into the surrounding}} water. If fertilized, the eggs hatch after only one day, but high concentrations of sperm are required in order for an egg to be fertilized. Therefore, aggregations of adult male and female abalone are necessary for successful fertilization to occur.|$|E

5000|$|Ritz Guitar Co. {{produced}} guitars in 1988 and 1989 over an 8-month {{period in}} Southern California in Wayne Charvel's workshop in Ontario. The company became known quality based upon Wayne's notoriety {{and for their}} amazing cracked shell mosaic finishes on their 'Neptune' series which was originally patented, designed and built by Andy Soler. Each little piece of shell was hand-cracked and stuck on the guitar body by hand. Introduced to Andy Soler's nephew Eric Galletta and eventually produced by Wayne Charvel, Andy Soler and Eric Galletta with Ritz being financially backed and majority owned co founders Brad Becnel's Sunset Ladders (Sunset Guitars) of South El Monte, CA and Cliff Wildes (Microtech International Inc CEO and the band [...] "Off White") of East Haven Conn, they made around 150 guitars with only about 25 being the cracked shell 'Neptune' models. The first two collectable models were handmade by Wayne Charvel in Gold Abalone and gold plated hardware for Cliff Wildes and a <b>White</b> <b>Abalone</b> for Brad Becnel, both featured in Ritz magazine ads. The other models were the 'Exotic' series, which used rare woods (e.g. Cocobolo) and kept them as a natural finish, there was a one off 'Exotic' model made from small pieces of rare woods stuck together like a mosaic to form {{the body of the}} guitar, in a similar idea to the shell finished 'Neptune' series. The lower cost 'Classic' Series had painted or Zolatone finishes with Wayne Charvel making his first ever 1 of a kind Midi guitar in corvette red for Wildes. All body shapes were Strat style, however, there is a rumor that a V shaped Ritz Neptune exists. The examples of shell types available were; Violet Oyster, Brown Lip, Black Lip, Green Shell, Abalone Shell, Nautilius Shell, and Snake Lip. Most Ritz Neptunes had Alder bodies for their light weight and some with Maple or Bubinga bodies under the shell finish. They mainly used Seymour Duncan, PAF (pickup) or Schaller Guitarenparts pickups (The Schaller's were custom made for Ritz and looked a little like EMG's and renamed as 'Ritz pickups' for the catalog, the Schaller's were the pick ups that Michael Angelo Batio used on his Rocket model.). All came with the Kahler Tremolo System Spyder model. The guitars retailed for over $2000.00. Most of the later Ritz guitars featured Warmoth Guitars necks made for Ritz as Ritz were running out of money and time to make their own. These necks were thinner than the Ritz made necks but still very good. The Warmoth logo can be located at the join on the on these necks if you take them off. Also a few Ritz Guitars were made after the demise of the company in 1991. This is thought to be because Wayne Charvel had a few Ritz necks left over and he attached them to one off custom orders at a little less money. A great book to read by the man himself Wayne Charvel is âThe Custom Guitar Shopâ which includes the Ritz story.|$|E
40|$|Once {{harvested}} commercially, the <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> (Haliotis sorenseni) is {{in danger}} of extinction and since 2002 has been under the protection of the federal Endangered Species Act. Recent failed efforts to find remnant populations in the speciesâ historical deep-seafloor habitats underscore the animalâs scarcity. In the time between when the grant for the project was written and funded, NOAA Fisheries halted the collection of wild <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> for research. It now appears that species recovery is either going to happen on its own {{over the course of several}} or more decades, or captive-bred <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> will have to be outplanted in the wild.

40|$|Prospective {{elasticity}} analyses {{have been}} used to aid in the management of fished species and the conservation of endangered species. Elasticities were examined for deterministic size-based matrix models of red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, and <b>white</b> <b>abalone,</b> H. sorenseni, to evaluate which size classes influenced population growth (lambda) the most. In the red abalone matrix, growth transitions were determined from a tag recapture study and grouped into nine size classes. In the <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> matrix, abalone growth was determined from a laboratory study and grouped into five size classes. Survivorship was estimated from tag recapture data for red abalone using a Jolly-Seber model with size as a covariate and used for both red and <b>white</b> <b>abalone.</b> Reproduction estimates for both models used averages of the number of mature eggs produced by female red and <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> in each size class from four-year reproduction studies. Population growth rate (lambda) was set to 1. 0, and the fiist-year survival (larval survival through to the first size class) was estimated by iteration. Survival elasticities were higher than fecundity elasticities in both the red and white matrix models. The sizes classes with the greatest survival elasticities, and therefore the most influence on population growth in the model, were the sublegal red abalone (150 - 178 mm) and the largest <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> size class (140 - 175 mm). For red abalone, the existing minimum legal size (178 mm) protects the size class the model suggests is critical to population growth. Implementation of education programs for novice divers coupled with renewed enforcement may serve to minimize incidental mortality of the critical size class. For <b>white</b> <b>abalone,</b> conservation efforts directed at restoring adults may have more of an impact on population growth than efforts focusing on juveniles.

The amount of suitable habitat available for the endangered <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> (Haliotis sorenseni) was quantified to aid in obtaining an accurate estimate of the number of remaining individuals at two offshore banks and one island site off the coast of southern California. Habitat was mapped by using multibeam sonar survey techniques and categorized by using rugosity and topographic position analysis. Abalone densities were evaluated by using a remotely operated vehicle and video transect methods. The total amount of suitable habitat at these three sites was far greater than that previously estimated.

Warning signs of potential problems existed both pre- and post-exploitation but were not recognized. In particular, serial depletion was not detected because catch was not analyzed spatially, perhaps because total landings were reasonably stable for the short period of exploitation.

40|$|In the 1970 âs, <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> {{populations in}} California {{suffered}} catastrophic declines due to over-fishing, and the species has been listed under the Endangered Species Act since 2001. Genetic diversity {{of a modern}} population of <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> {{was estimated to be}} significantly lower than similar Haliotis species, but the effect of the recent fishery crash on the species throughout its range was unknown. In this investigation, DNA was extracted from 39 historic and 27 recent dry abalone shells from California, and 18 historic dry shells from Baja California, Mexico. The DNA from the shells was of sufficient quality for the reproducible amplification of 580 bp of the mitochondrial COI gene and 219 bp of the nuclear Histone H 3 gene. Two COI haplotypes were distinguished, and no difference (p> 0. 05) was found between the nucleotide or haplotype diversity of Californiaâs recent (Ï= 0. 0010; Hd= 0. 501) and historic baseline (Ï= 0. 0010; Hd= 0. 505) wild populations of H. sorenseni. However, COI diversity in the historic Baja population (Ï= 0. 0004; Hd= 0. 209) was significantly lower (p< 0. 05) than in California. This study demonstrates the importance of appropriate historic reference groups for threatened or commercially important species, and can aid captive breeding programs manage broodstock and re-introduction design.

40|$|Abalone {{populations in}} {{southern}} California have declined dramatically since the 1950 s when they supported a multispecies, commercial, and recreational fishery producing more than 3, 000 t per year. Today the commercial fishery is closed statewide and the recreational fishery is closed south of San Francisco. In contrast, red abalone, Haliotis rufescens (Swainson, 1822), populations in northern California continue {{to sustain a}} 1, 100 1 per year free-diving recreational fishery. We used standardized Abalone Recruitment Modules (ARMs) made of half cinder blocks (area = 2. 6 m(2)) to compare the recruitment of juvenile abalone in northern California. where stocks are abundant, with southern California where stocks have declined. We compared the abundance of abalone inside ARMs (n = 12) in Van Damme State Park (VDSP). northern California with abalone inside ARMs (n - 82) in the Channel Islands National Park from 2001 to 2003. Abalone densities on the reefs Surrounding the ARMs at VDSP, averaged 8300 /ha compared with abalone densities of 30 /ha on reefs {{in three of the}} northern Channel Islands. Red, flat abalone, H. walallensis and pinto abalone. H. kamstchatkana kamstchatkana were found in the northern ARMs, whereas in the south red, pink, H. corrugata, threaded, H. kamtchatkana assimilis, and the endangered <b>white</b> <b>abalone,</b> H. sorenseni, were rare in the southern ARMs. Abalone were 30 times more abundant inside the ARMs in the north (5. 30 /ARM) compared with the south (0. 18 /ARM). Similar numbers of abalone were found in all 3 years in the ARMs in northern (69, 69, and 53 abalone) and southern California (14, 11, and 20 abalone). The majority of abalone in both {{the north and the south}} were less then 100 mm in shell length. Ironically, the rare flat abalone was more abundant in the north, than pink abalone were in the south, a species which once supported a major fishery. Clearly. abalone stocks in southern California are so low that recruitment is failing, despite their potential high fecundity and the fishery closure.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, five species of abalone (genus Haliotis) in California waters have gone from {{harvestable}} resources to rare or even endangered species status. Both anthropogenic (overexploitation, habitat destruction) and natural (disease, predation) factors {{have contributed to the}} declines. This dissertation explores several aspects of abalone recovery and conservation along the coast of California through population genetic theory and techniques. Chapters I and II deal with the captive breeding of two California abalone species. Chapter I focuses on ensuring the specific purity of broodstock and maintaining genetic diversity in hatchery-bred progeny of the endangered <b>white</b> <b>abalone</b> (H. soreseni). Using DNA from these animals, genetic markers were developed, including five nuclear microsatellite loci and partial sequences of one nuclear (VERL) and two mitochondrial (COI and CytB) genes, to assess genetic variability in the species, aid in species identification (ergo prevent broodstock contamination), and potentially track the success of future outplanting of captive-reared animals in restocking operations. Chapter II quantifies the loss of genetic diversity resulting from the captive breeding of green abalone (H. fulgens). No change in overall heterozygosity was evident, but significant losses in allelic richness were found in the captive-bred green abalone versus that in wild populations. Chapters III, IV, and V center on inferring realized connectivity (gene flow) among natural populations of red (H. rufescens), black (H. cracherodii), and pink (H. corrugata) abalone. For red abalone (Chapter III), COI sequencing and microsatellite genotyping did not show significant genetic divergence among populations. In contrast, data from AFLPs became the first to suggest there is significant genetic differentiation among California red abalone populations. In black abalone (Chapter IV), data from AFLPs and one microsatellite locus showed significant divergence among multiple populations and exhibited a signal of isolation by distance consistent with a stepping-stone model of connectivity. Pink abalone (Chapter V) also showed evidence of restricted gene flow among populations. Finally, Chapters VI and VII focus on the fatal disease withering syndrome (WS). Chapter VI involves characterizing the post-esophageal microbiomes of red and black abalone with and without WS. Significant differences between the clone libraries isolated from healthy and diseased abalone suggested that WS has significant impact on the bacterial composition of the abalone post-esophageal microbiome, and specific membership of the microbiomes suggests that infection by Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis, the etiological agent of WS, may not be the sole cause of morbidity and mortality due to WS in abalone. Chapter VII is a preliminary study of genetic variation within C. X. californiensis samples from wild and captive-bred abalone species collected from multiple locations along the coast of California. Thus far, no variation has been found in partial sequences of either the 16 S rDNA or recombinase A (recA) gene...|$|E
