5|$|The AWS has {{a mind of}} its own {{at times}} and reaches peak {{performance}} with the owner who is dedicated to teaching the dog just <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> it. The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E
25|$|In various KMT {{headquarters}} throughout Taiwan, {{celebrations of}} the party's landslide victory took place. The largest event was {{located at the}} Main KMT Headquarters in Taipei. Former Chairman Lien Chan, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Chairman Wu Po-hsiung were presented and celebrated with the large crowd. At 7:30 pm, Presidential-elect Ma Ying-jeou came out and spoke about <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> his new government when it begins office on May 20, 2008.|$|E
25|$|He is {{the uncle}} of Ondine and also Lord of the Mediterranean Sea. He tries to warn Ondine {{that what she}} intends to do with Palemon goes against <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> her.

When Ondine once again finds Palemon and realises how he has betrayed her, Tirrenio exacts a terrible revenge with his fellow Undines by causing death and destruction for all Palemon's guests.|$|E

25|$|The {{focus on}} {{outcomes}} creates a clear expectation of {{what needs to}} be accomplished {{by the end of the}} course. Students will understand <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> them and teachers will know what they need to teach during the course. Clarity is important over years of schooling and when team teaching is involved. Each team member, or year in school, will have a clear understanding of {{what needs to be}} accomplished in each class, or at each level, allowing students to progress. Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the serious}} {{consequences}} that plagiarism has for students, {{there has been}} a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism. This is especially important when students move to a new institution that may have a different view of the concept when compared with the view previously developed by the student. Indeed, given the seriousness of plagiarism accusations for a student's future, the pedagogy of plagiarism education may need to be considered ahead of the pedagogy of the discipline being studied. The need for plagiarism education extends to academic staff, who may not completely understand <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> their students or the consequences of misconduct.|$|E
500|$|Comparatively broad {{responsibility}}: {{it holds}} responsibility for policy portfolios which {{go far beyond}} <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> other Local Government Authorities, such as being the trustee of the DOGIT land, the provision of housing infrastructure, previously {{the running of the}} canteen and currently the running of the general store, law and justice, health, maintenance of culture and language, etc. [...] The Council is designed under the model of a mainstream Local Government Authority which structurally does not provide the latitude to address those functions which are not normally expected of mainstream Councils.|$|E
5000|$|Elizabeth [...] "Bette" [...] Cooper-Moore (born August 11, 1920) won the Miss America 1937 pageant as Miss Bertrand Island, {{representing}} {{an amusement}} park on Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey. She was born in Hackettstown, New Jersey. She caused a stir when she disappeared for some 24 hours after winning the title. Evidently overwhelmed by <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> her, she insisted upon a much lighter schedule than planned by pageant officials {{so that she could}} attend college. This led pageant officials to have future contestants sign agreements as to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> the winner.|$|R

500|$|Response to MOBA's {{opening and}} {{continued}} success is, for some, evocative {{of the way}} art is treated in society. MOBA works {{have been described as}} [...] "unintentionally hilarious", similar to the atrocious films of Ed Wood. Visitors—and even MOBA staff—often laugh out loud at displays. In Gullible's Travels, Cash Peters [...] contrasted this behavior with <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> patrons at galleries such as Southern California's Getty Museum; though viewers might find the art at the Getty equally hilarious, were they to show it they would almost certainly be thrown out.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{inspiration}} behind the remix, Hayden Thorpe from Wild Beasts group told The Guardian: [...] "The unlikeness of this match was perhaps what compelled {{us to take}} it on. Gaga in many ways {{is the epitome of}} what we are not. She is the butcher to our butter knife. The essential thrill is always to keep eluding <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> us and what we expect of ourselves." [...] The last of the remix to be released was The Weeknd's take on [...] "Marry the Night" [...] which featured Illangelo, thus earning him a co-producer credit on it.|$|E
2500|$|Lastly, Pritzker {{maintained}} {{that even a}} presumption of intent would not suffice to render the law constitutional.

2500|$|Further {{themes are}} also present: the [...] "sovereign freedom of Yahweh" [...] (God {{does not always}} do <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> him); the [...] "satirisation of foreign kings" [...] (who {{consistently}} underestimate Israel and Yahweh); {{the concept of the}} [...] "flawed agent" [...] (judges who are not adequate to the task before them) and the disunity of the Israelite community (which gathers pace as the stories succeed one another).|$|E
2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> {{psychological}} measurements is [...] "sufficient" [...] {{accuracy and}} reliability, i.e. capability to express an indication or focus which clinicians can {{use as a}} “guideline” to rapidly and accurately deepen the aspects highlighted by the measurements and check them together with their patients.

2500|$|The Scout {{law is a}} {{personal}} code of living to guide the way each Scout lives his or her life. It is not a repression of faults, so was not framed as a list of prohibitions.

2500|$|Pritzker held to his {{argument}} {{even in cases}} posited of an ordinance that prohibited the public display, without a license to do so, of pistols with barrels shorter than five inches (...) , which are limited to police use. [...] "The merchant would know <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> him," [...] he answered. [...] "There are standards for compliance," [...] which, {{he went on to}} argue at length, were lacking in the village's ordinance, although he agreed that there were other statutes, such as the Robinson–Patman antitrust statute, where [...] "people cannot be absolutely certain whether they are complying or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taking on the {{functional}} approach of leadership, leaders {{have to think}} about responsibilities that are taken out in the organization. The functional approach looks at the communication behavior of the leaders. Through functional leadership, roles have to be taken for the organization to function properly. The roles help give followers classifications, so they have an idea of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> them. Roles in {{the functional}} approach are task related, group building and maintenance, and individual. These roles allow for tasks to be accomplished and also to build up the organization through positive reinforcement, but also take away conflict that occurs. The task related role gives followers a sense of direction for an assignment to be completed in the group. Group building and maintenance roles steer the organization for open, supportive and healthy relationships with other followers in the organization. This role also helps to eliminate tension between workers and allows for sides to be heard on different topics that arise. However, in an organization the [...] "me" [...] wants to come out and this creates the individual role in the organization. Even though taking on an individual role can be healthy for the self because it creates autonomy, it also can be detrimental to the organization because it reduces the amount of group effectiveness. Being a functional leader allows for the organization to run like a machine and having all the parts work together to accomplish a common goal.|$|E

2500|$|In Our Mutual Friend Dickens also {{explores the}} {{conflict}} between doing what society expects of a person {{and the idea of}} being true to oneself. Much of what society expects of a person may be shown through the influence of their family. In many of Dickens's novels, including Our Mutual Friend and Little Dorrit, parents try to force their children into arranged marriages, which, although suitable in terms of money, are not suitable in other ways. John Harmon, for example, was supposed to marry Bella to suit the conditions of his father's will, and though initially, he refused to marry her for that reason, he later married her for love. Harmon goes against his father's wishes in another way too, simply by taking the alias of John Rokesmith. By taking this new identity, he refuses his inheritance. Bella is also swayed by the influence of her parents. Her mother wishes her to marry for money to better the fortunes of the entire family, although her father is happy with her marrying John Rokesmith for love. Bella's marriage to Rokesmith goes against <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> her by her mother, but eventually her mother accepts the fact that Bella has at least married someone who will make her happy. However, later on in the novel, Bella accepts the everyday duties of a wife, and seemingly gives up her independence. Yet she refuses to be the [...] "doll in the doll's house"; and is not content with being a wife who rarely leaves her home without her husband. Furthermore, Bella reads up on the current events so that she can discuss them with her husband, and is actively involved in all of the couple's important decisions.|$|E
2500|$|Xi Zheng, then an {{assistant}} {{official in the}} palace library, often visited Meng Guang to consult him. When Meng Guang asked him what the crown prince, Liu Xuan, had been learning and reading {{and what he was}} interested in, Xi Zheng replied, [...] "He treats the people around him respectfully. He is very diligent and hardworking. He has the style of a crown prince of ancient times. When he meets people, he shows sincerity, kindness and generosity in everything he says and does." [...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> every other person. What I really want to know is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life is to focus on winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I like to speak my mind as freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate me for that. Although I sense that you don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. This {{has to do with the}} Crown Prince's education. He should be striving to enrich himself with as much knowledge as possible so that he can be like a consultant. He should also sit for written and oral tests like academics and gain some titles. This is a top priority for him." [...] Xi Zheng strongly agreed with him.|$|E
