5|$|Among myriapods, millipedes have {{traditionally}} been considered most {{closely related to the}} tiny pauropods, although some molecular studies challenge this relationship. Millipedes can be distinguished from the somewhat similar but only distantly related centipedes (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are carnivorous, and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist <b>who</b> <b>studies</b> them is called a diplopodologist.|$|E

Neelambari advises Chandru to make Anitha {{fall in love with}} him. At the same time, Padayappa plans to get Anitha married to his sister's son. Neelambari, having made Chandru pretend {{to fall in love with}} Anitha, plans to humiliate Padayappa by making Anitha say that she does not wish to marry a groom of her parents' choice and that she is in love with someone else. At the {{marriage}} ceremony, after Anitha does what Neelambari told her to do, Padayappa makes an oath to unite Anitha with her lover by the next Muhurta day, or commit suicide. Padayappa discovers that Chandru really did fall in love with Anitha even though he was only initially pretending to do so on Neelambari's advise. When Padayappa takes Chandru and Anitha to the temple to get married, Neelambari and Suryaprakash give chase to stop them. Suryaprakash is killed in a car accident during the chase.|$|E

40|$|Using 2006 Canadian Census data, {{this paper}} {{focuses on the}} {{economic}} performance of highly educated immigrants who were born in less developed countries and <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> inside or outside Canada. There are two outcomes that are studied for immigrants and Canadian-born: access to a full-time full-year job and earnings. This study finds that immigrants from all places of birth have a lower probability of having a full-time full-year job than Canadian-born individuals and that, for most places of birth; immigrants <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> outside Canada have a lower probability of having such a job than immigrants <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> in Canada. People with more years of schooling earn more for both immigrants and Canadian-born, but immigrants earn less than the Canadian-born workers with the same educational attainment. Among the immigrants, some completed their higher education {{in their own country}} while others studied in Canada. The results show that immigrants <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> in Canada tend to earn more than immigrants <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> outside Canada...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the differences of independence in doing academic activities between the students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> in school that using KTSP 2006 and Kurikulum 2013.

Where the students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> in school that using Kurikulum 2013 is more independent in term of doing academic activities rather than students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> in school that using KTSP 2006. The population in this research is high school students in Yogyakarta. The samples in this research are the students from SMAN 6 Yogyakarta as students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> using Kurikulum 2013 and the students from SMAN 5 Yogyakarta as students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> using KTSP 2006. The number of samples taken is 40 students of SMAN 6 Yogyakarta and 40 students of SMAN 5 Yogyakarta. The samples selection is using Purposive Sampling method.

The analysis method that used to find the differences is different test non-parametrik Mann Whitney U method. According to the analysis, the result is the value of Mann Whitney U is 734 with Sig 0. 524 (p 0. 05).

He goes on to argue that “Islam is reduced {{to the concept of}} jihad and Jihad is reduced to terror against the West.” This line of argument echoes Edward Said’s famous piece Orientalism in which he argued that the United States sees the Muslims and Arabs in an essentialized caricatures – as oil supplies or potential terrorists.|$|E

Nevertheless, Giuliano's research in Russia has shown that economic grievances, even in a mixed workplace, can be politicized on ethnic lines.|$|E
