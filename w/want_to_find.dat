5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{a situation in which}} Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E
25|$|To {{get some}} intuition about the {{different}} approaches to integration, let us imagine that we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a mountain's volume (above sea level).|$|E

25|$|We {{start with}} a blank {{piece of paper and}} work out if the {{sponsorship}} still works for us and ask does it meet our objectives? We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a moment in time when people come together and have a collective experience and we achieve this through the sponsorships.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there is}} a {{one-to-one}} correspondence between cumulative distribution functions and characteristic functions, it is always possible to find one of these functions if we know the other one. The formula in definition of characteristic function allows us to compute φ when we know the distribution function F (or density f). If, on the other hand, we know the characteristic function φ and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the corresponding distribution function, {{then one of the}} following inversion theorems can be used.|$|E
25|$|Others {{are looking}} for the missing {{telemetry}} tapes for different reasons. The tapes contain the original and highest quality video feed from the Apollo 11 landing. Some former Apollo personnel <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the tapes for posterity while NASA engineers looking towards future Moon missions believe the tapes may be useful for their design studies. They have found that the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984, all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center at their request. The tapes are believed to have been stored rather than re-used. Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967, even before the Moon landings.|$|E

25|$|Techno-liberals {{look for}} change. By their nature, they're not {{satisfied}} with the way things are and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> new ways to do things. Liberals in technology arena move a society forward as the opportunists. Technoliberalism is actually more about civil liberties and individual rights such as Free Internet, Net neutrality for landline Internet not for mobile or satellites, gun control and Pro abortion, etc. Techno-liberalism represents socio-cultural perspectives that imply all human endeavors. This includes how we develop and use technology, especially computer technology. In the technology arena, liberalism normally points to innovation and risk-taking. Furthermore, if you're a techno-liberal in information technology, the future can't come soon enough. For those who see the true promise of the web for multi-media and as a general platform for application software, the Internet is still far too slow and primitive.|$|E
25|$|I get {{the tune}} and then I {{just keep on}} singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> when you're writin' songs.|$|E
25|$|For {{the other}} implication, assume that every set of graphs has a finite subset of minimal graphs and let a minor-closed set F be given. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a set H of graphs such that a graph is in F if {{and only if}} it does not have a minor in H. Let E be the graphs which are not minors of any graph in F, and let H be the finite set of minimal graphs in E. Now, let an {{arbitrary}} graph G be given. Assume first that G is in F. G cannot have a minor in H since G is in F and H is a subset of E. Now assume that G is not in F. Then G is not a minor of any graph in F, since F is minor-closed. Therefore, G is in E, so G has a minor in H.|$|E

25|$|Giant, segmented, insect-like, {{antennae}} {{rise over}} a distant mountain range. There is no direct {{connection between the}} antennae and the aliens, but the newly discovered race is named Ark Megaforms. The demonstration of the antennae {{appears to be an}} act of intimidation. It soon becomes apparent that Ark Megaforms want the humans to leave the planet as soon as possible. The Megaforms use the Kid as their negotiator with the humans. The Kid visits the base of ER-2 several times. He allows the humans to study him and question him about his foster parents in exchange for the promise to leave. The communication does not proceed smoothly as the Kid exhibits the mixture of human and alien psychological traits. His very way of thought seems inconceivable to humans. Though he can speak, most of the questions he is either unable or unwilling to answer. Moreover, there is a conflict of interest as the humans <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out about Ark Megaforms as much as possible while the Kid just wants them to leave.|$|E
25|$|The game {{contains}} a central hub level, the Royal Train Station, and four additional levels that the player travels to through the Train Station. Each level was designed {{with a number}} of puzzles that allowed the player to approach in any order, while keeping the level size small and uncomplicated to prevent the player from becoming lost. Most of the puzzles have been designed with multiple solutions; Petty stated they wanted to cater to both the casual player, who may only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> one of the solutions to progress in the game, and the more dedicated player, who would likely spend time to discover all of the intended solutions. This was furthered by allowing the player to freely roam through previously-completed areas to complete all the puzzles, including after completing the main story. The puzzles and challenges were designed {{to be able to be}} completed in short segments, giving the player more freedom to play it at their own pace. Petty wanted to make sure the player had time to contemplate the puzzles or explore the environment in a manner of older adventure games, though still assured that his environments felt alive and animated. The levels themselves are designed using a mix of the Great Depression and Victorian era designs, using virtual household items such as marbles and safety pins, an inspiration that came from interest in dioramas and miniature stages. The game itself presents cutscenes with dialog in the fashion of early silent films, where a text plaque is shown to show the dialog after it is acted out and scene takes place on a theater stage.|$|E
500|$|There {{had to be}} a cost. There {{had to be a}} price {{somebody}} {{paid for}} that discovery. Not everybody could take that. Not everyone could just say, [...] "OK, that didn't work out, let's go on to next week's episode." [...] It felt like somebody would just say, [...] "No, I'm done. I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a little moment of time where I can feel good about myself one last time, then I'm finished with this long nightmare." [...] And that seemed like that would be Dualla.|$|E

500|$|Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben {{began his}} {{argument}} for the United States by noting that information revealed to the world (i.e. movement on a public road) is not protected by the Fourth Amendment. Dreeben cited United States v. Knotts as an example where police were allowed to use a device known as a [...] "beeper" [...] that allows the tracking of a car from a short distance away. Chief Justice Roberts distinguished the current case from Knotts, saying that using a beeper still took [...] "a lot of work" [...] whereas a GPS device allows the police to [...] "sit back in the station ... and push a button whenever they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out where the car is." ...|$|E
500|$|Halsey uses an {{override}} code {{to force}} Infinitys AI, Roland, to assist her. Seeking information withheld from her concerning the Librarian, Halsey learns that Master Chief is alive. [...] Halsey contacts M'dama {{to try and}} strike a deal, as they both <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the Librarian; Roland breaks free of Halsey's control and summons guards to apprehend Halsey. Lasky decides to place Halsey in cryogenic sleep to prevent further trouble, but Promethean forces invade Infinity, capture Halsey and teleport her to 'Mdama's base. Serin Osman, head of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), orders Lasky to kill Halsey, but he is reluctant to do so. Palmer sets off to Requiem to kill Halsey; Lasky tells Majestic Squad to intervene and rescue Halsey from 'Mdama.|$|E
500|$|The set {{was already}} being broken down {{the day after}} filming finished. Debra Messing, who plays Grace, said it was [...] "cordoned off like an {{accident}} scene. It {{was a shock to}} see parts of it gone already." [...] Each cast member was allowed to keep their favorite souvenir from the set. Messing took the door to Grace's office; she wanted to lean it up against the wall at her house as a piece of modern art. Sean Hayes was given a couple of pieces from Will's apartment: [...] "There's a leather box that was on Will’s desk that I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a place for." [...] Mullally chose a simple portrait from one of the walls, and McCormack took a small ceramic dog, though he said he would have taken everything if he could.|$|E

500|$|In The King of Fighters: Kyo, a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} situated before KOF '97, Iori appears as Kyo's antagonist in his journey around the world. Iori {{appears in the}} spin-off video games [...] In the North American editions of Maximum Impact, Iori is voiced by Eric Summerer. Iori also appears as a sub-boss during The King of Fighters Ex: Neo Blood, which is situated after his fight against Orochi. Although Iori enters the tournament to fight Kyo, Geese Howard, the organizer of the tournament, tries to make him awake his Riot of the Blood to absorb his powers, but fails. In The King of Fighters EX2: Howling Blood, Iori enters another tournament, and is joined by two women who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a man controlled by the Orochi power. The [...] shooter game KOF: Sky Stage also features him as a boss.|$|E
500|$|As Frances Cleveland {{left the}} White House, {{she told a}} staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, I {{want you to take}} good care of all the {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> everything just as it is now, when we come back again." [...] When asked when she would return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E
500|$|Feminist author Naomi Wolf {{criticized the}} video as {{propaganda}} for the Marine Corps, stating [...] "I really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out {{if she was}} paid by them for making it ..... it is truly shameful. I would suggest a boycott of this singer whom I really liked if you are as offended at this glorification of violence as I am." [...] Glenn Selig, founder of The Publicity Agency, responded to these claims on Fox News Live, stating, [...] "In her efforts to boycott the video, Naomi Wolf has brought more attention to it, without her comments, most people would clearly have seen the military simply as a metaphor and not as an attempt by Katy Perry to glamorize the military or war." [...] Perry told MTV that she chose the military plot because it represented the song, saying, [...] "It's an affirmation of strength, so I wanted to go the strongest route I ever could." ...|$|E
