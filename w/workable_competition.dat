40|$|Abstrac: Although party {{competition}} {{is widely regarded}} as an important part of a working democracy, it is rarely analysed in political science literature. This article discusses the basic properties of party competition, especially the patterns of interaction in contemporary party systems. Competition as a phenomenon at the macro level has to be carefully distinguished from contest and cooperation as the forms of interaction at the micro level. The article gives special attention to the creation of issue innovations. Contrary to existing approaches, I argue that not only responsiveness but also innovation are necessary to guarantee a <b>workable</b> democratic <b>competition.</b> Competition takes place on an issue market, where parties can discover voters’ demands. Combined with the concept of institutional veto points, the article presents hypotheses on how institutions shape the possibility for programmatic innovations. cooperation; innovation; issue market; party competition; veto point...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{decisions}} today require a determination by regulators, legislators, or other public policymakers of whether <b>workable</b> <b>competition</b> {{exists in the}} telecommunications industry. Unfortunately, most decisions to date {{have been based on}} a substantially incomplete analysis, looking only at the firms that supply telecommunications service. In fact, determining whether <b>workable</b> <b>competition</b> exists (this might be an inquiry into intraLATA competition, intrastate interLATA competition, or other areas) 1 cannot take place in isolation from a detailed examination of the consumers who make up the market as well. While unquestionably the characteristics of telecommunications firms must be considered, to examine only those characteristics is to ignore much of the available relevant information upon which to make a considered decision. An analysis that looks at consumer characteristics complements rather than supplants other currently used analyses [Horning et al. 1988; Shepherd 1988]. This supplemental approach introduces into the analysis consumer-side characteristics that are too often “forgotten, ” or in any event underemphasized, in an analysis of competition. 2 Implicit in this introduction is an identification of shortcomings in the contemporary argument ove...|$|E
40|$|Competition {{policy is}} {{typically}} {{intended to protect}} competition where <b>workable</b> <b>competition</b> is possible.

This means competition and regulation settings can affect each other and potentially their own rationale. Electricity systems have particular competition and regulation issues and challenges and industry changes such as New Zealand's vertical integration of generation and energy retailing present additional complexities. In this seminar Richard Meade argues that there is no single optimal boundary between competition policy and regulation in electricity systems. Instead any such boundary will evolve over time reflecting a myriad of factors such as institutional endowments industry reform paths the extent of state ownership and changing technologies. Importantly the optimal boundary will differ from that prevailing in other network industries such as telecommunications suggesting that appropriate competition and regulatory policies will differ across industries...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish food {{retail market}} {{contains}} of three major actors, ICA, KF and Axfood, {{all in all}} dominating 75 {{percent of the total}} market shares. The scant number of retailing actors indicates that the Swedish food retail market is a highly concentrated oligopoly, which as a fact has given rise to definite discussions and argumentations concerning the market situation. But is the food retail market imperfect and how do we reach a <b>workable</b> <b>competition?</b> Economic theory does not provide any clear answer on these questions, but is rather divided into two fundamentally different approaches to define competition: the static and the dynamic perspective on competition. In an attempt to examine the competition on local Swedish retail markets, {{the purpose of this study}} is to carry out an econometric model estimating the situation. The model serves to explain the variation of ICA’s achievements measured in terms of turnovers obtained in the company. The explanatory variables composing the model are divided into three separate groupings: degreeof market concentration, storespecific factors and region-specific factors. Furthermore, in order to find out which one of the competitive explanations best fits the reality, the regression results are interpreted from a static and a dynamic perspective of competition. In part, we also aim to compare the results with the outline of the Swedish competition law. We found that the level of concentration obtained in our material is high and is steadily increasing. We also found that stores do not, in any great extent, use price, service and quality as competitive methods. Thus, to gain competitive advantage, market actors must find other ways to carry out strategic market activities. The region-specific variables had either none or very little influence on ICA’s turnover. According to these findings, neither the static nor the dynamic perspective of competition is solely able to produce an accurate method for reaching a state of a <b>workable</b> <b>competition.</b> Instead, a combination of the static and the dynamic ideas may be regarded as the most advantageous way to generate suitable conditions for competition to be efficient. Therefore, in order to promote <b>workable</b> <b>competition,</b> the Swedish competition law must consist of a balance between the static and the dynamic view of competition...|$|E

It focuses on the procedural law aspects that are permeated by legal uncertainty and {{that have not yet}} fallen under the scrutiny of the law and economics debate. The policy proposals described herein are based on the functional approach to law and economics and aim to promote a more qualified decision making process by: adjudicators, private parties and lawmakers. The resulting framework of procedural rules would be a cost-effective policy tool that could sustain the European Commission’s effort to guarantee a <b>workable</b> level of <b>competition</b> in the EU internal market. This project aims to answer the following broad research question: which procedural rules can improve the efficiency of antitrust arbitration by decreasing litigation costs for private parties on the one hand, and by increasing private parties’ compliance with competition law on the other hand?Throughout this research project, such broad question has been developed into research sub-questions revolving around several key legal issues. The chosen sub-research questions result from a vacuum in the European enforcement system that leaves several key legal issues in antitrust arbitration unresolved. The legal framework proposed in this research project could prevent such a blurry scenario from impairing the EU private enforcement of competition law in arbitration. Therefore, our attention was triggered by those legal issues whose proposed solutions lead to relevant uncertainties and that are most suitable for a law and economics analysis...|$|R
40|$|Currently in {{competition}} law and sectoral regulation in Thailand, {{there are significant}} obstacles to developing market competition in the electricity sector. This thesis investigates the problems relating to competition law and sectoral regulation in Thailand&# 146;s electricity sector. The thesis finds that there are problems in relation to competition law and sectoral regulation regarding aspects of the regulatory institution and rules. The Thai Competition Commission and Energy Commission both still face various institutional obstacles in relation to achieving the development of market competition in the Thai electricity sector. The rules regarding both competition law in the Competition Act and sectoral regulation in the Energy Act also do not promote or protect market competition in the Thai electricity sector. Following the research on the problems in Thailand&# 146;s competition law and sectoral regulation, the thesis reviews the international experience of both developed and developing countries regarding competition law and sectoral regulation {{with a view to}} presenting in the thesis a possible reform framework for Thailand. The thesis reviews the fundamental ideas regarding the role of competition law within utility sectors, including the electricity sector. The thesis finds that the substantives rules and their application, as well as the institution of competition law are important to protecting and promoting market competition in the electricity sector. In addition, the thesis researches the international experience regarding sectoral regulation to create and protect market competition in the electricity sector. The thesis finds that market competition will not occur by simply withdrawing regulation, but that regulation has {{to play an important role}} in stimulating and shaping <b>workable</b> market <b>competition.</b> The main aspects of the international experience with sectoral regulation relate to establishing effective regulatory institutions and ensuring appropriate regulation of the market. The thesis points out the importance of both competition law and sectoral regulation as a necessary development towards market competition in the electricity sector. Based on the review of the international experience, the thesis outlines a possible framework that could be used to reform Thai competition law and sectoral regulation in the Thai electricity sector. The thesis contends that the reform must involve both short and long term plans to develop the institutions, as well as the rules with respect to competition law and sectoral regulation in electricity sector in Thailand...|$|R

The main aim {{of this research is}} to examine the importance of competition policy harmonisation for regional economic integration and propose a <b>workable</b> framework of <b>competition</b> policy harmonisation for ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). To comply with the objectives, this research proposes a possible approach for ASEAN to develop competition policy harmonisation. The method used in this research is qualitative data with rational choice theory analysis. Of the ten of ASEAN member states, only five have national competition policy with different substantive laws, procedural rules, and enforcement mechanism. Legal diversity was not the only factor that militates against ASEAN regional competition policy harmonisation. Different competition culture, economic development, and national political support are also significant barriers to the development of competition policy and law in ASEAN member states. The thesis suggests that harmonisation in ASEAN can be achieved by following two alternative approaches: regional or bilateral cooperation. The regional approach requires ASEAN member states to change their competition policy and law to synchronize them with the regional competition policy and law. To implement this approach, ASEAN needs a regional competition authority which would require its member states to surrender their sovereign authority to make national competition policy and law. The regional approach also requires all member states to adopt uniform regional competition policy and law in their legal systems. These two requirements may render the regional approach very difficult to implement. Alternatively, bilateral cooperation between two member states is more lenient for ASEAN because {{it is not necessary to}} give up their sovereignty to a regional authority. It also gives an opportunity for other member states without competition policy and law to prepare for the development of national competition culture. The latest movement of ASEAN Economic Community shows a sign that ASEAN still is not ready for the regional harmonization of competition policy and law. The regional competition law is usually monitored by a regional competition authority for enforcement across jurisdictions. At this stage, ASEAN does not have any such legal regime to achieve enforcement. The lack of such an institution is likely to create an ineffective and flawed regime of competition law and policy in ASEAN. Another predominant factor is that ASEAN member states are too much concern about their national political interests. Consequently, bilateral cooperation is likely to work better than regional approach for harmonization. Should ASEAN want to develop its competition policy and law harmonisation on a regional basis, it may start gradually from bilateralism to limited multilateralism starting from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam which have competition authorities. The research outcomes will provide an innovative framework for the progressive development of competition policy and law in ASEAN, which will be immensely rewarding for ASEAN member states’ policy-makers, strategists, and negotiators in achieving this harmonisation. The research outcomes will also provide better understanding and experience for any existing and/or future regional economic integration/s desirous of pursuing competition policy and law harmonisation.

This article draws on the literature on infrastructure regulation in order to analyse this transfer. Taking a long view on attempts to introduce competition into health services in England, it points to a number of challenges of liberalisation, corresponding to those arising in infrastructure sectors. Using a framework drawn from utilities, it analyses these under the headings of: (a) market structure; (b) allocation of regulatory authority; and (c) decision-making style.

We do not argue that retailers have no bargaining power at all, but we want to show, that the division of bargaining power between {{the two sides of the}} markets varies from product to product and is also a dynamic phenomenon which changes over time.

40|$|Not {{only that}} {{consumers}} take it often {{for granted that}} product prices are good indicators of product quality, but also many experts in consumer economics expect a high positive pricequality relationship. However, for more than 50 years numerous studies in more than 10 countries {{all over the world}} have shown low price-quality correlation coefficients, mostly close to 0. 2. These results have been interpreted twofold: (a) consumers cannot use prices as valid indicators of quality and (b) markets do not function well. In contrast to the second interpretation, this paper argues that, according to the economic theory of price formation, prices are not an indicator of quality, but an indicator of scarcity. This allows the conclusion that workable consumer goods markets, as seen from a welfare point of view, should be characterized by low or even negative correlations between price and objective quality rather than by strong positive coefficients. All the more it is the availability of valid information about product quality which is necessary to enable consumers to avoid inefficient product choices.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{examined}} {{the conduct of}} the cotton market in Nigeria during the 1996 / 97 through 1998 / 99 cotton-marketing years (MYs). The data was collected from six states {{in the northern part of}} Nigeria during market interviews and consultations with buyers and sellers in the markets. The analytical procedure followed the descriptive-diagnostic-prescriptive approach of the structuralist interpretation of the structure, conduct, performance of the market. The study revealed that although some of the characteristics of workable (effective) competition abounded in the market, there were imperfections in the pricing system as revealed by the very high margins and market spread (profitability) as percent of producer price, which was as high as 150 percent in 1998 / 99. Other flaws in the market included fraud, preemption as manifested by the outgrower scheme operated by buyers, unfair tactics by both buyers and sellers and undesirable collaboration.

This paper aims to contribute to the growing discussion on how to proceed from here. Towards this end, the paper first outlines the framework for competition policy in the Philippine setting. It then attempts to assess the state of competition in the Philippines. What has the Philippines done along the framework of competition policy and what has been the impact on the state of competition in the different sectors of the Philippine economy? A general assessment is made across the different sectors of the economy by looking at what major factors are present that could determine the state of competition in the different sectors.

40|$|In a {{world where}} {{ubiquitous}} and affordable broadband availability {{is the key to}} unlocking the benefits of the information society, obstacles remain to the deployment of appropriate access networks. Traditionally, an analysis of the potential problems from a regulatory perspective would involve consideration of whether any players control bottlenecks or have significant market power in the market for carriage services. Such an approach is likely to prompt the forms of regulatory intervention which have been successful in the past or which have been applied overseas. This paper suggests that the analysis, at least from a technical perspective, of the benefits of ubiquitous broadband should have as its primary aim the creation of a vibrant market for applications and services. As a result {{of the nature of the}} next generation network (NGN), the focus of regulatory intervention should be on access to services (and not physical network elements) in the NGN access network. In the nascent market for the delivery of broadband services that can support a rich media experience, the current concern need not be about market power. The real issue is how to regulate the delivery of the applications and the services that ubiquitous and affordable broadband can provide. Any regulatory intervention associated with the deployment of a national broadband network should focus, as it has in Europe, on <b>workable</b> <b>competition</b> in the NGN access network.

In order to fulfil this objective, the thesis aims firstly to engage in a scholarly exercise of clarifying the role and purpose of the beer tie; the application of the EU competition law provisions to the brewing industry; and the UK Government’s approach to regulating it. Secondly, the thesis engages in comparative research and will consider how other non-UK markets have dealt with the distribution of beer, and more specifically the issue of the beer tie. In doing so, the thesis seeks to ascertain how competitive the UK market is in the context of these other geographical markets. The thesis will also compare the UK beer market with another UK market in which the use of tying agreements is prevalent in order to ascertain whether the same issues have been faced in this market as in the beer market. The intention of the comparative research in the thesis is to provide assistance to legal policy makers on the future regulation of beer distribution in the UK. The thesis does not however undertake to propose measures to achieve a state of perfect competition. Rather, it undertakes, as the third aim of the thesis, to propose informed recommendations that address better the ongoing anti-competitive concerns associated with the operation of the beer tie today and ensure a socially acceptable level of <b>workable</b> <b>competition...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of marginalist, or neoclassical, economics {{led to a}} fifty-year long crisis in competition theory. Given an industrial structure with sufficient fixed costs, competition always became 2 ̆ 2 ruinous, 2 ̆ 2 forcing firms to cut prices to marginal cost without sufficient revenue remaining to pay off investment. Early neoclassicists such as Alfred Marshall {{were not able to}} solve this problem, and as a result many economists were hostile toward the antitrust laws {{in the early decades of}} the twentieth century. The ruinous competition debate came to an abrupt end in the early 19302 ̆ 7 s, when Joan Robinson and particularly Edward Chamberlin developed models that took product differentiation into account. The emergent theory of monopolistic competition came with its own problems, however - namely, 2 ̆ 2 excessive 2 ̆ 2 product variety and advertising, chronic excess capacity, and prices above short-run marginal cost. In sharp contrast to the ruinous competition model, the monopolistic competition model called for aggressive antitrust enforcement. This change of model largely explains the Roosevelt administration 2 ̆ 7 s abrupt shift in antitrust policy between the First and Second New Deals. Only with John Maurice Clark 2 ̆ 7 s theory of <b>workable</b> <b>competition</b> in 1940 and the Mason-Bain structure-conduct-performance paradigm developed in the 1950 s did neoclassical competition theory begin to reach a new equilibrium which attempted to calibrate the amount and kind of competition policy necessary to produce satisfactory results in diverse markets.

40|$|The {{influence}} of laissez-faire ideology on economic policy {{in recent years}} has been profound. Proponents of this form of economic liberalisation rely heavily on antitrust, also known as competition law, to fill the void left by dismantled regulatory regimes. In most situations, antitrust law provides a mechanism which ensures that markets operate on a competitive basis and thus maximise the welfare of society. However, in some industries, antitrust law is not sufficient to promote and foster <b>workable</b> <b>competition.</b> This is of particular concern where the uncompetitive industry has the potential to adversely affect a neighbouring or related industry. This research analyses the computer reservation system industry in Europe, North America and Australasia. It looks closely at the competitive difficulties of the CRS industry and explains how these difficulties affect two related industries-air transportation and travel agencies. A number of conclusions and policy recommendations emerge. The triangular relationship of inter-dependence between the CRS, air transportation and travel agency industries makes CRS vendors unusually resistant to conventional regulation. Neither antitrust law nor direct industry regulation are completely effective at preventing airlines which own CRSs from exploiting their competitive advantage in one industry in ways which anti-competitively affect trade in other industries. The research concludes that for the Australian and New Zealand markets, a blend of competition law and light-handed regulation is appropriate. For the United States market, increased antitrust enforcement by the correct agencies combined with active regulatory threats is required to create a fair air transportation market. The thesis recommends a consistent world-wide code of conduct to promote global airline competition. Such a code could then be adopted by individual states and complemented by their competition law legislation...|$|E
40|$|The {{corporate}} sector in India has witnessed a substantial growth of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As) during the 1990 s, {{facilitated by the}} policy-shift under Structural Adjustment Program. During the first wave (i. e., 1990 - 95), the Indian corporate houses {{seem to have been}} bracing up to face foreign competition while the second wave (i. e., 1995 - 2000) experienced a large presence of multinational firms. M&As also determined, to a large extent, the nature of foreign investment in the country during this period. A large share of these M&As were between firms belonging to the same business groups with a view to increase their respective controlling blocs in order to guard against a takeover. However, the study could not find any evidence of efficiency-related factors influencing M&As. It is rather growth of the firm in terms of their asset-size and market share that have been noticed. There are indications that one of the main motives could have been financial, that is, to increase the equity size, which can be further used to borrow resources for modernization. It is indeed a matter of grave concern that with the end of licensing policies, not even a reliable list of MNEs in India could be located from a publicly available source, not to speak of reliable information about their operations in the country.

40|$|Competitive {{electricity}} markets are artificial markets with extensive rules {{for all participants}} arising from the complex interconnections of the electricity network. Governments or regulatory agencies oversee the market design process and the operation and maintenance of the market, so market design is necessarily a political process. The conceptual design of the market must recognise the political forces that will operate on the market design process so that the political process will not thwart the intended outcome of the market {{as it has in}} some jurisdictions including Ontario. The limited ability of consumers to understand changes in the electricity sector in the short run poses a real constraint on what can be achieved politically. Letting the market set the price means that governments cannot ensure any particular future price level and both theory and experience tell us that prices may increase after restructuring (California, Ontario, Alberta). This makes it difficult to sell restructuring to consumers who will be interested in the price they pay and not much interested in abstractions like efficiency. Another challenge for electricity restructuring is that the starting points differ from one jurisdiction to another and the starting points matter. The problems are different if you begin with a crown monopoly than if you have investor-owned utilities; if expected prices are higher than recent prices rather than lower; if governments have been deeply involved in the electricity sector rather than distant from it; if the public has experience with stable electricity prices rather than fluctuating prices. Finally, the situation in neighbouring jurisdictions matters as well. Restructuring in a low-price jurisdiction surrounded by high prices will increase the prospect of price increases at home, while a high-price island is more likely to see its prices decline. If <b>workable</b> <b>competition</b> will be difficult to achieve at home, strong interties to neighbouring jurisdictions can improve competitive performance if the market is appropriately designed. Air pollution, like electricity, moves across borders, so one must assess and evaluate the pollution implications of competition and make any appropriate adjustments to the market design. electricity restructuring, electric utilities, market design, electricity price, electricity market, spot price, retail competition...|$|E
40|$|Transaction cost {{economics}} (2 ̆ 2 TCE 2 ̆ 2) has radically altered {{industrial organization}} 2 ̆ 7 s explanation for so-called 2 ̆ 2 non-standard contracts, 2 ̆ 2 including 2 ̆ 2 exclusionary 2 ̆ 2 agreements that exclude rivals from access to inputs or customers. According to TCE, such integration usually reduces transaction costs without producing anticompetitive harm. TCE has accordingly exercised growing influence over antitrust doctrine, with courts invoking TCE 2 ̆ 7 s teachings to justify revision of some doctrines once hostile to such contracts. Still, old habits die hard, even for courts of increasing economic sophistication. This Article critiques one such habit, namely, courts 2 ̆ 7 continuing claim that firms use market or monopoly power to impose exclusionary contracts on unwilling trading partners. In so doing, the Article {{takes issue with}} both the Harvard and Chicago Schools of Antitrust, normally seen as antagonists, {{each of which has}} erroneously embraced the 2 ̆ 2 market power 2 ̆ 2 model of contract formation. For the last several decades, courts have premised particular rules of antitrust liability upon the assumption that firms used preexisting market power to 2 ̆ 2 coerce 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 7 force 2 ̆ 2 trading partners to enter exclusionary agreements. Most notably, courts have held that a monopolist 2 ̆ 7 s use of such power to obtain an exclusionary agreement violates § 2 of the Sherman Act, without any additional showing that the agreement produced economic harm. Following similar logic, courts enforcing § 1 of the Act have banned tying agreements obtained by firms with market power, reasoning that sellers used their power to 2 ̆ 7 force 2 ̆ 2 buyers to enter such contracts. Finally, courts have invoked the market power model when holding that dealers or consumers can challenge unlawful agreements they have themselves entered and enforced, contrary to the common law doctrine of in pari delicto (2 ̆ 2 in equal fault 2 ̆ 2). Courts have reasoned that plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 participation in such contracts is involuntary, because defendants use market power to impose them. While modern courts sometimes consider evidence that such agreements produce benefits, they nonetheless assume that sellers employ market power to impose them and treat such coercive imposition as a harm coexisting with any efficiencies. These doctrines survive to this day, along with the market power model of contract formation, despite courts 2 ̆ 7 increasing economic sophistication. This Article locates the origin of these doctrines and the market power model in price theory 2 ̆ 7 s <b>workable</b> <b>competition</b> model, often associated with the 2 ̆ 2 Harvard School 2 ̆ 2 of Antitrust. Assumptions informing the <b>workable</b> <b>competition</b> model excluded the possibility that exclusionary agreements produced benefits, giving rise to the natural inference that firms with market power imposed such contracts against the will of trading partners. Courts embraced this account of these agreements and announced hostile doctrines resting upon the assumption that such contracts were expressions of market power 2 ̆ 2 used 2 ̆ 2 to impose them. While Chicago School scholars questioned these doctrines, their critique ironically rested upon a more precise price-theoretic account of how firms purportedly used market power to impose these agreements. In the past few decades, TCE has emerged as a competing paradigm for evaluating non-standard contracts. Building on the work of Ronald Coase, practitioners of TCE argued that many such contracts, including those that 2 ̆ 2 exclude 2 ̆ 2 rivals, can reduce the cost of transacting, particularly anticipated costs of opportunism made possible by relationship-specific investments. While most practitioners of TCE have ignored the means by which such contracts are formed, Coase himself once indicated that such integration was 2 ̆ 2 voluntary, 2 ̆ 2 albeit without elaboration. This Article elaborates on prior work by the author and others showing that firms can induce voluntary acceptance of these provisions by offering cost-justified discounts to trading partners who agree to them, thereby using the institution of contract to redefine background rights and obligations so as to minimize transaction costs. While courts have sometimes invoked TCE 2 ̆ 7 s beneficial characterization of such agreements, they have not recognized the implication, examined here, that such contracts are purely voluntary, clinging instead to the decades-old conclusion that firms use preexisting market power to impose them. TCE does not teach that all non-standard agreements reduce transaction costs. Moreover, parallel developments suggest that some such agreements may reduce economic welfare by raising rivals 2 ̆ 7 costs and conferring market power. Here again, however, {{there is no reason to}} believe that proponents of such agreements use market power to impose them. Instead, proponents can induce input suppliers to enter such contracts voluntarily, simply by sharing with them expected monopoly profits the arrangements will help create. Thus, such agreements are no more 2 ̆ 2 coercive 2 ̆ 2 than ordinary cartel arrangements...|$|E
