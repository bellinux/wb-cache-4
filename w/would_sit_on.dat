5|$|The {{imperial}} ambassador {{reported that}} {{in the presence of}} guests, Henry <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts. Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king {{to spend more time with}} Catherine and sire more children. In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Joan and Victoria. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of Joan, who died in her womb. The surviving daughter, Victoria, died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.|$|E
5|$|In {{the charter}} of the Presidential Council, each of the three leaders <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a Presidential Council which would be tasked with {{approving}} all major policy decisions of the country. At the same time, each would get two years as the President of the country able to implement many of the ongoing tasks of managing the military and civil service in the country. The various ministerial positions would be divided between the three leaders; however, the Ministry of the Interior and the Minister of the Army would be appointed by the sitting president. It was decided that Maga would be the first President from 1970 until 1972, followed by Ahomadégbé until 1974, and then Apithy until 1976. One peaceful transition occurred with Hubert Maga giving power to Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin on 7 May 1972. However, stalled politics ensued with Maga and Apithy working to undermine Ahomadégbé's ability to govern and the Presidential Council was ended on 26 October 1972 when a military coup led by Mathieu Kérékou assumed power and ruled the country until 1991.|$|E
25|$|Boris Ermolaev, a Russian psychic, {{was known}} for levitating small objects. His methods were exposed on the World of Discovery {{documentary}} Secrets of the Russian Psychics (1992). Ermolaev <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a chair and allegedly move the objects between his knees but due to the lighting conditions a fine thread fixed between his knees suspending the objects was observed by the camera crew.|$|E

25|$|Callosities on the ischium {{imply that}} these animals <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> their {{haunches}} {{for extended periods}} of time, probably while feeding. Pad-supporting bony growth on the dorsal side of the manual phalanges is interpreted as evidence of knuckle-walking, which would probably be useful to avoid wearing down the claws, preserving them for use either as a forage-collecting rake or as a formidable defensive weapon.|$|E
25|$|The {{destruction}} of Hatshepsut's images began during the co-regency of Amenhotep {{when his father}} was very old, but stopped during his reign. However, the king may have harboured his father's concern that another woman <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the throne. Despite his efforts however it is possible that a female co-regent of Akhenaten ruled as pharaoh before the end of his own 18th dynasty. His cause of death is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The sternsheetsman and bowman {{were to be}} {{available}} to take over from the coxswain or stoker should they be killed or injured. On longer journeys they might relieve them to rest. They also manned any additional machine guns and operated the kedge anchor, if it was required.

50|$|Wilson {{also stated}} that Carmody had failed to hear any cases in recent weeks, preferring instead to {{undertake}} a public relations role {{which resulted in the}} other Supreme Court judges having to bear a heavier workload. According to Wilson, the Chief Justice stated that he <b>would</b> occasionally <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the Court of Appeal but <b>would</b> otherwise not <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> first instance matters in Brisbane.|$|R
5|$|The kulintang {{is played}} by {{striking}} the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. When playing the kulintang, the Maguindanao and Maranao <b>would</b> always <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> chairs while for the Tausug/Suluk and other groups that who play the kulintangan, they <b>would</b> commonly <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the floor. Modern techniques include twirling the beaters, juggling them in midair, changing {{the arrangement of the}} gongs either before or while playing, crossings hands during play or adding very rapid fire strokes all in an effort to show off a player's grace and virtuosity.|$|R

500|$|The new line-up entered Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey, England in mid-May 1990 {{to record}} the new album with {{producer}} Geoff Emerick, who had previously been the engineer for several albums by The Beatles. While recording the album Emerick <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the stairs outside the studio {{so that he could}} [...] "listen to the mix properly". Emerick employed the use of instruments such as sitars and tabla as well as backwards guitar loops. The album contained many of Sergeant's favoured psychedelic influences.|$|E
500|$|The {{garden at}} the rear of the house {{featured}} raised flowerbeds which Dakers described as being [...] "planned according to those pleasances depicted in medieval romances; beds of scarlet tulips, bordered with stone fencing". On a mosaic terrace, around a statue of a boy holding a hawk, sculpted by Thomas Nicholls, Burges and his guests <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> [...] "marble seats or on Persian rugs and embroidered cushions." [...] The garden, and that of the adjacent Woodland House, contain trees from the former Little Holland House.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{included}} the song on her setlist for her 2011 world concert tour entitled California Dreams Tour. For {{performances of the}} song, she <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a flower-entwined bower swing that rises up to reveal a large white bridal train that flows out to complete the entire backdrop. At the same time, a bubble machine started-up and the bed-sheet hanging behind her showed footage of cartoon animals falling in love. In a review {{of one of her}} concerts Ed Masley from The Arizona Republic called her performance of [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] was [...] "sweet".|$|E

500|$|During Victoria's {{lifetime}} and {{after her death}} in 1901, there have been rumours that Conroy or someone else, and not the Duke of Kent, was her biological father. Historians have continued to debate the accuracy and validity of these claims. In his 2003 work The Victorians, biographer A. N. Wilson suggests that Victoria was not actually descended from George III because several of her descendants had haemophilia, which was unknown among her recognised ancestors. Haemophilia is a genetic disease that [...] impairs the body's ability to control blood clotting, {{which is used to}} stop bleeding when a blood vessel is broken; it is carried in the female line but the symptoms manifest mostly in males. Wilson proposes that the Duchess of Kent took a lover (not necessarily Conroy) to ensure that a Coburg <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the British throne.|$|E
500|$|Texas {{entered the}} yard's {{floating}} drydock at approximately 22:30 on 13 December, at high tide with only [...] to spare between her hull and the blocks she <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on.</b> She underwent a 14-month refit {{that sought to}} restore the ship to her 1945 condition. While under refit, yard workers sand-blasted paint from not only the hull but also the superstructure and replaced many tons of rusted metal from the hull. Inside the ship, welders and fabricators replaced weakened structural beams and numerous rusted-out deck plates. Topside, workers removed the concrete from the main deck and made repairs. (A new pinewood deck would be installed in Green's Bayou.) In total, more than [...] of steel (amounting to about 15% of the ship's hull) was replaced and more than 40,000 rivets were seal-welded on the underwater hull.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} filmed during September 9–11, 1994 at the Lenox Lounge and on {{location}} on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. McDaniel {{and her team}} scouted out low-rent, speak-easy locations and they did street-casting, assembling off-beat characters, from transvestites to card tricksters and edgy Harlem teenagers. However, {{when it came to}} filming there was a problem—McDaniel's approach was to start the camera and let the cast improvise, but Madonna wanted direction. She <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the chair and when McDaniel said [...] "Action", she would still sit there saying impatiently, [...] "What am I doing? What am I doing? Hello?" [...] The director was overawed by Madonna's big entourage and had held herself from speaking her mind about the singer's look. She later asked Madonna to appear edgy like Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in the 1990 drama film Last Exit to Brooklyn. Madonna had her hair and makeup re-done and it was the final look for the video.|$|E

500|$|The El Capitan Theatre, at Nixon's insistence, {{was entirely}} deserted. Press members were {{confined}} to a nearby room, where they could watch on television; stenographers were {{standing by at the}} Ambassador to ensure an accurate transcript of Nixon's remarks for the press, who would be facing deadlines in the East. Chotiner and Rogers would watch from behind a screen in the theatre; Pat Nixon, wearing a dress knitted by supporters, <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> stage a few feet from her husband. The chosen set was a [...] "GI bedroom den" [...] with a desk, two chairs, and bookshelves. The senator usually preferred to work from a memorized text, but would work from notes for this speech to make the talk sound more spontaneous. Nixon spent some time practicing movements for the cameramen and finally went into the dressing room with his wife for a few minutes of solitude. He told her that he did not think he could go through with it, but she reassured him.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} years of Richard's reign, and {{particularly}} in the months after the suppression of the appellants in 1397, the king enjoyed a virtual monopoly on power in the country, a relatively uncommon situation in medieval England. In this period a particular court culture was allowed to emerge, one that differed sharply from that of earlier times. A new form of address developed; where the king previously had been addressed simply as [...] "highness", now [...] "royal majesty", or [...] "high majesty" [...] were often used. It was said that on solemn festivals Richard <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> his throne in the royal hall for hours without speaking, and anyone on whom his eyes fell had to bow his knees to the king. The inspiration for this new sumptuousness and emphasis on dignity came from the courts on the continent, not only the French and Bohemian courts that had been the homes of Richard's two wives, but also the court that the Black Prince had maintained while residing in Aquitaine.|$|E
500|$|A breaker boy was a coal-mining {{worker in}} the United States and United Kingdom whose job was to {{separate}} impurities from coal by hand in a coal breaker. Although breaker boys were primarily children, elderly coal miners who could no longer work in the mines because of age, disease, or accident were also sometimes employed as breaker boys. The use of breaker boys began around 1866. For 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal. Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by pushing their boots into the stream of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly pick out the impurities, and then let the coal pass {{on to the next}} breaker boy for further processing. Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into [...] "clean" [...] coal bins.|$|E

50|$|In 1932, Brostugan was renovated and {{redesigned}} by architect Ivar Tengbom and {{the same}} year a restaurant with a bakery opened.

500|$|The couple {{set about}} {{planning}} {{a new house}} to replace the aging tower house, and in 1694 the Earl contacted Sir William Bruce, who promised to design [...] "a convenient little house, gardings and courts". The property was surveyed by John Adair, and the old tower house was taken down. The survey took {{the place of a}} site visit by Bruce, who was at this time under virtual house arrest, due to his political leanings, and suspected Jacobite sympathies. Design submissions were also obtained from James Smith and Robert Mylne. Smith's scheme was judged too small and irregular by Bruce, who urged the Earl to agree to his own [...] "modish and regullar designe". However, the house as built by Bruce is partially based on Smith's early design. Before work on the house commenced, a courtyard, [...] across, was laid out, establishing the formal arrangement in which the house <b>would</b> <b>sit.</b> <b>On</b> 16 February 1698, a contract was signed between Lord Annandale and the mason Thomas Bauchop, for a house , and [...] high, all [...] "according to the modell of wood and draught signed by Sir William Bruce of Kinross".|$|E
500|$|When {{comparing}} work on Batman Forever, Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, explained, [...] "It {{just felt}} like everything got a little soft the second time. On Batman Forever, I felt like I was making a movie. The second time, I felt like I was making a kid's toy commercial." [...] He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable {{than the one he}} wore in Batman Forever, with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face. According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, [...] "Joel [...] <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take, 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of {{set the tone for the}} film." [...] Production designer Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from [...] "neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World's Fair on ecstasy." [...] Rhythm and Hues and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences, with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 October 1956, {{the first}} order day of its 1956 term, the Supreme Court asked J.
