Atualmente, esta fazenda corresponde ao Club Méditerranée, na cota próxima ao oceano Atlântico e à Reserva Rio das Pedras, acima da Rodovia Rio/Santos (BR- 101), sendo um remanescente de Floresta Ombrófila Densa no Estado. O objetivo deste estudo foi resgatar informações sobre o uso de plantas medicinais pelos sitiantes que ainda residem nesta Reserva. Através de entrevistas estruturadas e semi-estruturadas aplicadas junto à comunidade, pôde-se fazer um levantamento das plantas presentes ao redor das casas dos mesmos. Ao todo foram citadas 36 espécies medicinais, distribuídas em 34 gêneros e 25 famílias. Estas espécies estão relacionadas a 28 usos medicinais, organizados em sete categorias. Predominaram espécies de plantas herbáceas (21 spp.) seguidas das arbustivas (oito spp.) e arbóreas (cinco spp.). Constatou-se que a folha foi a parte mais utilizada e o modo de preparo do remédio foi o decocto. Quantificou-se o número de citações por informante para cada táxon, possibilitando a indicação das espécies mais utilizadas na área, como a erva-de-santa-maria (Chenopodium ambrosioides L.) e a pitanga (Eugenia uniflora L.). The ranchers {{who live}} in Rio das Pedras Reserve, which lies in Mangaratiba County, State of Rio da Janeiro, came from sharecroppers {{who worked at the}} banana {{plantation}} of the farmer Goiabal farm. Nowadays, that farm corresponds to the Méditerranée Club in the area next to the Atlantic Ocean and to Rio das Pedras Reservation, above the Rio/Santos highway (BR- 101), it is a remainder of the Dense Ombrophylous Forest in the State. The aim {{of this study was to}} collect information about the use of medicinal plants by the ranchers who still live in that Reservation. A survey of the plants, which could be found in the area surrounding their houses, was done through the use of structured and semi-structured interviews. In all, 36 medicinal vegetal speciesdistributed in 34 genera and in 25 families were mentioned. Those species are related to 28 medicinal uses, organized in seven categories. The herb species (21 species) prevailed, followed by shrubs (eight species) and arboreal (five species). The leaf was found to be the part of the plant most used and the mode of preparation of the medicine was the decoction. The number of citations by the informants for each taxon was quantified, making it possible to indicate the <b>worm</b> <b>seed</b> (Chenopodium ambrosioides L.) and pitanga (Eugenia uniflora L.) as the most used species in the area...|$|E

50|$|Seeds are {{collected}} {{immediately after the}} fruit falls to avoid germination in the wet soil or infestation by <b>worms.</b> <b>Seeds</b> {{are collected}} by hand and it usually it takes 4-5 weeks for the crop to be collected. The germ is removed by hand and the fruits are decorticated with wooden mallets; the kernels are broken and sterilized in the process. The kernels are dried by agitating them in a layer 4-5 feet deep under the sun in a godown. The kernel is broken up to 6-7 mm size and crushed through an expeller; 8-9% oil is recovered from the seed, then the oil cake is processed by solvent extraction to yield the remaining oil from the oil cake.|$|R

50|$|The {{compromised}} machine becomes {{merged into}} a botnet. While most botnets are controlled through a central server, which if found {{can be taken}} down to destroy the botnet, the Storm <b>Worm</b> <b>seeds</b> a botnet that acts {{in a similar way}} to a peer-to-peer network, with no centralized control. Each compromised machine connects to a list of a subset of the entire botnet - around 30 to 35 other compromised machines, which act as hosts. While each of the infected hosts share lists of other infected hosts, no one machine has a full list of the entire botnet - each only has a subset, making it difficult to gauge the true extent of the zombie network. On 7 September 2007, estimates {{of the size of the}} Storm botnet ranged from 1 to 10 million computers. Researchers from the University of Mannheim and the Institut Eurecom have estimated concurrent online storm nodes to be between 5,000 and 40,000.|$|R

40|$|A {{guide to}} using RNAi and other nucleotide-based {{technologies}} About 10 years ago, I performed my first ever RNAi experiment in Caenorhabditis elegans. I had just joined Julie Ahringer’s laboratory as a post-doc and was {{barely able to}} distinguish normal worms from abnor-mal worms, but nevertheless decided to perform RNAi by feeding [1, 2]. The concept was to feed bacteria engineered to produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). These dsRNA molecules recognize a specific mRNA, through sequence complement, and target this mRNA for degradation in most cells of the organism [3]. The RNAi procedure consisted of growing bacteria, <b>seeding</b> <b>worms</b> on plates {{and waiting for the}} mothers to lay embryos. Surely,...|$|R

She led them out into the farmyard, clucking and {{scratching}} busily; for all were hungry, and ran chirping round her to pick up the <b>worms</b> and <b>seeds</b> she found for them. Cocky soon began to help take care of his sisters; and when a nice corn or a fat bug was found, he would step back and let little Downy or Snowball have it. But Peck would run and push them away, and gobble up the food greedily. He chased them away from the pan where the meal was, and picked the down off their necks if they tried to get their share. His mother scolded him when the little ones ran to hide under her wings; but he didn't care, and was very naughty. Cocky began to crow when he was very young, and had such a fine voice that people liked to hear his loud, clear [...] "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" [...] early in the morning; for he woke before the sun was up, and began his song. Peck used to grumble at being roused at dawn, for he was lazy; but the hens bustled up, and were glad {{to get out of the}} hen-house.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Seed morphs of Calendula officinalis were {{investigated}} {{in order to}} examine the genetic variability which correlates with seed polymorphism and its impact on collection strategy of gene banks. The basic parameters to get the evidence were obtained from morphological data, karyotype analysis, electrophoretic pattern of seed proteins as well as nucleic acid analysis. Seven seed morphs were observed from every inflorescence as follows: curve, winged, insect leg, balloon rough, balloon smooth, worm and open <b>worm.</b> All <b>seed</b> morphs were diploid, with thirty-two chromosomes observed in somatic cells. Karyotype studies showed that the seed forms have different karyotype formulae. However, the chromosome type nearly submetacentric (-) and nearly metacentric are representing in all karyotype formulae of all seed forms. Where as Nearly submetacentric (+) was represented in all forms except in both insect leg and balloon smooth forms and nearly subtelocentric (-) was represented only in the insect leg form. Not only the dissimilarity was found in the morphology of chromosomes but also in the mean chromosome length (MCL) and diploid chromosome length (DCL). The types and proportions of abnormalities observed at mitotic division were analysed. The electrophoretic analysis revealed the presence of eleven bands of molecular weight ranging from 70. 50 to 15. 00 KD. Four bands were common to all seed types: 35. 00, 31. 50, 21. 00 and 20. 00 KD. However, some bands were more restricted to particular seed types thus; band 70. 50 KD was present only in winged and insect leg wherea...|$|R
5000|$|Rugosodon is {{represented}} by a nearly complete fossilized skeleton, including a skull, that bears a strong resemblance to a small rat or a chipmunk. The mammal is estimated to have weighed between 65-80 g, about that of an average chipmunk. The generic name Rugosodon (Latin for [...] "wrinkly tooth") refers to the rugosity, or wrinkliness, of the distinctively shaped teeth. Its teeth indicate that the animal was an omnivore, well-adapted to gnawing both plants and animals, including fruits and <b>seeds,</b> <b>worms,</b> insects and small vertebrates. Its ankle joints were highly mobile at rotation, a characteristic of mammals living in trees. This means that the ankle is remarkably flexible, allowing the foot to hyper-extend downward — like a ballerina standing on pointed toes — and to rotate through {{a wide range of}} motion. This feature, along with highly mobile digits, defines the multituberculates and is not seen in other mammalian lineages of the era. Rugosodon also had a highly flexible spine, which would have allowed it to twist both left to right and front to back.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans became in {{the last}} years one of the most investigated animal models in the context of studies on aging. Among various approaches, NMR metabolomics investigations have emerged to characterize aging nematodes or long-lived mutant stains. Under standard conditions worms were grown on Normal Growth Medium (NGM) agar plates seeded with bacteria, which serve as food for the <b>worms.</b> After <b>seeding</b> the plates were in general used for several days to weeks. The aging of the bacteria on the plates implies a potential evolution in the quality of the nematode food, including viability of the bacteria and/or changes in their metabolite composition that may finally impact on the metabolism of C. elegans. Here, we present the impact of aging bacteria on the metabolic fingerprints of C. elegans using high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) NMR as a whole organism profiling technique. The study was performed on C. elegans N 2 wild type and dys- 1 (cx 18) mutant strains. As nematode food source we investigated the Escherichia coli OP 50 strain. O-PLS models built from 1 H HR-MAS NMR data revealed a significant discrimination between worms grown on fresh or aged OP 50 plates. The differences are mostly explained by an altered composition of the C. elegans lipid profile. While worms grown on aged NGM agar plates contain less monounsaturated fatty acids than those bred on plates freshly seeded with bacteria, they are shown to integrate exogenous cyclopropane fatty acids (CFA) in their lipid profiles. The CFA level can exceed 30 % of the total amount of fatty acids in the worm, and come as direct intake from the bacterial food. Such findings are of primary importance in the general design of metabolomic studies on C. elegans, where biais or alteration in the lipid profiles, as influenced by the bacterial diet, should carefully be monitored...|$|R
50|$|Thin {{leaves are}} seized with the mouth, while thick ones are dragged by {{creating}} a vacuum. Leaves and stones are used to plug up the burrow. This may deter predators, keep out water and/or keep out chilled air (the latter is Darwin's preferred function). Leaves are dragged in mostly by the tips, which is the easiest way of doing it, but when the base is narrower the worms change behaviour. They drag pine needle clusters in by the base. Petioles are used to plug up burrows, and for food. Worms drag experimental triangles of paper by the apex most of the time, and do not rely on trial and error. Worms excavate burrows by consuming material or, preferably, pushing it away. They mainly consume soil for nutrients. They are found down to six or more feet, especially in extreme conditions. Burrows are lined, which serve several functions, and terminate in a chamber lined with stones or <b>seeds.</b> <b>Worms</b> are found all over the planet, some on isolated islands; how they got there is a mystery. Darwin draws on correspondence with {{people from around the}} world such as Fritz Müller in Brazil.|$|R
40|$|Several factors which, {{being present}} in the feces and methods of culture, might have {{influence}} {{on the development of}} Ancylostoma and Trichostrongylus orientalis are investigated. The result is summarized as follows : 1. A study of the eggs of Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale and Trichostrongylus orientalis in the feces left standing in a room temperature (19 ℃ on an average) and in a low temperature (0. 3 ℃ on an average) revealed that the survival curve followed by Trichostrongylus orientalis was the most gentle, followed by the survival curves representing Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus in the indicated order. Low temperature did a great deal of injuries to the eggs of all three kinds of worms. 2. Considering that some eggs may perish if the feces containing them are left standing for a long while, it is desirable that the sample of feces used for measurements of the numbers of worms is as fresh as is obtainable. In view of the fact, however, {{that at least some of}} the larvae of these three kinds of worms survived a low temperature for ten days, the eggs of worms {{present in the}} feces would be identifiable even if they are left standing for a while. 3. If the surface of a rough tile to be smeared with a sample of the feces is about 7. 5 cm. in diameter, the proper amount of a sample to be used would be from 0. 1 gm. to 0. 3 gm. However low the density of the distribution of worm eggs in the feces may be, they are sure to be detected upon culture, if this amount of feces is used. 4. Experiments performed in order to see if dilutions of some disinfectants, antiseptics and antibiotics have any advantage over filtered water as a medium to be used for the culture of these worm eggs revealed that a good result could be obtained by <b>seeding</b> <b>worm</b> eggs in filtered water, unless germ-free culture is what the investigator has in view. 5. Comparison of Kawara (rough tile) culture method with filter paper method revealed that the tormer always produced larger numbers of larvae than the latter. 6. The author has developed erect Kawara culture method in which are incorporated the virtues of the above two methods. 7. There is no choice between erect Kawara culture method and Kawara culture method so far as the number of larvae developed is concerned. However, the former is superior to the latter in that it is easier to operate. Erect Kawara culture method would, therefore, be useful in mass examinations to detect parasite worm eggs...|$|R
