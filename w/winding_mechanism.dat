5|$|Major repairs {{were carried}} out to the spire in 1946–47 under the {{supervision}} of architect Kenneth Dalgleish, following damage sustained during the Second World War. In 1957, the bells were again repaired. On 25 August 1959, the church was added to the register of listed buildings. It is Grade I listed. The clock was repaired in 1972 in memory of George Prentice, rector of Mereworth from 1966–70. A new fibreglass clock face was fitted at this time and the <b>winding</b> <b>mechanism</b> converted to electric power. In 2005, an inspection revealed that the church needed major repairs. English Heritage made a grant that covered 95% of the £500,000 cost of restoration. The work was carried out {{under the supervision of}} architects Thomas Ford & Partners, and won the 2009 Georgian Group award for best restoration of a Georgian church.|$|E

On 18 December the renovated station came into use, with automated turnstiles (and a substantial price rise). Lingering problems with the ticketing system upgrade were fixed during the October 2007 annual survey. A new computer was also added to the <b>winding</b> <b>mechanism</b> during the survey which has caused a few temporary issues with how smoothly the cars run.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} mid-1930s clockworks were a Seth Thomas Clock Company 8-day timepiece, Model #4 - 1912 tower clock {{movement with}} serial number 3180. This movement had a 4 foot long pendulum with a 28 lb. pendulum ball. It featured a power <b>wind</b> <b>mechanism</b> with a mercury switch {{that included a}} power reserve of 2 to 3 hours. When the weights dropped to a fixed distance the mercury switch was triggered which then activated the power <b>wind</b> <b>mechanism</b> to automatically rewind the weights. The movement was eventually converted to a full electric motor driven mechanism (electrified) in the 1980s.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the winch winding {{properties}} of typical driving mechanisms of cable-driven parallel robots. While cable properties have already been studied, the accuracy of <b>winding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to control cable robots and the interaction with cable properties {{has yet to be}} investigated. To initiate this, some properties believed to affect the winding accuracy are outlined. It was found that cable force can have a significant effect not only because of finite stiffness, but due to ovalisation and elongation effects of the rope. An experimental test on ovalisation showed significant deviations from a standard approximation to evaluate transmission accuracy. This effect can change the accuracy of <b>winding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> by 0. 3 – 1. 2 %. Thus when investigating cable-robot accuracy the winch winding properties cannot be ignored...|$|R
25|$|The first {{designs were}} criticized {{as having a}} slow and {{cumbersome}} firing mechanism. The shells had to be individually loaded and then the drum wound by a clockwork mechanism. Shell ejection was by an ejector rod along the right hand side of the barrel. The last version has the clockwork <b>winding</b> <b>mechanism</b> removed, the ejector rod {{has been replaced by}} an automatic ejection system and in the rod's place is a cocking lever that winds the drum automatically. The Striker design has a twelve-round magazine capacity and short overall length. Compact variants have 7 rounds.|$|E
25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called miter gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A lower gate is taller than an upper gate, because the upper gate only has to be tall enough to close off the upper pound, while the lower gate {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The upper gate is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, <b>winding</b> <b>mechanism,</b> etc.; the lower gate's height equals the upper gate plus the lock's rise.|$|E
2500|$|Virtually all {{railroad}} {{rolling stock}} {{is equipped with}} manually operated mechanical hand brake devices that set and release the brakes. [...] Most of these involve a chain linked to the brake rigging, most often at the brake cylinder, that when tightened pull the piston out against the releasing springs, thus applying the brakes on the car (if {{there is only one}} brake cylinder per car) or bogie (if there is more than once cylinder per car). [...] Newer locomotives have electric systems that simply place an electric motor in place of the chain <b>winding</b> <b>mechanism.</b> [...] This brake acts independent of the action of the automatic air brakes, which function collectively when coupled in a train and are {{under the control of the}} locomotive driver / engineer.|$|E
40|$|A {{substantial}} part of South Africa is subject {{to more than one}} strong wind source. The effect of that on extreme winds is that higher quantiles are usually estimated with a mixed strong wind climate estimation method, compared to the traditional Gumbel approach based on a single population. The differences in the estimated quantiles between the two methods depend on the values of the Gumbel distribution parameters for the different strong <b>wind</b> <b>mechanisms</b> involved. Cluster analysis of the distribution parameters provides a characterization of the effect of the relative differences in their values, and therefore the dominance of the different strong <b>wind</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> For gusts, cold fronts tend to dominate over the coastal and high-lying areas, while other mechanisms, especially thunderstorms, are dominant over the lower-lying areas in the interior. For the hourly mean wind speeds cold fronts are dominant in the south-west, south and east of the country. On the West Coast the ridging of the Atlantic Ocean high-pressure system dominate in the south, while the presence of a deep trough or coastal low pressure system is the main strong <b>wind</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the north. In the central interior cold fronts tend to share their influence almost equally with other synoptic-scale mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|The {{transfer}} of mass from {{one component of}} a binary system to another by mass ejection is analyzed through a stellar <b>wind</b> <b>mechanism,</b> using a model which integrates the equations of motion, including the energy equation, with an initial static atmosphere and various temperature fluctuations imposed {{at the base of}} the star's corona. The model is applied to several situations and the energy flow is calculated along the line of centers between the two binary components, in the rotating frame of the system, thereby incorporating the centrifugal force. It is shown that relatively small disturbances in the lower chromosphere or photosphere can produce mass loss through a stellar <b>wind</b> <b>mechanism,</b> due to the amplification of the disturbance propagating into the thinner atmosphere. Since there are many possible sources of the disturbance, the model can be used to explain many mass ejection phenomena...|$|R
2500|$|As of 2010, the {{original}} 1836 turret clock mechanism by John Moore Junior (later John Moore & Sons) {{was on display}} at Herne Bay Museum and Gallery, having been replaced in 1971. The mechanism is sometimes erroneously attributed to Peter Morton of Herne Bay and John Greenwood of Canterbury because their names are engraved on the front, however they were the suppliers and could not have manufactured such a large mechanism. This mechanism is listed in John Moore's 1877 catalogue as: [...] "Herne Bay, Kent. Four 5ft dials, the gift of Mrs Thwaites (sic)." [...] It was installed in the tower on a trestle and encased in a deal box, with doors {{for access to the}} <b>winding</b> <b>mechanism.</b> It had extra brass wheels for the striking bell, and was held in an iron frame. The clock had to be wound twice a week, the clock weights providing the stored energy. The pendulum was about [...] long, giving a slow beat of nearly two seconds. The clock winder had to ascend 66 steps, then turn the heavy strike winder 75 times, and the time winder 20 times, using a crank. The bell, made of bell metal, was supplied by Thomas Mears II in 1837, weighs 12 cwt and measures [...] high and [...] diameter. The bell is still functioning in the Tower.|$|E

To initiate this, some properties believed to affect the winding accuracy are outlined.

Experimental investigations showed that cable force was the most significant factor contributing to a change in cable length. This effect can change the accuracy of <b>winding</b> <b>mechanisms</b> by 0. 3 % to 1. 2 %. The accuracy is not affected by winding speed, and only minimally affected by variable cable forces. This implies that when investigating cable robot accuracy, the winch winding properties cannot be ignored and an accurate winding model will need to take into account different winding states...|$|R

40|$|A major {{outstanding}} {{problem in}} stellar astrophysics lies {{in understanding the}} <b>wind</b> generation <b>mechanism</b> by which evolved giants lose mass. Phase-resolved observations of eclipsing symbiotic binary systems, containing a mass-losing giant and a hot white dwarf, are ideal for studying the <b>wind</b> generation <b>mechanisms</b> in evolved stars. For such systems we use the orbital motion of the dwarf through the giant?s wind to provide a pencil-beam view through the circumstellar gas. FUV observations can probe different layers of the wind in absorption, permitting the derivation of the velocity profile and providing valuable, spatially-resolved diagnostics of the cool wind. We present a series of FUSE and HST/STIS observations of two such systems and discuss our findings. The velocity profiles, and by implication, <b>wind</b> generation <b>mechanisms</b> for these giants are found to differ from those predicted by commonly used parametrisations. The phasing of our observations allow us to examine the density, temperature and velocity structure in the wind acceleration region, {{as well as the}} composition of the outflowing material...|$|R
