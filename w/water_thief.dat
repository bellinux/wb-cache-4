25|$|In Greece, a water {{clock was}} known as a clepsydra (<b>water</b> <b>thief).</b> The Greeks {{considerably}} advanced the water clock by tackling the problem of the diminishing flow. They introduced several types of the inflow clepsydra, one of which included the earliest feedback control system. Ctesibius invented an indicator system typical for later clocks such as the dial and pointer. The Roman engineer Vitruvius described early alarm clocks, working with gongs or trumpets. A commonly used water clock was the simple outflow clepsydra. This small earthenware vessel had a hole in its side near the base. In both Greek and Roman times, this type of clepsydra was used in courts for allocating periods of time to speakers. In important cases, when a person's life was at stake for example, it was filled. But, for more minor cases, it was only partially filled. If proceedings were interrupted for any reason, such as to examine documents, the hole in the clepsydra was stopped with wax until the speaker was able to resume his pleading.|$|E

Thief River Falls was home to the headquarters of the Cycle Detection Warning System up until its shutdown on April 13, 2009.|$|R
30|$|Thief {{zones are}} {{generally}} a channel with high absolute permeability. However, a not very strict theory analysis shows that neglecting {{the effect of}} variant of water saturation on formation of thief zone in mature reservoirs cannot explain some thief zones in mature reservoirs. This paper focuses {{on the effect of}} <b>water</b> saturation on <b>thief</b> zone development for wells in mature reservoirs with areal permeability heterogeneity. The water saturation increases in high permeable channel with water passing through, which gradually leads to higher value of water phase relative permeability, and thus leads to higher value of effective permeability k·k rw in the high permeable channel than that in surrounding reservoir. The gradually increasing difference of effective permeability k·k rw between permeable channel and surrounding reservoir would be the main reason for formation of thief zones in mature reservoir. The oil–water two-phase numerical model based on PEBI (perpendicular bisection) gridding is used to study effect of variant of water phase saturation on formation of thief zone. We find that relatively small pressure change and not obvious bump in pressure derivative curves during shut-in are indicators of thief zones in mature reservoirs. This finding provides a further understanding for the thief zone development and also gives us a guidance to interpret the buildup pressure data in the mature sandstone reservoirs. A field case study verifies the effectiveness of the new explanation.|$|R

40|$|Track IV: Materials for Energy ApplicationsIncludes {{audio file}} (20 min.) Crude oil {{is found in}} {{underground}} porous sandstone or carbonate rock formation. After primary (natural energy) and secondary recovery (water flooding) have been exhausted, about 2 / 3 rds of the original-oil-in-place is left behind. The US DOE states that Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods can produce another 200 billion of oil from the US reserves, same as what has cumulatively been produced so far. Excess water production is a major issue that leads to early well abandonment and unrecoverable hydrocarbon for mature wells. The average water to oil production ratio is greater than 7 : 1 in the USA. Gel treatments at injection wells to plug off preferentially the <b>water</b> <b>thief</b> zones are a proven cost-effective method to improve sweep efficiency in reservoirs and reduce excess water production during hydrocarbon production. A newer trend is applying preformed gels for the purpose because the preformed gels can overcome some distinct drawbacks inherent in in-situ gelation systems. This paper will summarize the preformed particle gel (PPG) conformance control technique which has been applied for about 2, 000 wells. The paper will present: (1) {{the importance of the}} method to oil industry, (2) the properties of PPG products, (3) the mechanisms for PPG to control conformance; (4) the lessons we have learned from field applications, and (5) future research to improve the current technology for better conformance control results...|$|E
