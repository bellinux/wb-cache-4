These identities fall into two kinds. The first kind relates nabla-type fractional differences and sums to delta ones. The second kind represented by the Q-operator relates left and right fractional sums and differences. This setting enables us to get identities resembling better the ordinary fractional case. Along with the previously mentioned points, we are able to fit a reasonable nabla integration by parts formula which remains in accordance with the one obtained in [15] but different from those obtained in [13] and [14]. The obtained dual identities are also used to obtain a delta integration by parts formula from the nabla one. The solution representation for the higher-order Riemann fractional difference equation is obtained as well and thus the result in [20] is generalized. We will see that the higher-order Riemann fractional difference initial value problem of non-integer order needs only one initial condition which is not the case for the higher-order difference equation (i.e., of positive integer order).|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in Vietnam, which has emerged and {{recognized}} recently. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) or Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) in Vietnam was recognized by first BOT Decree in 1993 after the Government amended the Law on Foreign Investment to make way for "Build Operate and Transfer" (BOT) projects in 1992. Various revisions were undertaken in 1997, 1998 and 1999. The prevailing legislation governing PPP practices in Vietnam is Decree No. 78 / 2007 /CP enacted by the Government on the 11 th of May 2007. This current BOT Decree is a generic law, stipulating the sectors, conditions, procedures and incentives applicable to infrastructure development investment projects through the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), Build-Transfer-Operate (BTO) or Build-Transfer (BT) contracts. Therefore, Decree No. 78 could be regarded as a key legislation related to PPP in Vietnam. Since PPP has introduced in Vietnam, there have been many problems in real-life practice. However, the Government and practitioners have still been vague about explaining its success and failure. Therefore, the main goal of this research is to clarify the problems with current BOT projects in Vietnam with insufficient assessments and explanations and find out what actors and factors (the iceberg) impede the good PPP practices in Vietnam, as well as come up with definite solutions to break these obstacles in order to live up good PPP performance in the future. The first part of this research is to review international literatures {{in order to get the}} insights on PPP topic by mastering its concept, various kinds of PPP, PPP project phases and its motives. Then, the theoretical framework of critical success factors (CSFs) of PPP infrastructure projects (called fishbone) is developed. There are 71 subfactors for the successful PPP project in the fishbone, which are classified in 12 main critical factors. Two main factors with various subfactors in each phase play as a cause for the successful effect in this phase and the successful effect in every above phase will live up the fruitful PPP project’s expectation. From the fishbone framework, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the most impeding factors to hinder good PPP practice in Vietnam. Also, This framework will be verified by a case study, BOT Phu My 2 - 2 energy project in Vietnam, so that we can show its potential application, observe its variation in order to improve it in the future. The second part of the study is to analyze the most hindering factors for PPP good practices in Vietnam, namely its financial market and PPP policy, whereby we improve the research of World Bank conducted for Vietnamese Government on these issues. For financial aspect, we investigate various financial resources of Vietnam for infrastructure investments. We found that Vietnam financial market is nascent and cannot be affordable for long-term and huge-capital-consuming PPP projects. As a result, we formulate recommendations for its future development to meet the requirements’ PPP projects. Also, we propose solutions to achieve financial arrangement at operational level. With regard to PPP policy, we assess what is good and what is bad in the Decree 78, and we claim that Decree 78 is not a good law governing PPP practices in Vietnam. Also, we suggest recommendations to improve many specific bad points in the Decree. The third part of this research presents state-of-the-art of PPP practices in Vietnam so as to observe how these weaknesses influence on the PPP opportunities and PPP projects in various sectors of Vietnam infrastructure and how actors deal with these obstacles. We have observed that the private involvement in Vietnam lags behind the comparators such as China, Indonesia, and Philippine due to a number of reasons. As looking closure to a number of real-life projects (2 real BOT cases and 10 domestic cases), the whole picture of actors’ behaviors and the conditions building up these behaviors are depicted. We found that the conditions for PPP practices in Vietnam are not favorable, thus actors cannot act in the right ways to which they are suppose to do in respect of institutional failures, nascent financial market, restrictions in specific sectors. In fourth part of the study, we analyze and explain the success or failure of BOT Phu My 2 phase energy project in Vietnam (PM 2. 2 or Phu My 2 - 2) to both verify fishbone framework and withdraw learned lessons for some findings of previous chapters as well as future PPP in Vietnam. Through the assessment on various phases, from exploration to 3 -year operation and maintenance phase (1996 - 2008), based on the propositions of fishbone framework, BOT Phu My 2 - 2 project was quite successful until recently because it satisfies many CSFs of fishbone. Therefore, we conclude that CSFs fishbone framework is rather fit to apply for evaluating the successful factors of PM 2. 2 even though there are some adjustments and new factors needed to add. As a result, we add four new factors to update the fishbone for its potential application in the future. In addition, based lessons learned from PM 2. 2, we improve the finding about financial arrangement at operational level; we correct for the failure cases (2 real BOT cases and 10 domestic cases); and we propose short-term and long-term strategy to facilitate Vietnamese PPP in the future. Finally, we present many problems posed in the course of conducting this research for PPP in Vietnam and PPP in general. From these arisen issues, we generate six research questions for Vietnamese PPP and four research questions for PPP on the whole, which can be conducted in the future.

40|$|Ciciban is {{the oldest}} Slovenian children's {{magazine}} that was founded in 1945 and is being published for 70 years. It's known as an educational magazine with didactical content for children. It's very popular among children and parents alike. In 1945 the Second World War has ended and with it political believes brought changes on all aspects of social life. The new government and ideology also had an influence on the school system. Through decades they were the cause of changes in methods and contents of education. It’s been 70 years since the first issue. To date there have been 840 issues. With a broad variety of didactical contents, the magazine offers us a look through the school system and its changes from 1945 to 2015. I divided the era between 1945 (first issue) to 2015 on seven decades and analyzed 3 - 5 stories inside every decade which I quoted based on school thematic from the magazine Ciciban. I analyzed them after the three motives which are the student, {{the teacher and the}} school. We were interested if there is any school thematic included in the magazines, if the social-politic changes affected on the school system and the working staff. We wanted to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how the teachers, the students and the school itself were portrayed in those times and how they are portrayed now, with the analysis of different parts we chose. What were their rights and duties in the time of war and what kind of a ˝comfort˝ we are living in since 1991 when Slovenia became an independent country. The secret advertising in Ciciban magazines is an outcome of changes in the developing technology, which was developing trough decades. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> be <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> if the advertising agencies are using children magazines for communicating with them, their parents and teachers, and in what forms the advertisements appear.

40|$|The {{link between}} seen and unseen, matter and spirit, flesh and soul was always presumed, but never {{clarified}} enough, leaving room for debates and mostly controversies between the scientific domains and theologies {{of a different}} type; how could God, who is immaterial, have created the material world? Therefore, the logic of obtaining a result on this concern (would be) is first to see how religions have always seen the ratio between divinity and matter/universe. In this part, {{the idea of a}} world personality is implied by many, so that nature itself was transformed into a person; others have seen within the universe/the world a Spirit ruling all, connecting all and bending all to God’s commands. In a way or another, every culture has gifted the universe/nature with the capability of ruling all, seeing everything and controlling, even determining facts by connecting all together with a Great Spirit. What is this Great Spirit of all and where it resides? With the analogy of human body in relation to his Spirit <b>we</b> <b>will</b> try to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> a place or vehicle for the Spirit to dwell the body, and the Great Spirit the matter. The Christianity names this linkage between God and matter as ‘the (un) created grace of God’, which indwells matter and helps the Creator move and transform things. Is there any scientific argument to sustain such assertion? Can we argue somehow that God’s voice makes matter vibrate from within the way it can recombine primer elements into giant stars to the human body? If so, what should be the ratio between theology and science on this issue and with these assertions? How could God command to matter to bring things and beings out of it and what were the material leverages {{that was supposed to be}} operated to accomplish His <b>will?</b> However, if <b>we</b> can assume that God resides in the universe – as a whole, His body, or as in its very fabric – can we also <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how is this even possible, without transforming our explanation into a pantheistic and immanent exclusive one? Through these ‘divine leverages within matter’ theory, there is no need for questioning evolutionism, creationism, pantheism, deism and many other cosmological hypotheses any longer...|$|R

40|$|Russia’s {{annexation}} of Crimea met with widespread condemnation among international lawyers. And {{it could not}} have been otherwise. Russian behavior in the Crimean crisis epitomizes the kind of power politics which is deadly to international law. As a consequence, international law scholarship has tended to look down on legal arguments employed by Russia and Crimean irredentists to support their case, including the one leveraging on self-determination. This is indeed regrettable because the majority of the Crimean population seemed to be in favor of annexation to Russia. Such an element (of course, controversial) should have prompted greater respect for the self-determination argument. On these assumptions, we intend to investigate whether the Crimean claim for self-determination has any basis in international law. However, since we believe that Russian coercive intervention inevitably distorted the legal framework of this crisis (by turning it into a “use of force” issue) and seriously undermined the international reputation of the Crimean cause, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> imagine an alternative scenario where such an intervention never took place. In other words, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> try to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> whether – in the absence of forcible outside interference – the will expressed by Crimean institutions and its people to (re) unite with Russia would have had some weight under international law. Mainstream scholarship answered in the negative, on the two-fold ground that the Crimean case a) did not fit with any of the legitimate hypotheses of self-determination codified by international practice, i. e. colonial/alien/racist domination; b) did not meet the conditions required by the “remedial secession” doctrine. This is because these authors look at the principle of self-determination as a “rule”, whose content has been crystallized through the combination of state practice and opinio juris. In our opinion, the main problem with this view lies in its failure to consider that the principle of self-determination is inherently indeterminate. Accordingly, in order to draw from it concrete precepts, a policy-oriented choice is always required. This inevitably raises a string of questions. Who takes part in such a decision-making process? How is the latter carried out? What substantive principles direct the choices of decision-maker(s) ? Our working hypothesis is that, in the quest for a solution to these queries, a valuable contribution may be offered by the policy-oriented jurisprudence of the New Haven School (NHS), whose focus on the dynamics of the law-making “process” is widely known. This would be beneficial in many respects. First, it would allow bringing to the limelight the role played by non-state entities (such as local institutions and insurgents movements) which, while not enjoying formal status of international subjects, have a non-negligible say in self-determination processes. Second, by questioning the “sanctity” of past trends, NHS frees the principle of self-determination from its glorious (but outdated) anti-colonialist past and paves the way for an overall rethinking of what constitutes a legitimate self-determination claim. Third, since it is strongly committed to normative values, NHS does not equate international law with the will of superpowers, but provides a critical framework through which the latter’s international behavior may be scrutinized...|$|R

Bonnie’s ploy, Founder’s Day, Stefan’s anger at Damon’s love for Elena, Elena’s parentage, whether or not John <b>will</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> that Anna is a vampire: {{so many of these}} conflicts center on knowledge that some people have and others don’t." ...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of quality control teams: offensive, defensive, and special teams. Offensive quality control will chart the upcoming teams' defense for various down and distance situations, field positions and how many times they use particular personnel groupings. Defensive quality control will do similar analysis of the offense. Special teams quality control <b>will</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what players are used in various special situations such as kickoff and punt.|$|R

If {{you look at}} cost over time, a very {{large portion of the}} unit cost of the EELVs is {{attributable}} to the propulsion systems, and the RL10 is a very old engine, and there's a lot of craftwork associated with its manufacture," [...] says Dale Thomas, associate director of technical issues at NASA Marshall.

5000|$|Your dwarves usually act in {{automatic}} planning mode, {{which means}} they <b>will</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> themselves how to get stuff done. This means you can both set goals (like [...] "dig here" [...] or [...] "make food") or you can order individual dwarves around. Your dwarves will get upset if they work too long and don't get enough fun out of their free time, so {{you will have to}} provide them with sane working hours and entertainment in their free time.|$|R
40|$|We {{start with}} the {{well-known}} game below: Two players hold {{a sheet of paper}} to their forehead on which a positive integer is written. The numbers are consecutive and each player can only see the number of the other one. In each time step, they either say nothing or tell what number they have. Both of them <b>will</b> eventually <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> their number after a certain amount of time. The game is rather cooperative than competitive, and employs the notions of common knowledge and mutual knowledge. We generalize this game to arbitrary (directed and non-directed) simple graphs and try to establish for which graphs one or both of them <b>will</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the solution, and how long they do need to find it. We give a complete answer for the case of two players, even if they are both allowed to discuss {{before the start of the}} game. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
