5|$|In the Jamia Hafsa complex, {{damage was}} extensive, with {{thousands}} of bullet holes in the courtyard. The basement was blackened from rockets. The main buildings of the complex were structurally intact, but the boundary walls had been breached in several places. The building had bullet marks in its cement structure. The two courtyards inside the school were filled with shattered glass and spent rounds. Piles of the girls' bed rolls and stacks of books <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> against walls.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 June, the crowd {{continued}} west along the Thames, burning the houses of officials around Westminster and opening the Westminster gaol. They then moved back into central London, setting fire to more buildings and storming Newgate Prison. The hunt for Flemings continued, and those with Flemish-sounding accents were killed, including the royal adviser, Richard Lyons. In one city ward, the bodies of 40 executed Flemings <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> up in the street, and at the Church of St Martin Vintry, popular with the Flemish, 35 of the community were killed. Historian Rodney Hilton argues that these attacks may have been coordinated by the weavers' guilds of London, who were commercial competitors of the Flemish weavers.|$|E

50|$|After all {{possible}} moves have <b>been</b> made, the <b>piles</b> <b>are</b> collected in reverse order. That <b>is,</b> <b>Pile</b> 12 <b>is</b> {{placed over the}} Pile 11, then both <b>are</b> placed over <b>Pile</b> 10, and so on until all <b>piles</b> <b>are</b> placed over <b>Pile</b> 1. Then, without reshuffling, they are redealt again, one by one, into twelve piles around the foundations. After the cards are dealt anew, the restrictions no longer apply, i.e. a card can be placed on any foundation. This goes for after the second redeal.|$|R

25|$|About {{half the}} {{population}} of Lebanon starved to death (200,000 killed out of 400,000 of the total populace) throughout the years of 1915–1918 during what {{is now known as}} the Great famine Mount of Lebanon., as a consequence of a mixed combination of crop failure, incompetent governance and food blockade by the allies during World War I. Dead bodies <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> in the streets and starving Lebanese civilians were reported to be eating street animals while some even resorted to cannibalism.|$|E
25|$|The {{prison was}} built by British {{contractors}} in the 1950s. The prison held as many as 15,000 inmates in 2001. In 2002, Saddam Hussein's government began an expansion project to add six new cellblocks to the prison. In October 2002, he gave amnesty to most prisoners in Iraq. After the prisoners were released and the prison was left empty, it was vandalized and looted. Almost all of the documents relating to prisoners <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> and burnt inside of prison offices and cells, leading to extensive structural damage.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{thousands}} of tonnes of foul-smelling refuse <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> up in Naples, Italy {{and its surrounding}} villages, defacing entire neighbourhoods. Authorities discovered that polychlorinated dibenzodioxins levels in buffalo milk used by 29 mozzarella makers exceeded permitted limits; after further investigation they impounded milk from 66 farms. Authorities suspected {{the source of the}} contamination was from waste illegally disposed of on land grazed by buffalo. Prosecutors in Naples placed 109 people under investigation on suspicion of fraud and food poisoning. Sales of Mozzarella cheese fell by 50% in Italy.|$|E

25|$|At 5:30am on 16 December, after a 30-minute cannon and rocket barrage, the 3rd {{platoon of}} Company A was {{attacked}} by a strong German force which had penetrated the infantry lines. This {{became one of the}} decisive actions of the Battle of the Bulge. The battalion's actions during this action resulted in it being recognized with a Presidential Unit Citation. The enemy was driven off by vigorous counterattacks by Company A, fighting as infantry, and the U.S. lines were restored. Many enemy dead <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> {{up in front of the}} lines and 21 POWs were taken.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1949, Ivinskaya was arrested at her {{apartment}} by the KGB. Ivinskaya relates in her memoirs that, when the agents burst into her apartment, she was at her typewriter working on translations of the Korean poet Won Tu-Son. Her apartment was ransacked and all items connected with Pasternak <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> up in her presence. Ivinskaya {{was taken to the}} Lubyanka Prison and repeatedly interrogated, where she refused to say anything incriminating about Pasternak. At the time, she was pregnant with Pasternak's child and had a miscarriage early in her ten-year sentence in the GULAG.|$|E
25|$|The killing {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night, with soldiers and policemen {{operating on a}} house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. The Chihuahua Building {{as well as the}} rest of the neighborhood had its electricity and phones cut off. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were first removed in ambulances and later military officials came and piled up bodies, not knowing if they were dead or alive, into the military trucks, while some say that the bodies <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> up on garbage trucks and sent to unknown destinations. The soldiers rounded up the students onto the Chihuahua Building's elevator walls, stripped them, and beat them up.|$|E

25|$|Numbers of the Portuguese force were rapidly reduced {{before the}} Sinhalese army charged {{up the hill}} and {{attacked}} them. Rajasinghe conducted his troops during the battle from under the shade of a tree. The Portuguese force was almost completely destroyed in the fight that ensued. Approximately 4,000 soldiers of the Portuguese force were killed. Only 33 Portuguese soldiers were left alive, along with a number of mercenaries. Rajasinghe and Wijayapala ordered their men not to kill the survivors after the battle was won. Heads of the killed soldiers <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> before the Sinhalese king. A search was made for Melo's body, but it was not found. However, some Sinhalese soldiers found Melo's sword, and presented it to Rajasinghe.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the {{appetite}} {{of the god}} was not appeased. He ever wished for more. In order to furnish him with a larger supply, the victims <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> up on his hands with a big chain above them which kept them in their place. Some devout persons had at the beginning wished to count them, to see whether their number corresponded with {{the days of the}} solar year; but others were brought, and it was impossible to distinguish them in the giddy motion of the horrible arms. This lasted for a long, indefinite time until the evening. Then the partitions inside assumed a darker glow, and burning flesh could be seen. Some even believed that they could descry hair, limbs, and whole bodies.|$|E
25|$|All mountain-building strata {{consists}} of sedimentary rocks of the Mesozoic era, that were originally laid {{down on the}} seabed. The base of the mountain comprises muschelkalk beds; its upper layers are made of Wetterstein limestone. With steep rock walls up to 800metres high, it is this Wetterstein limestone from the Upper Triassic that is mainly responsible for the rock faces, arêtes, pinnacles and the summit rocks of the mountain. Due to the frequent occurrence of marine coralline algae in the Wetterstein limestone it can be deduced that this rock was at one time formed in a lagoon. The colour of the rock varies between grey-white and light grey to speckled. In several places it contains lead and zinc ore. These minerals were mined between 1827 and 1918 in the Höllental valley. The dark grey, almost horizontal and partly grass-covered layers of muschelkalk run from {{the foot of the}} Great Riffelwandspitze to the Ehrwalder Köpfe. From the appearance of the north face of the Zugspitze {{it can be seen that}} this massif originally consisted of two mountain ranges that <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> on top of one another.|$|E

25|$|Fishing was {{the most}} {{important}} industry from the 14th century until the mid-19th. Salt water fishing began before 1320, when too fine nets were seized by City authorities, but expanded greatly from the 16th century. Fisher Street was named after the fishing community there. From about 1775 welled and dry smacks were used, mostly as cod boats, and rigged as gaff cutters. Fishermen sailed as far as Iceland in the summer. They served Billingsgate Fish Market in the City of London, and moored in Barking Pool. Scymgeour Hewett, born on 7 December 1797, founded the Short Blue Fleet (England's biggest fishing fleet) based in Barking, and using smacks out of Barking and east coast ports. Around 1870 this fleet changed to gaff ketches that stayed out at sea for months, using ice for preservation of fish produced by flooding local fields in winter. Fleeting involved fish being ferried from fishing smacks to gaff cutters by little wooden ferry-boats. The rowers had to stand as the boats <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> high with fish boxes. Rowers refused to wear their bulky cork lifejackets because it slowed down their rowing. At first the fast 50-foot gaff cutters with great booms projecting beyond the sterns raced the fish to port to get the best prices.|$|E
500|$|The sod strips <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> grass-side down, {{staggered}} in {{the same}} way as brickwork, in three side-by-side rows, resulting in a wall over [...] thick. The sod wall was built around door and window frames, and the corners of the wall were secured by rods driven vertically through them. The roof was made with poles or brush, covered with prairie grass, and then sealed with a layer of sod.|$|E
500|$|During {{a second}} attack made around 11:00am, Milosevich fired the [...]50 caliber jeep-mounted machine gun until enemy fire drove {{him back into}} his foxhole. In both {{the first and second}} attack that morning no German soldier got past the fence {{in the middle of the}} field. Bodies <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> around it. German medics waved a white flag late in the morning and {{indicated}} they wanted to remove the wounded, which the American defenders allowed. The Americans again suffered only one wounded on the second attack, when Pvt. Kalil was struck in the face by a rifle grenade that failed to explode.|$|E

500|$|They {{were created}} by taking the shire, or other {{governmental}} districts, accounts and writing them on two strips of parchment, usually about [...] wide. The two pieces were then attached end to end to form one long sheet. Then, the various sheets from all the shires <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> together and affixed together at the top, and the resulting document would be rolled into a tight roll resembling a pipe. They were not formed into one long continuous roll, as the Patent Rolls were, however. The sheets for each county have a heading at the top giving {{the name of the}} county the account is for, in Latin. If more than one sheet was required for a county, the county name would be amended on secondary sheets to indicate the order the sheets were in.|$|E
500|$|In South Bay, {{nearly all}} houses were {{destroyed}} and several buildings were unroofed. The structures not suffering any damage floated away. Many boats and barged in the canal were [...] "resting at all angles.", {{some of which}} were sunk or disabled, while many homes were washed to the banks of the canal. The streets were littered were broken lumber. Debris such as the remains of custard apple trees, twisted metal roofing, and wood <b>were</b> <b>piled</b> against the bridges. At least 160fatalities occurred in the city, while the American Red Cross indicated 247deaths. Throughout the 1920s, Okeelanta suffered several floods and muck fires. Finally, the town was flooded severely during the storm and was subsequently abandoned. Bean City was also destroyed during the hurricane, but it was eventually rebuilt by Arthur Wells.|$|E
500|$|Adding to Sinclair's problems, {{production}} of the C5 had to be halted for three weeks after numerous customers reported that the plastic moulding attached to the gearbox was impairing {{the performance of their}} vehicles. 100 Hoover workers were shifted from the C5 production line to work on replacing the faulty mouldings on returned vehicles. Barrie Wills admitted that Sinclair was also taking the opportunity to [...] "adjust stocks" [...] {{in the light of the}} C5's poor sales. When production resumed a month later it was at only 10% of the previous level, with 90 of the workers being transferred back to the washing machine production lines. Only 100 C5s were now being produced a week, down from the original 1,000.
