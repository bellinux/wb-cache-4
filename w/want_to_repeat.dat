5|$|Frakes {{believes}} that the main themes of First Contact—and Star Trek as a whole—are loyalty, friendship, honesty and mutual respect. This {{is evident in the}} film when Picard chooses to rescue Data rather than evacuate the ship {{with the rest of the}} crew. The film makes a direct comparison between Picard's hatred of the Borg and refusal to destroy the Enterprise and that of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick. The moment marks a turning point in the film as Picard changes his mind, symbolized by his putting down his gun. A similar Moby-Dick reference was made in , and although Braga and Moore did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> it, they decided it worked so well they could not leave it out.|$|E
5|$|In , a new {{collectible}} item {{known as}} mini medals, resembling small gold coins with a five-pointed {{star in the}} middle, was introduced; {{they have nothing to}} do with winning the game, but they can be traded with a certain character for items. Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers. Horii introduced them as he wanted to have something players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games, but did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> the necessity for players having to collect a certain number of them before they could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Mrs. Jill Winkler Rath, {{widow of}} {{publicist}} Otto Winkler, filed a $100,000 {{lawsuit against the}} $2,000,000 estate of Clark Gable in connection with Winkler's death in the plane crash with Carole Lombard. The suit was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Mrs. Rath, in her action, claimed Gable promised to provide financial aid for her if she would not bring suit against the airline involved. Mrs. Rath stated she later learned that Gable settled his claim against the airline for $10. He did so {{because he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> his grief in court and subsequently provided her no financial aid in his will.|$|E

500|$|The band {{decided to}} forgo working with Butch Vig, who had {{produced}} the group's previous albums, and selected Flood and Alan Moulder as co-producers. Corgan explained, [...] "To be completely honest, I {{think it was}} a situation where we'd become so close to Butch that it started to work to our disadvantage... I just felt we had to force the situation, sonically, and take ourselves out of normal Pumpkin recording mode. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> past Pumpkin work." ...|$|E
500|$|As of 2017, Battletoads Arcade {{remains the}} last Battletoads game released. Rare had begun {{planning}} on a possible sequel in the mid-2000s but ultimately decided {{that there was}} no original direction for the game apart from its past. They did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> the failed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reboot. Battletoads Arcade served as an inspiration for the cooperative play mode in the 2011 [...] Kotaku included Battletoads Arcade in its list of 16-bit era beat 'em ups with the best graphics.|$|E
50|$|The {{next day}} was the giant slalom event with Anna Kulíšková. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> her silver medal success from the super G event. She was too slow and {{cautious}} {{in the first round}} and ending up finishing just short of medal standing in 4th place.|$|R

500|$|Madonna {{insisted that}} the video should be edited in Los Angeles, since during the [...] "Frozen" [...] video she {{had a number of}} back and forth with {{director}} Chris Cunningham (who was in London editing), a process she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat.</b> This meant that Åkerlund and his team had to live in the United States for the whole duration. They lived in a hotel, ate take-away Chinese food and finished the clip. All the footage ended up in the actual video, since every scene was sped up and the song was long.|$|E
500|$|When {{the news}} of Rowe's {{pregnancy}} broke to Jackson's mother Katherine, the Jackson family matriarch urged her son to wed {{the mother of his}} unborn child. Katherine did not want her son to be like his father, who had produced an illegitimate child with a woman while married to Michael's mother. Katherine first spoke on the telephone to Rowe about the sanctity of marriage and about the Jehovah's Witness faith. She later spoke to Jackson, telling him to marry [...] "that nice girl, Debbie" [...] and [...] "give your child a name, not like your poor, half-sister, Joh'Vonnie". The words resonated with the musician, who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> his father's sins.|$|E
500|$|Fincher had {{previously}} worked with director of photography Harris Savides on Seven (he shot the opening credits) and The Game. Savides loved the script but realized, [...] "there {{was so much}} exposition, just people {{talking on the phone}} or having conversations. It was difficult to imagine how it could be done in a visual way." [...] Fincher and Savides did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> the look of Seven. The director's approach to Zodiac was to create a look mundane enough that audiences would accept that what they were watching was the truth. The filmmakers also did not want to glamorize the killer or tell the story through his eyes. [...] "That would have turned the story into a first-person-shooter video game. We didn't want to make the sort of movie that serial killers would want to own," [...] Fincher said.|$|E

500|$|Mitchell {{maintains}} {{a level of}} decorum around General Landry (Beau Bridges), but is more laid-back around the SG-1 members. Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) and Browder did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> the [...] "cliché" [...] original O'Neill-Daniel dynamic where views on military and diplomacy clash. The actors tried to find some commonality between the characters while trying to develop an entertaining rapport between them. By mid-season 9, their interaction had become playful, without being decidedly positive or antagonistic. Although Mitchell and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) are both warriors and leaders, Teal'c is taken aback by Mitchell's enthusiasm at first, as he is more used to O'Neill's reserved attitude. Teal'c is unsure if he likes Mitchell, but Mitchell forces Teal'c to interact with him. By not letting Teal'c step back and observe, Mitchell makes Teal'c an active part of the scene.|$|E
500|$|The {{creator of}} Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry, decided {{early on that}} he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> the adversaries from [...] in [...] To this extent, the [...] "bible" [...] {{produced}} {{before the start of the}} show stated categorically [...] "No stories about warfare with Klingons or Romulans". The Ferengi were designed by Roddenberry and Herbert Wright to fill this gap. They were mentioned in the episodes running up to [...] "The Last Outpost", which marked their first appearance on screen. After they re-appeared later in the first series in [...] "", the producers thought that they didn't make a suitable adversary and plans for their continued use in this role were dropped. Their role as major villains in The Next Generation was eventually taken by the Borg. By the time that they appeared in Deep Space Nine, they were used in a comedic fashion. The look of the Ferengi and their ship was created by Andrew Probert. The vessel was inspired by a Horseshoe crab and was built by Greg Jein.|$|E
500|$|After the Spanish film {{development}} lab {{discovered that}} telephone lines, helicopters and cars were {{visible in the}} footage, they tried to incinerate it, telling Bakshi's first assistant director, [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." [...] When Bakshi returned to the United States, {{he learned that the}} cost of developing blown-up prints of each frame had risen. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> the process that had been used on Wizards, which was unsuitable for the level of detail he intended for The Lord of the Rings, so Bakshi and camera technician Ted Bemiller created their own photographic enlarger to process the footage cheaply. Live-action special effects and analog optics were used in place of animation to keep the visual effects budget low and give the film a more realistic look. Among the voice actors was the well-regarded John Hurt, who performed the role of Aragorn. The project's high-profile brought heavy trade journal coverage, and fans such as Mick Jagger visited the studio for the chance to play a role. Animator Carl Bell loved drawing Aragorn so much that Bakshi gave Bell the live-action costume, which he wore while animating.|$|E
2500|$|... : Minister of Foreign Affairs Ivica Dačić, in an {{interview}} with Deutsche Welle, stated that Catalonia <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> the example of Kosovo, by declaring unilateral independence without any agreement from Madrid.

500|$|In March 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Disney had greenlit the third film with Hedlund reprising his role as Sam and Kosinski returning to direct the sequel. Wilde {{was revealed}} in April to be returning as Quorra. Filming was expected to start in Vancouver in October 2015. However, in May 2015, The Hollywood Reporter stated that Walt Disney Studios had chosen not to continue with a third installment, which was confirmed by Wilde the following month. In the end of July, Boxleitner stated he frequently heard about the pre-production of Tron 3 while shooting Cedar Cove in Vancouver, and was disappointed to hear about the cancellation. While expressing the opinion that Disney decided to [...] "play it safe" [...] and explore other properties, Boxleitner said that this broke his interest in continuing with the franchise, as [...] "it's been too up and down for me. I would rather not just keep going. I don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> my career anymore." [...] In September 2015, Hedlund stated that he was told that the third Tron film was not [...] "totally dead", but jokingly suggested that it could be released 30 years later, referencing the near 30-year gap between the first film and Legacy.|$|E
500|$|Like her 2000 studio album, Music, Madonna {{enlisted the}} help of French DJ and {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Always interested in adapting herself and her music to the contemporary compositions, Madonna was inspired by the new Massive Attack and Lemon Jelly albums. [...] "We set out to put the two worlds of acoustic and electronic music together," [...] said Madonna. [...] "It is another step on, but I've never wanted to repeat myself. I don't ever <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> myself or make the same record twice." [...] American Life became Madonna's final studio album with Maverick Records, and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label. In an interview with VH1 titled Madonna Speaks, the singer discussed her 20 years in the music industry, and revealed her motivations behind American Life, about [...] "material things" [...] being unimportant. [...] "I have lots of 'material' things and I've had lots of beliefs about things and what's important, and I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that {{a lot of things that}} I'd valued weren't important", she concluded. Discussing her thoughts on the conception of the album, she told Q magazine that through her 20 years of being in the entertainment industry, she would have a correct opinion on fame and fortune and its perils, which would be the base of the album.|$|E
500|$|As no {{studio was}} big enough for the {{interior}} of Stromberg's supertanker, and set designer Ken Adam did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> {{what he had done}} with SPECTRE's volcano base in You Only Live Twice— [...] "a workable but ultimately wasteful set"— construction began in March 1976 of a new sound stage at Pinewood, the 007 Stage, at a cost of $1.8 million. To complement this stage, Eon also paid for building a water tank capable of storing approximately 1,200,000 gallons (5,500,000 litres). The soundstage was so huge that cinematographer Claude Renoir found himself unable to effectively light it due to his deteriorating eyesight, and so Stanley Kubrick visited the production, in secret, to advise on how to light the stage. For the exterior, while Shell was willing to lend an abandoned tanker to the production, the elevated insurance and safety risks caused it to be replaced with miniatures built by Derek Meddings' team and shot in the Bahamas. Stromberg's shark tank was also filmed in the Bahamas, using a live shark in a saltwater swimming pool. Adam decided to do experiments with curved shapes for the scenery, as he felt all his previous setpieces were [...] "too linear". This was demonstrated with the Atlantis, which is a dome and curved surfaces outside, and many curved objects in Stromberg's office inside. For Gogol's offices, Adam wanted an open space to contrast M's enclosed headquarters, and drew inspiration from Sergei Eisenstein to do a [...] "Russian crypt-like" [...] set.|$|E
5000|$|Not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> the {{mistakes}} of the 21st, General William Jenkins Worth listened to his Texan advisers. These men had fought in Mexican cities before at the Battle of Mier in 1842 and the Battle of Bexar in 1835. They understood that the army needed to [...] "mouse hole" [...] through each house and root out the defenders in close combat.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, the {{consulting}} firm EcoRisk, Inc. paid Hayes to join {{a panel of experts}} conducting studies for Novartis (later Syngenta) on the herbicide atrazine.

He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> his work <b>to</b> validate it but Novartis refused funding for further research; he resigned from the panel and obtained other funding <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> the experiments.|$|R

500|$|During the 2008 primaries, Gore {{remained}} neutral {{toward all}} of the candidates which led to speculation that he {{would come out of}} a brokered 2008 Democratic National Convention as a [...] "compromise candidate" [...] if the party decided it could not nominate one. Gore responded by stating that these events would not take place because a candidate would be nominated through the primary process. Senator Ted Kennedy had urged Gore to endorse Senator Barack Obama though Gore declined. When Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president on June 3, 2008, speculation began that Gore might be tapped for the vice presidency. On June 16, 2008, one week after Hillary Clinton had suspended her campaign, Gore endorsed Obama in a speech given in Detroit, Michigan which renewed speculation of an Obama-Gore ticket. Gore stated, however, that he was not interested in being Vice President again. On the timing and nature of Gore's endorsement, some argued that Gore waited because he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> his calamitous early endorsement of Howard Dean during the 2004 Presidential Election. On the final night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, shortly before Obama delivered his acceptance address, Gore gave a speech offering his full support. Such support led to new speculation after Obama was elected President during the 2008 Presidential election that Gore would be named a member of the Obama administration. This speculation was enhanced by a meeting held between Obama, Gore, and Joe Biden in Chicago on December 9, 2008. However, Democratic officials and Gore's spokeswoman stated that during the meeting the only subject under discussion was the climate crisis, and Gore would not be joining the Obama administration. On December 19, 2008, Gore described Obama's environmental administrative choices of Carol Browner, Steven Chu, and Lisa Jackson as [...] "an exceptional team to lead the fight against the climate crisis." ...|$|E
