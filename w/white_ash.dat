5|$|Emerald ash borer {{primarily}} infest and {{can cause}} significant damage to ash species including green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), <b>white</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus americana), and blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) in North America. In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main ash species colonized by EAB. Ash susceptibility can vary due to the attractiveness of chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but {{it is unclear whether}} the trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.|$|E
5|$|Flora {{along the}} {{northern}} end of the trail includes sumac (Rhus) and honeysuckle (Lonicera) shrubs, American elm (Ulmus americana), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south, there are occurrences of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black birch (Betula lenta). Other trees common on the trail include red maple (Acer rubrum), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), <b>white</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus americana) and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).|$|E
5|$|Ohio is a lead {{producer}} of horticulture products, from greenhouse and nursery plants to bulbs. The {{state is a}} {{producer of}} <b>white</b> <b>ash</b> trees for landscaping, totalling 25,000 annually. California, Florida, Texas, Michigan, and Ohio accounted for 42% of the nation's production of bedding plants in 2002. Oberer's Flowers, headquartered in Dayton, is the nation's fifth-largest florist, while Aris Horticulture, headquartered in Barberton, is a world leader in research and breeding. Lake County Nursery offers over 1,000 varieties of plants and California-based Monrovia Nursery Company, a global leader, operates nurseries in Springfield.|$|E

5|$|The Shickshinny Mountain Slopes, {{which are}} listed as a Locally Significant Area in the Luzerne County Natural Areas Inventory, {{are located in the}} {{watershed}} of Hunlock Creek in Plymouth Township. These slopes are on the northern side of Shickshinny Mountain and contain second-growth northern hardwood forests and some rock outcroppings with small seeps. The area contains a large number of wildflower species and some rare plants. The main tree species in this area include American basswood, sugar maple, <b>white</b> <b>ash,</b> white oak, black cherry, and eastern hemlock.|$|E
5|$|Pholiota squarrosa {{is thought}} to be a white rot fungus, which use {{cellulose}} as a carbon source, and have the ability to degrade the lignin (present in wood) to carbon dioxide to access the cellulose molecule. The fungus can attack a wide variety of deciduous host trees, including sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, paper birch, American beech, and <b>white</b> <b>ash.</b> It can also attack conifers, like spruce. The fungus is a secondary parasite, in that it attacks trees that have already been weakened from prior injury or infection by bacteria or other fungi. It also functions as a saprobe, and can obtain nutrients by breaking down organic matter in dead wood.|$|E
5|$|There {{are about}} 30 ponds in the park. Some– {{including}} Barn Wood Pond, Bishop's Pond, Gallows Pond, Leg of Mutton Pond, Martin's Pond and <b>White</b> <b>Ash</b> Pond– {{have been created}} to drain the land or to provide water for livestock. The Pen Ponds (which in the past were used to rear carp for food) date from 1746. They were formed when a trench was dug in the early 17th century to drain a boggy area; later in that century this was widened and deepened by the extraction of gravel for local building. The Ponds now take in water from streams flowing from the higher ground around them and release it to Beverley Brook. Beverley Brook and the two Pen Ponds are most visible areas {{of water in the}} park.|$|E

5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the <b>white</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E
25|$|While {{the refuge}} is {{protected}} {{primarily for the}} bird life, several rare or uncommon plant species have also {{been found in the}} grasslands, where Kentucky bluegrass is the dominant species Frank's sedge, small-flowered agrimony, purple milkweed, small white aster, Bush's sedge, coontail and watermeal. A few tree species, such as <b>white</b> <b>ash,</b> American elm, eastern red cedar, and pin oak, also flourish in those sections. The woodlands on the periphery are dominated by several oak species, red maple, sugar maple, shagbark hickory and tulip trees.|$|E
25|$|There are {{at least}} 29 tree species that Indiana bats use during the summer. The {{greatest}} number of tree species {{are found in the}} central portion of Indiana bats' range (primarily Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, and Kentucky), but this is likely because the majority of research conducted on the species has occurred in this region. Roost trees from these central states, which are mainly in the oak-hickory cover type, include silver maple, red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (A. saccharum), white oak (Q. alba), red oak (Q. rubra), pin oak (Q. palustris), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), post oak (Q. stellata), shingle oak (Q. imbricaria), eastern cottonwood, shagbark hickory, bitternut hickory, mockernut hickory (C. alba), pignut hickory (C. glabra), American elm, slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), <b>white</b> <b>ash</b> (F. americana), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and sassafras (Sassafras albidum).|$|E

500|$|Green ash {{and black}} ash trees are {{preferred}} by emerald ash borer. <b>White</b> <b>ash</b> is also killed rapidly, but usually only after all green and black ash trees are eliminated. Blue ash displays some {{resistance to the}} emerald ash borer by forming callus tissue around emerald ash borer galleries, but is eventually killed. Many of the specialized predators and parasitoids that suppressed emerald ash borer in Asia were not present in North America. Predators and parasitoids native to North America do not sufficiently suppress emerald ash borer, so populations continue to grow. Emerald ash borer populations can spread between [...] a year. It primarily spreads through flight or by transportation of ash bark containing products such as firewood or nursery stock, which allows it to reach new areas and create satellite populations outside of the main infestation.|$|E
500|$|Worlds End State Park is near Forksville on Pennsylvania Route 154 in the narrow, {{serpentine}} {{valley of}} Loyalsock Creek. It is nearly surrounded by Loyalsock State Forest, which was known here as Wyoming State Forest until July 1, 2005. Common trees {{found in the}} state park and forest include black cherry, eastern hemlock, red maple, tulip poplar, yellow birch, and <b>white</b> <b>ash.</b> The northern hardwood and hemlock forests are threatened in general by deer overgrazing, while the woolly adelgid, an invasive hemiptera, threatens the hemlock populations. In 2010 Worlds End was part of over [...] of state forests and parks combating the woolly adelgid with a $110,000 federal grant to the DCNR's [...] "Forest Pest Management Division for insecticide treatment of high-value Eastern hemlocks". Several different interpretive and educational programs on environmental and ecological topics are offered at the park each summer.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} {{tree in the}} park is the yellowwood (Cladrastis lutea). [...] This tree typically does not grow further north than central Kentucky, and has been designated as a state threatened species in Indiana. [...] Other trees found in the park include at least four types of oak (black, chestnut, red, and white) and three types of hickory (bitternut, pignut, and shagbark). [...] The park also contains at least two types of maple trees: [...] black and sugar. Patches of paw paw trees can be found throughout the park, and these trees produce an edible fruit. In areas with good moist soil, the black walnut tree grows, and this tree is {{an excellent source of}} wood for lumber or furniture. [...] Among other trees growing in the park are the American beech, basswood, black cherry, black gum, and red elm. [...] Also the sassafras, sycamore, <b>white</b> <b>ash.</b> [...] The park also contains at least eight kinds of ferns and 20 types of wildflowers, including bloodroot and wild geranium.|$|E

2500|$|The tract {{is almost}} {{completely}} wooded. DEC identifies five distinct forest communities within the Slide Wilderness: three subtypes of the boreal forest found at higher elevations in the Catskills ("mountain fir", [...] "mountain spruce-fir" [...] and [...] "spruce-fir rocky summit"), hemlock-northern hardwood forest and beech-maple mesic forest northern hardwoods, such as sugar maple, beech and yellow birch, {{are the most}} predominant, with associate species such as black cherry, <b>white</b> <b>ash,</b> red maple, basswood, big-tooth aspen and red oak {{can be found at}} some locations.

2500|$|A {{wide range}} of soil {{fertility}} exists as evidenced by soil orders-Alfisols and Mollisols which are medium to high in base saturation to Ultisols which are low in base saturation (24). Pignut hickory responds to increases in soil nitrogen similarly to American beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica) (15). These species are rated as intermediate in nitrogen deficiency tolerance and consequently are able to grow {{with lower levels of}} nitrogen than are required by [...] "nitrogen- demanding" [...] <b>white</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus americana), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and American basswood (Tilia americana).
