5|$|In 1942 Oppenheimer {{attempted}} to recruit Rabi and Robert Bacher {{to work at}} the Los Alamos Laboratory on a new secret project. They convinced Oppenheimer that his plan for a military laboratory would not work, since a scientific effort would need to be a civilian affair. The plan was modified, and the new laboratory would be a civilian one, run by the University of California under contract from the War Department. In the end, Rabi still did not go west, but did agree to serve as a consultant to the Manhattan Project. Rabi attended the Trinity test in July 1945. The scientists working on Trinity set up a betting pool on the yield of the test, with predictions ranging from total dud to 45 kilotons of TNT equivalent (kt). Rabi arrived late and found the only entry left was for 18 kilotons, which he purchased. Wearing <b>welding</b> <b>goggles,</b> he waited for the result with Ramsey and Enrico Fermi. The blast was rated at 18.6 kilotons, and Rabi won the pool.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{protection}} such as <b>welding</b> <b>goggles</b> {{should be}} worn at all times, including {{to protect the}} eyes against glare and flying sparks. Special safety eyewear must be used—both to protect the welder {{and to provide a}} clear view through the yellow-orange flare given off by the incandescing flux. In the 1940s cobalt melters’ glasses were borrowed from steel foundries and were still available until the 1980s. However, the lack of protection from impact, ultra-violet, infrared and blue light caused severe eyestrain and eye damage. Didymium eyewear, developed for glassblowers in the 1960s, was also borrowed—until many complained of eye problems from excessive infrared, blue light, and insufficient shading. Today very good eye protection can be found designed especially for gas-welding aluminum that cuts the sodium orange flare completely and provides the necessary protection from ultraviolet, infrared, blue light and impact, according to ANSI Z87-1989 safety standards for a Special Purpose Lens.|$|E
500|$|Bainbridge asked Groves to {{keep his}} VIP list down to just ten. He chose himself, Oppenheimer, Richard Tolman, Vannevar Bush, James Conant, Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, Charles Lauritsen, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Sir Geoffrey Taylor and Sir James Chadwick. The VIPs viewed the test from Compania Hill, about [...] {{northwest}} of the tower. The observers set up a betting pool {{on the results of}} the test. Edward Teller was the most optimistic, predicting [...] He wore gloves to protect his hands, and sunglasses underneath the <b>welding</b> <b>goggles</b> that the government had supplied everyone with. Teller {{was also one of the}} few scientists to actually watch the test (with eye protection), instead of following orders to lie on the ground with his back turned. He also brought suntan lotion, which he shared with the others.|$|E
5000|$|Ölfuß ("Grease Foot") {{is another}} member of MC Klappstuhl. Being the series' Gyro Gearloose of vehicle modifications, engineering, and repairing, he wears a red overall and is usually seen with <b>welding</b> equipment, welder's <b>goggles,</b> and a wrench. Ölfuß is based upon a real-life {{acquaintance}} of Brösel and Andi with the same nickname, but also on real-life Andi's passion for weird metal engineering, a feature which Andi's comic persona lacks. Ölfuß, both in real life and in the comics, is also the mastermind behind the Red Porsche Killer, a drag-bike with 4 Horex-engines, and the Dolmette, with 24 Dolmar Chainsaw-engines.|$|R
2500|$|Exposure to the {{brightness}} of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. <b>Welding</b> <b>goggles</b> and helmets with dark face plates—much darker than those in sunglasses or oxy-fuel goggles—are worn to prevent this exposure. In recent years, new helmet models have been produced featuring a face plate which automatically self-darkens electronically. To protect bystanders, transparent welding curtains often surround the welding area. [...] These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, drummer Bam {{returned}} to Dogs D'Amour {{and was replaced}} by Stidi (Andrew Stidolph). To follow up their first two EPs, the Wildhearts recorded demos for their first full-length album, which were released as Earth vs the Wildhearts without re-recording. The singles [...] "Greetings From Shitsville" [...] and [...] "TV Tan" [...] were underground hits in 1993. Stidi left the band shortly afterwards to be replaced by Ritch Battersby, {{just in time for the}} recording of the single [...] "Caffeine Bomb", a UK chart hit at the beginning of 1994, helped by a memorable video in which Ginger appeared to vomit into CJ's face. The band appeared on Top of the Pops with Ginger wearing green <b>welding</b> <b>goggles.</b> The debut album was reissued in late 1994 with [...] "Caffeine Bomb" [...] tacked on as an extra track.|$|E
50|$|Although {{spot welding}} does not {{generate}} UV light as intensely as arc welding, eye protection is nevertheless required. <b>Welding</b> <b>goggles</b> with a 5.0 shade are recommended.|$|E
5000|$|Goggles {{provide better}} {{protection}} than safety glasses, and {{are effective in}} preventing eye injury from chemical splashes, impact, dusty environments and <b>welding.</b> <b>Goggles</b> with high air flow {{should be used to}} prevent fogging.|$|E
50|$|Welding glass {{protects against}} glare and flying sparks. It {{is a more}} extreme {{implementation}} of the same idea as sunglasses, suited to the more intense light generated during welding. Arc <b>welding</b> <b>goggles</b> must be much darker than blowtorch goggles.|$|E
50|$|UV Light - The {{ultraviolet}} light emitted {{from the high}} voltage electrical arc can be harmful to ones eyes. It is recommended that the arc be viewed through the appropriate <b>welding</b> <b>goggles</b> {{or at the very}} least a high quality pair of sunglasses.|$|E
50|$|Praseodymium(III) oxide {{can be used}} as a {{dielectric}} {{in combination}} with silicon. Praseodymium-doped glass, called didymium glass, turns yellow and is used in <b>welding</b> <b>goggles</b> because it blocks infrared radiation. Praseodymium(III) oxide is also used to color glass and ceramics yellow.For coloring ceramics, also the very dark brown mixed-valence compound praseodymium(III,IV) oxide, Pr6O11, is used.|$|E
50|$|Fritz and Curtin {{performed}} the experiment at the Eighth International Violin Competition of Indianapolis (IVCI), selecting participants for the experiment from the competitors and judges. They held the experiment in a dim room, with participants wearing <b>welding</b> <b>goggles</b> {{so they could}} not identify the instruments. Additionally, perfume placed on the violin chin rests prevented identification by smell.|$|E
50|$|<b>Welding</b> <b>goggles</b> {{provide a}} degree of eye {{protection}} while some forms of welding and cutting are being done. They are intended to protect the eyes {{not only from the}} heat and optical radiation produced by the welding, such as the intense ultraviolet light produced by an electric arc, but also from sparks or debris. A full facemask may be required for arc welding.|$|E
5000|$|According to Riddick, {{while in}} Butcher Bay he {{received}} eye surgery (a [...] "surgical shine job", {{as he calls}} it) from a doctor who gave him permanent night vision in exchange for [...] "20 menthol KOOLs". The surgery made his eyes more sensitive to normal light, requiring him to wear <b>welding</b> <b>goggles</b> to protect them (although {{he has also been}} shown without the goggles in a regularly illuminated room).|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the images}} used in Fata Morgana would appear in Herzog's later work: the vehicle aimlessly turning circles recurs in Even Dwarfs Started Small (1970) and Stroszek (1977); the {{decaying}} animal carcases reappear in Cobra Verde (1987); the <b>welding</b> <b>goggles</b> and worn by the two blind inmates in Even Dwarfs Started Small; {{and the image of}} the temple in the desert is used in Kaspar's dream of the Caucasus in The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser. Herzog himself described the film as [...] "an hallucination".|$|E
50|$|Neodymium(III) oxide {{is used to}} dope glass, {{including}} sunglasses, to make solid-state lasers, and {{to color}} glasses and enamels. Neodymium-doped glass turns purple due to the absorbance of yellow and green light, and is used in <b>welding</b> <b>goggles.</b> Some neodymium-doped glass is dichroic; that is, it changes color depending on the lighting. One kind of glass named for the mineral alexandrite appears blue in sunlight and red in artificial light.About 7000 tonnes of neodymium(III) oxide are produced worldwide each year. Neodymium(III) oxide is also used as a polymerization catalyst.|$|E
50|$|The injury may be {{prevented}} by wearing eye protection that blocks {{most of the}} ultraviolet radiation, such as <b>welding</b> <b>goggles</b> with the proper filters, a welder's helmet, sunglasses rated for sufficient UV protection, or appropriate snow goggles. The condition is usually managed by removal from the source of ultraviolet radiation, covering the corneas, and administration of pain relief. Photokeratitis is known {{by a number of}} different terms including: snow blindness, arc eye, welder's flash, bake eyes, corneal flash burns, sand man's eye, flash burns, niphablepsia, potato eye, or keratoconjunctivitis photoelectrica.|$|E
5000|$|Riddick is a Human/Furyan hybrid, {{a member}} of a warrior race obliterated by a {{military}} campaign that left Furya desolate, {{and is one of the}} last of his kind. One of his most defining features are his eyes, a characteristic inherent in a certain caste of his species (the Alpha-Furyans), although he implies in Pitch Black that they were [...] "shined" [...] by a back-alley surgical operation. This allows him to see clearly in the dark, but also makes him vulnerable to strong light; he wears tinted <b>welding</b> <b>goggles</b> for protection.|$|E

These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E
50|$|The {{optical filter}} in <b>welding</b> <b>goggles,</b> face mask or helmet {{must be a}} type which is {{suitable}} {{for the sort of}} work being done. A filter suitable for gas welding, for instance, should not be used for arc welding. Face masks which are self dimming are available for arc welding, MIG, TIG, and plasma cutting, and allow better vision before the arc is struck and after it is extinguished. Failure to use such protection when arc welding or even being near where arc welding is going on can result in a painful condition called “arc eye” or photokeratitis, which is akin to a severe sunburn of the cornea and conjunctiva of the eye.|$|E
50|$|Welding {{and cutting}} processes, {{including}} arc welding and cutting, {{as well as}} brazing produce intense ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR) and visible light wavelengths. The UV and IR wavelengths cannot be seen and can produce eye injury without the victim realizing it immediately. Extremely dark filters of the proper sort are needed for the welder {{to be able to}} look at the intensely glowing metal being welded. An approved face shield or welding helmet can also have filters for optical radiation protection, and offer additional protection against debris and sparks. UV blocking protective spectacles with side shields or <b>welding</b> <b>goggles</b> are considered primary protection, with the face shield or welding helmet considered secondary protection. This way, the eyes are still protected even when the face shield or helmet is lifted up.|$|E

50|$|Any intense {{exposure}} to UV light {{can lead to}} photokeratitis. Common causes include welders who have failed to use adequate eye protection such as an appropriate welding helmet or <b>welding</b> <b>goggles.</b> This is termed arc eye, while photokeratitis caused by {{exposure to}} sunlight reflected from ice and snow, particularly at elevation, is commonly called snow blindness. It can also occur due to using tanning beds without proper eyewear. Natural sources include bright sunlight reflected from snow or ice or, less commonly, from sea or sand. Fresh snow reflects about 80% of the UV radiation compared to a dry, sandy beach (15%) or sea foam (25%). This is especially a problem in polar regions and at high altitudes, as with every thousand feet (approximately 305 meters) of elevation (above sea level), the intensity of UV rays increases by four percent.|$|E

5000|$|Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel), more {{commonly}} known as Riddick, is the protagonist of the series. He is {{shown to be a}} highly skilled predator, extremely mobile and stealthy, has a vast knowledge of how to kill almost any humanoid in a variety of ways, is an extreme survivalist, and is notoriously hard to contain. He is also self-admittedly a dangerous convict and murderer, yet despite this, he is sometimes shown to perform moral or even atypically heroic actions, usually against his own better judgment and survivalist nature. Riddick is a Furyan, a member of a warrior race obliterated by a military campaign that left Furya desolate, {{and is one of the}} last of his kind. One of his most defining features are his eyes, a characteristic inherent in a certain caste of his species (The Alpha-Furyans), although he implies in Pitch Black that they were [...] "shined" [...] by a back-alley surgical operation. This allows him to see in the dark with no difficulty at all, but also renders his eyes incredibly sensitive to concentrated light, therefore he wears tinted <b>welding</b> <b>goggles</b> for protection. Riddick was once a mercenary, then part of a security force, and later on a soldier. He is also an experienced pilot.|$|E
