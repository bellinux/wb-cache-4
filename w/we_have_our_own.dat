We do not want communism or capitalism or socialism. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> Dahomean social and cultural system." [...] On 30 November 1974, however, he announced the adoption of Marxism-Leninism by the state. The country was renamed from the Republic of Dahomey to the People's Republic of Benin a year later; the banks and petroleum industry were nationalized. The People's Revolutionary Party of Benin (Parti de la révolution populaire du Bénin, PRPB) was established as the sole ruling party. In 1980, Kérékou was elected president by the Revolutionary National Assembly; he retired from the army in 1987.|$|E
2500|$|The iPhone 4 {{features}} an additional front-facing VGA camera, and a backside-illuminated 5 megapixel rear-facing camera with a 3.85mm f/2.8 lens and an LED flash.

The rear-facing camera has a 5× digital zoom. In 2012 Will.i.am obtained a licence from Apple to market his i.am+ camera for the iPhone 4. He said, [...] "This thing turns the eight-megapixel iPhone camera into a 14-megapixel camera. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> sensor and a better flash.

We won France by playing music which was ours and not a pale imitation of others, and if we are to develop in America we must develop along our own lines." [...] In 1919 Europe made more recordings for Pathé Records. These include both instrumentals and accompaniments with vocalist Noble Sissle who, with Eubie Blake, would later have great success with their 1921 production of Shuffle Along, which gives us the classic song [...] "I'm Just Wild About Harry". Differing in style from Europe's recordings of a few years earlier, they incorporate blues, blue notes, and early jazz influences (including a rather stiff cover record of the Original Dixieland Jass Band's [...] "Clarinet Marmalade").|$|E

2500|$|Robinson came {{to teach}} at Howard University after {{delivering}} a lecture there in February 1979. Impressed with his knowledge and force of personality, students formed a committee to investigate his background, then met with faculty to discuss their findings. The joint student-faculty group then petitioned Howard University President James E. Cheek to hire Robinson as the next dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. Robinson joined Howard in September 1979. During his tenure as dean, he expanded the curriculum, organized the African American Architect Initiative, and established a program to encourage D.C. schoolchildren to choose a career in urban design and planning. Robinson has long advocated equal access for African-American architects, but argues that black architects should seek work {{where they can get}} it. [...] "I don't want to ask for anything. It's embarrassing to me," [...] he told Newsday in 1991. [...] "I have a new sense of being a radical. I really had to, with the barrage of negative press and complaints of what we don't have. I'm tired of it. ... We simply aren't going to get large corporate work. That's a different network. But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> network. We have the black church, we have the black sororities and fraternities. Of course we want equal access, but no profession is without its barriers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June five adult actresses {{met with}} Hall's {{district}} director, Heather Hutt, at the legislator's office on Artesia Boulevard in Compton and presented 650 signed petitions asking that the Assemblyman withdraw his [...] "condoms in porn" [...] bill. At {{the meeting with}} Hutt were adult film actresses Nina Hartley, Alex Chance and Anikka Albrite, along with industry newcomers Mia Li and Charli Piper and Michael Stabile, a publicist {{who has been working}} with Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and Kink.com on the issue. The group expressed their disappointment with the bill {{and the fact that it}} had been created with no input from adult industry representatives. In an interview with AVN magazine, Chance stated the following,"We told [...] <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> self-regulation..." [...] "We told her we wanted to have our voices heard. They'd had no performer input on this. About condoms and chafing and micro-tears, it didn't seem like she really knew all the details of that. She compared it to a dentist being forced to wear gloves, and maybe it's a little uncomfortable. She didn't realize why we have to have sex from 45 minutes to an hour, sometimes longer, and why that was necessary. She didn't know that the dangers of it, like if the condom breaks, and that we could get more STI's with the micro-tears, and just the condoms in general: Swelling, yeast infections, things of that nature—she just had no idea." [...] "She also didn't know about the doctors with the FSC that help make the decisions," [...] Chance added. [...] "It's not just a couple of people in a building making decisions for the whole industry. They don't even make decisions on the moratoriums; a doctor does, and she had no idea about that and what the testing protocols—how the doctors work with them to make the most safe tests available; she had no idea." ...|$|E
