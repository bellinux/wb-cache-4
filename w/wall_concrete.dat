Reinforced lightweight aggregate <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> and reinforced normalweight <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> are given the fire-resistance test under the same conditions, then their fire resistance performance and mechanical behaviors are compared. Taking into consideration the steel spacing, aggregate type, wall size, and high temperature as the wall sample variables. The research {{results showed that the}} reinforced lightweight aggregate <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> is superior to the reinforced normalweight <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> on ultimate load, yield load, cracked load, stiffness, ductility, and inter-story drift after a high-temperature fire-resistance test. In terms of failure patterns, for a reinforced lightweight aggregate <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> after a high-temperature fire-resistance test, the smaller the steel spacing the higher the yield load and ultimate load, but the worse the ductility. This result matched the results of the reinforced lightweight aggregate <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> without the high-temperature fire-resistance test and revealed that the reinforced lightweight aggregate <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> retained its mechanics after the fire-resistance test.

30|$|However, {{quantitative}} {{evidence supporting}} {{the relationships between}} the thickness of a <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> and the resistance to fire has not been reported. In addition, a limited number of studies have been performed on structural walls, especially normal strength <b>concrete</b> <b>walls,</b> compared to other structural members such as columns and beams. Recent studies on reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> under fire conditions have focused on spalling in high strength <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> (O’Meagher and Bennetts 1991; Crozier and Sanjayan 2000; Ngo et al. 2013; Lee and Lee 2013). O’Meagher and Bennetts (1991) developed a theoretical computer-based model for analyzing the behavior of <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> under fire exposure. From their theoretical study, they concluded that the behavior of a reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>wall</b> in one-sided fire exposure could be significantly influenced by the height to thickness ratio of the wall, the location of steel reinforcement, associated cover thickness, and end restraints. Crozier and Sanjayan (2000) focused on the behavior of slender high strength <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> subjected to standard fire conditions under combined eccentric axial and lateral loads to investigate the in-plane load capacity. According to their test results, slender walls subjected to low in-plane loads show that the in-plane loads made little difference on the behavior of the walls exposed to fire. Their study showed that concrete strength seems to have little influence on the in-plane load capacity of walls subjected to fire exposure on one surface. Ngo et al. (2013) found the differences in thermal behavior between normal and high strength <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> for ISO 834 standard fire testing. Specifically, it was observed that a hydrocarbon fire creates a significant increase in temperature in the initial period of the fire as compared to that specified by the ISO 834 standard. In addition, high strength <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> suffered severe damage due to spalling than normal strength <b>concrete</b> <b>walls.</b> Therefore, the hydrocarbon heating caused more explosive and earlier spalling in the high strength <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> than heating according to ISO 834 standard fire exposure. (Lee and Lee 2013) conducted experimental and numerical studies of the fire resistance of <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> exposed to fire on both sides. They tested eight walls with various height-to-thickness ratios, concrete strengths, and axial load levels. Test results showed that wall thickness and load level have a major effect on the performance of <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> in a fire. They proposed numerical methods for predicting the fire resistance of <b>concrete</b> <b>walls.</b> In their studies, the fire resistance of <b>concrete</b> <b>walls</b> was predicted based on the experimental observations of columns exposed to elevated temperatures.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results in the research of the load-carrying ability of reinforced-concrete nonpressure pipes with inner lining intended to protect concrete against corrosion. The lining (covers) are mounted as a stay-in-place formwork when manufacturing the pipes. The covers are made of 3 - 5 mm thick polyethylene sheets. To be fixed in the pipe <b>wall</b> <b>concrete,</b> the linings are provided with special anchoring elements. Two lining types are considered: 1 – with anchoring elements {{in the form of}} solid longitudinal ribs; 2 – with anchoring elements distributed equidistantly over the shell surface (≈ 400 pcs/m 2). The research has been performed by numerical simulation using a three-dimentional finite element model. The load was applied according to a three-linear pattern used to test pipes for strength (including that specified in ЕN 1916). The computation was performed by the iteration method taking into account physical non-linearity of concrete. The computation makes allowance for formation and opening of cracks in the longitudinal pipe wall sections. The examples of computation of a pipe with the diameter of 2, 000 mm and wall thickness of 150 mm reinforced with two cylindrical cages and a pipe with the diameter of 1, 000 mm and wall thickness of 110 mm reinforced with a single cylindrical cage are given. It has been determined that the load-carrying ability of pipes with type 1 protective linings is lower than that of pipes with type 2 linings. Maximum (up to 25 %) reduction of the load-carrying ability is observed in pipes reinforced with a single cylindrical cage. In pipes of this type, cracks are formed at lower loads. The load-carrying ability of pipes is reduced due to entering of anchoring ribs of the protective shell into the compression zone of the pipe <b>wall</b> <b>concrete</b> in the sections located {{at the level of the}} horizontal diameter. The results of the numerical computation are in good agreement with those obtained when testing full-scale specimens of pipes with specified technical parameters. To protect interior faces of reinforced-concrete non-pressure pipes, it is recommended to use lining covers with V-type discrete anchoring members ensuring reliable mechanical fixing of the linings in the pipe <b>wall</b> <b>concrete.</b> This type of anchoring elements causes almost no effect upon the load-carrying ability of pipes...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of equipping diaphragm walls as ground heat exchangers {{to meet the}} full or partial heating and cooling demands of overlying or adjacent buildings has been explored in recent years. In this paper, the factors affecting the energy performance of diaphragm walls equipped as heat exchangers are investigated through finite element modelling. The numerical approach employed is first validated using available experimental data and then applied to perform parametric analyses. Parameters considered in the analysis include panel width, the ratio between the wall and excavation depths, heat transfer pipe spacing, concrete cover, heat-carrier fluid velocity, concrete thermal properties and the temperature difference between the air within the excavation and the soil behind the wall. The results indicate that {{increasing the number of}} pipes by reducing their spacing is the primary route to increasing energy efficiency in the short term. However, the thermal properties of the <b>wall</b> <b>concrete</b> and the temperature excess within the excavation space are also important, with the latter becoming the most significant in the medium to long term.
