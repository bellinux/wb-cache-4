5|$|DAGs can model many {{different}} kinds of information.

5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large enough to have a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, <b>whenever</b> <b>the</b> bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life.|$|E
5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph. An implication graph is a directed graph {{in which there}} is one vertex per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one vertex to another <b>whenever</b> <b>the</b> corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game, {{the player}} is {{provided}} with a personal data assistant (PDA). PDAs contain security clearance levels, allowing the player to access certain areas that are otherwise locked and off-limits. Additionally, the PDA {{can be used to}} read e-mails and play videos that the player's character acquires during the game. <b>Whenever</b> <b>the</b> player picks up any of the other PDAs found throughout the game, its contents are automatically downloaded to the player's own device. Other PDAs often contain e-mails and audio logs for other characters, which can provide useful information such as storage or door key codes, as well as significant plot details.|$|E

Brown and Company, $2,200 {{to produce the}} first edition. The printer began work in September 1874, but stopped <b>whenever</b> <b>the</b> advance payment ran out, so {{progress}} was slow. The book—Science and Health by Mary Baker Glover, with eight chapters and 456 pages—finally appeared on October 30, 1875, published {{in the name of}} the Christian Science Publishing Company.|$|E

He was assigned as counsel for the Director of the Bureau of Workman's Compensation.

In 1954 Green unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination for Philadelphia City Council.|$|E
5|$|I thus learnt {{my first}} great {{lesson in the}} inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the {{repeated}} observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest. The whole history of science shows us that <b>whenever</b> <b>the</b> educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.|$|E

5|$|In Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the Tar Heel {{fans that}} watched {{the game on}} the {{television}} flooded Franklin Street after the victory over the Jayhawks. Over two thousand people rushed the street, which prevented cars from passing for over an hour. Police were required to help maintain the crowds. This has since turned into a tradition where people overrun Franklin Street following a win over the Duke Blue Devils or <b>whenever</b> <b>the</b> Tar Heels have won a National Championship.|$|E
5|$|In October 1941, Reggie {{was offered}} a post as {{lecturer}} at Farouk University in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell. The Germans regularly bombed the city, and the raids terrified Manning, who irritated Reggie and Liddell by insisting that all three descend to the air raid shelter <b>whenever</b> <b>the</b> sirens wailed. Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news of her brother Oliver's death in a plane crash. The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years.|$|E
5|$|Many foreign {{visitors}} to Iran {{of the time}} had commented on their pitiful situation. Traveller A.V.W. Jackson noted that Zoroastrians lived in constant fear of persecution by Muslim extremists and their lives were in danger <b>whenever</b> <b>the</b> fanatical spirit of Islam broke out, {{such as the one}} witnessed by him in Yazd. According to Edward Browne, the wall of Zoroastrian houses had to be lower than that of the Muslims and prohibited from marking their houses with distinctive signs. Zoroastrians were forbidden from erecting new houses and repairing old ones.|$|E

5|$|Rather than a single, {{overarching}} plot, {{the story}} of Legend of Mana is composed of a multitude of quests split into three main quest arcs, numerous other quests, and a final quest arc. Each main quest arc contains optional side-quests {{in addition to the}} main quests. <b>Whenever</b> <b>the</b> player completes the required portions of one of the quest arcs they are allowed to begin the final arc and finish the game, even if the other arcs have not yet been started or completed. The three main quest arcs prior to the final arc are: the Jumi arc, the Larc and Sierra arc, and the Matilda and Irwin arc.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its {{predecessor}} Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie features three-dimensional worlds containing items to be collected. Among the items are golden jigsaw pieces, called Jiggies, {{that are used}} to complete jigsaw puzzles that unlock the levels. Instead of exploring the hub world in search of incomplete puzzle boards as in Banjo-Kazooie, a singular board is used within a temple where Master Jiggywiggy resides. <b>Whenever</b> <b>the</b> player has obtained the number of Jiggies required, a timed puzzle-completion challenge can be played, after which Jiggywiggy grants access to each world. Each puzzle challenge requires more Jiggies than the last.|$|E
