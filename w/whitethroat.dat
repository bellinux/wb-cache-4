5|$|The genus Sylvia, {{the typical}} warblers, forms {{part of a}} large family of Old World warblers, the Sylviidae. Fossils from France show that the genus dates back at least 20million years. The garden warbler and its nearest relative, the blackcap, are an ancient species pair which diverged very early {{from the rest of the}} genus, between 12 and 16million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become {{sufficiently}} distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus Sylvia and the garden warbler in Epilais. These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the lesser <b>whitethroat</b> and common <b>whitethroat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rare vagrant species {{spotted in}} the area include lesser yellowlegs, white-rumped sandpiper, Pallid Harrier (in spring) and Richard's pipit (in autumn). The birds seen on Brean Down include {{peregrine}} falcon, jackdaw, kestrel, collared and stock doves, <b>whitethroat,</b> linnet, stonechat, dunnock and rock pipit. There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|E

There are also several species of butterfly, including chalkhill blue, dark green fritillary, meadow brown, marbled white, small heath, and common blue.|$|E
500|$|As of 2007, {{records of}} Wilson's snipe (from 1985 and 1998), [...] elegant terns (from 2002), {{a number of}} eastern <b>whitethroats</b> and lesser <b>whitethroats,</b> and several {{apparent}} North African common chaffinches, are still under consideration.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, Sylvia curruca caucasica is {{intermediate}} {{between the}} lesser and Hume's <b>whitethroats.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{distinguished}} from Hume's and lesser <b>whitethroats</b> by its smaller size (12 cm length, 8-13 g weight), smaller bill, the uniformly paler grey head lacking the well-marked dark cheeks of Hume's and lesser <b>whitethroats,</b> and a lighter grey-brown back; in these differences it follows Gloger's rule of pale colour in arid regions. The throat is white, {{and the rest}} of the underparts pale greyish-white.|$|R

These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the lesser <b>whitethroat</b> and common <b>whitethroat.</b> The nearest relatives of the garden warbler outside the sister group are believed to be the African hill babbler and Dohrn's thrush-babbler, both of which should probably be placed in Sylvia rather than their current genera, Pseudoalcippe and Horizorhinus respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{masked shrike}} feeds mainly on large insects, {{although}} other arthropods and small vertebrates are also caught. Shrikes fatten up before migration, {{but to a}} lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the masked shrike has been recorded as killing species such as lesser <b>whitethroat</b> and little swift. Vertebrates are killed by bill blows {{to the back of the}} head, and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the warbler eats insects {{as well as}} berries, and {{the fruits}} of the {{introduced}} Spanish flag is a favourite where present. An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey. Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common <b>whitethroat,</b> they leave from savanna rather than the treeless Sahel further north.|$|E
50|$|The {{site also}} has areas of woodland, which have great spotted woodpeckers, {{blackcap}} and chiffchaff. There are common <b>whitethroats</b> in scrub areas.|$|R
50|$|The park centres on Daventry Reservoir, which {{feeds the}} Grand Union Canal, {{and there are}} also meadows and crack willow woodland. Birds include yellowhammers, lesser <b>whitethroats,</b> dunnocks and song thrushes.|$|R
50|$|This {{site has}} woodland, {{saltmarsh}} and wet meadows. Wetland plants include lesser spearwort, fen bedstraw and southern marsh orchid, the woodland has birds such as nightingales and <b>whitethroats,</b> and rides have {{many species of}} butterfly.|$|R
25|$|Also {{nearby is}} Beeston Common, {{consisting}} of 24.7 hectares/61 acres of grassland, heath, marsh, fen and secondary woodland. The common {{was made a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest/SA6 in the year 2000 and is habitat {{for a wide range}} of mammals, birds, and insects. There are some forty species of rare flowering plants, and fourteen species of British orchids have been recorded on the common due to its special soil conditions. With such a variety of flowers the site is attractive to butterflies. Twenty-six species have been regularly recorded, including green hairstreak, brown argus and Essex skipper. Kingfisher and heron are also visitors to the pond, and no fewer than 19 species of dragonfly/damselfly have been observed. The bird life of the common includes varieties such as chiffchaff, willow warbler, blackcap, common <b>whitethroat,</b> lesser <b>whitethroat,</b> reed warbler and occasionally sedge and grasshopper warblers. Nightjars are occasionally heard. Foxes and muntjac deer along with smaller mammals such as water shrew, field voles, and harvest mice are present. Adders, slowworms and common lizards can also be found on the common.|$|E
500|$|Old {{names for}} the garden warbler, such as strawsmear, small straw and haychat, are often derived from its choice of nesting material, {{although}} the commonest of the English folk names was [...] "pettychaps". These names were often shared with other warblers including the blackcap, common <b>whitethroat</b> and common chiffchaff.|$|E
500|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat of}} the garden warbler is open areas with dense bushes, including thickets and woodland edges. Shady areas and a bushy or herbaceous undergrowth are preferred, as are woods adjacent to rivers or reed beds. A tolerance of willow, alder and birch allows it to breed farther north and at higher altitudes than any other European Sylvia warbler. Mature conifers and dense plantations are avoided, although young conifer plantations with thick undergrowth are suitable for nesting. Despite its name, {{it is not a}} bird of gardens. In Africa, a wide range of habitats with trees are used, although closed forests and arid areas are again avoided. This warbler occurs at altitudes of up to [...] in suitable mountain woodland, although in East Africa it is usually found at a lower altitude than the blackcap, and in moister areas than the common <b>whitethroat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thousands {{of birds}} pass through {{each year on}} their way to their {{breeding}} or wintering grounds. Chiffchaffs, goldcrests and wheatears are usually the first to pass through, followed by sedge warblers and willow warblers, <b>whitethroats</b> and spotted flycatchers.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} an {{important}} wildlife site - owls, yellowhammers, <b>whitethroats,</b> turtle dove, song thrush, nightingales and bullfinches can be seen. There are also many wild plants such as corn mint, hairy buttercup, sea aster and ox-eye daisy.|$|R

500|$|The male's song, usually {{delivered}} by birds in dense cover, {{is a rich}} musical warbling usually delivered in bursts of a few seconds duration, but sometimes for longer periods. The song is confusable {{with that of the}} blackcap, although compared to that species it is slightly lower-pitched, less broken into discrete song segments and more mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is much more difficult to separate. The most frequent call of the garden warbler is a sharp kek-kek, which is repeated rapidly when the bird is alarmed. A quiet rasping tchurr-r-r-r resembling the main call of the common <b>whitethroat</b> is also sometimes heard. [...] The juvenile has a quia alarm vocalisation. The garden warbler will occasionally mimic other birds, and is itself frequently mimicked by the blackcap. Both Sylvia warblers will also sing against common nightingales, which have a similar song despite being unrelated. Subsong may be heard on the wintering grounds in Africa, developing into the full song in March and April prior to the return to Europe.|$|E
500|$|The {{second edition}} {{appeared}} in 1831, {{described as being}} [...] "By Colonel G. Montagu, F.L.S." [...] but [...] "with a plan of study, and many new articles and original observations". It was fully numbered and ran to lx (60 pages of introductory matter) + 592 pages. The text was revised by the Scottish naturalist James Rennie, Montagu having died in 1815. Rennie was not an ornithologist; he had earlier published books such as Insect Architecture and Insect Transformations. The second edition was published by Hurst, Chance, and Co, of St Paul's, London. Rennie states that he has [...] "made very considerable alterations in the arrangement". He criticises Montagu's grouping of all species of a genus together, as with [...] "Duck-Eider, Duck-King" [...] as [...] "an unnecessary awkwardness, attended with no apparent advantage", and instead lists them as written. He also criticises the use of [...] "greater" [...] and [...] "lesser" [...] to distinguish two similar species, as of whitethroats, choosing to call the lesser <b>whitethroat</b> by [...] "the continental name, Babillard." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{used the}} journal to publish {{descriptions}} {{of his new}} discoveries, such as Hume's owl, Hume's wheatear and Hume's <b>whitethroat.</b> He wrote extensively on his own observation as well as critical reviews of all the ornithological works {{of the time and}} earned himself the nickname of Pope of Indian ornithology. He critiqued a monograph on parrots, Die Papageien by Friedrich Hermann Otto Finsch suggesting that name changes (by [...] "cabinet naturalists") were aimed at claiming authority to species without the trouble of actually discovering them. He wrote: ...|$|E

50|$|About 2 km from Shanagarry, {{just off}} the road to Ballycotton, lies Ballynamona beach. The {{surrounding}} land is a sanctuary for wildlife and is home to numerous herons, as well as oystercatchers and <b>whitethroats.</b> The beach offers good views of Ballycotton Bay.|$|R
50|$|The site {{is mainly}} rough grassland, with some {{woodland}} and scrub. The River Colne runs along its southern boundary, with stream water crowfoot and yellow water lily {{growing in the}} stream.

50|$|This {{site has}} areas of acidic {{heathland}} with damp grassland in river valleys. Gravel workings and scrub have produced habitats valuable to birds such as nightingales and <b>whitethroats.</b> Birds found on open heathland include stone curlews, a protected species, and wheatears. Six species of lichen and eight of moss have been recorded.|$|R

Their very {{emptiness}} and desolation, which frightens the stranger from them, only serves {{to make them more}} fascinating to those who are intimate with and have learned to love them. That dreary aspect brings to mind the other one, when, on waking with the early sunlight in the room, you look out on a blue sky, cloudless or with white clouds. It may be fancy, or the effect of contrast, but it has always seemed to me that just as the air is purer and fresher on these chalk heights than on the earth below, and as the water is of a more crystal purity, and the sky perhaps bluer, so do all colours and all sounds have a purity and vividness and intensity beyond that of other places. I see it in the yellows of hawkweed, rock-rose, and birds'-foot-trefoil, in the innumerable specks of brilliant colour--blue and white and rose--of milk-wort and squinancy-wort, and in the large flowers of the dwarf thistle, glowing purple in its green setting; and I hear it in every bird-sound, in the trivial songs of yellow-hammer and corn-bunting, and of dunnock and wren and <b>whitethroat.</b>|$|E

6000|$|This {{is almost}} the only passage in the poem in which {{something}} of the vastness of visible nature is conveyed. He saw the vastness only in the sky on nights with a full moon or when he made a telescope of his hat to watch the flight of the lark. It was not a hilly country about his native place, and his horizon was a very limited one, usually bounded by the hedgerow timber {{at the end of}} the level field. The things he depicts were seen at short range, and the poetry, we see, was of a very modest kind. It was a [...] "humble note" [...] which pleased me in the days of long ago when I was young and very ignorant, and as it pleases me still it may be supposed that mentally I have not progressed with the years. Nevertheless, I am not incapable of appreciating the greater music; all that is said in its praise, even to the extremest expressions of admiration of those who are moved to a sense of wonder by it, find an echo in me. But it is not only a delight to me to listen to the lark singing at heaven's gate and to the vesper nightingale in the oak copse--the singer of a golden throat and wondrous artistry; I also love the smaller vocalists--the modest shufewing and the lesser <b>whitethroat</b> and the yellowhammer with his simple chant. These are very dear to me: their strains do not strike me as trivial; they have a lesser distinction of their own and I would not miss them from the choir. The literary man will smile at this and say that my paper is naught but an idle exercise, but I fancy I shall sleep the better tonight for having discharged this ancient debt which has been long on my conscience.|$|E
