5|$|Our quarrel is {{not with}} these men, but with those who give them their chance. We {{who believe in the}} study of nature feel that a real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.|$|E
5|$|We {{always start}} out with a musical idea. Great effort goes into {{creating}} a solid melodic core. We both play the keyboards and program, but in general Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools, while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input. However, we both are hands on and have no rules or limitations. When we have some killer beats and musical starting points, we hook up with one of our favorite topline writers, who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody. We make sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> we've got a killer hook.|$|E

25|$|In this sense, the {{leadership}} of those here in Guernica who seek peace and {{have worked hard to}} bring about this memorial ceremony is profoundly meaningful. The solidarity <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> today derives from our shared experience of the horror of war, and this solidarity can truly lead us toward a world beyond war.|$|E
25|$|SEACAT is a {{means of}} {{contributing}} to the capabilities of our friends and allies. The security of all waterways is vital to peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region, and we applaud the ongoing efforts of regional nations in combating maritime threats.

Now there are various methods of getting up and walking to a fireplace, and they find their way to outward {{expression}} through the customary means of look and manner. <b>We</b> may <b>feel</b> cold, and may only want to warm ourselves. Or <b>we</b> may <b>feel</b> restless, and may need an excuse for changing our position. Or <b>we</b> may <b>feel</b> modestly confused, and may be anxious to hide it. Father Benwell, from head to foot, expressed modest confusion, and polite anxiety to hide it.|$|R

25|$|The band {{is not in}} {{competition}} with other Christian bands. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> we are competing with Journey, Styx and REO Speedwagon. We {{need to be aware}} of them, because the people who come to see Petra go to see those bands as well. We are being very naïve if we don't keep that in mind. We need to have a light system, sound system and presentation that will be competitive with those groups.|$|E
25|$|In 1738, Swiss {{physicist}} and mathematician Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamica which laid {{the basis for}} the kinetic theory of gases. In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that <b>we</b> <b>feel,</b> and that what we experience as heat is simply the kinetic energy of their motion.|$|E
25|$|We create karma {{in three}} {{different}} ways, through actions that are positive, negative, or neutral. When <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> kindness and love and with this attitude do good things, which are beneficial to both ourselves and others, this is positive action. When we commit harmful deeds out of equally harmful intentions, this is negative action. Finally, when our motivation is indifferent and our deeds are neither harmful or beneficial, this is neutral action. The results we experience will accord {{with the quality of}} our actions.|$|E

25|$|My Lord, - We beg {{leave to}} thank your lordship for {{presiding}} at this, our first examination, and we trust that the progress {{which we have}} made in out studies will meet with your approval, and also of our parents. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> assured that your lordship's approbation will prove a stimulus to our future exertions, and that next Christmas (with God's blessing) will find us much further advanced, not only in our secular studies, but in the great study you so strongly recommended to our attention on your late visit, namely - 'the study of God's laws {{and those of the}} Church.' We conclude, begging your lordship's apostolic benediction, and wishing you a merry Christmas and many happy New Years. Signed on behalf of the pupils of St Peter's School. Laurence Lorigan.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation in {{the body}} may lead to effects on the brain via the blood-brain barrier (BBB). During {{systemic}} inflammation, whether {{in the form of}} infection or sterile inflammation, the BBB may undergo changes which may be disruptive or non-disruptive. Such changes may be part of a productive host response to systemic inflammation, or may lead to deleterious consequences within the central nervous system. These BBB changes likely {{play a role in the}} generation of sickness behaviour during systemic infection (why <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> 'unwell' when we have an infection). These changes may also induce or accelerate disease within the brain, for example in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, and may be part of the reason why patients with these conditions can deteriorate during an infection. Also, in patients with neurological disease the BBB may be abnormally sensitive to the effects of systemic inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Substrates {{within the}} muscle {{generally}} serve to power muscular contractions. They include molecules such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glycogen and creatine phosphate. ATP binds to the myosin head and causes the ‘ratchetting’ {{that results in}} contraction according to the sliding filament model. Creatine phosphate stores energy so ATP can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions, allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 5–7 seconds. Glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of glucose, used to generate energy quickly once intramuscular creatine stores are exhausted, producing lactic acid as a metabolic byproduct. Contrary to common belief, lactic acid accumulation doesn't actually cause the burning sensation <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> when we exhaust our oxygen and oxidative metabolism, but in actuality, lactic acid in presence of oxygen recycles to produce pyruvate in the liver, which {{is known as the}} Cori cycle.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) {{developed from}} the combination of cognitive therapy and rational emotive behavior therapy, both of which grew out of cognitive psychology and behaviorism. CBT {{is based on the}} theory that how we think (cognition), how <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> (emotion), and how we act (behavior) are related and interact together in complex ways. In this perspective, certain dysfunctional ways of interpreting and appraising the world (often through schemas or beliefs) can contribute to emotional distress or result in behavioral problems. The object of many cognitive behavioral therapies is to discover and identify the biased, dysfunctional ways of relating or reacting and through different methodologies help clients transcend these in ways that will lead to increased well-being. There are many techniques used, such as systematic desensitization, socratic questioning, and keeping a cognition observation log. Modified approaches that fall into the category of CBT have also developed, including dialectic behavior therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.|$|E
25|$|It is {{in those}} two {{functions}} that the real life of the ego is manifested, but behind them is self-consciousness permanently present, which is always both subjective and objective — consciousness of ourselves and of the non-ego. This self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought — which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge. In it we cognize our own inner life as affected by the non-ego. As the non-ego helps or hinders, enlarges or limits, our inner life, <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> pleasure or pain. Aesthetic, moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas — nature, mankind and the world; those feelings are {{the sense of being}} one with these vast objects. Religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and God; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E
