5|$|Takao's 26-year-old brother, {{who leaves}} home {{to live with}} his girlfriend, dismisses Takao's shoe-making as a <b>whimsical.</b> He is voiced by Takeshi Maeda in Japanese and Crash Buist in English.|$|E
5|$|The Free State of Galveston (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Republic of Galveston Island) was a <b>whimsical</b> name given to the coastal city of Galveston in the U.S. state of Texas during the early-to-mid-20thcentury. Today, the term is sometimes used to describe the culture and history of that era.|$|E
5|$|Yarrell's tail-pieces, small {{engravings}} fitted into spaces at {{the ends}} of articles, follow the tradition established by Bewick, but differ in rarely being <b>whimsical.</b> Many are secondary illustrations showing details of bird anatomy or features useful in identification.|$|E
5|$|A {{role-playing}} game, it {{centers on}} a battle system {{different from that of}} traditional games of the genre, with emphasis on timing and more elaborate attacks. The game is <b>whimsical</b> in tone, with various in-game jokes and comical references to the heritage of the Mario series. Superstar Saga was critically acclaimed, and IGN named it the twelfth best Game Boy Advance game of all time in their feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance's lifespan. A remake of the game for Nintendo 3DS, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, was released on October 6, 2017.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Second Dutch War, Charles {{dismissed}} Lord Clarendon, whom he used as a scapegoat for the war. Clarendon fled to France when impeached for high treason (which carried the penalty of death). Power passed to five politicians known collectively by a <b>whimsical</b> acronym as the Cabal—Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley (afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury) and Lauderdale. In fact, the Cabal rarely acted in concert, and the court was often divided between two factions led by Arlington and Buckingham, with Arlington the more successful.|$|E
5|$|Kwee Tek Hoay's {{first stage}} play, Allah jang Palsoe was written as a realist {{response}} to <b>whimsical</b> contemporary theatres. Though the published stageplay sold poorly {{and the play}} was deemed difficult to perform, Allah jang Palsoe found success on the stage. By 1930 it had been performed by various ethnic Chinese troupes to popular acclaim and pioneered {{a body of work}} by authors such as Lauw Giok Lan, Tio Ie Soei, and Tjoa Tjien Mo. In 2006 the script for the play, which continues to be performed, was republished with updated spelling by the Lontar Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Paul's second children's {{book was}} {{published}} - again by Albert Whitman & Company - in October 2015. Based on his Christmas poem The Night the Lights Went Out on Christmas, the book, illustrated by Scott Brundage, is the <b>whimsical</b> yet heartwarming story of a neighborhood where families trying to outdo one another with Christmas lights and decorations use so much electrical power that the neighborhood is thrown into darkness. The poem originally appeared on Paul's City of Silver Dreams Christmas CD and is included as a downloadable mp3 file with the book.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} iconography {{includes two}} notable <b>whimsical</b> elements. A downspout {{on the east}} wall features a relief of a bulldog head; a decades-old myth relates that Cram placed it there to recognize Yale University, whose mascot is the bulldog. (Cram was not a Yale alumnus and in fact did not attend college, so {{it is unclear what}} interest he might have had promoting Yale.) A sculptor who worked on the chapel during its construction placed small carvings of his face and Cram's at the bottoms of crockets flanking the main entrance; Cram is identifiable by his glasses.|$|E
5|$|The legendary sagas tend {{to focus}} on elves as legendary {{ancestors}} or on heroes' sexual relations with elf-women. Mention of the land of Álfheimr is found in Heimskringla while Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar recounts a line of local kings who ruled over Álfheim, who since they had elven blood were said to be more beautiful than most men. According to Hrólfs saga kraka, Hrolfr Kraki's half-sister Skuld was the half-elven child of King Helgi and an elf-woman (álfkona). Skuld was skilled in witchcraft (seiðr). Accounts of Skuld in earlier sources, however, do not include this material. The Þiðreks saga version of the Nibelungen (Niflungar) describes Högni as the son of a human queen and an elf, but no such lineage is reported in the Eddas, Völsunga saga, or the Nibelungenlied. The relatively few mentions of elves in the Chivalric sagas tend even to be <b>whimsical.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Knight visited the Bertram Mills Circus at Olympia in West London. Mills' circus {{was a highly}} {{polished}} show with internationally renowned performers. Knight painted some of these performers, such as the clown <b>Whimsical</b> Wilson, several times. Charivari or The Grand Parade, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1929, depicts practically the entire circus cast of performers and animals. Throughout 1929 and 1930 Knight went {{on a tour of}} British towns with the combined Bertram Mills and Great Carmo's Circus. Painting within a working circus forced Knight to paint at great speed, as the performers rarely had much time to pose. Knight responded by painting directly onto the canvas without any preliminary drawing. Whilst this led to some of her circus scenes appearing 'flat', her paintings of small groups of clowns, such as The Three Clowns (1930) and Old Time Clowns (1957), were much more successful. Knight's Circus Folk exhibition, at the Alpine Club in 1930, was heavily criticised in art journals, but her paintings of more mundane subjects, such as domestic interiors and London streets, were highly praised. Notable works from this period include Susie and the Wash-basin (1927), Blue and Gold (1927), A Cottage Bedroom (1929) and Spring in St. John's Wood (1933). In 1934 Knight developed a series of circus designs for the Modern Art for the Table tableware range produced by Clarice Cliff.|$|E

25|$|After {{graduating from}} Cambridge in 1903, A. A. Milne contributed humorous verse and <b>whimsical</b> essays to Punch, joining the staff in 1906 and {{becoming}} an assistant editor.|$|E
25|$|Itá, Paraguay {{is another}} ceramic center, {{known for its}} <b>whimsical,</b> ceramic chickens. Rosa Brítez (b. 1941) is a famous ceramic artist from Itá and has been {{recognized}} by UNESCO.|$|E
25|$|A fourth {{problem with}} using personas {{is that some}} {{organizations}} are not ready for the methodology. Creating hypothetical users with real names, stories and personalities may seem unserious and <b>whimsical</b> to some people, teams or organizations.|$|E
25|$|Poodles are crossed {{with other}} breeds for various reasons, and the {{resulting}} puppies (called designer dogs) are described by <b>whimsical</b> portmanteau words, such as cockapoo or spoodle (Cocker Spaniel), maltipoo (Maltese), goldendoodle, labradoodle (Labrador), Schnoodle (Schnauzer), Pekapoos (Pekingese), Cavapoo (Cavalier King Charles), Bernedoodle (Bernese Mountain Dog) and many others.|$|E
25|$|Betus pottery is {{characterized}} by vibrant colors that give the ceramics a <b>whimsical</b> look. This style derives {{its name from the}} betus oil the clayware is immersed in before it is fired. The oil, which is made of a resin extracted from pine trees, gives the painted pottery a brilliant sheen.|$|E
25|$|Visitors would board moving {{four to six}} person Omnimover vehicles, {{and would}} be taken through scenes that were {{populated}} with Audio-Animatronic figures and also projection effects. It was a <b>whimsical</b> {{look at the history}} and achievements in transportation, showing scenes from the invention of the wheel right up to the present day and beyond.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to their lyrics, which often focus on historical incidents and/or folklore, The Decemberists are also well known for their eclectic live shows. Audience participation {{is a part of}} each performance, typically during encores. The band stages <b>whimsical</b> reenactments of sea battles and other centuries-old events, typically of regional interest, or acts out songs with members of the crowd.|$|E
25|$|BT's second album, ESCM (Electric Sky Church Music), {{released}} in 1997, features more complex melodies and traditional harmonies {{along with a}} heavier use of vocals. The tone of the album is darker and less <b>whimsical</b> than Ima. The album, as a whole, is much more diverse than BT's debut, expanding into drum and bass, breakbeat, hip-hop, rock and vocally-based tracks.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unusual}} for pubic hair to be dyed or painted, except {{incidentally}} to bodypainting. Concerns {{have been raised}} {{about the safety of}} using regular hair dye for this purpose, but dyes have been formulated for use on pubic hair. This is sometimes done to enable someone to match their pubic hair to the (dyed) hair on their head, or in <b>whimsical</b> colours.|$|E
25|$|Many rural {{households}} in the Mexican state of Oaxaca have prospered {{over the past three}} decades through the sale of brightly painted, <b>whimsical</b> wood carvings they call alebrijes to international tourists and the owners of ethnic arts shops in the United States, Canada, and Europe. What are called “alebrijes” in Oaxaca is a marriage of native woodcarving traditions and influence from Pedro Linares’ work in Mexico City.|$|E
25|$|In Western European terms, Spybuck's style {{might be}} called naïve art, but his works differs from most naïve artists' due to the {{influence}} of ethnographic patronage that guided his choice to include certain details and an infusion of a sense of humor and personality. His scenes can provide subtle hints of attitudes and personalities of individual people and often include <b>whimsical</b> details on the periphery that contrast with the central activities.|$|E
25|$|A <b>whimsical</b> comedy, Rio das Mortes follows {{two young}} men without {{prospects}} who try to raise {{money in order to}} realize their dream of finding a buried treasure in Peru using a map of the Rio das Mortes. The girlfriend of one of them finds the notion stupid and wants {{to put a stop to}} it, but eventually the two friends find a patroness to finance their adventure.|$|E
25|$|Ocumicho {{produces}} glazed {{figures of}} devils and other fantasies. The settings for {{the figures are}} <b>whimsical,</b> devils {{sitting on the edge}} of a volcano and a Noah's ark where the animals look extremely tired. Some of the best potters here are women. It is difficult to travel to the small village but the figures are sold in the towns of Uruapan and in the Casa de las Artesanias in Morelia.|$|E
25|$|The {{descriptive}} passages mix <b>whimsical,</b> often alliterative {{language with}} phonetically-spelled dialogue {{and a strong}} poetic sensibility ("Agathla, centuries aslumber, shivers in its sleep with splenetic splendor, and spreads abroad a seismic spasm with the supreme suavity of a vagabond volcano."). Herriman was also fond of experimenting with unconventional page layouts in his Sunday strips, including panels of various shapes and sizes, arranged in whatever fashion he thought would best tell the story.|$|E
25|$|After Dark was {{an early}} {{screensaver}} for the Macintosh platform, and later PC/Windows, which prominently featured <b>whimsical</b> designs such as flying toasters. Perhaps {{in response to the}} workplace environment in which they are often viewed, many screensavers continue this legacy of whimsy by populating the idle monitor with animals or fish, games, and visual expressions of mathematics equations (through the use of fractals, Fourier transforms or other means) as in the Electric Sheep screensaver.|$|E
25|$|The term {{antimatter}} {{was first}} used by Arthur Schuster in two rather <b>whimsical</b> letters to Nature in 1898, in which he coined the term. He hypothesized antiatoms, as well as whole antimatter solar systems, and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other. Schuster's ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal, merely speculation, and like the previous ideas, differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed negative gravity.|$|E
25|$|Although {{funded by}} the People's Commissariat for Education of Soviet Russia, the Proletkult {{organization}} sought autonomy from state control, a demand which brought it into conflict with the Communist Party hierarchy and the Soviet state bureaucracy. Some top party leaders, such as V.I. Lenin, sought to concentrate state funding on the basic education {{of the working class}} rather than on <b>whimsical</b> artistic endeavors. He and others also saw in Proletkult a hotbed of bourgeois intellectuals and potential political oppositionists.|$|E
25|$|The film centres on Sam Lowry, a {{man trying}} to find a woman who appears in his dreams while he is working in a mind-numbing job and living in a small apartment, set in a consumer-driven dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poorly {{maintained}} (and rather <b>whimsical)</b> machines. Brazils bureaucratic, totalitarian government is reminiscent of the government depicted in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, except that it has a buffoonish, slapstick quality and lacks a Big Brother figure.|$|E
25|$|The {{name is a}} <b>whimsical</b> {{reference}} to 19th-century economist William Stanley Jevons, who attempted to correlate business cycle patterns with sunspot counts (on the actual sun) {{on the grounds that}} they might cause variations in weather and thus agricultural output. Subsequent studies have found no evidence for the hypothesis that the sun influences the business cycle. On the other hand, sunny weather has a small but significant positive impact on stock returns, probably due to its impact on traders' moods.|$|E
25|$|Paul Edmund Flato (September 1, 1900 – July 17, 1999), was {{a popular}} American jeweler, based in New York City from the 1920s to the early 1940s. Considered the first celebrity jeweler, he was well known for {{important}} jewelry, and as an early proponent of <b>whimsical</b> pieces. His long list of movie star clients included Greta Garbo, Mae West, Rita Hayworth, Joan Crawford, Doris Duke, Ginger Rogers, Carmen Miranda, Marlene Dietrich, Katharine Hepburn, and Gloria Vanderbilt—many of whom wore his pieces on screen.|$|E
25|$|Other {{than the}} {{previous}} basic design rules, the Cub Scout is able to carve and decorate the car as he chooses. Many Cub Scouts also add weights to the final design to bring {{the car to the}} maximum allowable weight; coins and glued-in lead or steel pieces are common ways to add weight. Cars typically vary from unfinished blocks to <b>whimsical</b> objects, to accurate replicas of actual cars. Graphite is usually the only lubricant allowed, and it often helps to polish the provided nails.|$|E
25|$|With {{the other}} {{planters}} Milan was equally <b>whimsical.</b> For trifling misdemeanors, he instituted elaborate investigations and meted out extravagant fines and punishments where a wiser {{man would have}} overlooked the whole matter. Offending negroes were made to feel {{the pressure of the}} governor's heavy hand. A runaway who might have been mercifully beheaded was impaled alive on a sharpened stick to die in horrible agony. Another negro, arrested on a similar charge, had his foot cut off, after which he was confiscated to the governor's use and put to work in his kitchen.|$|E
25|$|Dickensian {{characters}} are amongst {{the most memorable}} in English literature, especially so because of their typically <b>whimsical</b> names. The likes of Ebenezer Scrooge, Tiny Tim, Jacob Marley, Bob Cratchit, Oliver Twist, The Artful Dodger, Fagin, Bill Sikes, Pip, Miss Havisham, Sydney Carton, Charles Darnay, David Copperfield, Mr. Micawber, Abel Magwitch, Daniel Quilp, Samuel Pickwick, Wackford Squeers, and Uriah Heep are so well known as to be {{part and parcel of}} British culture, and in some cases have passed into ordinary language: a scrooge, for example, is a miser - or someone who dislikes Christmas festivity.|$|E
25|$|An {{international}} cast {{plays the}} array of contestants with the film opening with a brief, comic prologue {{on the history of}} flight, narrated by James Robertson Justice and featuring American comedian Red Skelton. In a series of silent blackout vignettes that incorporate stock footage of unsuccessful attempts at early aircraft, Skelton depicted a recurring character whose adventures span the centuries. The early aviation history sequence that begins the film is followed by a <b>whimsical</b> animated opening credit sequence drawn by caricaturist Ronald Searle, accompanied by the title song.|$|E
25|$|He went solo {{the next}} year with the one man show Bill Bailey's Cosmic Jam. The show led to a {{recording}} at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London which was broadcast in 1997 on Channel 4 as a one-hour special called Bill Bailey Live. It was not until 2005 that this was released on DVD uncut and under its original title. It {{marked the first time}} that Bailey had been able to tie together his music and post-modern gags with the <b>whimsical</b> rambling style he is now known for.|$|E
