When they investigate, the figure appears, causing {{the man with the}} nightmare to collapse in fright. Elsewhere, director Adam Kesher has his film commandeered by mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his film. Adam resists, but after being thrown out of his house when he finds his wife cheating on him, he learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{extermination}} {{activities of}} the Einsatzgruppen generally followed a standard procedure, with the Einsatzgruppen chief contacting the nearest Wehrmacht unit commander to inform him of the impending action; this was done so they could coordinate and control access to the execution grounds. Initially the victims were shot, but this method proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. Also, after Himmler observed the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk in August 1941, he grew concerned about the impact such actions were having on {{the mental health of}} his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found, which led to introduction of gas vans. However, these were not popular with the men, because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} Minsk in August 1941, Himmler {{witnessed}} an Einsatzgruppen mass execution first-hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men. By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care. He also decided a transition {{should be made to}} gassing the victims, especially the women and children, and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders. Gas vans, which had been used previously to kill mental patients, began to see service by all four main Einsatzgruppen from 1942. However, the gas vans were not popular with the Einsatzkommandos, because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma. Some of the early mass killings at extermination camps used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines, similar to the method used in gas vans, but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at Auschwitz using Zyklon B, a cyanide-based pesticide gas.|$|E

500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably the worst time in my whole life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and I can understand why. He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't really have a place'." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{boost its}} declining readership, Deadline {{featured}} Tank Girl {{on its cover}} many times in 1994 and 1995 {{in anticipation of the}} film's release. Subsequently, Tom Astor said the release of the film: [...] "was very helpful, but it did not make up the difference, it lost some of its cult appeal without gaining any mainstream credibility." [...] The magazine ceased publication in late 1995. Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett have since spoken negatively of their experiences creating the film, calling it [...] "a bit of a sore point" [...] for them. [...] "The script was lousy," [...] Hewlett recalled, [...] "me and Alan kept rewriting it and putting Grange Hill jokes and Benny Hill jokes in, and they obviously weren't getting it. They forgot to film about ten major scenes so we had to animate them... it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> experience." [...] Talalay complained that the studio interfered significantly in the story, screenplay, and feel of the film. She said that she had been [...] "in sync" [...] and on good terms with Martin and Hewlett until the studio made significant cuts to the film, which she had no control over. Peter Milligan wrote an adaptation comic in 1995, and a novelization of the film by Martin Millar was published in 1996.|$|E

2500|$|Ferguson {{refused to}} give {{interviews}} to the BBC after a documentary called Fergie and Son was shown on BBC Three on 27 May 2004.

The same newspaper article {{made it clear that}} [...] "Ferguson Jnr" [...] was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, and it quoted Ferguson Senior as follows: [...] "They [...] did a story about my son that was whole lot of nonsense. It all [...] made-up stuff and 'brown paper bags' {{and all that kind of}} carry-on. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> attack on my son's honour and he should never have been accused of that."

And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up, through love of this country." [...] In response to criticism of the remarks, Giuliani said, [...] "Some people thought it was racist—I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother... This isn't racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism." [...] White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said he agreed with Giuliani [...] "that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> thing to say", but said he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event. Although he received some support for his controversial comments, Giuliani said he also received several death threats within 48 hours.|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{descended from}} the rooftop to the street, where he got {{into his car and}} drove quickly toward the ruined railway station. When he arrived, he noted carnage and confusion: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> sight. People were still trying to get up. Dead and injured lay strewn across the tracks and platform. Limbs lay all over the place. Only my work helped me forget what I was seeing. I stopped to reload my camera. I noticed that my shoes were soaked with blood. I walked across the railway tracks, and made many long scenes with the burning {{overhead}} bridge in the background. Then I saw a man pick up a baby from the tracks and carry him to the platform. He went back to get another badly injured child. The mother lay dead on the tracks. As I filmed this tragedy, I heard the sound of planes returning. Quickly, I shot my remaining few feet [...] on the baby. I ran toward the child, intending to carry him to safety, but the father returned. The bombers passed overhead. No bombs were dropped." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rathenau was {{appointed}} Minister of Reconstruction and in May 1921 held a second meetings with Lloyd George and the Reparations Committee. [...] He established {{good relations with}} Aristide Briand who praised [...] "a strong, healthy, booming Germany". [...] The era of Erfullungspolitik was high, altruistic self-confidence; he shared a pre-war fascination for the Hegelian Complex for a corporate Germany chastised by a reverence to a Supreme Being. [...] He was wary of allied decadence, complacent, corrosive of an innocent romanticism expanded into mysticism. [...] His ideas were challenged as [...] "objectively impossible"; Weimar lacked clarity and leadership, while Rathenau was deterministic, and robust over the details. [...] A Levee en masse {{would be part of}} this utilitarianism that bestrode his menschen philosophies. [...] This contradistinction about an [...] "unravelled" [...] Versailles which was incompatible with Fulfillment and the role of Reconstruction. Bravely Rathenau held out against the partition of Poland; despite Erzberger's assassination; and threats for extreme National Bolshevists when he joined Joseph Wirth's government after Cannes on 31 Jan 1922, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> fear that his days were numbered.|$|E

2500|$|Both [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice" [...] {{and second}} single [...] "Everybody Knows" [...] were largely ignored by U.S. country radio {{and failed to}} {{penetrate}} the top 35 of the Hot Country Songs chart. [...] In June 2006, Emily Robison noted {{the lack of support}} from other country music performers: [...] "A lot of artists cashed in on being against what we said or what we stood for because that was promoting their career, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> thing to do. ... A lot of pandering started going on, and you'd see soldiers and the American flag in every video. It became a sickening display of ultra-patriotism." [...] Maines commented, [...] "The entire country may disagree with me, but I don't understand the necessity for patriotism. Why {{do you have to be}} a patriot? About what? This land is our land? Why? You can like where you live and like your life, but as for loving the whole country ... I don't see why people care about patriotism." [...] In Europe, however, the two singles were well received by country radio, peaking at Nos. 13 and 11 respectively and remaining on the European Country Charts for more than 20 weeks each.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the capture}} of Anula, in the 'reorganization' phase of the attack, as the support weapons were being moved into place, and the rear echelons had started to arrive, the {{battalion}} came under intense uninterrupted artillery fire. The fire was accurate and deadly. It lasted for some fifteen minutes. The artillery fire, as it soon became clear, was from own field artillery fire; and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> mistake. It was meant to support {{the second phase of}} the 168 Brigade attack, {{the capture of}} Bajragarhi by 2/1 GR. By the time the fire was lifted 8 men were dead and 17 wounded. Amongst the wounded was Lieutenant Colonel Vasant B Sathe, the Commanding Officer. After he was hit in the ankle and the hip by shrapnel, Sathe winced, and was heard saying [...] " [...] I think I've been hit by a stone" [...] by John Taylor, and Hem Tiwari, who were 'lying head to head' with him while the shelling rained down. After the shelling lifted it was realised that Sathe had been hit. But Sathe, though wounded and bleeding, continued to command, firmly rejecting all attempts to evacuate him till Major BB Sharma, the Second in Command, was able to reach and assume command.|$|E
2500|$|Bullough {{argues that}} {{prostitution}} in 18th-century Britain was a convenience to men of all social statuses, and economic necessity for many poor women, and was tolerated by society. [...] The evangelical {{movement of the}} nineteenth century denounced the prostitutes and their clients as sinners, and denounced society for tolerating it. Prostitution, according to the values of the Victorian middle-class, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> evil, for the young women, for the men, and for all of society. [...] Parliament in the 1860s in the Contagious Diseases Acts ("CD") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The [...] "regulationist policy" [...] was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were [...] trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by Josephine Butler and the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts, Parliament repealed the acts and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free. [...] The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand. [...] The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.|$|E

2500|$|Navarro first {{appeared}} {{with the band}} at Woodstock '94. The band opened their set wearing enormous light bulb costumes attached precariously to chrome metallic suits, making it near-impossible for them to play their instruments. Navarro hated the idea but went with it. The performance saw the debut of new songs such as [...] "Warped", [...] "Aeroplane", and [...] "Pea" [...] although the songs were in the beginning stages and the lyrics were {{very different from the}} final versions. The band followed up their performance at Woodstock with a brief tour, which included headlining appearances at the Pukkelpop and Reading Festivals as well two performances as the opening act for The Rolling Stones. According to Kiedis, however, opening for the Stones <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> experience. While externally, the band appeared to be settled, the relationship between the three established members and Navarro had begun to deteriorate. His differing musical background made performing difficult as they began playing together, and continued to be an issue over the next year. Navarro admitted he did not care for funk music or jamming. Kiedis was also struggling with his heroin addiction; he had been through a dental procedure in Beverly Hills, in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs, although the band would not find this out until later.|$|E
2500|$|Developers {{also found}} the machine {{difficult}} to program for. In 2007, Gabe Newell of Valve said [...] "The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels, I think it's really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted". He continued [...] "I'd say, even at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, 'This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'". Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that Valve is interested in developing for the console and is looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects. He later restated Valve's position, [...] "Until {{we have the ability}} to get a PS3 team together, until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don't really see us moving to that platform". At Sony's E3 2010 press conference, Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony's move to make the system more developer friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system. He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks (Valve's system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market.|$|E

[...] When the outnumbered troops of the 6th Regiment finally fired volleys on an attacking crowd on Baltimore Street, they killed 10 civilians and wounded 25. The rioters injured several members of the militia, damaged B. & O. engines and train cars, and burned portions of the train station at South Howard and West Camden Streets. The militia remained trapped in the surrounding Camden Yards, besieged by armed rioters until July 21–22, when the 19th President Rutherford B.
