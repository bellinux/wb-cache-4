The episode was the first of an ongoing plot thread with Nog entering Starfleet, which initially concerned Eisenberg as he thought he was being written out of the show. The episode was the fourth most watched episode of the third series, with 8.3 million viewers. Critical response was mixed, with negative comments directed at the idea that the situation was created by the female Founder (Salome Jens).|$|E
5|$|With {{knowledge}} of his sexuality becoming more common beginning in the 1970s, some film historians and gay studies scholars have detected homosexual themes in Whale's work, particularly in Bride of Frankenstein in which {{a number of the}} creative people associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cast,</b> including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were alleged to be gay or bisexual. Scholars have identified a gay sensibility suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius (Thesiger) and his relationship with Henry Frankenstein (Clive).|$|E

5|$|Cucumber {{focuses on}} the life of the middle-aged Henry Best (Vincent Franklin) and the fallout from a {{disastrous}} date with his boyfriend of nine years, and is accompanied with Banana, an E4 anthology series featuring younger characters across the LGBT spectrum {{on the periphery of the}} Cucumber narrative, and Tofu, an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing modern sex, sexuality and issues arisen during the show <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> and public. The three names reference a urological scale categorising the male erection by hardness from tofu to cucumber, and are used to symbolise differences in sexual attitudes and behaviour between the two generations. Although Cucumber was designed as a self-contained serial focusing {{on the life of}} one man, Davies envisioned Banana as open-ended with the potential to continue after its sister series finished.|$|E
