5|$|Powered <b>winches</b> {{were used}} on cargo ships {{to speed the}} {{handling}} of heavy loads. One winch was operated {{at each of the}} ship's five cargo holds. During loading operations, the <b>winches</b> were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain operable. Winch brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch's main power was lostwere not often used by a skilled winch operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The <b>winches</b> on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.|$|E
5|$|Large hatches {{above the}} cargo holds allowed steam <b>winches</b> and booms rigged to three {{centerline}} masts to quickly load or unload cargo.|$|E
5|$|Tail lift or ramp – Ambulances can {{be fitted}} with a tail lift or ramp in order to {{facilitate}} loading a patient without having to undertake any lifting. This is especially important where the patient is obese or specialty care transports that require large, bulky equipment such as a neonatal incubator or hospital beds. There may also be equipment linked to this such as <b>winches</b> which are designed to pull heavy patients into the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Many M809 series were {{equipped}} with a front-mounted 20000 lb capacity <b>winch,</b> intended for self-recovery. A <b>winch</b> weighed 665 lb and added 15+1/2 in inches {{to the length of}} the truck. The M815 had a mid-mounted <b>winch</b> and the M816 had a rear-mounted 45,000 lb capacity <b>winch.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Winch</b> {{was the son}} of Onslow <b>Winch</b> of Everton, Huntingdonshire and {{grandson}} of Sir Humphry <b>Winch,</b> Lord Chief Justice of Ireland (died 1625). <b>Winch</b> purchased the Hawnes estate in Bedfordshire in 1654 and by 1659 had sold the manor of Everton which he had inherited from his father.|$|R

5|$|Modern {{furnaces}} {{are equipped}} {{with an array of}} supporting facilities to increase efficiency, such as ore storage yards where barges are unloaded. The raw materials are transferred to the stockhouse complex by ore bridges, or rail hoppers and ore transfer cars. Rail-mounted scale cars or computer controlled weight hoppers weigh out the various raw materials to yield the desired hot metal and slag chemistry. The raw materials are brought {{to the top of the}} blast furnace via a skip car powered by <b>winches</b> or conveyor belts.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the Navy set up twenty-one large <b>winches</b> on the island to turn the Oklahoma upright {{so it could be}} re-floated and patched before being scrapped. Coral was piled between the ship and the island so the ship would roll upright, instead of sliding toward the shore. Despite {{recovery}} efforts and patching, the Oklahoma sank during a mid-Pacific storm while it was being towed to the scrapyard. Nevada, California, West Virginia and the minelayer USS Oglala were re-floated and salvaged by the Navy. The entire salvage operation took 20,000 man-hours underwater and 5,000 dives to recover human remains, weapons, ammunition and artifacts of historic or military importance.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} soldiers mustered and awaited their officers' orders. Salmond ordered Colonel Seton to send men to {{the chain}} pumps; sixty were directed to this task, sixty more {{were assigned to the}} tackles of the lifeboats, and the rest were assembled on the poop deck in order to raise the forward part of the ship. The women and children were placed in the ship's cutter, which lay alongside. Two other boats were manned, but one was immediately swamped and the other could not be launched due to poor maintenance and paint on the <b>winches,</b> leaving only three boats available. The two large boats, with capacities of 150 men each, were not among them.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{research}} of resistance differences in <b>winching</b> of logs with their thicker or thinner end turned forward. <b>Winching</b> represents traction of wood assortments on the ground from the felling site to the forest vehicle equipped with a forest <b>winch.</b> The <b>winching</b> coefficient {{is determined by the}} horizontal tractive force and weight of the traction load. The research of resistance in <b>winching</b> wood assortments was carried out for the purpose of determining the size of the forest <b>winch</b> designed for equipping the prototype of the thinning tractor assembly (adapted farming tractor, forest semi-trailer and hydraulic crane) and developing an environmentally and economically viable technology for timber production. The research was carried out on flat forestland in a pedunculate oak stand by <b>winching</b> three logs of different weight. The research results have shown that the <b>winching</b> coefficients depend on the weight of logs, shape of log and their direction. Higher weight causes higher traction resistance. In all cases, the <b>winching</b> coefficients were higher in <b>winching</b> of logs with their thicker end turned forward. In order to achieve lower ground-based traction resistance and, at the same time, cause less damage to forest soil, <b>winching</b> of logs should be carried out with their thinner end turned forward...|$|R

40|$|<b>Winching</b> {{is among}} the most common logging {{techniques}} in small-scale forestry, but it is inefficient and hard on the operators. The authors conducted a comparative test to determine the benefits of introducing an auxiliary <b>winch</b> that automatically returned the <b>winch</b> cable to the loading site. Such device would make it unnecessary for a crew member to walk down to the <b>winch</b> and pull the cable back to the loading site. The tests were conducted in central Italy, on the Tuscan hills. The study involved six volunteers, who were meant to cover a wide range of age and physical fitness characteristics and were considered representative of the regional logging workforce. Physiological workload was determined by measuring the operators’ heart rate for a half-day individual work session. Performance was determined by stop-watching all <b>winching</b> cycles, with and without the auxiliary <b>winch.</b> The auxiliary <b>winch</b> improved the efficiency of downhill <b>winching,</b> allowing operation by two workers only, instead of three. <b>Winching</b> cost decreased between 20 and 35 %, while physiological workload decreased between 7 and 30 %, depending on the operator...|$|R
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the upheaval, the new Palladium had opened. The Senators, still coached by Allison, lost their opening game in the arena 3–0 to Montreal on January 17, 1996. The event was much more subdued than their franchise's first game. The Cup banners were raised, but the <b>winches</b> jammed, {{blocking}} the view of many fans. There were no entertainment big names, and only Firestone and Bryden participated in the ceremonial face-off. The club would lose its first four games at the Palladium, winning none for Allison, who was later fired on January 24 after the team lost 22 of 25 games. While Ottawa finished last in the League for the fourth year in a row, the 1995–96 season ended with renewed optimism, partly from the debut of new star Daniel Alfredsson, who won the Calder Trophy, the NHL rookie of the year award, the first Senator to do so. Alfredsson, selected 133rd overall in 1994, was also selected to play in the 1996 NHL All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|The {{converted}} carrier aircraft were heavier {{versions of}} their land-based predecessors and this required {{a host of}} changes to Graf Zeppelins original design: the existing catapults needed modernization; stronger <b>winches</b> were necessary for the arresting gear; the flight deck, elevators and hangar floors also required reinforcement. Changes in naval technology dictated other alterations as well: installation of air search radar sets and antennas; upgraded radio equipment; an armored fighter director cabin mounted on the main mast (which in turn meant a heavier, sturdier mast to accommodate the cabin's added weight); extra armoring for the bridge and fire control center; a new curved funnel cap to shield the fighter director cabin from smoke; replacing the single-mount 20mm AA guns with quadruple Flakvierling 38 guns (with a corresponding increase in ammunition supply) to improve overall AA defense; and additional bulges {{on either side of}} the hull to preserve the ship's stability under all this added weight.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Rider was MP for Maidstone in 1690 {{and from}} 1696 to 1698. He {{carried out a}} number of {{alterations}} to the house and its grounds between 1685 and 1690. Following his death in 1698, the estate was inherited by his son Sir Barnham Rider, MP for Maidstone from 1722 to 1727, and then his son, Thomas Rider. The second Thomas Rider left the house to his cousin Ingram Rider in 1786. In 1805, Ingram Rider left it to his son Thomas Rider, MP for Kent and West Kent from 1831 to 1835. The third Thomas Rider rebuilt parts of the house and extended and re-landscaped the park. On his death in 1847, he left the house to his nephew, also Thomas Rider, who let the house to a series of tenants. From 1903 to 1998, the house was occupied by the Winch family, firstly as leaseholders then, from 1960, as freeholders. The <b>Winches</b> sold the house in 1998; it remains in private ownership and belongs to the Kendrick family.|$|E

5|$|The rivers {{were run}} {{down by the}} 1920s and, with high {{unemployment}} in the area, West Ham Corporation and the Lee Conservancy Board applied for a government unemployment relief grant, with which to fund major improvements. In addition {{to work on the}} channels, Bow Tidal Lock was duplicated, Marshgate Lock was rebuilt further east as City Mill Lock, and a second new lock at Carpenters Road was constructed. It used up-and-over radial gates operated by <b>winches,</b> rather than the traditional mitre gates used at City Mill Lock. The gates were quadrant-shaped, and were raised out of the river to allow boats to enter or leave the lock. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1930 to authorise the work, called the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act, and work began the following year. The project was completed in 1935. Before the work, there had been a floodgate on the Waterworks River above its junction with the Three Mills Wall River, and a large pool, the City Mill Pool, connecting to the City Mills River and Saint Thomas Creek. Marshgate Lock was situated {{to the west of the}} junction between the Pudding Mill River and Saint Thomas Creek. It was originally built in 1864, by adding a second set of gates to Hunters Gates, a floodgate which had been built around 1847. The reconstructed lock was built on the site of the City Mill Pool, and had two sets of gates at its eastern end, to prevent high tidal levels in Waterworks River flooding the waterways to the west. It was labelled Marshgate Lane Lock on the 1948 map, but was called Ward Lock, after a local councillor, and is now known as City Mills Lock. The course of the Saint Thomas Creek was then straightened, and the original Marshgate Lock was bypassed. Pudding Mill River became a dead end when the lower section was filled in, as was most of the Three Mills Back River, and the floodgate on Waterworks River was also removed. Reconstruction of the channels included widening City Mill River to , while Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River were made twice that width.|$|E
