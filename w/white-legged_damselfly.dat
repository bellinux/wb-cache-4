50|$|The Platycnemididae are {{a family}} of damselflies.They are known {{commonly}} as <b>white-legged</b> <b>damselflies.</b> There are over 400 species native to the Old World. The family is divided into several subfamilies.|$|R
50|$|This former brickworks {{was opened}} {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century for the {{construction}} of the Grand Junction Canal, and is on its bank. There are diverse habitats with grassland, ponds, a reed bed and a redundant arm of the canal. Invertebrates include <b>white-legged</b> <b>damselflies</b> and there are a variety of small mammals which provide food for barn owls.|$|R

Notable birds include blackcaps, mute swans, kingfishers, goosanders and in summer, sand martins, whilst teal often over-winter here. There are also a great many insects, including the rare club-tailed dragonfly, banded demoiselle <b>damselflies</b> and <b>white-legged</b> <b>damselflies,</b> plus a range of butterflies, hoverflies and crickets.|$|R

50|$|The <b>white-legged</b> <b>{{damselfly}}</b> or blue featherleg (Platycnemis pennipes) is a damselfly of slow-flowing, muddy waters. It occurs {{from the}} Atlantic to Siberia {{and is often}} abundant throughout its range.|$|E
50|$|Birds include mallard, coot, red warbler and sedge warbler. Kingfisher {{are present}} and waders are {{reported}} such as redshank, common sandpiper and lapwing. Dragonflies are present including the relatively scarce hawker and <b>white-legged</b> <b>damselfly.</b>|$|E

50|$|The slow-moving Cornmill Stream and Old River Lea form a {{freshwater}} habitat {{with one of}} the most diverse invertebrate fauna in Essex. Eighteen species of dragonflies and damselflies have been recorded and includes the uncommon and nationally declining <b>white-legged</b> <b>damselfly.</b> The watercourses support a rich and varied aquatic and marginal flora and the site also includes rough grassland which provides feeding and breeding grounds for invertebrates and birds.|$|E
50|$|Samples of {{bottom fauna}} taken in 1998 {{documented}} {{the presence of}} nationally rare species of gastropods such as Hippeutis complanatus and bivalve swan mussel; and during the preceding decades two species of limnetic gastropods were documented. Larvae of <b>white-legged</b> <b>damselfly</b> and blue-tailed damselfly were recorded in summer 2000. Signal crayfish and trout have been introduced in the stream, of which the former succeeded in establishing while roach {{is believed to be}} unfavourable to the latter. The white water rapids make a section of the stream ice-free during the winter time which attracts white-throated dippers and common kingfishers. In 1996, traces of beaver were reported.|$|E
5000|$|The {{geographical}} distribution of {{many species of}} invertebrate in the river reflects the geology of the catchment area. Viviparid snails and water scorpions (of the genus Nepidae) are commonly found where the river runs over the London Clay. Crayfish are common in areas associated with high alkalinity particularly around Brockham and the tributaries which run over the Wealden Clay provide an excellent habitat for stoneflies, caddisflies, fast swimming mayflies and riffle beetles.The beautiful demoiselle (Calopteryx virgo) disappeared from the River Mole during the 1960s owing to deteriorating water quality, but has since recolonised.
