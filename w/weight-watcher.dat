This service aims at providing resource consumption measurements and estimations for software executing on resourceconstrained devices. By using the <b>Weight-Watcher,</b> software components can continuously adapt and optimize {{their quality of}} service with respect to resource availability. The interface of the service is composed of a Profiler and a Predictor. We present an implementation that is lightweight in terms of CPU and memory. We also performed various experiments that convey (a) the tradeoff between the memory consumption of the service and {{the accuracy of the}} prediction, as well as (b) a maximum overhead of 10 % on the execution speed of the VM for the Profiler to provide accurate measurements.

[...] Time Out noted: [...] "The <b>weight-watchers</b> script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that's enjoyably spicy but low on substance. So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time's left for analysis or characterization." [...] Producer Dino De Laurentiis was asked why some characters, notably Jack Crawford, were left out of the film: [...] "I think if you get a book which is 600 pages, you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages. In two hours of film, you cannot possibly include all the characters. We set ourselves a limit, and cut characters which weren't so vital." ...|$|R
