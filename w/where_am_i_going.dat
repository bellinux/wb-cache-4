I really wanted to create a young rock band - not a pop band - but a real rock band that had the same sensibility that rock from the 1960s and 1970s had to it. You know, something rocking from the heart and expressing something real. The question became: <b>where</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>going</b> to find these guys? So I thought maybe I could try out some music agencies or talent agencies and see what I could come with. I started to pursue that a little bit, but then I realized the only way that this is going to come about is if it comes about organically. It has to be real. I have to be able to vibe off those people and know those people when I see them."
