40|$|Background: Supporting {{the health}} and {{wellbeing}} of healthcare employees is a UK national priority. Aims: To design, deliver and evaluate an educational package to promote health and wellbeing for nurses and midwives Methods: An online training package was developed and administered in two ways: online (HAWN-online) or in a face-to-face workshop (HAWN-contact). A mixed- methods evaluation {{was used to assess}} usability and acceptability of HAWN training. Findings: 316 nurses, midwives and students completed the online training package. 16 participants attended the workshop. HAWN-online significantly increased knowledge in core areas of workplace health and <b>wellbeing.</b> <b>Nurses</b> and midwives valued online and face-to-face delivery but raised barriers to attendance at workshops. Participants advocated that training in workplace health should be mandatory for all frontline staff. Conclusions: Employers should take steps to promote staff wellbeing through HAWN training, and address barriers to accessing workplace health training or supportive services...|$|E
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} level of organizational-wide change (such as {{empowerment}} and downsizing) occurring within the Australian health care sector. However, there is a paucity of empirical evidence on how public and nonprofit sector nurses cope with these organizational-wide change initiatives and their consequences on individual and work outcomes. This will be the primary aim of the current paper. To this end, a path model is developed base on an integration of existing theoretical perspectives on occupational stress, change management, and person-organizational fit. Data were collected from 252 public and not-for-profit sector nurses. The path analysis suggests that public and nonprofit nurses experience positive and negative change initiatives. Negative change initiatives resulted {{in an increase in}} the level of administrative-related stressors. Nurses with more congruent values report less experience with administrative stressors. As nurses experienced more administrative stressors, they tend to report more job dissatisfaction. Nurses whose values were more congruent during organizational change reported higher level of psychological <b>wellbeing.</b> <b>Nurses</b> who were had higher level of psychological wellbeing were found to have higher job satisfaction, which subsequently led to a higher level of organizational commitment...|$|E
40|$|Background. Hope {{plays an}} {{integral}} role {{in health and}} illness and may assist individuals to cope in difficult and adverse circumstances, for instance when living with an illness such as {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), which can demand continuous adaptation. Aim. This paper reports the meaning of hope in people living with COPD as described by seven participants involved in a home-based pulmonary maintenance program. Methods. Using an interpretive phenomenological approach a purposive sample of seven participants were interviewed to understand participants' experiences of the phenomena of hope. An interpretative description is provided. Results. Thematic analysis revealed a number of themes, including that hope persists despite chronic illness and the unpredictable dilemmas of living with COPD. Many benefits were found to be gained from involvement in a home-based pulmonary maintenance program, including increasing exercise capacity, hope and wellbeing. Conclusion. Despite the limitations imposed by living with COPD participants revealed a determination to live as normal a life as possible. The pulmonary maintenance program was pivotal in assisting participants to improve exercise capacity, hope and <b>wellbeing.</b> <b>Nurses</b> may {{have a role to play}} in helping people with COPD maintain or regain hope.

40|$|<b>Wellbeing</b> of <b>nurses</b> is {{associated}} with patient aggression. Little {{is known about the}} differences in these associations between nurses working in different specialties. We aimed to estimate and compare the prevalence of patient aggression and the associations between patient aggression and the <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nurses</b> in psychiatric and non-psychiatric specialties (medical and surgical, and emergency medicine). A sample of 5288 nurses (923 psychiatric nurses, 4070 medical and surgical nurses, 295 emergency nurses) participated in the study. Subjective measures were used to assess both the occurrence of patient aggression and the <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nurses</b> (self-rated health, sleep disturbances, psychological distress and perceived work ability). Binary logistic regression with interaction terms was used to compare the associations between patient aggression and the <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nurses.</b> Psychiatric nurses reported all types of patient aggression more frequently than medical and surgical nurses, whereas nurses working in emergency settings reported physical violence and verbal aggression more frequently than psychiatric nurses. Psychiatric nurses reported poor self-rated health and reduced work ability more frequently than both of the non-psychiatric nursing groups, whereas medical and surgical nurses reported psychological distress and sleep disturbances more often. Psychiatric nurses who had experienced at least one type of patient aggression or mental abuse in the previous year, were less likely to suffer from psychological distress and sleep disturbances compared to medical and surgical nurses. Psychiatric nurses who had experienced physical assaults and armed threats were less likely to suffer from sleep disturbances compared to nurses working in emergency settings. Compared to medical and surgical nurses, psychiatric nurses face patient aggression more often, but certain types of aggression are more common in emergency settings. Psychiatric nurses have worse subjective health and work ability than both of the non-psychiatric nursing groups, while their psychiatric wellbeing is better and they have less sleep problems compared to medical and surgical nurses. Psychiatric nurses maintain better psychiatric wellbeing and experience fewer sleep problems than non-psychiatric nurses after events of exposure to patient aggression. This suggest that more attention should be given to non-psychiatric settings for maintaining the <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nurses</b> after exposure to patient aggression...|$|R

40|$|MCur, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Infant care is an {{essential}} part of the healthcare industry and an aspect of healthcare where the multi-disciplinary teams work closely together. Within this collaboration of teams, the term "infant wellbeing" is frequently used. Yet even though wellbeing on its own is a multi-faceted concept, when pertaining to the infant, this concept can become very complex and difficult to understand and apply. Dictionary definitions of wellbeing emphasize a state of being healthy, happy or prosperous. However, despite its common-sense appeal, it was found that the term wellbeing is not a particularly well- defined outcome, especially in reference to the infant. Despite the fact that scrutiny of the literature indicated that the term "infant wellbeing" is used by different members of the multi-disciplinary team, a clear concise universal definition for healthcare settings and professionals is missing from published literature. In fact, no recorded definition for the concept was to be found. Consequently, the aim of this study was to develop an operational definition for the concept "infant wellbeing" that can be used congruently between different members of the multi-disciplinary team. This is done by means of a concept analysis as described by Walker and Avant (2014). The findings revealed that the infant consists of certain dimensions which all play a role in the infant's wellbeing. Equally the infant also functions within a certain system or domain which also affects the wellbeing of the infant. These aspects are discussed in detail. By having a specific general description of infant <b>wellbeing,</b> <b>nurses</b> and other members of the multi-disciplinary team will have a common understanding of what the concept entails which also assists in the development of standardized language within the healthcare profession.

40|$|This Grounded Theory study {{developed}} a substantive theory {{to explore and}} explain the experienced nurse’s perspective of maintaining emotional wellbeing in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Data were collected by recorded interviews of 15 experienced ICU registered nurses from an ICU of a metropolitan hospital in Perth, Western Australia. Emotional wellbeing was described by the participants as feelings of satisfaction and happiness, derived from the delivery of best care to patients and their families. This formed {{the context of the}} study. The core problem shared by ICU nurses was the Inability to Protect Self from Distress. Distress was described as feelings of grief, sadness, frustration and anger in response to caring for patients who were critically ill, and their families. Conditions were also identified that impacted the nurse's ability to protect self from distress: Best care; Autonomy; Teamwork; and Previous nursing and life experience. The Basic Social and Psychological Process used by nurses to protect themselves from distress, and therefore maintain their emotional wellbeing was called Protecting Self from Distress. The process was described under three phases: Delivering best care, Validating care episodes, and Distancing self from distress. The process described how nurses protected self from distress, including strategies to overcome or promote the conditions that impacted nurse <b>wellbeing.</b> <b>Nurses</b> maintain their emotional wellbeing through the delivery of best care. Best care referred to giving the best care possible given the nature of critical illness and limitations of critical care. Understanding the conditions that impacted nurse wellbeing provides valuable insight into factors that help or hinder the delivery of best care. The substantive theory outlined processes that enabled nurses to maintain their emotional wellbeing and succeed in providing best care to patients and families in the ICU. Minimising threats to the delivery of best care will promote nurse satisfaction, happiness, enhance wellbeing and may contribute to higher retention rates. The satisfaction and happiness enjoyed by nurses was found to be the reason the group in this study remained nursing in ICU...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Intense and long-standing {{problems}} in burn centers in Tehran have led nurses to burnout. This phenomenon has provoked serious responses and {{has put the}} nurses, patients and the organization under pressure. The challenge for managers and nurse executives is to understand the factors which would reduce or increase the nurses' responses to burnout and develop delivery systems that promote positive adaptation and facilitate quality care. This study, {{as a part of}} more extensive research, aims to explore and describe the nurses' perceptions of the factors affecting their responses to burnout. Methods Grounded theory was used as the method. Thirty- eight participants were recruited. Data were generated by unstructured interviews and 21 sessions of participant observations. Constant comparison was used for data analysis. Results Nurses' and patients' personal characteristics and social support influenced nurses' responses to burnout. Personal characteristics of the nurses and patients, especially when interacting, had a more powerful effect. They altered emotional, attitudinal, behavioral and organizational responses to burnout and determined the kind of caring behavior. Social support had a palliative effect and altered emotional responses and some aspects of attitudinal responses. Conclusions The powerful effect of positive personal characteristics and its sensitivity to long standing and intense organizational pressures suggests approaches to executing stress reduction programs and refreshing the nurses' morale by giving more importance to ethical aspects of caring. Moreover, regarding palliative effect of social support and its importance for the nurses' <b>wellbeing,</b> <b>nurse</b> executives are responsible for promoting a work environment that supports nurses and motivates them. </p...|$|R

40|$|The article {{reports on}} {{selected}} {{findings of a}} research study concerning emotional <b>wellbeing</b> and professional <b>nursing</b> practice(Rose 2002). It highlights the relationship between community mental health nurses' and emotional wellbeing, and their capacity to provide satisfying professional nursing practice (Rose 2002). The notion of emotional wellbeing, factors that impacted upon the participants' emotional wellbeing, {{and the relationship of}} emotional wellbeing to professional practice were revealed in the study. These findings were based on a qualitative critical feminist research inquiry and specifically, interviews with five women community mental health nurses in Australia. Whilst complex, emotional wellbeing was found to be both implicitly and explicitly linked to the participants intertwined personal and professional experiences. Four key components were identified: the nebulous notion; the stress relationship; the mind, body, spirit connection; and, inner sense of balance. In terms of emotional wellbeing and professional practice, three themes were revealed. These were: being able to speak out (or not); being autonomous(or not) and being satisfied (or not). The authors argue that the emotional <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nurses</b> working in community mental health settings is critical to satisfying professional practice. Furthermore nursing work involves emotional work which impacts on one’s emotional wellbeing and emotional wellbeing is integrally linked to professional practice. It is recommended that health organisationsmust be pro-active in addressing the emotional needs of nurses to ensure the delivery of health care that is aligned to professional practice. This approach will ensure nurses will feel more recognised and validated in terms of their nursing practice. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{current and}} {{estimated}} future shortage of nurses presents {{a threat to}} the health of both nursing professionals and those in their care. Stress and burnout are contributors to turnover among nurses and needs to be addressed. Story as a potential self-care strategy has the potential to promote health and <b>wellbeing</b> among <b>nurses,</b> which may increase satisfaction among nurses and decrease turnover in the profession. This study used a qualitative descriptive design with content analysis to: 1) describe the use of story and story sharing/telling in nursing practice, and 2) describe how story contributes to the nursing workplace. Findings revealed that stories are inherent in the practice of professional nursing. Nurses share a common bond and connection through sharing stories about the nursing profession. This connection spans generations, care settings, specialty, levels of education, training and experience. Nurses also use story as a way of remembering and processing information and to teach and mentor each other through the experiences they encounter in work settings. This sharing on the job and outside of work settings is more memorable and valuable to nurses than what they learn in the classroom or through textbooks and case study presentations. Story creates ease for nurses through validation of shared human experience. When an individual feels heard both the storyteller and listener benefit from the understanding that is gained from the exchange. The greatest barrier to this exchange within nursing practice is time. Nurses {{believe that there is a}} limited amount of time due to the complexity of the work environment, demands on their time, and the structure of the healthcare system. This study provided empirical findings for what has been theorized with respect to story and nursing. Nurses use story in their daily work and personal lives.

40|$|Quality of {{life and}} <b>wellbeing</b> in <b>nursing</b> homes are {{becoming}} more important in research and practice. One of the main influences on residents' wellbeing is the interaction with their professional care-givers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore to what extent care-givers support the residents' needs of relatedness, autonomy and competence, and how this need support is related to wellbeing. Residents and their professional care-givers of four nursing homes in the Netherlands participated in an observational and questionnaire study. Three video-observations of each resident (with different care-givers) were made during morning care. Additional data were collected by means of questionnaires. The results show that the needs of residents were, on average, moderately fulfilled during care interactions. More need support by care-givers was related to higher resident wellbeing. Care-givers provided more need support to residents with stronger functional impairments. More need support was provided by higher-educated care-givers and care-givers in higher job functions. The results show the importance of need support for situational wellbeing, but the contribution to the general subjective wellbeing of residents remains unclear.

Qualitative descriptive and explorative research was conducted to explore the experiences of student caring for mental health care users with profound intellectual disabilities and to recommend the best practices in caring for mental health care users with profound intellectual disabilities. Data collection was done using reflective diaries and in depth interviews. Twelve participants participated in the study. The study composed of student nurses (n= 12) caring for mental health care users with profound intellectual disabilities. Five themes emerged from the study i. e. emotionally challenging, communication difficulties, lack of knowledge on the nature of intellectual disability, burden of care and mixed feelings. Findings of the study revealed that completing nurses find working with profound intellectual disabilities to be emotionally challenging and that negative experiences outweigh the positive experiences, resulting in their reluctance to want to work with profound intellectual disability users.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{learning environment}} {{is an important}} component in the educational development of a student nurse. Nursing students have identified the clinical experience {{as one of the most}} stress producing components of their nursing education. Past research has shown high levels of stress can lead to decreased learning, affect clinical performance, increase clinical errors, and threaten physical or psychiatric <b>wellbeing.</b> <b>Nurse</b> educators 2 ̆ 7 primary responsibilities are to help students effectively cope with their initial stress and facilitate student learning by applying the knowledge they gain in the classroom to the clinical environment. To allow students the opportunity to integrate theory into practice, the use of high-fidelity human patient simulation is becoming more widely accepted in nursing education as an instructional methodology. This study demonstrated a relationship between the use of high-fidelity human patient simulation and the reduction of stress levels in novice nursing students that has not been previously reported in the literature. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of high-fidelity human patient simulation on the stress levels of associate degree novice nursing students prior to their first clinical experience. Fifty-five associate degree nursing students from one technical college tested the hypothesis that novice nursing students who receive practice on a high-fidelity simulator prior to their first clinical day will experience less stress and increased client system stability than those novice student nurses who do not. This study used a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest comparison group research design to examine self-reported stress levels on the Student Stress and Coping Inventory Clinical Experiences subscale (SSCI). Control group participants attended two days of clinical in a skilled nursing facility on a long-term care unit. Intervention group participants attended a simulated clinical experience with a high-fidelity human patient simulator followed by a clinical day the same skilled nursing facility as the control participants.

40|$|Workplace Violence (WPV) is an all-encompassing {{term used}} to {{describe}} abusive behaviours directed at another {{with the intent to}} cause harm. Although the definition varies according to situations and practice settings, there is agreement that WPV has a negative impact on the health and <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nurses</b> and the delivery of quality nursing care (Choiniere, MacDonnell, 2 ̆ 6 Shamonda, 2010; Higgins 2 ̆ 6 MacIntosh, 2010; Registered Nurses Association of Ontario [RNAO], 2008; Hsinag-Chu 2 ̆ 6 Lee, 2011; Vessey, DeMarco, Gaffney, 2 ̆ 6 Budin, 2009). The growing epidemic of violence in the workplace is of great concern for employees, employers and government agencies and is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Council of Nurses (ICN) as a major health priority (Hinchberger, 2009). WPV occurs between nurses, between nurses and physicians and between nurses and patients and their families. In order to implement effective strategies aimed at diminishing WPV an investigation of the multi-layered risk factors must first be explored.

Design/methodology/approach – Quantitative data were collected from 550 public hospital nurses in North-Eastern Brazil. Path and multivariate analysis were used to test the hypotheses. Findings – The findings demonstrate that the impact of the independent variables on affective commitment was statistically significant but low. The impact of NPM factors such as contracting out and multiple job-holding was a major influence on affective commitment and work-life interface across generational cohorts. The analysis revealed significant differences between generational cohorts and suggested that affective commitment may well be enhanced by improving the quality of the work-life interface and consequently, the <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nurses.</b> Research limitations/implications – This study is confined to the Northeast of Brazil and confined to public sector hospitals.

40|$|Background: Nurses {{are often}} {{involved}} in end-of-life decision making as they {{play an important}} role in caring for terminally ill patients. Aim: To investigate nurses’ attitudes towards their involvement in end-of-life decisions with a possible lifeshortening effect, and a possible relationship with sociodemographic characteristics and work-related factors. Methods: A representative sample of 903 nurses in the Netherlands received a written structured questionnaire about experiences with medical end-of-life decisions, and the extent to which they agreed with statements about attitudes towards and their role in medical end-of-life decisions on a 5 -point scale. Logistic regression models were fitted for each statement to determine the relation between nurses’ attitudes and socio-demographic and work-related characteristics. Results: The response rate was 66 percent. Most nurses, especially highly educated nurses, nurses working in a hospital, and nurses who had experience with or had received training on end-of-life decisions, agreed that patients talk rather to a nurse about end-of-life decisions than to a physician (64 %). In particular highly educated and female nurses, believed that they are in a better position to assess patients’ wishes than physicians are (38 %). Most nurses, especially those working in a hospital and nursing home agreed that they should be involved in the whole process of end-of-life decisions (74 %), and in decisions to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment (58 %). Though the core value of nursing is the patient’s <b>wellbeing</b> most <b>nurses</b> believed that nursing may also include decisions with a possible life shortening (71 %).

40|$|Background: Healthcare organisations are {{increasingly}} recognising {{their responsibility to}} support the <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nurses</b> {{as a result of}} the accumulative demands of their role. Resilience-based clinical supervision is a newly developed intervention that encourages practitioners to pay attention and apply reasoning to behaviours and responses to emotive scenarios through a process of stress alleviation and prevention. Aims: To evaluate an intervention aimed at supporting pre-registration nursing students to develop resilience-based competencies that enable them to regulate their response to stress and monitor their own wellbeing using mindfulness, reflective discussion and positive reframing. Method: Case study methodology was used to explore how the characteristics associated with the expression and maintenance of resilience have been influenced by the intervention. Data were collected through focus groups at three timepoints with students and at the end of the intervention period with supervision facilitators, and then analysed by pattern matching to theoretical propositions. Findings: Participants expressed positive experiences of resilience-based clinical supervision. Their perception of the importance of self-care increased and their commitment to caring for others was maintained. They continued to demonstrate competencies of self-care six months after qualifying as nurses, despite the complexities of the workplace. As qualified nurses, participants recognised the implications of limited time and resources on the quality of care they were able to provide to patients, but they externalised this as organisational failings as opposed to personal inadequacy, and worked around such constraints where possible to maintain personal standards. Conclusion: Resilience-based clinical supervision has the potential to support healthcare practitioners in developing resilience-based competencies that allow them to recognise and attend to workplace stressors through appropriate and effective alleviation strategies. Implications for practice: There is potential to foster resilience where practitioners and healthcare organisations commit to a sustained investment in strategies that promote reflection and self-care...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{challenges}} {{of caring for}} people living with HIV (PLWH) in a low-resource setting has had {{a negative impact on}} the nursing profession, resulting in a shortage of skilled nurses. In response to this shortage and perceived negative impact, we conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study to describe the level of knowledge and psychosocial <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nurses</b> caring for PLWH at a regional hospital in Limpopo Province, South Africa. A total of 233 nurses, the majority being female, participated and were stratified into professional nurses (n =  108), enrolled nurses (n =  58) and enrolled nursing auxiliaries (n =  66). Data were collected using HIV/AIDS knowledge questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Inventory; AIDS Impact Scale and Beck's Depression Inventory. The total knowledge score obtained by all the participants ranged from 2 to 16, with an average of 12. 93 (SD =  1. 92) on HIV/AIDS knowledge. Depersonalization (D) (83. 7 %) and emotional exhaustion (EE) (53. 2 %) were reported among participating nurses caring for PLWH. Burnout was higher among professional nurses as compared to both enrolled nurses and enrolled nursing auxiliaries. There was a moderate negative significant correlation between HIV knowledge with the nurses' emotional exhaustion (r = − 0. 592), depression (r = − 0. 584) and stigma and discrimination (r = − 0. 637). A moderate to high level of burnout was evident among all levels of nurses. These findings lead to the recommendations for support of nurses caring for PLWH that include structured nursing educational support, organisational support with respect to employee wellness programmes that address depression and work burnout, as well as social support. The provision of these support mechanisms has the potential of creating a positive practice environment for nurses in the Vhembe District of the Limpopo Province in particular, and South Africa in general, and in improved care for PLWH...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study investigating stress among nurses in the Jalgaon district of North Maharashtra region. A specific measure of stress was developed following in-depth interviews questionnaire with primary care professionals i. e. nurses. A total of 360 nurses took part in the study. The major sources of stress isolated by the nurses related to: time pressure, administrative responsibility, having too much to do, Factor analysis of stress questionnaire responses identified five major factors: demands of the job and lack of communication, working environment, communication with patients, work/home interface and social life, and career development. The highest levels of satisfaction were reported for the amount of variety in their job and the lowest level of job satisfaction was reported for chance of promotion. The results revealed that the mental <b>wellbeing</b> of the <b>nurses</b> was higher than that of the other population groups. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed three major stressors that were predictive of high levels of job dissatisfaction demands of the job and lack of communication, working environment, and career development. The implications of the findings for further research are considered. Introduction Sampl...|$|R
40|$|Nurses are {{the largest}} group of {{healthcare}} providers in South Africa. The personal cost of caring is an important concern for nurses as they have one-on-one contact with terminally-ill patients. This contact could affect their psychological and emotional well-being. There are few studies on the psychological and emotional well-being of nurses working in palliative care in South Africa. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the emotional well-being of nurses providing palliative care in Johannesburg. The study compared the emotional <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nurses</b> working in palliative care and nurses providing general health care. This was achieved by focusing primarily on levels of secondary traumatic stress, empathy, emotional exhaustion, affective commitment, continuance commitment, and sense of coherence. Data were gathered from a sample consisting of 67 nurses; 32 nurses offering palliative care and 35 nurses offering general care. The instruments used to assess emotional well-being were: Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale, Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Maslach Burnout Inventory (Emotional exhaustion subscale), Affective commitment scale, Continuance commitment scale, and Orientation to Life Questionnaire. Data were analysed using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test. The results showed that there were no significant differences in levels of secondary traumatic stress, empathy, emotional exhaustion, continuance commitment, and sense of coherence between palliative care and general care nurses. However, there was a significant difference in levels of affective commitment between the two groups of nurses. Additional analyses were run to establish whether there was a relationship between organisational commitment and age. Pearson Product Moment Correlation was used to determine the relationship between two variables, age and affective commitment, and age and continuance commitment. The results showed that there was no relationship between age and affective commitment. However, the correlational analysis showed that there was a significant relationship between age and continuance commitment. The findings of this study suggest the need for management of health organisations to invest in the well-being of their nurses. Directions for future research among nurses could focus on improving the psychological and emotional well-being of nurses in South African hospitals...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{literature}} suggests that person-centred care can contribute to {{quality of life and}} <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nursing</b> home residents, relatives and staff. However, there is sparse research evidence on how person-centred care can be operationalised and implemented in practice, {{and the extent to which}} it may promote wellbeing and satisfaction. Therefore, the U-Age nursing home study was initiated to deepen the understanding of how to integrate person-centred care into daily practice and to explore the effects and meanings of this. Methods The study aims to evaluate effects and meanings of a person-centred and thriving-promoting intervention in nursing homes through a multi-centre, non-equivalent controlled group before-after trial design. Three nursing homes across three international sites have been allocated to a person-centred and thriving-promoting intervention group, and three nursing homes have been allocated to an inert control group. Staff at intervention sites will participate in a 12 -month interactive educational programme that operationalises thriving-promoting and person-centred care three dimensions: 1) Doing a little extra, 2) Developing a caring environment, and 3) Assessing and meeting highly prioritised psychosocial needs. A pedagogical framework will guide the intervention. The primary study endpoints are; residents’ thriving, relatives’ satisfaction with care and staff job satisfaction. Secondary endpoints are; resident, relative and staff experiences of the caring environment, relatives’ experience of visiting their relative and the nursing home, as well as staff stress of conscience and perceived person-centredness of care. Data on study endpoints will be collected pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at a six-month follow up. Interviews will be conducted with relatives and staff to explore experiences and meanings of the intervention. Discussion The study is expected to provide evidence that can inform further research, policy and practice development on if and how person-centred care may improve wellbeing, thriving and satisfaction for people who reside in, visit or work in nursing homes. The combination of quantitative and qualitative data will illuminate the operationalisation, effects and meaning of person-centred and thriving-promoting care.

40|$|Background: Compassion {{fatigue and}} burnout can impact on {{performance}} of nurses. This paper explores {{the relationship between}} self-compassion, self-judgement, self-kindness, compassion, professional quality of life, and <b>wellbeing</b> among community <b>nurses.</b> Aim: To measure associations between self-compassion, compassion fatigue, wellbeing, and burnout in community nurses. Method: Quantitative data were collected using standardised psychometric questionnaires: (1) Professional Quality of Life Scale; (2) Self-Compassion Scale; (3) short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale; (4) Compassion For Others Scale, used to measure relationships between self-compassion, compassion fatigue, wellbeing, and burnout. Participants: A cross sectional sample of registered community nurses (n= 37) studying for a postgraduate diploma at a University in the North of England took part in this study. Results: Results show that community nurses who score high on measures of self-compassion and wellbeing, also report less burnout. Greater compassion satisfaction was also positively associated with compassion for others, and wellbeing, whilst also being negatively correlated with burnout. Conclusion: High levels of self-compassion were linked {{with lower levels of}} burnout. Furthermore when community nurses have greater compassion satisfaction they also report more compassion for others, increased wellbeing, and less burnout. The implications of this are discussed alongside suggestions for the promotion of greater compassion.

40|$|Aim: To analyse nursing {{turnover}} intention {{from the}} unit by using multilevel approach, examining {{at the individual}} level, the relationships between job characteristics, job satisfaction and turnover intention, and at the group level the role of leader-member exchange. Background: Research on nursing turnover has given {{little attention to the}} effects of multilevel factors. Method: Aggregated data of 935 nurses nested within 74 teams of four Italian hospitals were collected in 2009 via a self-administered questionnaire. Results: Hierarchical linear modelling showed that job satisfaction mediated the relationship between job characteristics and intention to leave at the individual level. At the unit level, leader-member exchange was directly linked to intention to leave. Furthermore, cross-level interaction revealed that leader-member exchange moderated the relationship between job characteristics and job satisfaction. Conclusion: This study supported previous research in single-level turnover studies concerning the key role of job satisfaction, providing evidence that job characteristics are important in creating motivating and satisfying jobs. At the unit-level, leader-member exchange offers an approach to understand the role of unit-specific conditions created by leaders on nurses 2 ̆ 7 workplace <b>wellbeing.</b> Implications for <b>nursing</b> management: This study showed that it is important for nursing managers to recognise the relevance of implementing management practices that foster healthy workplaces centred on high-quality nurse-supervisor relationships...|$|R

40|$|Background Dry skin or xerosis is {{a common}} problem in elderly, {{therefore}} skin care {{is essential to the}} <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nursing</b> home residents. Traditional washing with water and soap is still standard of care, but increasingly replaced by disposable wash gloves with cleansing lotion. However, {{there is a lack of}} evidence on the effect of disposable wash gloves on skin hydration. Aims and objectives The objective of this study was to compare the effect of two washing methods (traditional versus disposable bed bath) on skin hydration at stratum cornea level in nursing home residents. Method We’ve conducted an interventional study in which 145 residents from two nursing homes were divided into two groups: 40 residents received the traditional washing method (control group), while disposable wash gloves were provided to 105 residents (intervention group). Skin hydration was measured using a MoistureMeter SC at three skin sites (cheek, hand and lower leg) and two time points (before and after 12 weeks of implementation). Residents characteristics, bath practices as well as environmental influences were recorded. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of AZ Sint-Niklaas hospital (Belgium, EC 14045). After an information session, residents or their legal representatives provided written informed consent. Results The mean age of the residents was 85. 5 years. No differences were observed in personal characteristics between both groups. Significantly more residents in the control group had a weekly bath and used liquid soap. The mean room temperature was significantly higher in the control group, while humidity was lower. Total skin hydration did not differ between residents at the start of the study in both groups (p= 0, 213). After implementation, hydration in the intervention group was significantly higher at all skin sites and total skin (p< 0, 001). In both groups the percentage of residents with dry skin at the legs decreased, but this was higher in the control (14 %) versus intervention group (9 %) (p< 0. 05). Conclusion The use of disposable wash gloves in nursing homes can improve quality of care, thereby reducing the risk of dry skin. However, additional skincare and hydration of the legs still needs attention. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of an {{enduring}} shortage of nurses, this study explores the career pathways and experiences of immigrant and Canadian-born nurses in two Ontario cities utilizing a qualitative research design consisting of 70 in-depth interviews. Differences in career entry and experiences of workplace conflict across immigration status and race are explored. First, I explore successful immigrants’ pathways into the nursing profession and their social and economic integration into the Canadian economy in light of the traditional assimilation and segmented assimilation theories. The study reveals distinct career pathways taken by foreign-born nurses and Canadian born nurses. While Canadian-born nurses have a shorter and a more direct pathway into nursing, foreign-born nurses, especially IENs and visible minority nurses, face more complex systemic and multidimensional challenges in transitioning into the profession. I conclude from this study that the segmented assimilation theory cannot accurately capture immigrants’ experiences in nursing as it {{does not take into account}} the conditions of the labour market. Second, I examine nurses’ conflicts with patients and family members/friends, the sources of the conflicts, the role of racial status, and the coping mechanisms used. I find that racial status influences the experience of conflicts at the workplace. Visible minority nurses experience verbally aggressive behaviours more frequently relative to White nurses. This, I find impedes their integration in the nursing profession. Third, I examine conflicts amongst nurses and the implications of intra-professional conflict for the nursing profession. The findings show that conflicts centre on workloads and tasks, as well as race and age. The study reveals evidence of White nurses engaging in social closure, sometimes excluding and marginalizing visible minority nurses. Nonetheless, I find the response of visible minority nurses’ foster professional unity and not division. This study calls for skilled immigrants seeking nursing integration to be provided with adequate information on the requirements and necessary credentials needed for their professional integration before migration and upon professional entry. Also, the removal of factors that create toxic work environments and reproduce workplace inequality are pertinent in promoting the <b>wellbeing</b> of <b>nurses,</b> their professional integration, and quality healthcare...|$|R
