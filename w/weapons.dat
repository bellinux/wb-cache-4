5|$|As {{a result}} of these negotiations, in September 2013 Syria joined the Chemical <b>Weapons</b> Convention (formally acceding on 14 October), and agreed to the {{destruction}} of its chemical <b>weapons,</b> {{under the supervision of the}} Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical <b>Weapons,</b> as required by the Convention.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} throughout the game, two additional ships become available for use. Each of the game's three ships offers a different balance of speed, <b>weapons,</b> and maneuverability. Within the levels, the player may collect power-ups that enhance the ship's weaponry. <b>Weapons</b> are categorized into three different types: primary <b>weapons,</b> secondary <b>weapons,</b> and countermeasures. Primary <b>weapons</b> {{range from a}} variety of laser <b>weapons</b> to the Plasma Cannon and the Napalm Cannon, which projects a stream of burning fuel. Secondary <b>weapons</b> include different types of missiles, while countermeasures range from proximity mines to portable turrets. Most primary <b>weapons</b> consume energy in different rate, but some, such as the Napalm Cannon, use their own type of ammunition. In contrast, all secondary <b>weapons</b> and countermeasures require their own ammunition suppliers.|$|E
5|$|Axis forces {{employed}} {{biological and}} chemical <b>weapons.</b> The Imperial Japanese Army {{used a variety of}} such <b>weapons</b> during its invasion and occupation of China (see Unit 731) and in early conflicts against the Soviets. Both the Germans and Japanese tested such <b>weapons</b> against civilians and, sometimes on prisoners of war.|$|E
50|$|Soldier Blade's <b>weapon</b> {{system was}} {{unique in that}} every <b>weapon</b> the player would pick up, the {{previous}} <b>weapon</b> would be stocked as a Special <b>Weapon.</b> The Special <b>Weapon</b> attack was different depending on the particular <b>weapon.</b> The Red <b>Weapon</b> Special would make the ship's robot temporarily invulnerable, the Green <b>Weapon</b> Special would send out a homing energy blast while the Blue <b>Weapon</b> Special unleashed an enormous laser beam. Collecting a <b>Weapon</b> pick-up of the same color once the <b>weapon</b> in-use was fully upgraded results in a large explosion that clears the screen of smaller enemies and attacks.|$|R
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} replacement for the coaxial <b>weapon</b> in the American M60 tank. The <b>weapon</b> was evaluated by both the US Army and the US Naval <b>weapon</b> center, who reported that the performance of the <b>weapon</b> was outstanding during all phases of testing. However, neither chose to adopt the <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Weapon</b> rules: Before {{a player}} can fire a <b>weapon,</b> they must {{determine}} if the <b>weapon</b> is capable of being fired. A hero or warrior must be within two inches of a <b>weapon</b> to fire it. They can not be behind the <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
5|$|Deus Ex {{features}} twenty-four <b>weapons,</b> {{ranging from}} crowbars, electroshock <b>weapons,</b> and riot baton, to laser guided anti-tank rockets and assault rifles; both lethal and non-lethal <b>weapons</b> are available. The player {{can also make}} use of several <b>weapons</b> of opportunity, such as fire extinguishers.|$|E
5|$|East Timor {{ratified}} the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Biological and Toxin <b>Weapons</b> Convention and Chemical <b>Weapons</b> Convention in 2003. The East Timorese Government {{has no plans}} to acquire nuclear, biological or chemical <b>weapons.</b> The country also became a party to the Ottawa Treaty, which bans anti-personnel mines, in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In February 1994 (when {{air strikes}} were {{originally}} threatened), NATO {{had created a}} heavy <b>weapons</b> exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and collected <b>weapons</b> {{at a number of}} sites. On 5 August, the VRS seized several <b>weapons</b> from the Illidža <b>Weapons</b> Collection site in clear violation of the exclusion zone agreement. During the seizure, Serb forces injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response to the attack, the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, and the Serbs returned the seized <b>weapons</b> to the collection site.|$|E

5|$|In January 2013, a <b>weapons</b> convoy {{carrying}} SA-17 anti-aircraft {{missiles to}} Hezbollah was destroyed allegedly by the Israeli Air Force. A nearby research center for chemical <b>weapons</b> was also damaged. A similar attack on <b>weapons</b> destined for Hezbollah occurred in May {{of the same}} year.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the game}} {{features}} {{a variety of}} <b>weapons</b> which can be utilised to destroy other opponents or for self-defence. Offensive <b>weapons</b> include rockets, plasma bolts, missiles, and grenades, whilst defensive <b>weapons</b> range from deployable mines to energy shields. Every ship is also equipped with a standard energy shield which will protect the player from damage caused by collisions or <b>weapons</b> fire. If a shield runs out, the ship will explode and the player in question will be eliminated from the race.|$|E
5|$|Iridion 3D {{features}} five {{types of}} <b>weapons,</b> with {{three levels of}} power each. Players boost weapon power by collecting powerups of the color that matches the current weapon. Collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type. If the player's ship is destroyed the power level of the weapon is reduced by one. Each weapon has advantages and disadvantages. The player starts with the red weapon, which is relatively weak but fires rapidly in a large spread. Green <b>weapons</b> are inaccurate but fill the screen with shots. Purple <b>weapons</b> spin in a counterclockwise motion slowly and are fairly strong. Yellow torpedo-like <b>weapons</b> are very powerful but powerups are rare and the weapon fires slowly. Blue <b>weapons,</b> a more powerful version of Yellow <b>weapons,</b> are found only on the last level. Flashing powerups restore the craft's shields.|$|E

5000|$|A ranged <b>weapon</b> is any <b>weapon</b> {{that can}} harm targets at {{distances}} greater than hand-to-hand distance. In contrast, a <b>weapon</b> {{intended to be}} used in hand-to-hand combat is called a melee <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
50|$|L (Laser) - This <b>weapon</b> {{is similar}} to the blue laser <b>weapon</b> in the {{original}} Raiden series. The <b>weapon</b> has no defensive spread. However, the laser is the most damaging secondary <b>weapon</b> available. It can make short work of large enemies and bosses. Ship's <b>weapon</b> module flashes blue.|$|R
5|$|On July 7, 2017, Switzerland {{voted in}} favor of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear <b>Weapons,</b> the first such {{international}} treaty to ban nuclear <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, after the signing, Syria {{announced}} that it was acceding to the Chemical <b>Weapons</b> Convention (provisionally applying it directly, but formally taking effect 14 October 2013), and in doing so becoming a member of the OPCW. This committed Syria not to use chemical <b>weapons,</b> to destroy its chemical <b>weapons</b> within 10 years, and to convert or destroy all of its chemical <b>weapons</b> production facilities.|$|E
5|$|Some LARP rules {{call for}} the use of {{simulated}} <b>weapons</b> such as foam <b>weapons</b> or airsoft guns to determine whether characters succeed in hitting one another in combat situations. In Russian LARP events, <b>weapons</b> made of hard plastic, metal or wood are used. The alternative to using simulated <b>weapons</b> is to pause role-play and determine the outcome of an action symbolically, for example by rolling dice, playing rock-paper-scissors or comparing character attributes.|$|E
5000|$|A device {{included}} in or {{attached to a}} nuclear <b>weapon</b> system to preclude arming and/or launching until the insertion of a prescribed discrete code or combination. It may include equipment and cabling external to the <b>weapon</b> or <b>weapon</b> system to activate components within the <b>weapon</b> or <b>weapon</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>weapon</b> {{also has}} a score akin to hit points, called duration. Each attack will {{decrease}} {{the duration of the}} <b>weapon</b> very slightly. If duration of a <b>weapon</b> hits zero, the <b>weapon</b> will break and will no longer be usable. When a <b>weapon</b> breaks, it leaves behind a <b>weapon</b> shard and cannot be restored. Duration is refilled after every battle. The rate which a weapon's duration decreases is inversely proportional to the weapon's TEC score. TEC can be increased by fighting with the <b>weapon</b> more often.|$|R

5|$|Switzerland did {{not possess}} {{biological}} <b>weapons</b> nor chemical <b>weapons,</b> {{nor did they}} see it as in their interest to acquire them. Thus the banning of such <b>weapons</b> was in the country's interest. Switzerland signed the Biological <b>Weapons</b> Convention in April 1972 and ratified the treaty in 1976 with three reservations. The country also signed the Chemical <b>Weapons</b> Convention in January 1993 and ratified it in March 1995.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland made {{detailed}} {{plans to}} acquire and test nuclear <b>weapons</b> during the Cold War. Less {{than two weeks}} after the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Swiss government started studying the possibility of building nuclear <b>weapons,</b> and continued its military nuclear program for 43 years until 1988. It has since signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear <b>Weapons.</b> Switzerland never possessed biological or chemical <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
5|$|The USAF {{issued a}} new policy {{directive}} regarding the handling of nuclear <b>weapons</b> and delivery systems, which prohibits the storing of nuclear armed and nonnuclear armed <b>weapons</b> in the same storage facility. The directive further instructs that all nonnuclear munitions and missiles must be labeled with placards clearly stating {{that they are not}} armed with nuclear warheads. Wing commanders are now charged with approving any movement of nuclear <b>weapons</b> from <b>weapons</b> storage areas and must appoint a single individual as a munitions accountability system officer and <b>weapons</b> custodian. All units that handle nuclear <b>weapons</b> must develop a coordinated visual inspection checklist. The policy further directs that airmen charged with handling or maintaining nuclear <b>weapons</b> cannot be on duty for longer than 12 hours, unless during an emergency, when their duty period can be extended to a maximum of 16 hours. The USAF has since instituted a program of surprise inspections at nuclear-armed bases.|$|E
50|$|The <b>weapon</b> was {{designed}} by Umberto Onorati; very little information of the <b>weapon</b> is available other than that. As no pictures of the actual <b>weapon</b> exist, it can be assumed that the <b>weapon</b> never advanced past prototype stages.The Onorati used a dual-bolt system and fed from two 20-round detachable box magazines inserted into the <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ori Stun <b>Weapon</b> A {{small hand}} <b>weapon</b> shaped in {{the symbol of}} Origin that is worn as a {{gauntlet}} {{on the arm of}} Ori soldiers. The Ori stun <b>weapon</b> appears to share the same blue/white plasma energy as the larger Ori staff <b>weapon,</b> but is less potent. This <b>weapon</b> is similar in function to the Zat'ni'katel with one shot from this <b>weapon</b> capable of rendering an individual unconscious and multiple shots required to kill.|$|R

5|$|The first bomb {{assembly}} {{team was}} formed in August 1947, followed by a second in December and a third in March 1948. Experience with assembling the bombs convincingly demonstrated the requirement, in Sandia if not in Washington, for a much larger unit. Groves reluctantly approved a 109-man special <b>weapons</b> unit, and Montague converted the three lettered companies of the 38th Engineer Battalion into special <b>weapons</b> units. In 1948, they began training a Navy special <b>weapons</b> unit, as the Navy foresaw delivery of nuclear <b>weapons</b> with its new North American AJ Savage bombers from its s. This unit became the 471st Naval Special <b>Weapons</b> Unit on its certification in August 1948. Two Air Force units were created in September and December 1948, which became the 502d and 508th Aviation Squadrons. An additional Army special <b>weapons</b> unit was created in May 1948, and in December, the 38th Engineer Battalion (Special) became the 8460th Special <b>Weapons</b> Group, with all seven special <b>weapons</b> units under its command. The four Army units were then renamed the 111th, 122d, 133d and 144th Special <b>Weapons</b> Units. During the late 1940s the Air Force gradually became the major user of nuclear <b>weapons,</b> {{and by the end}} of 1949, it had twelve assembly units, and another three in training, while the Army had only four, and the Navy three, one for each of the three Midway-class carriers.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of <b>weapons,</b> including melee, projectile, and explosive <b>weapons,</b> as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as the shotgun, bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases poisonous gas. In a normal match, all teams begin with the same <b>weapons,</b> based on the chosen weapon set. Some <b>weapons</b> may not become available until a certain number of turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional <b>weapons</b> may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates. In addition to normal <b>weapons,</b> during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after a certain number of turns. The special <b>weapons</b> are more powerful than regular <b>weapons</b> and often offer special abilities; super <b>weapons</b> will rarely fall in weapon crates. These <b>weapons</b> are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, one of the game <b>weapons</b> is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E
5|$|The pre-mission {{briefing}} {{stage is}} where the player gets information on the background and objectives, and selects the ship and <b>weapons.</b> The choices of ships and <b>weapons</b> increase as the player proceeds further along the campaign. Certain missions, however, will dictate certain ships and <b>weapons</b> to be used. <b>Weapons</b> can be classified into primary <b>weapons</b> and secondary <b>weapons.</b> Primary <b>weapons</b> are kinetic and energy <b>weapons,</b> while missiles and torpedoes are classified as secondary <b>weapons.</b> Each weapon has its own specifications such as its rate of fire. They also inflict different damages on hulls (body of the ships) or shields (the protective energy fields surrounding the ships), or possess special effects such as shutting down specific electronic systems or propulsion.|$|E
