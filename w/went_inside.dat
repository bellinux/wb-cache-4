5|$|Becket excommunicated both de Brocs {{again on}} Christmas Day, 1170. On 28 December 1170, de Broc {{received}} at Saltwood Castle four knights– William de Tracy, Reginald fitzUrse, Hugh de Morville, and Richard le Breton– {{who had arrived}} from the continent. The five men conceived a plan to surround Canterbury Cathedral and force Becket to rescind his excommunications. On 29 December 1170, the five men arrived at Canterbury, where it appears that de Broc {{was in charge of}} the soldiers surrounding the cathedral while the other four <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> to negotiate with the archbishop. The four did not succeed in persuading the archbishop and the situation degenerated into the four men murdering Becket at one of the altars of the cathedral. After this, the four rejoined de Broc and searched the archiepiscopal residence for papers and other documents that de Broc was to send to the king. The party then returned to Saltwood.|$|E

The last step was to scrape off the scales.|$|E

When the team performs today, the Dalmatians sit on the wagon, seated next to the driver. The wagons are Studebaker wagons modified to carry beer, originally manufactured circa 1900.|$|E
25|$|The Browns {{faced the}} New York Yankees {{in the third}} game {{of the regular season}} on a rainy {{afternoon}} in Cleveland. The Yankees scored first on a field goal by Harvey Johnson in the first quarter. Cleveland's offense struggled throughout the game, maintaining possession for just 40 plays and amassing only 125 yards of total offense. Graham completed just four passes. While the offense faltered, however, the Browns' defense stopped the Yankees from scoring numerous times despite allowing a series of long drives. The Browns stopped the Yankees from scoring on six drives that <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> the Browns' 20-yard line and three of them that <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> the 10-yard line. New York had 311 total yards, but Cleveland won the game 14–3 on a pair of touchdowns scored by its defense. Les Horvath took a fumble by Buddy Young 84 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, and Tommy James intercepted Yankees quarterback Don Panciera with two seconds left in the game, running the ball in for a 27-yard touchdown. Lou Saban again handled kicking duties, booting through both extra points after the touchdowns as Lou Groza remained sidelined with his leg injury.|$|E
25|$|The strikers {{then decided}} to occupy the power station {{controlling}} the mines' pumping machinery. A radical group <b>went</b> <b>inside,</b> forcing the men there to stop their work, endangering the lives of 200 miners still underground (who had refused to join the strike) and causing a power outage for the entire Jiu Valley. The engineer Radu Nicolau, the power station's manager, told to leave his station, was stabbed when he refused {{and had to be}} hospitalised. The other power station employees were forcibly evicted and the guard beaten.|$|E

25|$|Bryant {{travelled}} to Forcett Village, arriving {{some time}} around 11:00a.m. He continued down to Port Arthur and was seen driving into Seascape down the Arthur Highway around 11:45a.m. He {{stopped at the}} Seascape guest accommodation site {{that his father had}} wanted to purchase, owned by David and Noelene Martin. Bryant <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> and fired several shots, then gagged David Martin and stabbed him. Witnesses testified to different numbers of shots fired at this time. It was stated in court that it was believed that this was the time that Bryant killed the Martins, his first two victims.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September, {{government}} forces from Liaodong began to lay siege {{to the city}} of Yongping. Zhu Di led the Yan forces to reinforce the city on 19 September and defeated the Liaodong forces by 25 September. Following the victory, Zhu Di decided to raid the city of Daning controlled by Prince of Ning in order to annex his army. The Yan forces reached Daning on 6 October, and Zhu Di <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> the city. He was able to coerce the Prince of Ning and the troops in Daning to submit to him, and the strength of the Yan forces increased significantly.|$|E
25|$|At the {{breaking}} of camp, Aaron and his sons were to take down the Ark, the table of display, the lampstand, and the service vessels, and cover them all with cloths and skins. Only when Aaron and his sons had finished covering the sacred objects would the Kohathites come and lift them. Aaron's son Eleazar had responsibility for the lighting oil, the aromatic incense, the regular meal offering, the anointing oil, and all the consecrated things in the Tabernacle. God charged Moses and Aaron to {{take care not to}} let the Kohathites die because they <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> and witnessed the dismantling of the sanctuary.|$|E

One of their most {{important}} jobs were to answer questions, including those surrounding the canteen and the basics of the North Platte and Nebraska. Another important job was to tend to those on the hospital trains who were unable to enter the building. The men on the trains were naturally treated the same as those who <b>went</b> <b>inside.</b> Magazines, religious literature, and decks of cards were also distributed to the servicemen on the trains. If they were unable to disembark from the cars, women would walk {{up and down the aisles}} distributing goods or hand up materials from the ground to the windows.|$|E
25|$|As Roberts {{drove away}} with Mangum, {{the two women}} began to argue. Roberts pulled over and {{attempted}} to push Mangum out of the car. When that failed, Roberts drove Mangum to a nearby Kroger supermarket, <b>went</b> <b>inside,</b> and told a female security guard that a woman was refusing to leave her car. The guard walked {{to the car and}} asked Mangum to leave, but Mangum remained in the vehicle. The guard said that she did not smell alcohol on Mangum's breath, but thought she might have been under the influence of other drugs. At 1:22 AM, the guard called 911 to report that Mangum refused to leave the car. Police then arrived, removed Mangum from the car and questioned her.|$|E
25|$|This {{arrangement}} {{resulted in}} a robbery tour of the Swedish province of Östergötland in 1999, which ended on 28 May in Kisa where Arklöv, Axelsson and Olsson robbed Östgöta Enskilda Bank. Olsson waited outside the bank armed with an Uzi submachine gun while Arklöv and Axelsson <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> the bank, kicked open a door to the offices and cashregisters and threatened the employees to open the vaults. As the vault was time-locked, the robbers were forced to wait 12 minutes before leaving the bank with a large sum of cash. They got away with over two million SEK, but during their escape a lone policeman, Kennet Eklund, followed them in his car. The robbers spotted him and opened fire, two hand grenades were thrown in his direction and against his car. Both hand grenades exploded but Eklund got away without any injuries while the robbers continued their escape. About 10 minutes later two policemen, Olle Borén and Robert Karlström, spotted the robbers' vehicle and drove after them in their own police car. Gunfire occurred as both cars had stopped, and the two policemen were gunned down and executed with their own guns.|$|E

He leapt onto the set, grabbed the tilting machine, and said 'Next set, that's a wrap.'" [...] By 9am of the first day, Corman was informed by the production manager that he was behind schedule.|$|E
500|$|The {{session was}} {{interrupted}} constantly, with people entering the building, phoning them, or throwing things through the window. Eventually, when the filming crew left the room, the group managed {{to finish the}} song. Stannards commented about the inspiration behind it to Music Week: [...] "We were talking about Bollywood films, the colours and how the Spice Girls could present themselves. It {{was a matter of}} how do we get everything in to one song?" [...] All the writing and the vocal recording was completed in one afternoon, and instead of taking turns, the five members <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> the vocal booths and recorded the chorus together. Brown commented that for this reason the final mix sounds [...] "spontaneous and full of energy".|$|E
500|$|Debbie Cook {{left the}} Hole in May 2007 after {{spending}} seven weeks there, {{when she was}} sent back to Clearwater, Florida to organize a major public event involving Miscavige. According to Cook, she was driven to downtown Clearwater by another staff member, along with her husband, to eat at the Church's dining hall. The couple took the opportunity to escape Scientology when the staff member <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> to get breakfast; Cook jumped into the driver's seat, drove with her husband to the nearest car rental outlet and hired a car to drive up to her father's house in North Carolina. Before they got there, they were intercepted by Church officials and ordered to return to Clearwater. She spent three weeks under guard, at one point writing in a letter to her mother that if she was not released she [...] "would take whatever steps necessary, like slitting my wrists", before finally signing a severance agreement. She later said that by that point, [...] "I would have signed that I stabbed babies over and over again and loved it".|$|E

500|$|Soon, the {{prominent}} cattlemen sent out an assassination squad to kill Nate Champion {{on the morning}} of November 1, 1891. Champion and another man named Ross Gilbertson were sleeping in a cabin in Middle Fork of Powder River when a group of armed men <b>went</b> <b>inside.</b> Two of them went in while another stood by outside. Champion was immediately awakened by the intrusion, and as the gunmen pointed their weapons at him, Champion reached for his own pistol hidden under a pillow and a shootout commenced. Champion successfully shot two of the gunmen; mortally wounding and killing Billy Lykins. The rest of the assassination squad subsequently fled. Champion was left uninjured except for some facial powder burns from the gunfight. In a subsequent investigation of the attack, the names of those involved were leaked to two ranchers: John A. Tisdale and Orley “Ranger” Jones. However, both men were ambushed while they were riding, which outraged many of the small ranchers and farmers in the county. By early 1892, violence had reached something of a peak; newspapers, such as the Big Horn County Rustler, published articles and speculations that a [...] "war" [...] was on the way.|$|E
500|$|Several {{isolated}} incidents against Christians {{were reported}} from 17 August onwards, and on 29 August some 45,000 institutions across India {{participated in a}} [...] "prayer for peace and communal harmony" [...] {{in response to the}} ongoing anti-Christian violence in Orissa. St. Aloysius College, a Jesuit institution in Mangalore, and some other 2000 Christian schools in Karnataka went on strike for varying periods between 29 August and 5 September prior to the attacks, protesting against the events in Orissa, in defiance of the orders of the government who stated that {{it was to be a}} regular work day. This led to government denouncement of the Christian institutions in the state for disobeying orders and led to a Bajrang Dal demonstration outside the St. Aloysius College, two weeks prior to the main attacks. The attacks began on 14 September, when a group of youths from the Bajrang Dal <b>went</b> <b>inside</b> the chapel of Adoration Monastery of the Sisters of St-Clare near the Milagres Church in Hampankatta and desecrated it. Some 20 churches or prayer halls, including Catholic and Protestant churches and temples belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses and other evangelical sects, and colleges were damaged in towns and villages in the Mangalore taluk and other parts of Dakshina Kannada district, Udupi district and Chikkamagaluru district. A few Christian institutions were later attacked in Bangalore and Kasaragod district. Out of frustration and anger, the Christian community responded to the attacks within hours and began protesting. In Karkala, the Catholics of Karkala deanery staged a protest on 15 September and organised a 3 kilometre silent protest march. The protesters blocked arterial city roads in their masses, especially in places such as Hampankatta, Kulshekar, Bejai, Derebail and Thokottu and rang bells in almost all the churches of Mangalore, calling parishioners to their churches. The protests led to strong police suppression with lathi charges and tear gas, making around 150 arrests and injuring 30 to 40 people. The incident marked the first time that Catholics had ever resorted to violence in Mangalore when provoked. Between 15 September and 10 October, a new wave of anti-minority attacks began against Christian communities in the Indian states of Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, New Delhi, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand, as well as Muslim communities in Gujarat and Maharashtra.|$|E
