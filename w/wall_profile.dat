50|$|Late Gothic {{construction}} of the parish church started with building up the choir in 1446. The builder in the late 1450s was probably Hans from Brno according to scientific research. The main problem is surely {{to find out the}} date when construction began, i.e. the date of establishing the East-oriented presbytery. There is a document about a gift for the {{construction of}} the chancel from the year 1469 and the latest research comes with differing opinions as to when construction on the presbytery began. It should date according to documents from the half of the 15th century. This year probably prefers to the finishing of the {{construction of the}} chancel. Another opinion puts forth the idea about the earlier construction of the oldest part of the presbytery. This idea is supported by some architectonic details, for example the axial placing of the buttress which recalls Petr Parléř's construction at the Southern hall in Saint Vitus cathedral in Prague and in the presbytery of Saint Bartholomew's in Kolín upon Elbe. Also the structure of the <b>wall</b> <b>profile</b> between the windows and the shape of the window tracery repeats some of Parléř's characteristic motifs and possibly floral ornaments and beautiful gargoyles {{at the top of the}} buttresses which are close to work from Parléř's area. It could be hardly made as special kind of historicism in the half of the 15th century. It is possible to consider the origin of the presbytery and so the project of the new church at the end of the 14th century. Norbert Nussbaum pointed out to details of the shaft work, which passes through the windows jambs and the compound piers. It shows knowledge of the forms, which were used in the lodge at the Cathedral of St. Stephan in Vienna, when there was a master Lorenz Spenning.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{secondary}} flow feature, previously unreported for turbine blading {{as far as}} the authors are aware, has been discovered. It has been found {{that it is possible to}} separate part of the inlet boundary layer on the blade row end wall as it is being over-turned and rolled up into the passage vortex. This flow feature has been discovered during a continuing investigation into the aerodynamic effects of non-axisymmetric end <b>wall</b> <b>profiling.</b> Previous work, using the low speed linear cascade at Durham University, has shown the potential of end <b>wall</b> <b>profiling</b> for reducing secondary losses. The latest study, the results of which are described here, was undertaken to determine the limits of what end <b>wall</b> <b>profiling</b> can achieve. The flow has been investigated in detail with pressure probe traversing and surface flow visualization. This has found that the inlet boundary locally separates, on the early suction side of the passage, generating significant extra loss which feeds directly into the core of the passage vortex. The presence of this new feature gives rise to the unexpected result that the {{secondary flow}}, as determined by the exit flow angle deviations and levels of secondary kinetic energy, can be reduced while at the same time the loss is increased. CFD was found to calculate the secondary flows moderately well compared with measurements. However, CFD did not predict this new feature, nor the increase in loss it caused. It is concluded that the application of non-axisymmetric end <b>wall</b> <b>profiling,</b> although it has been shown to be highly beneficial, can give rise to adverse features that current CFD tools are unable to predict. Improvements to CFD capability are required in order to be able to avoid such features, and obtain the full potential of end <b>wall</b> <b>profiling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Results are {{presented}} for the nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum $XXZ$-spin chain whose spins are initially {{arranged in a}} domain <b>wall</b> <b>profile</b> via {{the application of a}} magnetic field in the $z$-direction which is spatially varying along the chain. The system is driven out of equilibrium in two ways: a). by rapidly turning off the magnetic field, b). by rapidly quenching the interactions {{at the same time as}} the magnetic field is turned off. The time-evolution of the domain <b>wall</b> <b>profile</b> as well as various two-point spin correlation functions is studied by the exact solution of the fermionic problem for the $XX$ chain and via a bosonization approach and a mean-field approach for the $XXZ$ chain. At long times the magnetization is found to equilibrate (reach the ground state value), while the two-point correlation functions in general do not. In particular, for quenches within the gapless $XX$ phase, the transverse spin correlation functions acquire a spatially inhomogeneous structure at long times whose details depend on the initial domain <b>wall</b> <b>profile.</b> The spatial inhomogeneity is also recovered for the case of classical spins initially arranged in a domain <b>wall</b> <b>profile</b> and shows that the inhomogeneities arise due to the dephasing of transverse spin components as the domain wall broadens. A generalized Gibbs ensemble approach is found to be inadequate in capturing this spatially inhomogeneous state. Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures. References added. Final published versio...|$|E

40|$|Bragg {{resonances}} {{caused by}} the same transverse modes can always {{play a major role}} in periodic waveguides when the period is larger than the average radius. Because of higher-order mode cutoffs, the related Bragg gaps can be identified as interactions between different spatial harmonics of the fundamental mode, and the first Bragg gaps are more intensive than the higher ones. When we alter the parameters of the periodic waveguide, especially, decrease the period, the first transverse mode can be involved in Bragg gaps. Here, we demonstrate a direct mode-stopband interaction between the first mode and the second Bragg gap, that an extraordinary passband arises in the original second Bragg gap and splits the bandgap into two. Furthermore, the extraordinary passband is mainly composed of a pure first mode, which effectively suppresses the transmission of the fundamental one. We have also investigated the influence of <b>wall</b> <b>profiles</b> on the transmission and mode purity, and have found that the defined shape factor of <b>wall</b> <b>profiles</b> is proportionally related to the width of both pass and stop bands. The results could benefit not only the understanding of wave phenomena but also the applications in mode generators, filters, and so on...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} effect of extreme {{geometry}} on a non-convex variational problem. The analysis is motivated by recent investigations of magnetic domain walls trapped by sharp thin necks. To capture the essential issues in the simplest possible setting, we focus on a scalar variational problem with a symmetric double well potential, whose spatial domain is a dumbell with a sharp neck. Our main results are (a) the existence of local minimizers representing geometrically constrained walls, and (b) an asymptotic characterization of the <b>wall</b> <b>profile.</b> Our analysis uses methods similar to Gamma-convergence; in particular, the <b>wall</b> <b>profile</b> minimizes a certain "reduced problem" - the limit of the original problem, suitably rescaled near the neck. The structure of the wall depends critically on the choice of scaling, specifically the ratio between length and width of the neck...|$|E

Both inhomogeneous elastic stress and positive surface energy lead to the wall broadening at electrically screened surface. For ferroelectrics with weak piezoelectric coupling, the extrapolation length that defines surface energy parameter, affects the wall broadening more strongly than inhomogeneous elastic stress. Unexpectedly, the domain <b>wall</b> <b>profile</b> follows a long-range power law when approaching the surface, while it saturates exponentially in the bulk. In materials with high piezoelectric coupling and negligibly small surface energy (i. e. high extrapolation length) inhomogeneous elastic stress effect dominates.

40|$|Venous {{stenosis}} is {{a significant}} problem in arteriovenous fistulae, likely due to anatomical configuration and <b>wall</b> shear stress <b>profiles.</b> To identify linkages between wall shear stress and the magnitude and pattern of vascular stenosis, we produced curved and straight fistulae in a pig model. A complete <b>wall</b> stress <b>profile</b> was calculated for the curved configuration and correlated with luminal stenosis. Computer modeling techniques were then used to derive a <b>wall</b> shear stress <b>profile</b> for the straight arteriovenous fistula. Differences in the <b>wall</b> shear stress <b>profile</b> of the curved and straight fistula were then related to histological findings. There was a marked inverse correlation between the magnitude of wall shear stress within {{different regions of the}} curved arteriovenous fistula and luminal stenosis in these same regions. There were also significantly greater differences in wall shear stress between the outer and inner walls of the straight as compared to curved arteriovenous fistula, which translated into a more eccentric histological pattern of intima-media thickening. Our results suggest a clear linkage between anatomical configuration, <b>wall</b> shear stress <b>profiles,</b> and the pattern of luminal stenosis and intima-media thickening in a pig model of arteriovenous fistula stenosis.

They have a major influence over {{the performance of the}} blade rows since they cause unsteadiness in the mainstream flow. This consequently affects not only the mechanical integrity of the blades but also causes extra loss. This research is aimed to reduce secondary flows using a novel method; end wall profiling. Profile 2 end wall was designed by Rolls Royce pic. with improved design features compared to its predecessor, Profile 1 end <b>wall.</b> <b>Profile</b> 2 end wall was manufactured and tested using the test facility available at the University of Durham.
