Heavy metals viz., copper, lead, zinc, nickel, chromium were estd. for their concn. in sewage water irrigated {{and also with}} regular irrigation.

The concn. of heavy metals were considerably high with sewage water irrigated plants.

On the contrary the other heavy metal lead recorded only in the dry land condition. However, any of the heavy metals were not recorded with the control plants. The role of urban sewage water irrigation in contributing to the heavy metals for plants was discussed in the present paper. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|R
