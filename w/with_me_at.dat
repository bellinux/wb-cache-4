5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E

500|$|In the Georgia game Bomar had a brain {{hemorrhage}} {{after he}} was kicked in the chin, and half his body was paralyzed for two days. It was thought {{that he would never}} play football again: [...] "Not a player on the team could talk of Bomar's injury without tears coming to his eyes", and Bomar sat on the bench {{for the rest of the}} season's games. Known as a devastating blocker and [...] "lightning fast," [...] he was the first Commodore football player elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956. At his induction Bomar said, [...] "I just wish all the men who played <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Vanderbilt between 1921 and 1924 could also receive this coveted award.

500|$|The {{mass media}} has often speculated about a romantic {{relationship}} between Vidya and her co-actors, but she has strongly denied these reports. In 2009, Vidya {{was involved in a}} controversy when she mentioned a previous relationship in which [...] "caustic remarks" [...] were made at her due to her weight. She said, [...] "If someone who matters to you takes you down, it can break you. That someone whose approval mattered to me started to constantly find faults <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> <b>At</b> that point of time, it was important to walk away from that relationship." [...] Though she refused to name the person, tabloid reports suggested that she was referring to Shahid Kapoor (her co-star in Kismat Konnection). Kapoor, however, denied the allegations. During an interview in May 2012, Vidya announced that she was dating Siddharth Roy Kapur, the CEO of UTV Motion Pictures. On 14 December 2012, the couple were married in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{recalled}} that [...] "Balakirev had no difficulty in getting along <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> <b>At</b> his suggestion I most readily rewrote the symphonic movements composed {{by me and}} brought them to completion {{with the help of}} his advice and improvisations". Though Rimsky-Korsakov later found Balakirev's influence stifling, and broke free from it, this did not stop him in his memoirs from extolling the older composer's talents as a critic and improviser. Under Balakirev's mentoring, Rimsky-Korsakov turned to other compositions. He began a symphony in B minor, but felt it too closely followed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and abandoned it. He completed an Overture on Three Russian Themes, based on Balakirev's folksong overtures, as well as a Fantasia on Serbian Themes that was performed at a concert given for the delegates of the Slavonic Congress in 1867. In his review of this concert, nationalist critic Vladimir Stasov coined the phrase Moguchaya kuchka for the Balakirev circle (Moguchaya kuchka is usually translated as [...] "The Mighty Handful" [...] or [...] "The Five"). Rimsky-Korsakov also composed the initial versions of Sadko and Antar, which cemented his reputation as a writer of orchestral works.|$|E

2500|$|According to Roger Ebert {{from the}} Chicago Sun-Times, {{the film was}} met with two extremes, one side being overall positive, while the other side being the exact opposite. Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, who was also in attendance, said in a 1992 interview, [...] "After I saw Twin Peaks: Fire Walk <b>with</b> <b>Me</b> <b>at</b> Cannes, David Lynch had {{disappeared}} so far up his own ass that I {{have no desire to}} see another David Lynch movie until I hear something different.

Catherine Ndereba of Kenya finished in second place, {{more than a minute}} behind. Radcliffe said: [...] "It pretty much went according to plan.

2500|$|... he Elo {{equivalent}} of a given handicap degrades as you go down the scale. A knight seems to be worth around a thousand points when the [...] "weak" [...] player is around IM level, but it drops as you go down. For example, I'm about 2400 and I've played tons of knight odds games with students, and I would put the break-even point (for untimed but reasonably quick games) <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> around 1800, so maybe a 600 value at this level. An 1800 can probably give knight odds to a 1400, a 1400 to an 1100, an 1100 to a 900, etc. This is pretty obviously the way it must work, because the weaker the players are, the more likely the weaker one is to blunder a piece or more. When {{you get down to}} the level of the average 8 year old player, knight odds is just a slight edge, maybe 50 points or so.|$|E

It also noted that [...] "One of the obvious obstacles was how to color a film whose natural shadings tend toward black, white and degrees of gray. The result is a lot of odd but fascinating colorations -- the sky might turn up yellow at times, or the sea a deep maroon". The Spokesman-Review wrote [...] "in an era when G-rated movies are as rare as Hollywood humility, any attempt at family entertainment should be lauded", adding [...] "let us salute Don Bluth and his team of animators". In a rare case, The Daily Gazette gave the film 4 stars. The Animated Movie Guide said the film was an [...] "utter waste of talent and resources", due to interference from external forces. Monica Sullivan of Movie Magazine International noted that the film was [...] "heartily enjoyed by the two little girls who saw it <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> a kiddie matinee".|$|E
