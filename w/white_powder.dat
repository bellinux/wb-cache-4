5|$|Ordinary <b>white</b> <b>powdered</b> {{zinc oxide}} can be {{produced}} in the laboratory by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate with a zinc anode. Zinc hydroxide and hydrogen gas are produced. The zinc hydroxide upon heating decomposes to zinc oxide.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{two-stage}} synthesis {{from the}} γ-hydroxybutenolide compound, 5-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-5(H)-furanone, has been reported. Firstly, 5-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-5(H)-furanone is oxidised to 3-isopropylfuran-2,5-dione by Dess-Martin periodinane, followed by acetic acid reflux with beta-alanine. The <b>white</b> <b>powdered</b> product has a melting point of 75-77 °C.|$|R
5|$|Mephedrone {{can come}} in the form of capsules, tablets or <b>white</b> <b>powder</b> that users may swallow, snort, inject, smoke or use rectally. When taken orally, users {{reported}} they could feel the effects within 15–45 minutes; when snorted, the effects were felt within minutes and peaked within half an hour. The effects last for between two and three hours when taken orally or nasally, but only half an hour if taken intravenously. It is sometimes sold mixed with methylone in a product called bubbles in the UK and also mixed with other cathinones, including ethcathinone, butylone, fluoromethcathinone and methedrone.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} is very {{efficient}} at eating its prey; {{not only is}} it able to splinter and eat the largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any inorganic material is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a <b>white</b> <b>powder</b> with few hairs. They react to alighting vultures more readily than other African carnivores, {{and are more likely to}} stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum pectinatum {{has been}} mistaken for the morphologically similar but smaller species G.schmidelii. The latter species lacks {{vertical}} striations on the basal {{portions of the}} endoperidium, and {{does not have a}} pseudoparenchymatous collar around the stem. Another similar species, G.berkeleyi, has a shorter stem and is missing the ridges {{at the base of the}} spore sac. Further, the color of its spore sac is usually brown, in contrast to the gray-blue of G.pectinatum. G.xerophilum also has a dusting of <b>white</b> <b>powder</b> on the surface of the spore sac, but unlike G.pectinatum, consistently lacks a ring at the base of the pedicel; furthermore, in contrast to G.pectinatum, the spores of G.xerophilum are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope. G.striatum has smaller fruit bodies than G.pectinatum, and a distinct collar-like apophysis.|$|E
50|$|Inorganic mercury {{compounds}} or mercury salts, more {{commonly found in}} nature, include mercuric sulphide (HgS), mercuric oxide (HgO) and mercuric chloride (HgCl2). Most of these are <b>white</b> <b>powders</b> or crystals, except for mercuric sulphide which is red and turns black after exposure to light.|$|R

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that PHMG in {{solution}} has fungicidal as well as bactericidal activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The substance also has detergent, anti-corrosive, and flocculant properties and prevents biofouling. PHMG-P is a <b>white</b> <b>powdered</b> solid, and as all polyguanidine salts, readily soluble in water.|$|R
5|$|Many calcium {{compounds}} {{are used}} in food, as pharmaceuticals, and in medicine, among others. For example, calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate, calcium diphosphate, and tricalcium phosphate. The last is also used as a polishing agent in toothpaste and in antacids. Calcium lactobionate is a <b>white</b> <b>powder</b> that {{is used as a}} suspending agent for pharmaceuticals. In baking, calcium monophosphate is used as a leavening agent. Calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in papermaking and as a disinfectant, calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber, and calcium acetate is a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins.|$|E
5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one they could find, including an African theater troupe that was passing by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went to Carl Lumbly, {{who was known}} for his role on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who had just returned to his home in Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of <b>white</b> <b>powder,</b> and a little pink powder for color. He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change it back and forth from black and white. As revealed on his resident alien card, Aboah's birthday is September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} scene, Gaga and her eye-patch wearing boyfriend are reading {{magazines}} {{on a sofa}} in a tea room. Gaga wears a yellow jumpsuit with circular glasses and shoulder pads. The Guardian compared this look with that of Minnie Mouse. She finally takes her revenge on her boyfriend by discreetly poisoning his drink with <b>white</b> <b>powder</b> concealed in her ring. As he falls dead, Gaga calls 9-1-1 and declares that she just killed her boyfriend. The police arrive at the mansion and arrest Gaga who, wearing a tall ice cream cone corkscrew wig, walks to the police car as the paparazzi surround her once again. Images flash by, with newspapers proclaiming her innocence and that Gaga {{is back in the}} spotlight and has regained her fame. The video ends with Gaga posing for mug shots like a fashion model while wearing a tulip shaped metallic dress similar to the single cover.|$|E
30|$|Planktothrix rubescens strain No 80 {{was grown}} in {{laboratory}} culture, and the dried cell biomass was extracted using aqueous methanol. Compounds (1 – 3) were isolated after fractionation of the crude extract on C 18 solid-phase extraction cartridges followed by semi-preparative HPLC. The three compounds were obtained as amorphous <b>white</b> <b>powders.</b>|$|R
30|$|For brevity, (aq) is dropped. Thus, as {{mentioned}} above, salts containing Na or K {{should be avoided}} {{as a source of}} IO 3 – to avoid precipitation. Using NaIO 3, we could easily induce precipitation of Na 2 SiF 6 with sufficiently extensive etching. Alkali metal hexafluorosilicates are <b>white</b> <b>powders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 5.6 mm. The forewings are narrow.

5|$|The team of Curry Man and Shark Boy were {{pitted against}} Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray), who were {{accompanied}} by Johnny Devine, in a thirteen-minute-and-twelve-second Fish Market Street Fight. Prior to this bout, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that if Team 3D made weight, then the weight restriction on them would be lifted. Also, that Kurt Angle originally won the Six Sides of Steel Cage match against Christian Cage, however the decision with The Unlikely Alliance gaining the advantage in the Six Man Tag Team match was still in effect. Before the bout, both members of Team 3D were weighed, with both coming in below the mark. In a Fish Market Street Fight the match is won by pinfall or submission, {{in which there are}} no disqualifications and the ring area is covered by fish paraphernalia. Devine interfered in the match near the end, accidentally throwing <b>white</b> <b>powder</b> in Ray's face. This led to Shark Boy tossing him out of the ring and through a table. Afterwards, Ray mistakenly performed Team 3D's signature tag team maneuver the 3D on Devon with Curry Man, allowing Shark Boy to cover for the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|The astronomical {{phenomena}} {{of the solar}} eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the Moon to the Sun. The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78–139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that {{the brightness of the}} Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun. Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape ('like a crossbow bullet'), not flat. Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies. However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century. When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of waxing and waning of the Moon. Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun). He explained that when the Sun's light is slanting, the Moon appears full. He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with <b>white</b> <b>powder,</b> and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical. He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the Sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.|$|E
