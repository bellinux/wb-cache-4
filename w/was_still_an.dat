5|$|Ibn Bajjah (Avempace, c. 1085–1138) {{proposed}} {{that for every}} force there is a reaction force. While he did not specify that these forces be equal, it <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> early version of Newton's third law of motion.|$|E

5|$|Although the pharaoh {{delegated}} his authority, {{the performance}} of temple rituals <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> official duty, restricted to high-ranking priests. The participation of the general populace in most ceremonies was prohibited. Much of the lay religious activity in Egypt instead took place in private and community shrines, separate from the official temples. As the primary link between the human and divine realms, temples attracted considerable veneration from ordinary Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, it was {{announced}} that Voyager 1 might have become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space, having detected a marked change in the plasma environment on August 25, 2012. However, until September 12, 2013, it <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> open question as to whether the new region was interstellar space or an unknown region of the Solar System. At that time, the former alternative was officially confirmed.|$|E
5|$|That the {{practice}} of sewing murderers of their parents in sacks and throwing them in the water <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> active type of punishment at Cicero's time, {{at least on the}} provincial level, is made clear within a preserved letter Marcus wrote to his own brother Quintus, who as governor in Asia Minor in the 50s BCE had, in fact, meted out that precise punishment to two locals in Smyrna, as Marcus observes.|$|E

50|$|The {{removal of}} one {{drop from the}} ocean, will not make it 'not <b>an</b> ocean' (it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> ocean), but since the volume {{of water in the}} ocean is finite, eventually, after enough removals, even a litre of water left <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> ocean.|$|R
5|$|The media {{tended to}} {{overlook}} the meaning behind Pussy Riot's feminism; the cultural context of it is vastly {{different from that of}} Western feminism. According to Elianna Kan in the American Reader, Pussy Riot's feminism focused on the repression of authoritarian regimes that created idealised ideas of sexism, sex and family life. Pussy Riot strove {{to make it clear that}} feminism in Russia <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> issue and that post-feminism had not been achieved.|$|E
5|$|There are ten {{counties}} in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. Five of the counties were created in 1769, when New Hampshire <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> English colony and not a state, during the first subdivision of the state into counties. The last counties created were Belknap County and Carroll County, in 1840.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1993 (while he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> amateur) until 2004, Woods worked almost {{exclusively}} with leading swing coach Butch Harmon. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods' full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better kinesiology. The changes began {{to pay off}} in 1999. From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by Hank Haney, who worked on flattening his swing plane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly. Haney resigned in May 2010 {{and was replaced by}} Sean Foley.|$|E

5|$|Gordimer herself became {{involved}} in South African struggle politics after the arrest of a friend, Bettie du Toit, in 1960 for trade unionist activities and {{being a member of}} the SACP. Just as Rosa Burger in the novel visits family in prison, so Gordimer visited her friend. Later in 1986, Gordimer gave evidence at the Delmas Treason Trial in support of 22 ANC members accused of treason. She was a member of the ANC while it <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> illegal organization in South Africa, and hid several ANC leaders in her own home to help them evade arrest by the security forces.|$|E
5|$|Jemima {{tells her}} life story to Maria and Darnford, {{explaining}} {{that she was}} born a bastard. Jemima's mother died while she <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> infant, making her already precarious social position worse. She was therefore forced to become a servant in her father's house and later bound out as an apprentice to a master who beat her, starved her, and raped her. When the man's wife discovers that Jemima is pregnant with his child, she is {{thrown out of the}} house. Unable to support herself, she aborts her child and becomes a prostitute. She becomes the kept woman of a man of some wealth who seems obsessed with pleasure of every kind: food, love, etc. After the death of the gentleman keeping her, she becomes an attendant at the asylum where Maria is imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{as a wife}} an epikleros who {{had little}} estate was {{considered}} a praiseworthy action, and was generally stressed in public speeches. Such an heiress was called an epikleros thessa. If the nearest male relative {{did not wish to}} marry an epikleros who belonged to the lowest income class in Athens, he was required to find her a husband and provide her with a dowry on a graduated scale according to his own income class. This dowry was in addition to her own property and the requirement was designed to ensure that even poor heiresses found husbands. The law also did not stipulate what was to happen if the epikleros <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> infant or too young for consummation of the marriage when she was claimed.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} game {{of what would}} become known as Canadian football was played in Toronto on November 9, 1861, featuring University of Toronto students. The game {{at the time was}} a modified version of English rugby and it gained popularity throughout the 1860s. Rugby itself <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> infant game having evolved out of association football (soccer) in the 1830s. Seeking a way to keep fit after summer, the Argonaut Rowing Club (ARC) formed their own rugby-football squad on October 4, 1873. The Argonauts Football Club would play their first game against Hamilton on October 18 of that year (a victory), beginning a storied rivalry. H.T. Glazebrook served as their first captain and head coach. Establishment of the football team was formalized by the ARC on September 17, 1874, with a subscription fee of one dollar charged per player.|$|E
5|$|While Margaret <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> infant, William {{lost his}} job {{and was unable to}} find regular work. The family {{suffered}} hardship, with the threat of the workhouse a constant fear. Nevertheless, William and Ann did their best to ensure that their children were educated and prepared for life. Margaret was a clever child, whose skills at reciting poetry or playing piano pieces were often displayed at town events and Sunday School outings. Until the age of 13 she attended the local elementary school; she then worked for a year as a pupil-teacher (she was paid three shillings a week) in the school's boys' department. Local employment opportunities being scarce, she left Chard in 1887, at the age of 14, to begin an apprenticeship at a draper's shop in Hove, near Brighton.|$|E
5|$|After Emperor Mingzong died in 933, the Later Tang {{began to}} crumble {{from its own}} {{succession}} crisis. Mingzong's son and successor Li Conghou ruled for only five months {{before he was killed}} in 934 in a coup led by his adoptive brother Li Congke (Emperor Mo of Later Tang). Prince Bei, who <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> honored guest at the Tang court at the time, wrote to his brother Emperor Taizong (Yelü Deguang), advising him to invade the Tang. Instead, Taizong lent military support to a rebellion led by Shi Jingtang, a Tang governor and son-in-law of the former Emperor Mingzong. With Khitan help, in 936 Shi Jingtang succeeded in replacing the Later Tang with his own Later Jin. After some negotiation with the more powerful Khitans, he ceded sixteen border prefectures stretching from modern-day Datong (Shanxi province) to the coast of the Bohai Sea east of what is now Beijing, to the Liao. Since the Sixteen Prefectures contained numerous strategic passes and fortifications, the Khitans now had unrestricted access to the plains of northern China. Shi Jingtang also agreed to treat Emperor Taizong of Liao as his own father, a move that symbolically elevated Taizong and the Liao to a superior position.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the M-76 {{designation}} was decommissioned in 1973, most of the overall highway had been converted to freeway. It started southwest of Standish at an interchange with US23 in southern Arenac County. The freeway ran northward through fields to a junction with M-61 where it turned northwesterly. M-76 passed to the southwest of Sterling and over {{a tributary of the}} Tittabawassee River as the freeway approaches Alger through a forested area. In Ogemaw County, the trunkline ran south and west of Greenwood and continued to the West Branch area. There, M-76 met the southeastern end of its business loop that ran north into downtown. The freeway bypassed the town to the southwest, passed over M-30 without an interchange and then met the northwestern end of the business loop. While M-76 <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> active highway designation, this second business loop junction marked the end of the freeway in the area. M-76 turned west, merging onto M-55 to run concurrently along a two-lane highway.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, {{he moved}} to Second Division Grimsby Town. Though now playing in the {{professional}} Football League, Chapman <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> amateur at this stage and obtained {{a job with a}} firm of local solicitors to earn his way. Grimsby started the season poorly – they were {{near the bottom of the}} division by Christmas and were beaten 7–0 by Preston North End in the FA Cup, but rallied to finish tenth at the end of the 1898–99 season. By this time Chapman had been dropped from the team, having been unsuccessfully moved to centre forward, an unfamiliar position for him. He was released by Grimsby and drifted down into non-league football with a brief spell at Swindon Town, playing three games and scoring twice, but had to leave the club as he was unable to find a job in the area. He moved on to see out the season with Sheppey United, who finished bottom of the Southern League in 1899–1900. Chapman finished as United's top scorer but was injured at the end of this season, and still unable to find a job. Disheartened, he returned to his home town and turned out for Worksop Town of the Midland League in 1900–01, while resuming his studies, this time at Old Firth College in Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|In {{his role}} as Controller of Atomic Energy, Morgan was present for Operation Hurricane, the first British atomic weapons tests at the Montebello Islands in October 1952. His {{position}} was gradually reduced to a figurehead, with his authority largely supplanted by the Atomic Energy Board, which was chaired by Lord Cherwell, and was abolished in 1954 {{with the creation of}} the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Morgan then became Controller of Nuclear Weapons. Nonetheless, he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>an</b> important figure in the push for higher-yield weapons. He pressed for the testing of the Green Bamboo boosted fission weapon during Operation Mosaic. This resulted in Mosaic becoming a two-test series, although Green Bamboo could not be made available in time. A Green Bamboo assembly was subsequently taken to Christmas Island for Operation Grapple, but was deleted from the test series to save money. Morgan was also instrumental in putting the case {{for the development of the}} H-bomb on operational grounds.|$|E
