5|$|The strongest {{high-pressure}} {{areas are}} associated with cold air masses which push away out of polar regions during the <b>winter</b> <b>when</b> there is less sun to warm neighboring regions. These Highs change character and weaken once they move further over relatively warmer water bodies.|$|E
5|$|A greater misfortune {{occurred}} {{at the onset of}} the southern <b>winter</b> <b>when</b> the Aurora, locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its moorings. The ocean currents then pulled ship further away from the sledding parties marooned on shore and drifted for over six months before breaking free of the ice. Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party.|$|E

5|$|For most of 1650, a Venetian {{fleet of}} 41 vessels {{maintained}} the blockade of the Dardanelles, prohibiting Haideragazade Mehmed Pasha from sailing for Crete. He was replaced {{late in the}} year by Hozamzade Ali Pasha, governor of Rhodes, who used a clever ploy to get through the blockade: waiting until <b>winter,</b> <b>when</b> the Venetians withdrew their forces, he assembled a small number of ships and embarked several thousand troops with many provisions on them, and sailed unmolested to Crete.|$|E
5|$|The Westerlies or the Prevailing Westerlies are the {{prevailing}} winds {{in the middle}} latitudes between 35 and 65degrees latitude. These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. They are strongest in the <b>winter</b> <b>when</b> the pressure is lower over the poles, and weakest {{during the summer and}} when pressures are higher over the poles.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis, part of a {{geological}} formation known as the Blue Lias. This consists of alternating layers of limestone and shale, laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210–195million years ago). It {{is one of the}} richest fossil locations in Britain. The cliffs could be dangerously unstable, however, especially in <b>winter</b> <b>when</b> rain caused landslides. It was precisely during the winter months that collectors were drawn to the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils.|$|E

5|$|The swans, {{ducks and}} geese are medium to large birds that are adapted to an aquatic {{existence}} with webbed feet and bills which are flattened {{to a greater or}} lesser extent.

5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the <b>winter,</b> <b>when</b> pipelaying could not take place due to the frozen ground.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} months of winter {{darkness}} Joyce and Wild printed around 30copies of the expedition's book, Aurora Australis, which were sewn and bound using packaging materials. The most important winter's work, however, {{was preparing for}} the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton {{had been able to}} reinstate the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would be leading the South Pole journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the <b>winter</b> <b>when</b> four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{and other}} {{invertebrates}} {{are a major}} portion of the nuthatch diet, especially during the breeding season, when they rely almost exclusively on live prey, but most species also eat seeds during the <b>winter,</b> <b>when</b> invertebrates are less readily available. Larger food items, such as big insects, snails, acorns or seeds may be wedged into cracks and pounded with the bird's strong bill. Unusually for a bird, the brown-headed nuthatch uses a piece of tree bark as a lever to pry up other bark flakes to look for food; the bark tool may then be carried from tree to tree or used to cover a seed cache.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} known to kill deer, {{especially}} in <b>winter</b> <b>when</b> smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant. One study in the Everglades showed a large majority of kills (33 of 39) were fawns, but prey up to eight times the bobcat's weight could be successfully taken. It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest. On the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{sedentary}} species, {{meaning that}} adults are resident {{throughout the year}} in its range. The exception may be during harsh <b>winters,</b> <b>when</b> the adults may move south. Young of the species usually move in autumn or winter.|$|R
50|$|In severe <b>winters,</b> <b>when</b> {{the water}} {{surface of the}} bodden freezes over, the Rassower Strom remains largely {{ice-free}} {{as a result of}} the current to and from the Großer Jasmunder Bodden and provides a refuge for large numbers of water fowl.|$|R
50|$|Fimbulvetr is {{the harsh}} winter that precedes {{the end of}} the world and puts an end to all life on Earth. Fimbulwinter is three {{successive}} <b>winters,</b> <b>when</b> snow comes in from all directions, without any intervening summer. Then, there will be innumerable wars.|$|R
5|$|Like all Australasian robins, {{the flame}} robin is a perch and pounce hunter, mainly eating insects, and often {{returning}} to a favourite low perch several times to stand erect and motionless, scanning the leaf-litter for more prey. They are typically seen in pairs (during {{the spring and summer}} breeding season) or in loose companies in more open country in <b>winter,</b> <b>when</b> they more commonly feed on the ground. A field study in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales found no significant difference in foraging behaviour between male and female flame robins. Birds have been recorded foraging for insects in furrows in freshly ploughed fields. In Deniliquin, a flame robin was observed holding one foot forward and pattering the ground repeatedly to disturb ground-dwelling insects, and then watching and snapping up any which emerged; this behaviour is otherwise seen in waders.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was laid up each <b>winter</b> <b>when</b> the Gulf of Finland froze. Bronenosets was {{reclassified}} as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. During 1903, the ship was converted into a coal barge by the removal of her turret, her side armor, and its wooden backing, and by the division of her hull into three holds. She was redesignated as Barzha No. 34, Barzha No. 51 and, in 1914, Barzha No. 324. The ship sank in a storm in the Gulf of Finland sometime during World War I.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the ship's career other than that she was laid up each <b>winter</b> <b>when</b> the Gulf of Finland froze. On 18 July 1875, she was accidentally rammed by the ironclad , but only {{suffered}} minor damage. Perun was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. After she was stricken she was used as a pilot ship before being renamed Lotsiia (Pilot) in 1915. During the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion, the ship was struck by artillery fire. She was laid up after the resulting fire badly damaged her. During a flood on 23 September 1924, Lotsiia ran aground and was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

Tifon was converted into a mine storage hulk in 1909 and renamed Blokshiv No. 3 on 27 October of that year. She was abandoned by the Soviets in Helsingfors (Helsinki) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but she was later returned by the Finns in 1922. The ship was subsequently broken up in Finland.|$|E
