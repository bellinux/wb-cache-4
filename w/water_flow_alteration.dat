Human interferences (nitrates from waste <b>water,</b> <b>flow</b> <b>alteration,</b> invasive species introduction…) {{have altered the}} structure of the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) ecosystem. We use stable isotope analysis to improve our knowledge of the planktonic food web in the SFE and gain insights into its evolution over the past decades. We use the ratios of certain isotopes (Nitrogen, Carbon, Sulfur, etc.) in different species of zooplankton to tell us what it is feeding on as well as the trophic level it feeds in. My research focused on a number of different goals. 1) We’ve been examining the effect of Formalin vs. Frozen preservation. Since Formalin preservation is preferred by most researchers we want to see if it will affect isotope analysis. Results showed there were only small differences in the carbon isotopic composition of frozen and formalin preserved samples. A correction factor can be used. 2) After applying a correction factor to our samples, which span from 1976 - 2012, our results show spikes in Nitrogen concentrations in a number of species over time. The spikes may be due to influxes in Nitrogen rich waste water in those areas...|$|E

40|$|Australia {{is faced}} with {{large-scale}} dryland salinization problems, largely {{as a consequence of}} the clearing of native vegetation for cropland and grassland. We estimate the change in continental <b>water</b> vapour <b>flow</b> (evapotranspiration) of Australia during the past 200 years. During this period there has been a substantial decrease in woody vegetation and a corresponding increase in croplands and grasslands. The shift in land use has caused a ca. 10 % decrease in <b>water</b> vapour <b>flows</b> from the continent. This reduction corresponds to an annual freshwater flow of almost 340 km(3). The society-induced <b>alteration</b> of freshwater <b>flows</b> is estimated at more than 15 times the volume of run-off freshwater that is diverted and actively managed in the Australian society. These substantial <b>water</b> vapour <b>flow</b> <b>alterations</b> were previously not addressed in water management but are now causing serious impacts on the Australian society and local economies. Global and continental freshwater assessments and policy often neglects the interplay between freshwater flows and landscape dynamics.

5000|$|The {{eastern sand darter}} can {{be found}} in many areas {{throughout}} the United States and into southern Canada. In addition to the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, it {{can be found in}} great concentration in Lake Champlain, Erie, Huron, Michigan and Ontario. They can also be found in the St. Lawrence River drainage in Canada along with the Lake Champlain drainage in Vermont south into New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana. Currently, the greatest concentration occurs in northern Alabama and eastern Tennessee. Distribution has slowly decreased over the last few decades and two key factors could be the cause. The eastern sand darter requires clean sand substrates; hence, siltation is a major factor in their decline. Siltation decreases the quality of habitat for both egg development and adult darters by decreasing the oxygen levels within the sand in which they bury themselves. Furthermore, silted habitats can cause adult darters to not fully burrow or decrease their time burrowed which then causes them to waste energy reserves. Channel or <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>alterations,</b> nutrient enrichment, or any other habitat modification can completely change the amount and quality of the shifting sand bars which can then turn detrimental for the eastern sand darter. The increased construction of dams also has been a major factor contributing to the reduction of their habitats. Dams reduce river levels and flow, decrease oxygen levels in reservoir waters, and alter water temperatures, making it difficult for the eastern sand darter to reproduce at a comfortable temperature. [...] Dam construction adds a whole new dimension to decreasing the reproduction and survival rate for A. pellucida.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated with freeze-fracture electron microscopy that vasopressin induces specific structural alterations of the luminal membrane of granular cells from toad urinary bladder in a dose-dependent fashion. These alterations consist of aggregated intramembranous particles and are observed both in the presence and absence of an osmotic gradient. We examined the effect of methohexital, a selective inhibitor of vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow,</b> {{and the effect of}} phloretin, a selective inhibitor of urea permeability, on the structure of the granular cell luminal membrane. Methohexital treatment of the vasopressin-stimulated toad bladder reduced both the osmotic <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> and vasopressin-induced <b>alterations</b> of membrane structure to the same extent. Phloretin reduced urea permeability but not <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> or particle aggregation.

40|$|As landscapes become {{increasingly}} urbanized, {{there is an}} associated increase in impervious cover. Impervious surfaces, such as roads, rooftops, and parking lots contribute to the physical, hydrological, chemical, and biological alteration of stream systems. Biotic assemblages consistently degrade with increased watershed impervious cover; however, at low levels of impervious cover, these assemblages exhibit wide variability in biotic integrity. This study investigated which reach- and watershed-scale factors explained biotic condition (i. e., richness, flow traits, thermal traits, and tolerance for macroinvertebrates and fishes) at similar levels of low imperviousness. The primary objective was to identify factors that confer resistance for biota, such that they retain high biotic integrity at low levels of impervious cover, and, conversely, to determine which factors make biota more vulnerable to urban disturbance, such that they have low biotic integrity despite low levels of impervious cover. Forty sites were selected across Massachusetts within two narrow bands of impervious cover: 1 – 4 % (n = 20) and 7 – 10 % (n = 20). Models with reach-scale variables (reflecting habitat heterogeneity, <b>flow,</b> temperature, or <b>water</b> quality) or watershed-scale variables (representing natural characteristics, land use, <b>flow</b> <b>alterations,</b> and other measures of urbanization or impervious) explained additional variance compared to models with impervious cover alone. Reach-scale factors tended to explain more variance than watershed-scale factors for all biotic responses except fluvial fishes, with overall more variance explained for fish than macroinvertebrate assemblages. At the reach scale, colder water temperatures, higher dissolved oxygen, and more large wood were related to higher proportions of fluvial, coldwater, and intolerant fishes. For macroinvertebrates, warmer water temperature, smaller sediment size, and higher nitrate were related to higher macroinvertebrate richness and tolerance. At the watershed scale, air temperature emerged as an important predictor for both taxonomic groups and across response metrics; air temperature was highly correlated with high-elevation watersheds. Other important watershed-scale predictors were open <b>water</b> and dams, <b>flow</b> <b>alteration,</b> and other urban measures such as housing density, impervious in a 120 -m buffer, and road crossings. Restoration should focus on strategies to reduce impacts that would degrade in-stream conditions that allow for higher biotic integrity, such as habitat heterogeneity, more large wood, and colder water temperatures. Similarly, watersheds should be prioritized for protection with those characteristics potentially more resistant to urban disturbance, such as high-elevation regions that retained high biotic integrity despite higher dam density, more road crossings, and more <b>flow</b> <b>alteration...</b>|$|R
