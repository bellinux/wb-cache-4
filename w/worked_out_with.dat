5|$|The {{details of}} the plan were <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Oberst (Colonel) Karl Koller, Generalfeldmarschall Hugo Sperrle's chief of staff, Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3).

5|$|After going undrafted in the 2010 NFL Draft, the San Francisco 49ers signed Brown to a {{free agent}} contract. He was re-signed to the {{practice}} squad, but the franchise released him on September 8 when it signed quarterback Troy Smith and moved Nate Davis to the practice squad. Later in September, Brown tried out with the Pittsburgh Steelers alongside quarterbacks Levi Brown and John David Booty {{in search of a}} replacement for the injured Dennis Dixon. Brown also <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the New York Giants earlier in September and with the Houston Texans in October.|$|E
5|$|Chesbro {{met with}} Highlanders owner Frank J. Farrell and new manager Harry Wolverton in February 1912 about {{attempting}} a comeback. Wolverton {{agreed to give}} Chesbro a chance at pitching for the Highlanders. However, before leaving for camp he reconsidered and released Chesbro. Chesbro's request for reinstatement {{as a free agent}} was granted in March, while the Highlanders granted him his unconditional release. Chesbro decided to travel to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where teams participated in spring training, in an attempt to find a team willing to give him a chance at a comeback. He <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Brooklyn and Pittsburgh, but both teams passed on him.|$|E

5|$|Kolb {{was rated}} as the sixth-best {{quarterback in the}} 2007 NFL Draft by NFLDraftScout.com, and was {{projected}} to be drafted in {{the third or fourth}} round. He hired Jeff Nalley and Vann McElroy as his agents prior to the draft, and they hired former NFL quarterback Jerry Rhome to work with Kolb to get him ready for the pre-draft workouts. He <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Danny Arnold in Stafford, Texas in February 2007 in order to prepare for the NFL Scouting Combine. Kolb worked out for the Baltimore Ravens {{in the first week of}} April, and followed it up with a visit to the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2010 NBA Draft, Rolle hired Fletcher Cockrell {{to be his}} agent. ESPN, NBADraft.net, and DraftExpress.com {{projected}} him to be {{a possible}} mid-to-late second-round selection. He <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the Washington Wizards, Phoenix Suns, Milwaukee Bucks, Charlotte Bobcats, and Indiana Pacers. Dave-Te' Thomas of CBS Sports said that Rolle had a good wingspan and was very athletic. He added while larger NBA forwards might push him around, he was an intense player and would not back down if challenged. Thomas compared Rolle to former LSU teammate Tyrus Thomas.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Congress.|$|E

5|$|On 15 December, {{this plan}} was <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> {{the help of}} the Luftwaffe′s Jagd-Geschwaderkommodore, among them Gotthard Handrick (Jagdabschnittsführer Mittelrhein; Fighter Sector Leader Middle Rhein), Walter Grabmann and Karl Hentschel, commanders of 3. and 5. Jagddivision respectively. It was {{originally}} scheduled to support the Battle of the Bulge, the German Army′s offensive, which began 16 December 1944. However, the same bad weather that prevented the RAF and USAAF from supporting their own ground forces also prevented the Luftwaffe from carrying out the operation. It was therefore not launched until 1 January 1945. By this time, the German Army had lost momentum owing to Allied resistance and clearing weather, which allowed Allied Air Forces to operate. The German Army attempted to restart the attack by launching Operation Northwind (Unternehmen Nordwind). The Luftwaffe was to support this offensive through Bodenplatte.|$|E
25|$|Jones <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the Cincinnati Bengals on February 12, 2010, but the Bengals did {{not offer}} him a contract. Jones worked out for NFL scouts on March 19 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Six NFL teams were in attendance. Initial reports claimed Jones did not show up, but newer reports countered those claims. At his workout, his 40-yard dash time was 4.42 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Rumours {{stated that}} Tanner {{would make his}} return to the UFC in December 2007 at UFC 79 against Dean Lister, where he would {{represent}} the American Chute Boxe team. That report was dismissed by Tanner, as he did not have an upcoming fight with Dean Lister, and was continuing to battle his alcohol problems. Furthermore, he stated that things had not <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> American Chute Boxe and he no longer trained with them. He then started training at Hard Knocks Kickboxing in Las Vegas.|$|E
25|$|His high school, Schenley High School, did {{not have}} a wrestling program, but he <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the University of Pittsburgh wrestling team under storied coach Rex Peery. Sammartino became known for {{performing}} strongman stunts in the Pittsburgh area, and sportscaster Bob Prince put him on his television show. It was there that he was spotted by local wrestling promoter Rudy Miller, who recruited Sammartino for professional wrestling. Miller knew that Sammartino could easily be marketed as an ethnic strongman, and that he would appeal to Italian immigrants who supported wrestling.|$|E
25|$|Huntington {{had begun}} long {{negotiations}} with Harriman about consolidating the Los Angeles electric railways beginning in 1907. There {{had always been}} a difference between the two men as to the purpose of the railway, with Huntington seeing the PE as a means to facilitate his real estate efforts, and Harriman seeing it as part of the Southern Pacific’s overall transportation system in Southern California. Harriman left Huntington alone until 1910, when the former refused to allow the latter to run a line to San Diego that would have interfered with a competitive arrangement Harriman had <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the Santa Fe Railway.|$|E

Coleman began to train intensively in 1968 at Gold's Gym in Santa Monica, where he <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Dave Draper, Franco Columbu and Arnold Schwarzenegger. At this time he was able to bench press 605lbs (the world record, held by his friend Pat Casey, was 616lbs). One of Coleman's photo shoots with Schwarzenegger featured that year in Joe Weider's Muscle Fitness magazine.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} months, Hill <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> several NBA teams. After an impressive {{run at the}} Orlando pre-draft rookie camp, Hill attracted attention and became a projected second-round selection. On draft night, the San Antonio Spurs surprised many by selecting George Hill with their 26th pick in the first round; many had San Antonio selecting Mario Chalmers of Kansas. Hill became the second first-round draft choice in The Summit League's history and the first player ever drafted from IUPUI. On September 23, 2008, the Spurs signed Hill to a standard rookie contract that guaranteed the first two years, and included a team option on the next two years.|$|E
25|$|According to some reports, the People's Republic of China {{has offered}} to extend {{a line of credit}} to South Sudan for several years while an {{alternative}} pipeline to the Kenyan coast is laid and an export deal is <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the Kenyan government, but this scenario is regarded as less likely than continued South Sudanese dependence on Sudanese infrastructure. If such a deal were struck, though, and South Sudan began exporting oil from Kenyan ports, the US would become a potential trade partner and South Sudanese oil importer. In the meantime, the South Sudanese government intends to lobby the US to ease restrictions on American companies doing business with Sudan.|$|E

25|$|From {{that point}} forward, most of Magoffin's vetoes to protect {{southern}} interests were overridden in the General Assembly. After clashing with the Assembly {{for over a}} year on even the most trivial issues, Magoffin decided that resignation was his only option. Magoffin's lieutenant governor, Linn Boyd, had died in office, and Senate Speaker John Fisk, next in line for the governorship, was not acceptable to Magoffin as a successor. In an intricate plan <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> the General Assembly, Fisk resigned as speaker and the Senate elevated Magoffin's chosen successor, James F. Robinson, to the post. Magoffin then resigned, promoting Robinson to governor, and Fisk was re-elected as Senate Speaker.|$|E
25|$|Four {{years before}} CNN's launch, in December 1976, Ted Turner turned his Atlanta, Georgia {{independent}} station WTBS {{into one of}} the original satellite-distributed television channels, leasing a transponder on RCA's Satcom 1 geostationary satellite. The Cable News Network was intended to be distributed on RCA's new Satcom 3, which was lost on its launch date of December 7, 1979. Because replacement transmission capacity was not readily available, the Turner Broadcasting System filed suit against RCA seeking use of another communications satellite and $35.5 million in damages. On March 5, Turner announced that a consent order had been <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> RCA in federal court, allowing CNN to begin operations on June 1 as scheduled, using a transponder on Satcom 1.|$|E
25|$|K 177: Hamilton, Victoria. Following {{withdrawal}} from service, this locomotive {{was sold to}} the Langhi Morgala Museum in Ararat and placed on display. It was subsequently acquired by the Mornington Railway Preservation Society and transferred to Moorooduc. Further inspection revealed a number of parts beyond restoration, so a complex deal was <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> other organisations over the late 1990s. The end result was that the frame of K 177 was placed at Hamilton, Victoria, along with its own coupled wheels, motion gear and smoke deflectors. K 159 donated the tender body, frame and bogies, and K 174 provided the boiler, smokebox, funnel and pony truck. The engine is currently un-numbered, but during the transition process it was alternately known as the Hamilton Exchange Locomotive or K 193.|$|E
