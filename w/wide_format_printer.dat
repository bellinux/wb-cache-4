40|$|From {{a conference}} paper {{given at the}} Third International Conference: Preservation and Conservation Issues Related to Digital Printing and Digital Photography, 25 th April 2006, Institute of Physics, London. For many blue chip artists the master printer has been {{essential}} to the realization of highly creative, innovative, museum quality prints. Besides offering bespoke printing services and techniques, {{one of the many}} concerns of the master printer - especially {{in the latter half of}} the 20 th century- was to translate the artists creative intentions into print through fully preservable materials. A further offshoot of this work also, (in many cases) necessitated the actual documentation of the artists working approach and procedures in note form and progressive proofs to provide a unique insight into the creative process. This paper outlines some of the previous parameters and achievements in the field, looking at some of the worlds most prestigious print ateliers and examining the work produced for major artists under these terms. The paper will then investigate how the precedents of the master printer/atelier system have transferred into the field of digital printing for fine artists at the onset of the 21 st century. For many, the current generation of digital inkjet printers (especially wide format printers) can be seen to have had a democratising effect on the art world. Where artists who formerly needed to access the master printers skills and technology to produce ambitious print works, can now with a computer and access to a <b>wide</b> <b>format</b> <b>printer</b> create similar results. Or can they? By giving an overview of the specialised print work produced by the University of the West of England Centre for Fine Print Research digital printing facility and a selection of other British Digital Printing Studios, the presentation will provide an overview of some of the advantages offered by the transfer of the master printer system to the digital arena, arguing the case for the production of prints aiming to maintain and transcend the high standards of individuality and permanence previously set by 20 th century analogue print practice...|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the widely used small inkjet printers for home and office, there are professional inkjet printers, some for [...] "page-width" [...] format printing and many for <b>wide</b> <b>format</b> printing. Page-width format means that the print width ranges from about 8.5" [...] to 37" [...] (about 20 cm to 100 cm). [...] "Wide format" [...] means print width ranging from 24" [...] up to 15' (about 60 cm to 5 m). The most common application of page-width printers is in printing high-volume business communications that do not need high-quality layout and color. Particularly {{with the addition of}} variable data technologies, the page-width printers are important in billing, tagging, and individualized catalogs and newspapers. The application of most <b>wide</b> <b>format</b> <b>printers</b> is in printing advertising graphics; a lower-volume application is printing of design documents by architects or engineers.

40|$|We {{present results}} in a {{constraint}} solving approach for automatic generation of inkjet print masks. Print masks are used to control the firing of the nozzles, that is, to determine which nozzles on an inkjet printer cartridge are to spit an ink droplet at each particular instant in a multiple-pass print mode. Many design rules for print masks can be modeled in terms of constraints and cost functions. For example, if adjacent nozzles are fired simultaneously, printing artifacts often result. Therefore, spatial adjacency constraints with respect to horizontal, vertical and diagonal neighbors are modeled with various cost functions. Minimizing the associated, total costs then generates the print masks. Initial solutions are found by a greedy algorithm with some randomization; then neighborhood search techniques are applied to find local near-optima. Our approach can generate masks for Inkjet printers in multiple-pass print modes for multiple-level, multiple-drop technologies. It {{has been used to}} help design the print masks for Hewlett Packard's <b>wide</b> <b>format</b> <b>printers</b> (DeskJet 2500 C and 2500 CM). This approach can shorten the turnaround time for print mask design in a systematic and methodical way...|$|R
5000|$|Printers are {{generally}} {{referred to as}} [...] "Super-Wide format" [...] when their print bed exceeds 2.2m in width. For many applications at this size resolution becomes secondary to print speed - which is why many machines over 3m wide are designed for speed over resolution. In the 1980s billboards were generally printed at resolutions as low as 80dpi (dots per inch). Resolutions today are much higher because of the improvements in technology but printing billboards, vehicle graphics, building wraps and the like do not require the ultra-high resolutions of 1440dpi and upwards often associated with standard <b>wide</b> <b>format</b> <b>printers.</b> It is normal for super-wide <b>format</b> digital <b>printers</b> to function at maximum resolutions of between 540dpi and around 1040dpi. However even these resolutions are rarely used in a production environment, billboards and building wraps for example are often done at between 200dpi and 350dpi and the end result relies on the viewing distance for the impactful, colourful graphics the public sees on roadsides and buildings. The {{fact that they are}} capable of printing at these higher resolutions is still important though because it attests {{to the size of the}} ink droplet being laid down by the inkjet solvent and eco-solvent machines. These ink droplets are measured in pica-litres and a print done at 200dpi will look more defined if it is printed with smaller ink droplets when compared to a machine laying down bigger ink droplets. The primary print head technologies used in ultra-wide format digital outdoor printing comes down to a few print head manufacturers worldwide including (but not restricted to) Piezo, Seiko and Spectra as the primary competitors and their print heads are used in most machines from a variety of manufacturers. They have their pros and cons and Piezo appears to focus more on the higher resolution side of the industry whereas Seiko and Spectra-Polaris tend more towards the robust, high production capabilities required in a manufacturing environment.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>wide</b> <b>format</b> inkjet <b>printers</b> made the technology available for large area commercials. Outdoor advertising uses {{a wide range}} of substrate including paperboard, vinyl, canvas, mesh; the material of the substrate itself has to endure the physical and chemical effects of local weather. Weather elements (humidity, wind, solar irradiation) degrade printed products inevitably; plastic products have better resistance against them, than paper based substrates. Service life of the printed product for outdoor application is a key parameter from the customer’s point of view. There are two ways to estimate expected lifetime: on site outdoor testing or laboratory testing. In both cases weathering parameters can be monitored, however laboratory testing devices may produce the desired environmental effects and thus accelerate the aging process. Our research objective was to evaluate the effects of artificial weathering on prints produced by inkjet technology on plastic substrates. We used a large <b>format</b> CMYK inkjet <b>printer</b> (Mutoh Rockhopper II, with Epson DX 4 print heads) to print our test chart on two similar substrates (PVC coated tarpaulins) with grammages 400 g/m 2 and 440 g/m 2.
