500|$|The {{praise for}} the album {{overwhelmed}} the band; Greenwood felt the praise had been exaggerated because The Bends had been [...] "under-reviewed possibly and under-received." [...] They rejected links to progressive rock and art rock, despite frequent comparisons made to Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon. Yorke responded: [...] "We write pop songs... there was no intention of it being 'art'. It's a reflection of all the disparate things we were listening to when <b>we</b> <b>recorded</b> it."

500|$|The band {{entered the}} Ocean Way Recording studio in Hollywood in February 1989 to record Mother's Milk.

[...] "I was still a little bit confused about my position and we were just like four individuals. Music is all about welding people into a unit and with all the touring we've been doing we're now like an eight armed cosmic octopus!" [...] Beinhorn pushed the Chili Peppers to produce the best possible takes for each of the record's thirteen tracks with the intent of the band obtaining a hit record.|$|E
500|$|Evan Gutierrez from AllMusic {{considered}} the record's instrumentation, performance, and overall sonic palette to be [...] "minimalist" [...] and [...] "unassuming". Arjona experimented with prominent Latin sounds for Adentro, such as Mexican and Tejano music on [...] "Mojado", {{a duet with}} Mexican band Intocable about immigration. Ricky Muñoz, the vocalist of the group, said that the group met Arjona in Monterrey, {{and that they were}} in contact with Arjona through Carlos Cabral, one of Adentro producers, who had also worked with them formerly. Muñoz additionally reflected: [...] "We admire Arjona. We liked the song and then <b>we</b> <b>recorded</b> it [...] It is very cool that he invited us [...]" [...] "Adiós Melancolía" [...] is mainly composed as a bachata song with Colombian influences. [...] "No Te Cambio Por Nada" [...] is intermittently rock-dabbled. The lyrics of [...] "De Vez En Mes" [...] pertain to a woman's menstruation.|$|E

He said, [...] "you see Kelly doing her thing and then me on the other side doing mine. Eventually we come together just like how <b>we</b> <b>recorded</b> the song.

These reflections and more behind the scenes footage were revealed in the video clip [...] "Making of When Love Takes Over" [...] which was uploaded to Guetta's official YouTube channel on 1 June 2009. The music video itself premiered on 8 June 2009 on Guetta's YouTube channel.

Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a [...] "special thanks." ...|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{motor neurone}} disease, Hawking {{is unable to}} speak, and he {{communicates}} using a custom-made computer. With small movements of his body, Hawking writes a text onto the computer, which is then spoken by a voice syntheziser. Because of this, Hawking had to write all his lines on his computer, while the staff recorded them by placing a microphone {{in front of the}} computer's speaker. [...] "It's easy to do a fake Stephen Hawking in your comedy TV show", Selman said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "Any computer can sound just like his computer, but every line that we wrote for him, he typed in himself and <b>we</b> <b>recorded</b> with our microphones as if it had come out of a regular mouth." [...] Some of Hawking's lines were difficult to record.

500|$|The {{album was}} titled after the {{recurring}} theme {{of water in}} songs such as [...] "Diving for Hearts" [...] and [...] "I Would Like to Call It Beauty", while the music was said by Rae to possess [...] "a kind of tidal movement to it too, {{in the way that}} <b>we</b> <b>recorded</b> the songs. You know, sometimes it would just be me and my guitar. Then we'd really sort of swell up into these big arrangements, only to then retreat back to it just being me and my guitar again." [...] According to Chris Mugan from The Independent, The Sea was a departure from the polished sound of Rae's debut album, while Paste magazine's Steve Labate said Rae expanded on her debut's mix of contemporary R and older soul music by incorporating pop rock, singer-songwriter influences, and occasional elements of bossa nova and trip hop. In the opinion of Craig McLean from The Daily Telegraph, the record's music evoked Simone's singing and the 1968 Van Morrison album Astral Weeks.|$|E

Faley has claimed that [...] "the album {{fell into place}} itself, like the songs basically told us where {{they wanted to go}} on the album". Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress. The cover art was designed by a friend of the band members from Brighton, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, Echoclistel Lambietroy, was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, [...] "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, and we never really kind of considered the fact that it should sound like an album. I think <b>we</b> <b>recorded</b> all the songs and then they were there and it was like, 'Oh, we have to kind of stitch this together and make it sound like one piece.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{core of the}} album's {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} organ, honky-tonk piano, and electronic bass played by the Beach Boys themselves, rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work. Brian became obsessed with a three-tiered Baldwin organ during the album's recording, resulting in a more minimalist approach to the new arrangements {{in addition to the}} album's central timbre. Tape manipulation was another prominent feature, varispeed being applied to a few miscellaneous vocals. On [...] "She's Goin' Bald", a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer was used to raise the pitch of the group's vocals without affecting the tempo. The album continued Brian's exploration of [...] "party tracks"—a form of music which includes the sounds of people shouting and making noises, as if at a party. Mike Love, recalling how [...] "She's Goin' Bald" [...] was a song about fellatio, commented: [...] "We were stoned out of our heads. We were laughing our asses off when <b>we</b> <b>recorded</b> that stuff." [...] Brian had previously enacted this approach with Beach Boys' Party! in 1965, thereby mixing that record's style with the modular composition method he devised for [...] "Good Vibrations".|$|E

500|$|McMahan {{reflected}} on the album's success: [...] "We worked really hard on Spiderland. I mean, I definitely felt much more personal about it. I thought it represented us as people, musically, {{a lot more than}} Tweez did. That's about it. It seemed like when we were around, and actively playing and stuff, that people's responses to us were fairly ambivalent. I thought it was funny when the press picked up on it. For an independent release, it had a strange sort of audience and kept selling three or four years after <b>we</b> <b>recorded</b> it; it still sells more copies than when it first came out." [...] Touch and Go founder Corey Rusk said that Spiderland is [...] "like an icon now. But when it came out, nobody cared! The band had broken up by the time the album came out, and it really didn't sell particularly well or get written about all that much in the year it was released. But it was a revolutionary, groundbreaking record, and it's one of the few instances where people catch up to it later on."

500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way <b>we</b> <b>recorded</b> it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E
500|$|After the 53rd Grammy Awards, held in February 2011, {{band members}} Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood {{said in a}} {{backstage}} interview that work on the group's third album was almost complete.

In a blog entry on their website, the group said that [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] was among the last songs that were written for the album. Haywood commented, [...] "We were about six songs into recording and someone had this idea, so we sat down to write it." [...] Hillary Scott, Kelley and Haywood wrote the song with Dallas Davidson. Davidson discussed the conception of the song with country music blog Taste of Country: [...] "I {{went out on the}} road with them, and we wrote a couple of things. <b>We</b> <b>recorded</b> one song called 'We Own the Night'.
