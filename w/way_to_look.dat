5|$|Mitzeee and Riley begin a {{relationship}} and Mercedes continues to stalk Mitzeee. Mitzeee accuses Lynsey of being her stalker. She becomes axious after noticing her stalker {{has been in}} the flat. When Mercedes and Lynsey go to visit Mitzeee, Mitzeee threatens them with a knife and Lynsey leaves to find Riley. Mitzeee realises Mercedes is her stalker and they fight. Mitzeee drops the knife and Mercedes hits her over the head with a bottle, knocking her unconscious. Mercedes sees Lynsey and Riley returning to the flat and feeling desperate, stabs herself in the stomach in an attempt to turn Riley against Mitzeee. In hospital, Mercedes tells Riley and her family that Mitzeee stabbed her, and Mitzeee is arrested. Lynsey discovers that Mercedes is Mitzeee's stalker and that she stabbed herself, and tells Mercedes that she will expose her if she doesn't admit the truth. Mercedes discharges herself from hospital to speak to Lynsey, however, as she is on the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for her, Lynsey is found murdered in her flat. Mercedes enters into {{a relationship}} with Doctor Browning to make Riely jealous, however receives a phonecall from Jacqui while she is with Doctor Browning who tells her she has found Lynsey's scarf in Doctor Browning's drawer. Mercedes confronts Doctor Browning who confesses to murdering Lynsey so that she wouldn't expose Mercedes, having overheard their argument. She tries to run, but he kidnaps her and drives out of the village. He convinces Mercedes that he killed Lynsey because he loved her and they agree to run away together, but the police find them and arrest Doctor Browning.|$|E

These intrasexual displays of aggression are more frequent in females, and are vital when a breeding female is forcing both subadult and adult females to emigrate out of a familial group.|$|E

25|$|The goal {{of local}} helioseismology, a term first used in 1993, is to {{interpret}} the full wave field observed at the surface, not just the mode (more precisely, eigenmode) frequencies. Another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at it, is that global helioseismology studies standing waves of the entire Sun and local helioseismology studies propagating waves {{in parts of the}} Sun. A variety of solar phenomena are being studied, including sunspots, plage, supergranulation, giant cell convection, magnetically active region evolution, meridional circulation, and solar rotation. Local helioseismology provides a three-dimensional view of the solar interior, which is important to understand large-scale flows, magnetic structures, and their interactions in the solar interior.|$|E
25|$|These models {{rely on the}} {{assumption}} that asset price fluctuations are the result of a well-behaved random or stochastic process. This is why mainstream models (such as the famous Black-Scholes model) use normal probabilistic distributions to describe price movements. For all practical purposes, extreme variations can be ignored. Mandelbrot thought this was an awful <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at financial markets. For him, the distribution of price movements is not normal and has the property of kurtosis, where fat tails abound. This is a more faithful representation of financial markets: the movements of the Dow index for the past hundred years reveals a troubling frequency of violent movements. Still, conventional models used {{by the time of the}} 2008 financial crisis ruled out these extreme variations and considered they can only happen every 10,000 years. An obvious conclusion from Mandelbrot’s work is that greater regulation in financial markets is indispensable. Other contributions of his work for the study of stock market behaviour are the creation of new approaches to evaluate risk and avoid unanticipated financial collapses.|$|E

When she realizes that she can no longer stop Jo from doing what she wants, Ellen becomes her hunting partner, deciding it is the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after her. By the time of Ellen's final appearance, actress Alona Tal came to view their characters more as equals rather than mother and daughter.|$|E

500|$|Nitsche and Lowood {{describe}} {{two methods}} of approaching machinima: starting from {{a video game}} and seeking a medium for expression or for documenting gameplay ("inside-out"), and starting outside a game and using it merely as animation tool ("outside-in"). Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd similarly distinguish between works that retain noticeable connections to games, and those closer to traditional animation. Belonging to the former category, gameplay and stunt machinima began in 1997 with Quake done Quick. Although not the first speedrunners, its creators used external software to manipulate camera positions after recording, which, according to Lowood, elevated speedrunning [...] "from cyberathleticism to making movies". Stunt machinima remains popular. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd state that [...] stunt videos offer a new <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the game, and compare Battlefield 1942 machinima creators to the Harlem Globetrotters. Built-in features for video editing and post-recording camera positioning in Halo 3 were expected to facilitate gameplay-based machinima. MMORPGs and other virtual worlds have been captured in documentary films, such as Miss Galaxies 2004, a beauty pageant {{that took place in}} the virtual world of Star Wars Galaxies. Footage was distributed in the cover disc of the August 2004 issue of PC Gamer.

500|$|Until {{the start}} of the fourth season, the series was shot on {{traditional}} film stock. It (the first three seasons) were shot on wide screen 35mm film with and an aspect ratio of 1.78:1, and it was 3-perf Super 35mm film. After Rush began testing a Sony digital camera on the standing sets for two days prior to production on [...] "" [...] and demonstrated the footage to Braga and Berman, {{the decision was made to}} switch to digital production. Rush felt that the audience wouldn't see a great deal of difference as the footage can be shot in a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> the same as the earlier seasons, but felt that the filming in high definition would be a benefit because of the additional detail that could be seen on screen. At the time this was cutting edge for a TV show, with allowing the production team improved low-light performance and it enabled shooting more compared to chemical films. The actual camera used was the Sony HDW-F900 CineAlta High-Definition camera, and the recording technology also used Sony' CineAlta 24P, a trademarked name of that company. The decision to move to Sony's technology was a triple agreement of the three executive producers of the show, and also supported by the Directory of Photography. Season four's Blu-ray release of Enterprise in 1080p has been praised as sharp and with satisfying color, and the best looking of the seasons. The fourth season has been released multiple times, with latest as a combined full-series set in January 2017.|$|E
