25|$|Though {{known to}} keep her faith a private matter, her {{religion}} and proximity to the king made her the target of anti-Catholic sentiment. Catherine occupied herself with her faith. Her piety was widely known and was a characteristic in his wife that the King greatly admired; in his letters to his sister, Catherine's devoutness is described almost <b>with</b> <b>awe.</b> Her household contained between four and six priests, and in 1665, Catherine decided to build a religious house east of St James's to be occupied by thirteen Portuguese Franciscans {{of the order of}} St Peter of Alcantara. It was completed by 1667 and would become known as The Friary.|$|E

In a letter to his wife, Aline, he remarked: [...] "Now I'm doing work I love – and work you may be proud of. None of the drudgery of soldiering, but a double share of glory and thrills." [...] According to Hillis, Kilmer's fellow soldiers had accorded him much respect for his battlefield demeanour—"He was worshipped by the men about him. I have heard them speak <b>with</b> <b>awe</b> of his coolness and his nerve in scouting patrols in no man's land. This coolness and his habit of choosing, with typical enthusiasm, the most dangerous and difficult missions, led to his death." ...|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{was not as}} {{receptive}} to Rousseau’s ideas as she was to Locke’s; she appropriated the aesthetic of the sublime to challenge Rousseau's ideas regarding the education of women (discussed in more detail below). During the 18th century, [...] "the sublime" [...] was associated <b>with</b> <b>awe,</b> fear, strength and masculinity. As Myers writes, [...] "to convey her message for female readers that achievement comes from within, Wollstonecraft substitutes the strength, force, and mental expansion associated with heroic sublime for the littleness, delicacy, and beauty that Rousseau and aestheticians such as Edmund Burke equate with womanhood". [...] Unlike writers such as Rousseau and Burke, who portray women as innately weak and silly, Wollstonecraft argues that women can indeed achieve the intellectual heights associated with the sublime.|$|E

500|$|From {{his boyhood}} Wodehouse had {{been fascinated by}} America, which he {{conceived}} of as [...] "a land of romance"; he [...] "yearned" [...] to visit the country, and by 1904 he had earned enough to do so. In April he sailed to New York, which he found greatly to his liking. He noted in his diary: [...] "In New York gathering experience. Worth many guineas in the future but none for the moment". This prediction proved correct: few British writers had first-hand experience of the US, and his articles about life in New York brought him higher than usual fees. He later recalled that [...] "in 1904 anyone in the London writing world who had been to America was regarded <b>with</b> <b>awe</b> and looked upon as an authority on that terra incognita.... After that trip to New York I {{was a man who}} counted.... My income rose like a rocketing pheasant." ...|$|E
500|$|Even TIME {{magazine}} {{took note}} of Ward’s dominating performance. [...] Time noted: “The other entrants in the Intercollegiates last week had reason to consider <b>with</b> <b>awe</b> another athlete who—until he helped Michigan win the Western Conference title last week, with 60½ points to Indiana's 47½ had not often been heard of outside the Midwest, except {{as a member of}} Michigan's football team. He was Willis Ward, 196-lb. Negro sophomore. At the Big Ten meet in Evanston last week. Willis Ward won the 100-yd. dash in 9.6 sec. He won the high jump, placed second in the broad jump. In the 120-yd. high hurdles, he forced Ohio State's Jack Keller to world's record time of 14.1 sec., finished a close second. The 18 points he won were what enabled Michigan to beat Indiana. They made his the most efficient individual performance in a Big Ten meet since Carl Johnson scored 20 points for Michigan in 1918. Quiet, unassuming, an above-average student of literature, Ward was the first Negro ever elected to Sphinx, Michigan's junior honor society.” ...|$|E
500|$|The Monadnock {{belongs to}} the Printing House Row District, a National Historic Landmark which {{includes}} the Manhattan Building, the Old Colony Building, and the Fisher Building, some of Chicago's seminal early skyscrapers. The Manhattan Building, built by William LeBaron Jenney in 1890, was the first building in Chicago with a complete steel skeleton or [...] "Chicago" [...] construction, an innovation Jenney had introduced in the Home Insurance Building in 1884. The first 16-story building in America, {{at the time it}} was [...] "regarded <b>with</b> <b>awe</b> and fear". Jenney's masterpiece, the Manhattan was considered a technical triumph in construction. The 17-story Old Colony, built by Holabird & Roche in 1894, was considered one of the structural masterpieces of its time for its revolutionary portal form of bracing. It is the only survivor of a group of Chicago school buildings with rounded corner bays. The Fisher Building, built by Burnham in 1894, was an engineering miracle—the first tall commercial building to be built almost entirely without bricks. Its steel frame and thin terracotta curtain wall allowed two-thirds of the surface to be covered with glass.|$|E

500|$|In John, Jesus' miracles are {{described}} as [...] "signs", performed to prove his mission and divinity. However, in the Synoptics, when asked by some teachers of the Law and some Pharisees to give miraculous signs to prove his authority, Jesus refuses, saying that no sign shall come to corrupt and evil people except {{the sign of the}} prophet Jonah. Also, in the Synoptic Gospels, the crowds regularly respond to Jesus' miracles <b>with</b> <b>awe</b> and press on him to heal their sick. In John's Gospel, Jesus is presented as unpressured by the crowds, who often respond to his miracles with trust and faith. One characteristic shared among all miracles of Jesus in the gospel accounts is that he performed them freely and never requested or accepted any form of payment. The gospel episodes that include descriptions of the miracles of Jesus also often include teachings, and the miracles themselves involve an element of teaching. Many of the miracles teach the importance of faith. In the cleansing of ten lepers and the raising of Jairus' daughter, for instance, the beneficiaries are told that their healing was due to their faith.|$|E

Pope Francis recorded a video message for the occasion, in which he described the image on the shroud as [...] "this Icon of a man", and stated that [...] "the Man of the Shroud invites us to contemplate Jesus of Nazareth."

2500|$|The Old Testament was {{compiled}} and edited by various men {{over a period}} of centuries, with many scholars concluding that the Hebrew canon was solidified by about the 3rd century BC. [...] The works have been subject to various literary evaluations (both secular and religious). Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: “In the Jewish Old Testament, there are men, things and speeches in so grand a style that Greek and Indian literature have nothing to compare to it. One stands <b>with</b> <b>awe</b> and reverence before these tremendous remnants of what man once was... The taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone of 'greatness' and 'smallness'.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The USSR voted at the UN for {{establishment}} of Israel. When {{it became apparent}} that Israel would not turn Communist Stalin became hostile to Israel and the USSR served diplomatic and military interests in the Arab world. This caused major crises and mass exit in both Kibbutz Meuchad and Kibbutz Artzi kibbutzim, especially after the 1952 Rudolf Slánský Prague show trials in which most of the accused and executed party functionaries were Jews and the 1953 Doctors' plot in Moscow of mostly Jews. Nonetheless many kibbutzim cancelled Purim celebrations when Stalin collapsed on March 1, 1953. Despite Communist atrocities and increasing state antisemitism in the USSR and its satellites many in the far left kibbutz movement, like Hashomer HaTzair (The Young Guard) viewed Stalin <b>with</b> <b>awe</b> and leader of the [...] "peace camp".

The only extant dispositional awe scale (Shiota, Keltner, and John [2006]) conceptualizes awe rather broadly {{and with a}} focus on natural beauty as elicitor. We formulated items that would allow distinguishing awe from admiration and adoration and that tap into awe elicited by persons. In keeping <b>with</b> <b>awe’s</b> defining features (Keltner and Haidt [2003]), the items focused on perceptions of vastness and need for accommodation, for instance, “I am overwhelmed and bewildered in view of the grandness of a person or object”.|$|R
