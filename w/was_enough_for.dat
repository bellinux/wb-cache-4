5|$|A 45-goal {{season in}} 1989–90 <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Nieuwendyk {{to lead the}} team in goal scoring for the third {{consecutive}} season. He missed he first 11 games of the 1991–92 NHL season after suffering a knee injury during a summer evaluation camp for the 1991 Canada Cup. Nieuwendyk began the season as the 12th captain in the Flames franchise history. He was limited to 22 goals and 56 points on the season, but scored his 200th career goal on December 3, 1991, against the Detroit Red Wings. His 230th career goal, scored against the Tampa Bay Lightning on November 13, 1992, established a Flames franchise record for career goals (since broken).|$|E
5|$|Arsenal played Newcastle United in {{the sixth}} round on 9 March 2002. It was the second meeting between both teams in a week, {{and in spite of}} Arsenal winning the first fixture and scoring the opener in the cup tie, Newcastle held them to a 1–1 draw. A replay was {{scheduled}} two weeks later at noon. Arsenal won by three goals to nil, but during the match lost Robert Pirès to injury; he was ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} season with medial knee ligament damage. An own goal by Middlesbrough's Gianluca Festa, from an Henry free-kick, <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Arsenal to win the semi-final.|$|E

5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 25,000 tickets, {{fewer than the}} 32,000 received for the semi-finals. The allocation <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the 21,000 Stoke City season ticket holders, but not for Manchester City's 36,000 season ticket holders. Consequently, some supporters felt aggrieved {{at the lack of}} tickets, including Stoke City chairman Peter Coates who expressed his disappointment and suggested an allocation in the region of 30,000 for both clubs. Ticket prices for the final exceeded £100 for the first time. The most expensive tickets cost £115, an increase of 22percent on the previous season. The cheapest tickets available at £45, up £5 from 2010.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{tight end}} John Gilmore picked up Vinatieri's {{bouncing}} kickoff {{and returned it}} 9-yards to his own 45-yard line, with an unnecessary roughness penalty on Mathis adding another 15yards and giving the Bears a first down on the Colts' 40-yard line. Chicago could only gain 14yards on their ensuing possession, but it <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Robbie Gould to make a 44-yard field goal, cutting the score to 22–17.|$|E

5|$|Galatasaray faced Bologna in the competition's third round. The {{first game}} was played at Stadio Renato Dall'Ara, which ended in a 1–1 draw; the Italian side took the lead after a Giuseppe Signori goal during the second half, before Hakan Şükür {{levelled}} the score, with eight minutes remaining. At home, the Turkish side scored twice during the first half, and conceded once, as they won the match 2–1, and the overall leg 3–2. Galatasaray were pitted against Borussia Dortmund in the fourth round. Gala won 2–0 away at Westfalenstadion, while a scoreless draw in the homecoming match <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Galatasaray to see them through.|$|E

Johnston recovered {{in time for the}} final tour match before the Tests, a match against a South African XI, effectively a full-strength Test team. Johnston took 2/81 in his only innings but it <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> captain Lindsay Hassett to put him in the Test team.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 2003, Arsenal {{opened up}} an eight-point lead {{at the top}} of the table, winning 2–0 against Charlton Athletic. The result <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Irish {{bookmaker}} Paddy Power to pay out on punters backing Arsenal to retain their lead, despite Manchester United having a game in hand. The gap was cut to two points after Arsenal suffered their first defeat in 2003, against Blackburn Rovers. By the time Arsenal played Everton on 23 March 2003, they were displaced {{at the top of}} the table by Manchester United. A goal by Vieira moved the team two points clear once more.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Æthelberht's influence in other kingdoms <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> him to convert any other kings to Christianity, although this is partly {{due to the lack of}} sources—nothing is known of Sussex's history, for example, for almost all of the seventh and eighth centuries. Æthelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the Severn valley, on the northwestern borders of Wessex, however, and this may be an indication of the extent of his influence in the west. No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of Mercia, but it is known that Mercia was independent of Northumbria, so it is quite plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship.|$|E
5|$|Alexios was {{replaced}} as commander by John Tarchaneiotes, first cousin of Andronikos II, and {{disappeared from the}} scene for 30 years. His successors proved greatly inferior, and by 1323, Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced. At that point, Patriarch Jesaias urged Andronikos to recall the aged general. A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324. Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated exclave of Philadelphia, which had been long under siege {{and was ready to}} fall. He was given no army, but, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, the mere news of Alexios's approach, and the respect in which the Turks held him, <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the siege to be lifted. Alexios was appointed governor of the city, a position he retained until 1327.|$|E
