5|$|During the {{preliminary}} hearing in late July, prosecutors presented testimonies from Jew's neighbors at both of his homes, indicating that Jew had never lived in his 28th Avenue house {{and spent most of}} his time in Burlingame. Testimony from a U.S. Postal Service inspector revealed that Jew's first-class mail went to Burlingame while junk mail went to his San Francisco address; prosecutors cited utility bills showing low usage of <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>electricity</b> at his 28th Avenue home, as well as loan applications that indicated he lived in Burlingame. In his defense, Jew produced a jury duty summons to indicate his address in San Francisco, and questioned the possible bias of the witnesses against him.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, the Superior Courts of Justice and the School of Arts vacated the {{building}} after {{moving into a}} new courthouse which had been built {{on the site of}} Auberge d'Auvergne. The building was to be converted into an examination hall, but in August of that year, it was assigned to the Posts and Telephones Department. After extensive renovations, the auberge opened as the General Post Office on 4 July 1973, taking over the role from Palazzo Parisio. The auberge remained the GPO until Posta Limited opened a new complex at Marsa in October 1997. The auberge was also used by the <b>Water</b> <b>and</b> <b>Electricity</b> Department, the Agricultural Department and the Central Office of Statistics.|$|E

5|$|In Mier, the {{spillway}} of the Las Blancas Dam was overtopped, {{causing a}} river bridge {{to be destroyed}} and electric power to be lost, as well. In Río Bravo, 50families were evacuated as seven collective farms became hard to reach by road; approximately 90% of the residences in the farms were affected by the storm. In Altamira, 200families were evacuated as well, and relocated to seven shelters. Also, in the municipalities of Burgos, Cruillas, and Méndez there was flooding in collective farms and family dwellings. Overall, the municipalities of Mier, Reynosa, Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, Matamoros, San Fernando, San Carlos, Burgos, Cruillas, Méndez, Soto la Marina, Mante and Altamira were affected in the state, losing potable <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to contemporary music, the festival hosts dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other arts. Leading pop and rock artists have headlined, alongside {{thousands of others}} appearing on smaller stages and performance areas. Films and albums recorded at Glastonbury have been released, and the festival receives extensive television and newspaper coverage. Glastonbury is the largest greenfield festival in the world, and is now attended by around 175,000 people, requiring extensive infrastructure in terms of security, transport, <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> <b>electricity</b> supply. The majority of staff are volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for charity organisations.|$|E
5|$|In his ministerial role, Constantine {{promoted}} {{development of}} Trinidad's road, rail, <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>electricity</b> infrastructure. However, in late 1958 {{he was accused}} of corruption, over a ship leasing deal. His angry response to the charge, in the Legislative Council, created a perception of arrogance among his colleagues, and suggested that he had not sufficiently adapted to parliamentary politics. According to Mason, the speech was a miscalculation which made the public, perhaps already sceptical of his commitment to Trinidad after so many years away, question his fitness for a ministerial role, a view increasingly held by commentators.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{properties}} in Salta is known to date from the 16th century, and the hamlet has been continually inhabited ever since. During the Second World War, 43 evacuees from the Newcastle-Upon-Tyne area were billeted to the parish of Holme St. Cuthbert, and several ended up in Salta. Development in the 20th century saw new houses built, but mainline <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>electricity</b> arrived later than {{in other parts of}} Britain, perhaps due to the small population. Excavations of a cropmark enclosure at Edderside, beyond the Moss to the southeast of Salta, were conducted in 1989–1990 by Robert H. Bewley.|$|E
5|$|Running <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>electricity</b> are {{supplied}} at {{the national}} level by a government service provider, Jirama, which is unable to service the entire population. , only 6.8percent of Madagascar's fokontany had access to water provided by Jirama, while 9.5percent had access to its electricity services. 56% of Madagascar's power is provided by hydroelectric power plants with the remaining 44% provided by diesel engine generators. Mobile telephone and internet access are widespread in urban areas but remain limited in rural parts of the island. Approximately 30percent of the districts are able to access the nations' several private telecommunications networks via mobile telephones or land lines.|$|E
5|$|After {{independence}} in 1960, {{the pace of}} growth increased further. The city's population reached 1.4 million {{by the end of}} the 20th century; in 2013, it was estimated at nearly 2.1 million. Uncontrolled urban sprawl has challenged the city's infrastructure, producing shortages of clean <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>electricity,</b> sanitation and public health problems, and heavy traffic congestion. There are more than 5,000 church buildings in the city and its suburbs, including an Anglican and a Roman Catholic cathedral. Antananarivo is the see city of Madagascar's Roman Catholic Archdiocese. The city has repeatedly been the site of large demonstrations and violent political clashes, including the 1972 rotaka that brought down president Philibert Tsiranana and the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, which resulted in Andry Rajoelina replacing Marc Ravalomanana as head of state.|$|E

5|$|Some of the privatised industries, {{including}} gas, <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> <b>electricity,</b> were natural monopolies {{for which}} privatisation involved little increase in competition. The privatised industries that demonstrated improvement sometimes did so while still under state ownership. British Steel Corporation had made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government-appointed MacGregor chairmanship, which faced down trade-union opposition to close plants and halve the workforce. Regulation was also significantly expanded {{to compensate for}} the loss of direct government control, with the foundation of regulatory bodies such as Oftel (1984), Ofgas (1986), and the National Rivers Authority (1989). There was no clear pattern to the degree of competition, regulation, and performance among the privatised industries; in most cases privatisation benefited consumers in terms of lower prices and improved efficiency, but the results overall are said to have been mixed.|$|E
5|$|Under Morales, Bolivia {{experienced}} unprecedented economic strength, {{resulting in}} the increase in value of its currency, the boliviano. His {{first year in office}} ended with no fiscal deficit; the first time this had happened in Bolivia for 30 years, while during the global financial crisis of 2007–08 it maintained some of the world's highest levels of economic growth. Such economic strength led to a nationwide boom in construction, and allowed the state to build up strong financial reserves. Although the levels of social spending were increased, they remained relatively conservative, with a major priority being placed on constructing paved roads, as well as community spaces such as soccer fields and union buildings. In particular, the government focused on rural infrastructure improvement, to bring roads, running <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> <b>electricity</b> to areas that lacked them.|$|E
5|$|In Oman, {{production}} of desalinated water was interrupted, as both of Oman's desalination plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of natural gas, halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding. These plants provided water to Muscat's 631,000residents and surrounding areas, triggering severe water shortages across eastern Oman. To rectify the situation, officials used water tanks. The water returned to near normal in five days, {{as the two}} plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair the power outages across the region. Five days after Gonu hit, utilities were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces. The Omani army assisted residents in returning to their houses. Even though the Omani government did not request any international aid, the United States offered assistance through naval ships in the area; this was eventually rejected. The country lost an estimated $200million (2007USD) in oil exports. In the months after the storm, the government allocated funds {{for the removal of}} debris and trees, as well as restoration of roads in tourist areas. Additionally, the National Committee for Civil Defence set up 139buildings to provide temporary housing for 8,192people. Services such as <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>electricity</b> were gradually restored, and people returned to their homes. By two weeks after the storm's passage, most of those remaining in shelters were from Qurayat, one of the most severely affected villages.|$|E
