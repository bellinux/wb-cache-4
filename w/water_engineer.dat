500|$|Stamford Canal, now disused, {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} post-Roman canals in England. It opened in 1670, around 100 years {{before the start of the}} Industrial Revolution which brought about the [...] "golden age" [...] for canals in Britain. Parts of the route can be traced on the ground, though only one lock survives intact. It was part of the Welland Navigation in Lincolnshire. [...] First authorised in 1571, during the reign of Elizabeth I, construction did not start until 1664, under powers granted in 1620 and ratified by James I. It ran for [...] from Stamford to Market Deeping and had 12 locks, two of which were on the river section at Deeping St James. No plans of its construction survive, although one of the locks was documented by a visiting <b>water</b> <b>engineer</b> in 1699. It contributed to the wealth of Stamford, allowing barley to be transported to the town for malting.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there are}} no known records {{from the time the}} canal was constructed, the lock at Hudd's Mill was {{documented}} by Thomas Surbey in 1699. Surbey was a <b>water</b> <b>engineer,</b> and made notes and drawings when he visited it, during a journey from London to York. The lock chamber was [...] long and [...] wide. The gates were hung on stone piers, but the banks between them were of earth. The gates were conventional 'V' gates, similar to modern ones, which included some sort of paddle, but did not include balance beams. Instead, a chain or rope was attached to the mid-stream edge of the gate and to the bank. While this would have made opening the gates possible, it is not obvious how they were shut. The measurements match those of the surviving structures, with the exception of Briggin's lock, which appears to only be [...] long. There is no visible evidence that it was shortened at some point, nor any obvious reason why it would have been built shorter than all the others.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Water</b> <b>engineer</b> Ken Wright {{estimates}} that 60 {{percent of the}} Inca construction effort was underground. The Inca built their cities with locally available materials, usually including limestone or granite. To cut these hard rocks the Inca used stone, bronze or copper tools, usually splitting the stones along the natural fracture lines. Without the wheel the stones were rolled up wood beams on earth ramps. Extraordinary manpower would have been necessary. Hyslop comments that the 'secret' {{to the production of}} fine Inca masonry…was the social organization necessary to maintain the great numbers of people creating such energy-consuming monuments.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first free}} public library in Runcorn was {{established}} in 1882. [...] This was housed in {{a room in the}} Town Hall, which was at that time Waterloo House in Waterloo Road. It was opened with great celebration by Sir John Picton, the chairman of the Liverpool Free Library Committee. [...] The demand was so great that within a year two more rooms were required and a reading room was opened. [...] Three years later two additional rooms were opened and in 1889 a lady's reading room was provided. In 1897, further books and a natural history collection were added to the library and it was further expanded the following year. [...] This was still inadequate for the demands being made upon it and it was decided that the only solution would be an entirely new building. [...] An appeal for a grant towards a new building was made to Andrew Carnegie, who had provided grants for many other libraries in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. [...] Following what seemed at first to have been a refusal, Carnegie gave a grant of £3,000. [...] The new library was built adjacent to Waterloo House. [...] It was designed by James Wilding, surveyor and <b>water</b> <b>engineer</b> to the Runcorn Urban District Council. [...] The library was opened with little ceremony on 1December 1906 by Mr.D.Bisbrown, chairman of the Council. [...] It remained Runcorn's central library until {{the development of a new}} town in Runcorn in the 1960s and 1970s. [...] Then a larger library was opened adjacent to the new shopping centre at Halton Lea, and the Carnegie Library became a branch library. [...] It closed in 2012.|$|E
