50|$|The larvae feed on Quercus palustris. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The larva forms a {{characteristic}} oval spiral mine in the bark of young branches of pin oak. The mine is a narrow linear track, closely coiled in a flattened oval spiral, resembling a <b>watch</b> <b>spring.</b> The empty egg shell often remains attached to the bark {{in the center of}} the mine after the larva has deserted the mine. The bark of old mines cracks and often breaks away entirely, leaving the inner bark exposed, producing scars which persist for a number of years.|$|E
50|$|A CNT spring made of {{bundles of}} densely packed 1 nm {{diameter}} SWCNTs stretched to a 10% strain {{is predicted to}} have an energy density of 3.4 kJ/m3. The energy density of CNT springs loaded in tension {{is higher than the}} energy density of CNT springs loaded in compression. Whereas the current maximum energy density of a carbon-steel <b>watch</b> <b>spring</b> is reported to be between 1080 kJ/m3 and 3000 kJ/m3. Calculations show that when a support structure made of single crystal silicon carbide is used the energy density of CNT springs reduces to 1 kJ/m3. Even after considering a support structure and other energy extraction hardware associated with a CNT spring energy harvesting device, its energy density is much greater than mechanical springs and is in approximately the same range as that of lithium-ion batteries. The energy density is much lower than the energy density of any hydrocarbon used in combustion processes.|$|E

40|$|A point charge moving uniformly {{around a}} circle {{produces}} an electric field pattern which co-rotates with it, constituting, for relativistic motion, synchrotron radiation. Surprisingly perhaps, {{the wealth of}} knowledge on synchrotron radiation {{does not seem to}} include explicit knowledge of the field itself, and of the consequent field lines. As with any relativistic motion, there is an obstruction to writing an explicit formula for the field; evaluation of the retarded time requires solving an implicit equation. However, as the relativistic limit is approached the field grows very strong in a very confined ribbon region shaped like a spiral <b>watch</b> <b>spring.</b> Here, the field can be written as an explicit scaling, or universal similarity, formula, which is our main result. From it the field lines can be derived analytically. In terms of scaled coordinates along the directions of the length, width and thickness of the ribbon, they twist in two side-by-side bundles in 'bipolar ' cylinder surfaces, mirror symmetric about the orbit plane...|$|E
40|$|The work {{contains}} a grammatical and linguistic {{analysis of the}} texts of watch advertisements placed in Polish and Russian press. The research {{has been carried out}} on the basis of marketing contents printed among others in the following magazines published in Russia: „Семь дней”, „Домовой”, „Деловые люди”, „Мои Часы”, „Комсомольская правда”, „Культ личности”, „Ведомости” and in Poland: „Twój Styl”, „Cosmopolitan”, „Viva”, „Elle”, „Fokus”, „Vogue”, „Kronos”, „Zegarki & Biżuteria”. The pronouns {{play an important role in}} advertising texts. Thanks to them we become aware of persons, objects, circumstances and features, to which they refer not only against a background of a situation in which somebody speaks, but also against a background of a context, e. g. the pronoun we in the content of an advertisement may mean the manufacturer, the seller; We, that is all reading this text; future buyers of the watch. The pronoun вы is used often as well, particularly in watch advertisements printed in Russian press, e. g. : С нами Вы передаете свой стиль следующему поколению (Швейцарские часы Патек Филипп – Patek Philippe). In watch advertisements printed in Polish press often appears the pronoun you, e. g. : Is it You? (advertising of the SEIKO <b>watch,</b> <b>Spring</b> Driver – chronograph). The purpose of the use of pronouns in advertising texts is to establish a personal contact with customers, it brings the identification of a potential buyer with a group possessing or wanting to have the given product. The advertisement text of such type has a wide readership; it can refer to each reader. In the summary of the paper there have been discussed cultural aspects of the language of watch advertisements as well as the function and role of pronouns appearing in commercial texts, usually written on commission and sponsored...|$|E

50|$|A modern watch {{mainspring}} is a {{long strip}} of hardened and blued steel, or specialised steel alloy, 20-30 cm long and 0.05-0.2 mm thick. The mainspring in the common 1-day movement is calculated to enable the watch to run for 36 to 40 hours, i.e. with a power-reserve for 12 to 16 hours, which is the normal standard for hand-wound as well as self-winding watches. 8-Day movements, used in clocks meant to be wound weekly, provide power for at least 192 hours but use longer mainsprings and bigger barrels. Clock mainsprings are similar to <b>watch</b> <b>springs,</b> only larger.|$|R
