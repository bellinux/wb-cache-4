Taking the year’s theme ‘inspiring change’, we set {{ourselves}} a 48 -hour Twitter challenge. Our goal was to help us better {{understand some of the}} very real challenges women face in graphic design and equally, to celebrate women who have inspired change; for example, through projects, teaching or mentoring. We asked our friends, colleagues, as well as the broader design community to help us by reTweeting but also by actively participating in our Twitter conversations. <b>We</b> <b>presented</b> <b>our</b> <b>findings</b> and responses at the Design Culture Salon: 'What are the gender politics of contemporary design practice?’ (7 March 2014, 7 : 00 - 8 : 30 pm, V&A, London) Further details here: [URL] The Twitter conversation was run from 4 - 5 March by @WomensDesign and @wofgd using the hashtags: #womensday #graphicdesig...|$|E
40|$|On December 19, 2015, Scholtes et al. 's {{work was}} {{published}} online in the Journal of Empirical Software Engineering, {{in which they}} challenged the exciting findings that we (with another co-author) presented in 2014, showing that open source software production exhibits superlinear productive bursts. <b>We</b> <b>presented</b> <b>our</b> <b>findings</b> as the first quantification of Aristotle's famous adage: The whole {{is more than the}} sum of its parts. In contrast, Scholtes et al. referred to Maximilien Ringelmann, a French agricultural engineer (1861 - 1931) who discovered the tendency for individual members of a group to become increasingly less productive as the size of their group increases. Since Ringelmann, the topic of collective intelligence has interested numbers of researchers in social sciences, as well as practitioners in management aiming at improving the performance of their team. And indeed, in most research and practice case studies, the Ringelmann effect has been found to hold. Our results challenge common wisdom, precisely because the Ringelmann effect has been replicated in countless experiments. We are glad that the study by Scholtes et al. allows us to explain further our findings by highlighting the methodological aspects that condition our diverging results. In particular, the definitions of group sizes and measurement periods are essential to explain the different conclusions. This healthy debate enriches the understanding on group productivity, in particular in the case of open source software production.

40|$|Background: Certifying {{physicians}} play a {{key role}} in the management of sickness absence and are often provided with guidelines. Some of these guidelines contain statements on expected sickness absence duration, according to diagnosis. We were interested in exploring the evidence base of these statements. Methods: We identified guidelines through a survey of EUMASS members and a literature search of the Internet and PubMed. We extracted the statements and methods from the guidelines. We compared: diagnoses that were addressed, expected durations and development processes followed. Next, <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> <b>our</b> <b>findings</b> to the developers, to afford them an opportunity to comment and/or correct any misinterpretations. Results: We identified 4 guidelines from social insurance institutions (France, Serbia, Spain and Sweden) and 4 guidelines from private organisations (1 Netherlands, 3 US). Guidelines addressed between 63 and some 63000 health conditions (ICD 10 codes). Health conditions overlapped among guidelines. Direct comparison is hampered by differences in coding (ICD 9 or 10) and level of aggregation (three or four digit, clustering of diseases and treatment situations). Expectations about duration are defined as minimum, maximum, and optimum or mean or median and percentile distribution, stratified to age and work requirements. In a sample of 5 diagnoses we found overlap in expected duration but also differences. Guidelines are developed differently, pragmatic expert consensus being used most, supplemented with data on sickness absence from different registers, other guidelines and non-systematic literature reviews. The effectiveness of these guidelines has not yet been formally evaluated. Conclusions: Expectations about duration of sickness absence by diagnosis are expressed in several guidelines. The expectations are difficult to compare, their evidence base is unclear and their effectiveness needs to be established...|$|E

40|$|Handover is {{a crucial}} part of patient care and is a well {{recognized}} cause of patient harm if not performed well. The introduction of full shift working for doctors has placed even more emphasis on this area of patient care. We identified handover of orthopaedic admissions in our unit was substandard. A prospective audit over a one week period including the weekend was undertaken. The Royal College of Surgeons of England guidance on handovers was used as minimum criteria and we also included criteria essential for handover of orthopaedic patients. This initial audit revealed a poor standard of handover. 21 patients were included and in particular patient location (57 %), responsible consultant (14 %), and pending investigations (29 %) were poorly performed. In addition two patient safety incidents were noted, including one admission that was not handed over. To improve the handover we created a trauma specific handover proforma. We then conducted a re-audit again over a one week period including the weekend with the proforma in use. There was a notable improvement, 17 patients were included and only 3 criteria fell below 80 %. <b>We</b> <b>presented</b> <b>our</b> <b>findings</b> at the local audit meeting where the results were discussed with all members of the trauma team. We suggested that an electronic proforma, accessible from multiple computers within the hospital may improve handover further. This was created in conjunction with the IT department. Once again we reaudited handover over a one week period including the weekend with the electronic proforma in use. 23 patients were included and a further improvement was noted; only one criterion fell below 95 %. In conclusion handover of acute fracture admissions within the unit has undoubtedly improved. The electronic proforma tool was a simple, cost effective, and accurate method of improving handover...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Defense (DOD) is working to achieve information superiority over adversaries and share information seamlessly among disparate weapons systems. Two programs envisioned {{as a part of}} this effort are Transformational Satellite Communications System (TSAT) and Space Radar. TSAT is designed to provide rapid worldwide secure communications with air and space systems [...] including Space Radar [...] through radio frequency and laser communications links. Space Radar is expected to provide global all-weather intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, particularly in denied areas, for military, national intelligence, and civil users. Both TSAT and Space Radar will require major software development efforts and employ a significant number of experienced staff. TSAT and Space Radar development efforts are expected to be among the most costly space systems ever developed by DOD. In 2004, TSAT was estimated to have a total life cycle cost of about $ 16 billion, of which $ 2. 0 billion will have been spent at the end of fiscal year 2007. Space Radar is estimated to have a total life cycle cost from $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion, and the program has spent about approximately $ 464. 5 million. TSAT expects to begin product development in fiscal year 2008, and launch the first satellite {{in the first quarter of}} fiscal year 2016. Space Radar expects to begin product development in fiscal year 2009 and launch the first satellite in third quarter of fiscal year 2016. The systems are also expected to be among the most complex ever developed, largely because of the challenges associated with integrating critical technologies within the satellites and networking the satellites to other platforms. Congress requested that GAO assess DOD's progress in adopting best practice as both of these programs proceed toward product development. <b>We</b> <b>presented</b> <b>our</b> <b>findings</b> on TSAT and Space Radar in briefings to Congressional staffs in March 2007.

40|$|The {{concentrated}} ethnographic {{study reported}} in this paper represents an ethically driven project which sought to ‘allow’ the Jakun peoples of the Orang Asli (the indigenous people of western or peninsular Malaysia) {{to have a voice}} in an increasingly complex, difficult and monochrome neoliberal socio-cultural environment. The primary fieldwork was completed in 2014. Our findings indicated an erosion of their environment and lifestyles and growing perceptions of powerlessness amongst the people. We noted a ‘clash of cultures’ (although not in Huntington’s sense) in which normative neoliberal pressures and expectations appeared to be promoted within mainstream society without question. These findings were interpreted using sociological and anthropological theorisation highlighting potential dialogic ways forward for the communities using their traditional approaches to conflict resolution. Our initial work resulted in 10 recommendations that were offered to the Tasik Chini Research Centre at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia with whom we were attached. <b>We</b> <b>presented</b> <b>our</b> <b>findings</b> and recommendations to the people we worked with in the communities and has since been disseminated widely {{as one of the few}} ways that seemingly impotent social work researchers could amplify the people’s unheard voices. The problems and opportunities of being foreign researchers imbued with a certain level of privilege conducting research with an oppressed minority led to reflection concerning the complexities and nuances of research and the pursuit of social justice. The acronym AESThETICS captured our reflections in understanding ethnographic research as a type of social work practice: • Activism and social research • Ethics and social research • Social justice and post-post-colonial research • Theorising for better practice • Empowering communities • Training and education • Inclusion • Criticality • Support This model has potential to help work within the messy and complicated area of international research, social justice, and privilege versus minority statuses. This paper briefly reports the study, findings and interpretation and then, drawing on our reflections, it explores and problematizes the ethnography whilst suggesting ways in which it can be employed as part of an engaged approach to social work research and practice...|$|E

40|$|This {{deliverable}} {{summarizes the}} activity of the second FORWARDworkshop. This workshop constituted {{the end of the second}} phase of the project. The aim of this second phase was to establish a number of working groups; each working group had to identify a number of emerging threats in their respective areas (malware and fraud, smart environments, and critical systems). These threats were summarized in three threat reports (Deliverable D 2. 1. x), one per working group. The goal of the second workshop was to checkpoint and critically review the work that has been done in the working groups, in particular, the threat reports. More precisely, each working group should present their threats to a larger audience comprised of experts. In discussions and presentations, we wanted to make sure that the lists of threats are comprehensive – that is, each working group has identified all major threats in their respective areas. Moreover, we wanted to use the workshop to establish an initial ranking for the threats presented by each working group. Clearly, at one point, it is necessary to prioritize threats and focus the attention on those that present the largest threat potential to ICT infrastructures and the society at large. Of course, the assessment of the danger that each threat poses, as well as an analysis of inter-dependencies among threats, is a focus of the third project phase (which is to be completed by the end of the year). However, we attempted to leverage the presence of a large amount of domain experts to obtain an initial ranking that would combine and reflect the viewpoints of a large audience. For the second workshop, we decided to invite a number of selected speakers that would give presentations at the beginning of the workshop on the first day and later during the second day. The talks set a framework in which the detailed technical discussions about the individual threat reports could take place. For these discussions, the attendees would first break into working group sessions to perform the necessary review of the threats that each group had defined. Then, in a next step, the outcome of each discussion was presented to the audience at large. This twostep process served two purposes. First, in the actual discussion sessions, we had less people involved. Thismade the discussion process manageable and interactive. In the second step, <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> <b>our</b> <b>findings</b> in a succinct fashion to the whole audience. This allowed everybody who participated in the first discussion round to ensure that their opinions were correctly reflected. In addition, it allowed people that were present in other working group discussions to see what other groups did, and to provide feedback. According to Annex 1, a total of 60 attendees was considered to be the threshold for a successful workshop. This threshold was significantly exceeded, with a total of 103 attendees. This clearly demonstrates the significant interest and participation to the FORWARD working groups and workshops. Moreover, nonacademic participation remains to be strong. 39 attendees (37. 8 % of the participants) came from industry or policy-making institutions. In this document, we first summarize the three working group discussions that were held during the two-day workshop. In addition to the discussion sessions, a total of 11 talks were given in the form of plenary talks and keynotes. Moreover, we had 7 five-minute work-in-progress talks. These talks are summarized in the subsequent chapter. Finally, we discuss the conclusions that the consortium has drawn from the workshop, and we briefly outline the future actions that we plan to take in the subsequent, third phase of the project...|$|E
