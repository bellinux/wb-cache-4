5|$|As {{early as}} 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper {{essentially}} predicting {{the existence of}} the positron, after a paper by Paul Dirac proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, known as the Dirac equation, which unified quantum mechanics, special relativity and the then-new concept of electron spin, to explain the Zeeman effect. Oppenheimer, drawing on the body of experimental evidence, rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were protons. He argued that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, Carl David Anderson discovered the positron, for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a mass that is less than 0.55 {{times that of the}} Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{foreigner}} {{and possibly a}} hetaera, Aspasia was free of the legal restraints that traditionally confined married women to their homes, and thereby was allowed {{to participate in the}} public life of the city. She became the mistress of the statesman Pericles in the early 440s. After he divorced his first wife (c. 445 BC), Aspasia began to live with him, although her marital status remains disputed. Their son, Pericles the Younger, must have been born by 440 BC. Aspasia <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been quite young, if she were able to bear a child to Lysicles c. 428 BC.|$|E

50|$|Kölling {{did not act}} on the discovery. However, on May 11, 2006 Microsoft {{attempted}} to patent the idea.

50|$|George Andrew Reisner {{proposed}} that Takatamun {{might have been}} buried in Nuri in Tomb 21.

5|$|Several {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn {{about the nature of}} it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss, there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was {{in the best position to}} judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} natural resonance frequency of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{governance and}} liquidity {{explanations for the}} discount of preferred shares to common shares in the Russian market. Conflicts between shareholder classes may help explain the discount. However, {{for this to be}} the sole explanation the estimated models suggest that the magnitude of future expected adverse shareholder events <b>would</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been very high in 2000. These beliefs <b>would</b> then <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> undergone such a dramatic change that by February 2001 over half the discount disappeared. The paper also finds it difficult to document large enough liquidity differentials to explain the discount. Overall the evidence indicates that non-traditional explanations may be necessary.

50|$|It {{has been}} since {{suggested}} that the marriage rumours were a result of efforts to detect a leaker in the Privy Council.

25|$|Ambulances were {{standing}} by and ordinary city buses were brought in. Medical workers were expecting to treat victims of explosions and gunfire {{but not a}} secret chemical agent.

50|$|In 1567 Thomas Harding criticized Foxe's account, {{not for his}} {{description}} of the event, for which Foxe quotes eye-witnesses and official documents, but on the grounds that Perotine Massey was {{responsible for the death of}} her own child; had she revealed in court that she was pregnant, the execution <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been postponed until after the birth.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} achieve the goal by 2015, the United Nations {{estimated}} that all children at the official entry age for primary school <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been attending classes by 2009.

50|$|This was a {{substantial}} two track building. Until the Maldon West branch opened in 1889 {{there was no}} turntable located at Maldon so any tender engines working the branch <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> worked one direction tender first.

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1979, the board visited the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York City. They came away {{convinced}} that a successful arts school <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an exclusive program, that is, a program that would function on its own, without sharing space within an existing secondary school. To ensure that the right students enrolled, they also agreed that admission {{would be subject to}} an audition.|$|E
25|$|In this example, {{the edges}} going upward, to the left, {{and to the}} right from the central degree-four vertex do not have any cliques in common. Therefore, any {{partition}} of the graph's edges into cliques <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> at least one clique for each of these three edges, and these three cliques would all intersect in that central vertex, violating the requirement that each vertex appear in exactly two cliques. Thus, the graph shown is not a line graph.|$|E

50|$|It {{is thought}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been first built circa 1627 as this date is carved {{on part of}} the framework.

50|$|One {{letter from}} the Pope {{suggests}} that Llywelyn Fawr may <b>have</b> been married <b>to</b> an unnamed sister of Earl Ranulph of Chester in about 1192, but {{there appears to be}} no confirmation of this.

25|$|Syllabaries {{are best}} suited to {{languages}} with relatively simple syllable structure, such as Japanese. The English language, on the other hand, allows complex syllable structures, with a relatively large inventory of vowels and complex consonant clusters, making it cumbersome to write English words with a syllabary. To write English using a syllabary, every possible syllable in English <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a separate symbol, and whereas the number of possible syllables in Japanese is around 100, in English there are approximately 15,000 to 16,000.|$|E

Every time, he found the {{experience}} had a beneficial effect on his composing. In 1947 he realized he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a country place of his own, {{and took out a}} three-year rental on a Colonial-era house in the Rockland County hamlet of Palisades. He found it the perfect balance between the country life he desired and the proximity to the city he needed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{phenomenon is}} exhibited {{by a different}} complete bipartite graph, K2n+1,2n+1. This graph has an equitable 2-coloring, given by its bipartition. However, {{it does not have}} an equitable (2n+1)-coloring: any equitable partition of the vertices into that many color classes <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> exactly two vertices per class, but {{the two sides of the}} bipartition cannot each be partitioned into pairs because they have an odd number of vertices. Therefore, the equitable chromatic threshold of this graph is 2n+2, significantly greater than its equitable chromatic number of two.|$|E
50|$|Governor Charlie Crist (Then Republican Florida) {{announced}} {{his support for}} another Democratic Primary, though he opposed using government funds to cover the expenses.

25|$|The Klickitat Public Utility District Board of Commissioners {{investigated}} {{acquiring the}} project from Pacificorp {{to continue its}} operation as a power plant.

25|$|As {{with the}} first, puppetry was involved, {{and some of}} the puppets were mechanical. An actor holding a puppet <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> wires {{strapped}} to him. Gremlins 2 also includes more stop motion animation than the first film; the Bat Gremlin was portrayed through some stop motion animation. Film technology since the original had improved, and as a result the creatures can be seen walking more. Gizmo is able to dance, although this scene took the longest to make. Because there are more gremlins in Gremlins 2 than the original, additional filming lasted five months. Many of the effects had to be completed after the actors had finished their work.|$|E
