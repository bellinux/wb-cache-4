25|$|When {{initially}} introduced, the CVA {{procedure was}} not frequently used because a single creditor could veto the plan, {{and seek to}} collect their debts. This changed slightly with the Enterprise Act 2002. Under a new section 1A of the Insolvency Act 1986, small companies may apply for a moratorium on debt collection if it has any two of (1) a turnover under £6.5m (2) under £3.26m on its balance sheet, or (3) fewer than 50 employees. After an arrangement is proposed creditors <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to vote on the}} proposal, and if 75 per cent approve the plan it will bind all creditors. For larger companies, voluntary arrangements remain considerably under-used, particularly given the ability of administrators to be appointed out of court. Still, compared to the individual voluntary arrangement available for people in bankruptcy, company voluntary arrangements are rare.|$|E
25|$|The {{player can}} {{occasionally}} gain {{the opportunity to}} play as a Troll or an Ent, which are also used by non-player characters and, while far stronger than any normal class, are vulnerable to instantaneous kills by Warriors and Scouts through the use of Quick Time Events. Any class can ride a mount: horses for the Men of the West and wargs and Oliphaunts for Sauron and Saruman’s forces. Mounts are useful for quickly traversing large areas, but are highly vulnerable and a single hit against one will result in the player being knocked off (with the exception of the oliphaunt, which has an enormous amount of health). The player wields a sword when mounted, regardless of their class, and is only allowed to use basic attacks. Mounts also have the power to trample enemies when riding at top speed. Depending on the game's settings during multiplayer matches, or during certain periods of the campaign, players <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to control heroes, many of whom include the heroes and villains of Lord of the Rings. The heroes are usually based on the four primary class archetypes, controlling very similarly to their standard non-hero counterparts, but are also far more powerful, though not invincible.|$|E

500|$|After battle sequences, {{the player}} <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to rebuild their}} units by allocating a {{quantity}} of armament supplies, such as air support, which can be issued to any friendly unit on the map. After rebuilding ground units, the game will move onto an [...] "air phase", which consists of commanding aircraft such as aeroplanes, bombers and {{a limited number of}} reserve air units. Several options for allocating air forces include: counter air strikes, reconnaissance on enemy movement, interdiction, assault breakers, and deep strikes. Counter air strikes involve attacks on enemy air bases, whereas interdiction involves aircraft being sent behind enemy lines in order to attack supply and movement networks. If interdiction aircraft are discovered in enemy territory, there will be a chance that the side will respond with a retaliatory nuclear strike. The remaining three aircraft options are to attack a single unit, strike enemy territory, and attack railways in order to disable enemy reinforcements, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{election}} and consecration prompted {{a group of}} 19 bishops, led by Robert Duncan, Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, {{to make a statement}} warning the church of a possible schism between the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion. Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, stated that [...] " [...] will inevitably {{have a significant impact on}} the Anglican Communion throughout the world and it is too early to say what the result of that will be." [...] He added: [...] "t is my hope that the church in America and the rest of the Anglican Communion <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to consider this development before significant and irrevocable decisions are made in response." [...] Desmond Tutu, Archbishop emeritus of Cape Town, stated that he did not see what [...] "all the fuss" [...] was about, saying the election would not roil the Church of the Province of Southern Africa. Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria and head of the Global South, have made Robinson a figurehead in their dispute with the Episcopal Church. Some disaffected Episcopalians have disaffiliated from the Episcopal Church and formed the Convocation of Anglicans in North America with the support of the Nigerian church.|$|E
