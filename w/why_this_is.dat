5|$|The Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War {{states that}} the raid {{occurred}} at St Lorenzen (the German name of Lovrenc na Pohorju), and that the raid was planned by two British officers. This varies significantly {{from all of the}} other sources, and it is unknown <b>why</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the case.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{differences}} exist between different racial groups which affect {{the risk of}} developing alcohol dependence. For example, there are differences between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups. The alcohol dehydrogenase allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol. The allele ADH1 B*3 is only found in those of African descent and certain Native American tribes. African Americans and Native Americans with this allele have a reduced risk of developing alcoholism. Native Americans however, have a significantly higher rate of alcoholism than average; it is unclear <b>why</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the case. Other risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e.g. trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates of alcoholism among Native Americans compared to alcoholism levels in caucasians.|$|E
5|$|Robert of Ghent or Robert de Gant (c. 1085–after 1154) was Lord Chancellor of England and Dean of York in the 12th century. The {{younger son}} of a nobleman, Robert was {{probably}} {{a member of the}} cathedral chapter of York before his selection as chancellor by King Stephen of England in the mid-1140s. He is not mentioned often in documents from his time as chancellor, but <b>why</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> so is unknown. He became dean at York Minster around 1147. Robert was slightly involved in the disputes over who would be Archbishop of York in the late 1140s and 1150s, but it is likely that his chancellorship prevented his deeper involvement in diocesan affairs. He was no longer chancellor after the death of Stephen, but probably continued to hold the office of dean until his death around 1157 or 1158.|$|E

5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of <b>why</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E

25|$|Wetz wrote only vocal {{works in}} his early days. He often {{returned}} to this style until his dying days, which explains <b>why</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the largest part of his output. Wetz counts {{as one of the}} most important song composers of his generation. The authorities in this field that Wetz looked to were Franz Schubert, Franz Liszt, Peter Cornelius and Hugo Wolf. Liszt, especially, strongly influenced the tonal patterns of Wetz's early work, although even then Wetz was already forging his own path. This creative period culminates in two operas and Kleist-Ouvertüre, an orchestral work inspired by the tragic destiny of the poet.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of lactate dehydrogenase-B deficiency, {{mutations}} to the LDHB gene results {{in the production of}} an abnormal lactate dehydrogenase-B subunit that cannot bind to the other subunits to form the complete enzyme. As with lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency, this mutation reduces the overall effectiveness in the enzyme. However, there are some major differences between these two cases. The first is the location where the condition manifests itself. With lactate dehydrogenase-B deficiency, the highest concentration of B subunits can be found within cardiac muscle, or the heart. Within the heart, lactate dehydrogenase plays the role of converting lactate back into pyruvate so that the pyruvate can be used again to create more energy. With the mutated enzyme, the overall rate of this conversion is decreased. However, unlike lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency, this mutation does not appear to cause any symptoms or health problems linked to this condition. At the present moment, it is unclear <b>why</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the case. Affected individuals are usually discovered only when routine blood tests indicate low LDH levels present within the blood.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode is}} named after the White Rabbit from the tale Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, who leads the story's title character, Alice, deeper and deeper down a hole to a {{whimsical}} world called Wonderland, while meeting different characters. Just as Alice followed the White Rabbit deeper and deeper down the hole to Wonderland, Jack follows his father {{deeper and deeper into}} the jungle. Geoff Heise, who shows Jack his dead father at the morgue, is also in the Pilot episode as a survivor. It is unclear <b>why</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> so, and whether or not his portrayal of two seemingly unrelated characters has any symbolism. The episode marks the first appearance of actor John Terry, who plays Jack's father, Christian Shephard (the mysterious man who Jack chases in the jungle). In the previous episode, [...] "Walkabout", Christian was played by a stand-in actor, as the character hadn't been cast yet; thus, only {{the back of his head}} was shown.|$|E
500|$|TV Guide Matt Roush {{wrote that}} [...] "Audition" [...] was [...] "far from [...] {{favorite}} episode", disliking the [...] "cruelty and dirty tricks" [...] {{employed by the}} characters, though he commented that [...] "the moments that soar remind us <b>why</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a genuine pop-culture phenom". James Poniewozik of Time called it a [...] "solid" [...] episode, one which was [...] "neither awful nor amazing", but set up promising storylines for the season ahead. He felt there were no stand out musical performances, but commented, [...] "it gave the season some emotional grounding [...] It showed us a Glee that's not working double-time to give us everything we want all at once, and that's pretty much what I want from it." [...] John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote that, with [...] "Audition", Glee had become formulaic, and asserted that [...] "Glee fanatics won't be disappointed. The rest of us are." ...|$|E
500|$|Following an {{incident}} in which Natasha sprays graffiti around Ramsay Street, Michael disowns his daughter and ignores her attempts {{to get back in}} his good books. Natasha finds the situation weird and she is hurt by her father's actions. Novakovic said Natasha is disappointed in herself for hurting Michael so much. Natasha responds by taking advantage of her new independence to try to get Michael's attention. She also tries to get back on her father's good side, by doing some housekeeping, but Michael brushes it all aside. Of how Natasha feels about this, Novakovic said [...] "She knows how much her father loves her which is <b>why</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> even more jarring, as she realises it must be killing her father to act this way." [...] Natasha and Michael eventually make amends, but it is not an easy journey and they have a lot to work through. Novakovic told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that the storyline would change Natasha and she would become more sensitive and less self-absorbed.|$|E

500|$|Acting Mayor Feinstein, Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, and Milk's {{successor}} Harry Britt {{condemned the}} jury's decision. When {{it was announced}} over the police radio in the city, someone sang [...] "Danny Boy" [...] on the police band. A surge {{of people from the}} Castro District walked again to City Hall, chanting [...] "Avenge Harvey Milk" [...] and [...] "He got away with murder". Pandemonium rapidly escalated as rocks were hurled at the front doors of the building. Milk's friends and aides tried to stop the destruction, but the mob of more than 3,000 ignored them and lit police cars on fire. They shoved a burning newspaper dispenser through the broken doors of City Hall, then cheered as the flames grew. One of the rioters responded to a reporter's question about why they were destroying parts of the city: [...] "Just tell people that we ate too many Twinkies. That's <b>why</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> happening." [...] The chief of police ordered the police not to retaliate, but to hold their ground. The White Night riots, as they became known, lasted several hours.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright {{was asked about the}} significance of Bran witnessing the scene at the Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran knows <b>why</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> significant, but he knows that it is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've learned so far during his visions has been pretty big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad? And why have I been shown this? If I find out who the dad is and why I need to know who the dad is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E
500|$|Bryan Lark, {{writing for}} The Michigan Daily, called the song [...] "gorgeous" [...] {{and one of}} the album's best tracks, along with [...] "The Power of Good-Bye". He further commented that both songs prove that she still likes to get into the groove, and explain <b>why</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a techno album and not part of the [...] "Moods" [...] series. Sputnikmusic gave the song a {{positive}} review, impressed by how [...] "interesting percussion backing, beautiful use of strings with techno effects and Madonna at her soothing best". Stephen Sears from Idolator noted that Madonna has a history of releasing albums with [...] "killer singles" [...] as [...] "Frozen", and commented that [...] "Not since 'Live To Tell' had a Madonna ballad carried such emotional weight— and this time it was done with a new level of sonic grandeur". Jose F. Thomas from AllMusic rated the song two stars out of five, describing the song as [...] "chilly". In 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their [...] "Top 20 Madonna singles of all-time", by Q magazine. [...] "Frozen" [...] was allocated the number ten spot on the list. Billboard also allocated [...] "Frozen" [...] at number 25 on a list containing Madonna's 40 hits, stating that the song marked a sonic change in Madonna's career. Rolling Stone also ranked the song as Madonna's sixth best song of all time according to a readers' poll, saying that the song is [...] "striking the perfect balance of pop accessibility, sophisticated balladry and cutting-edge electronic textures". VH1's Mark Graham included [...] "Frozen" [...] on his list of his favorite songs from Madonna at number 36.|$|E
