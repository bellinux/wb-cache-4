5|$|Tera McArthur asked {{two police}} {{officers}} to accompany her to a trailer home where she lived with her husband Charles, {{so that she could}} take her belongings out of the home. Just after she came out of the trailer, she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get a <b>warrant.</b> <b>The</b> Illinois Appellate Court held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures without a <b>warrant.</b> <b>The</b> Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case in 2000.|$|E

In 1821, Samuel Frederick Gray considered H.auriscalpium to be sufficiently distinct from the other Hydnum species to <b>warrant</b> <b>the</b> {{creation of a new}} genus, Auriscalpium, to contain it.

5|$|Ann soon arrives, {{discovering}} Gil cowering in {{the cellar}} {{in a state of}} shock. Believing that he is beyond help, Gil at first refuses to see Dr. Hoffman, but after Ann's tearful pleading, Gil reluctantly agrees. During the examination, Dr. Hoffman orders Gil to remain in the house at all times as a precaution until he can return with help. Feeling guilty for leaving Trudy, Gil returns to the bar but is brutally beaten by George and his gang. Gil regains consciousness the next morning and discovers that Trudy, having felt sorry for him, brought him home to her apartment. George soon arrives and, upon seeing Gil, forces him at gunpoint out into the daylight. Transforming into the creature, Gil murders George in front of the horrified Trudy before fleeing into the hills. Returning to the house, Gil finds Ann, Dr. Hoffman and Buckell waiting there and returns to his normal human state. A disturbed Gil later admits to the murder, with the others assuring him that he acted in self-defense, but when the police arrive with an arrest <b>warrant,</b> <b>the</b> hysterical Gil flees from the grounds in his car and accidentally hits a police officer.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the {{availability}} of fresh specimens of the fungus—collected by Australian mycologist Bruce A. Fuhrer from the cones of Banksia spinulosa—prompted Gordon Beaton and Gretna Weste to reexamine the previous collections. Various apparent and microscopic differences were found which suggested that three distinct species were represented in the collections, and further, the species differed enough from other Encoelia species to <b>warrant</b> <b>the</b> {{creation of a new}} genus, which Beaton and Weste named Banksiamyces. The three Banksiamyces species they described in 1982 were the original B.toomansis (those initially named T.toomansis), as well as B.macrocarpus and B.katerinae. A fourth species, B.maccannii, was added to the genus by the same authors in 1984. A 2006 study identified two additional taxa that did not quite meet the description for previously published species; these have been called Banksiamyces aff. macrocarpus and Banksiamyces aff. toomansis. Some existing species were found on other banksia species, so evidence strengthened that the individual Banksiamyces fungi did not exclusively parasitize only one banksia species, a suggestion proposed by Beaton and Weste in 1982.|$|E

5|$|The 1960 Winter Olympics, officially {{known as}} the VIII Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held between February 18–28, 1960 in Squaw Valley, California, United States. Squaw Valley was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It was an undeveloped resort in 1955, so from 1956 to 1960 the {{infrastructure}} {{and all of the}} venues were built at a cost of US$80,000,000. It was designed to be intimate, allowing spectators and competitors to walk to nearly all the venues. Squaw Valley hosted athletes from thirty nations who competed in four sports and twenty-seven events. Women's speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts. The organizers decided the bobsled events did not <b>warrant</b> <b>the</b> cost to build a venue, so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program. The Soviet Union dominated the medal count winning twenty-one medals, seven of which were gold. Soviet speed skaters Yevgeny Grishin and Lidiya Skoblikova won two gold medals each. Swedish cross-country skier Sixten Jernberg added a gold and silver to the four medals he won at the 1956 Winter Games.|$|E
