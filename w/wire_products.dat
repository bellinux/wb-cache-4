40|$|The {{introduction}} of a new wrought copper alloy <b>wire</b> <b>product</b> for copper infiltration in 2005 has been met with wide acceptance throughout the PM industry. To further {{the use of this}} new infiltration technology this wrought <b>wire</b> infiltration <b>product</b> has been applied to low alloy steel powder matrices as a means to develop a sinter hardened, infiltrated structure. The mechanical properties of this new infiltrated and sinter hardened material system were investigated using three different low alloy steel powders of increasing alloy content and hardenability, but reduced compressibility. The sintering was carried out in a conventional mesh belt sintering furnace without an accelerated cooling section. The results of these studies are presented for two different carbon contents using tensile, impact energy, hardness and transverse rupture strength properties as measures of the sinter harden response. Microstructure analysis was used to relate the phase transformations to the resultant properties. Alloys with higher hardenability and higher carbon content formed 100 % martensite while lower carbon content and leaner alloys formed a mixed microstructure. The use of an alloy steel matrix eliminates the need for a secondary heat treatment in order to achieve exceptional heat treated properties in copper infiltrated steels...|$|R

5000|$|Worldwide, {{more than}} a dozen {{different}} types of AC power plugs and sockets are used for fixed building <b>wiring.</b> <b>Products</b> sold in many different markets can use a standardized IEC 60320 connector and then use a detachable power cord to match the local electrical outlets.

Note that the same types of appliance-side connectors are used with both 110 V and 230 V power cables, so care must be used when moving appliances between countries with different voltage standards [...] - [...] substituting a power cord that matches local power outlets will result in an incorrect voltage being applied to the appliance or equipment.
