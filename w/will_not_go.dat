5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E
25|$|The lying {{witness is}} a {{deceitful}} man, who mocks at justice. He {{is like a}} war club, or a sword, or a sharp arrow. ″A false witness <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> unpunished.″ king Solomon says. ″A false witness will perish″ {{if he does not}} repent.|$|E
25|$|Philosophers, such as Wittgenstein, take a {{view that}} is {{considered}} anti-realist and oppose philosophical arguments related to God's existence. For instance, Charles Taylor contends that the real is whatever <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> away. If we cannot reduce talk about God to anything else, or replace it, or prove it false, then perhaps God is as real as anything else.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} whether to legalize jitneys has been {{considered}} several times by Pennsylvania's Public Utilitiy Commission since at least 1975. The thinking behind the proposal is that jitneys often service areas regular Yellow Cab drivers <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go,</b> thus picking up slack in transportation needs. Famed Pittsburgh playwright August Wilson wrote a play called Jitney, {{which was published in}} 1982.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010, with Armstrong's {{earliest}} possible {{release date}} {{just four months}} away, Yates oversaw the launch of a campaign in Hartlepool for Armstrong {{to be placed on}} the sex offender's register when and if he is paroled – as the law stands he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> onto the register once released, because he was not convicted of a sexual offence.|$|E
25|$|January 13: After {{being named}} in trade rumors {{for much of}} the offseason, Braves utility man and 2011 {{starting}} left-fielder Martín Prado signed a one-year contract worth $4.75 million with the Braves for the 2012 season. The move assures that Prado <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> through the salary arbitration process and will likely return to the team for the 2012 campaign.|$|E

25|$|Advanced {{abdominal}} pregnancy {{refers to}} {{situations where the}} pregnancy continues past 20 weeks of gestation (versus early abdominal pregnancy < 20 weeks). In those situations, live births {{have been reported in}} academic journals and also in the lay press where the babies are not uncommonly referred to as 'Miracle babies'. A patient may carry a dead fetus but <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> into labor. Over time, the fetus calcifies and becomes a lithopedion.|$|E
25|$|The IAC activists {{intensified}} their protests, and Anna Hazare organised {{a hunger}} strike. Kejriwal and other activists {{were arrested for}} defying a police directive to give a written undertaking that they <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> to JP Park. Kejriwal attacked the government on this and {{said there was a}} need for a debate over police power to detain and release people at will. In August 2011, a settlement was reached between the Government and the activists.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{arbitrage}} or merger arbitrage {{includes such}} events as mergers, acquisitions, liquidations, and hostile takeovers. Risk arbitrage typically involves {{buying and selling}} the stocks {{of two or more}} merging companies to take advantage of market discrepancies between acquisition price and stock price. The risk element arises from the possibility that the merger or acquisition <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> ahead as planned; hedge fund managers will use research and analysis to determine if the event will take place.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} recommended {{to perform a}} laparotomy when the diagnosis of an abdominal pregnancy is made. However, if the baby is alive and medical support systems are in place, careful watching could be considered to bring the baby to viability. Women with an abdominal pregnancy <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> into labor. Delivery {{in a case of}} an advanced abdominal pregnancy will have to be via laparotomy. The survival of the baby is reduced and high perinatal mortality rates between 40–95% have been reported.|$|E
25|$|The woman's head quickly withdraws, {{the door}} to the trailer closes again, but she leaves behind her an unmistakable sense of watchful remonstrance, as if an angel had briefly touched the surface of the world with one sandaled foot, asked if there was any trouble and, being told all was well, had resumed her place in the ether with skeptical gravity, having {{reminded}} the children of earth that they are just barely trusted to manage their own business, and that further carelessness <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> unremarked.|$|E
25|$|Each auditioner {{will take}} turn to sing one song {{for as long}} as they want. If the {{representative}} is not sure about the competitor's performance, they may ask them to sing another song. After all five auditioners have sung, the representatives may make comments, and announces auditioners that <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> through to the second round. The successful auditioners will be given a Yellow Ticket, and will return to the waiting room to wait for an audition crew to lead them to a separate waiting room where they wait for the second round of audition.|$|E

25|$|As of March 2016, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Partridge of the Metropolitan Police Service's Homicide & Major Crime Commend has said:This case {{is still}} very much a live investigation. Farouk Abdulhak remains wanted for the rape and murder of Martine Vik Magnussen. Farouk Abdulhak has known {{for the past eight years}} now that he is wanted for the rape and murder of Magnussen. There have been {{extensive}} diplomatic efforts made over this time to return him to the UK, to no avail. This anniversary should serve as a further reminder that he cannot put this behind him, it <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> away and I appeal to him and those close to him to advise him to return to the UK to stand trial.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{spirits are}} {{believed}} to be irritated or angered by human presence. Negative spirits are responsible for accidents, illnesses, and deaths befalling those who have had contact with their habitation. Thus even today, haunted places are especially sacrosanct, to the point that many people refuse to develop perfectly suited properties or live next to beautiful areas because they have been judged to be inhabited by a negative spirit. An especially famous example of this is the half-finished Nakagusuku Hotel ruins that stand within walking distance from Nakagusuku Castle in Kitanakagusuku, which was abandoned during its construction as the result of several deaths both on- and off-site and still stands as it was; most Okinawan people <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> near the hotel.|$|E
25|$|On 6 September 2006, the Emperor {{celebrated the}} birth of his first grandson, Prince Hisahito, the third child of the Emperor's younger son. Prince Hisahito is the first male heir born to the Japanese {{imperial}} family in 41 years (since his father Prince Akishino) and could avert a possible succession crisis as the Emperor's elder son, the Crown Prince Naruhito, has only one daughter, Princess Aiko. Under Japan's male-only succession law, Princess Aiko is not eligible for the throne. The birth of Prince Hisahito could mean that proposed changes to the law to allow Aiko to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> through after being temporarily shelved following the announcement of Princess Kiko's third pregnancy in February 2006. The supporters of changes criticized the current law as it placed a burden on the few aging males old enough to perform royal duties as females left the family.|$|E

25|$|The {{final scene}} {{takes place in}} the Phantom's Chapel, with his organ and its unkempt riot of sheet music as a center-piece. He seems {{determined}} to wed Christine and expresses his love for her ("Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain"). As the song ends, Christine tears off his mask and The Phantom screams in anger and shame, hiding his face from Christine. His sobs fade and he turns back, with a determined and violent look in his eyes, and produces a Priest and Chorus Girl to bear witness to the forced marriage between him and Christine. But just in time, Raoul, The Persian {{and the rest of the}} group burst in, having escaped the Boiler Room and come through The Phantom's traps. The Phantom, suddenly finding himself in a tight spot, produces a knife and pulls Christine in front of him. In act of love to Christine, The Phantom stabs himself with his own dagger and dies in Christine's arms ("Ne'er Forsake me, Here Remain").Christine remarks that The Phantom was always the angel of music ("He <b>Will</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Go</b> Without A Friend").|$|E
25|$|The {{morality}} of crossing the floor, the Sultan's power {{to dismiss the}} Menteri Besar (First Minister), the validity of pre-signed undated resignation letters, {{the powers of the}} Speaker of the House and power of the Election Commission were major issues of this constitutional crisis. On 11 May 2009, the Kuala Lumpur High Court ruled that the Sultan was not constitutionally permitted to dismiss the Menteri Besar, and that Nizar had always been the rightful head of the state government. On 22 May 2009, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court decision, and confirmed that the Barisan Nasional which has sworn in a new chief minister and parliamentary speaker for Perak should remain in power. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal found the trial judge to have erred in confusing the issue of whether the government has lost the confidence {{of the majority of the}} house with the issue of whether the Sultan has the power to dismiss the government. However Zambry's position as Menteri Besar <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> unchallenged despite the ruling as Pakatan Rakyat leaders have indicated they intend to file an appeal.|$|E
25|$|During {{a charity}} abseil {{on top of}} The Queen Victoria, Shirley proposes to Phil and he accepts. At their {{engagement}} party, Sharon Watts returns, begging for help, as she has left her fiancé John Hewland (Jesse Birdsall) at the altar and he has her son, Dennis Rickman Jnr (Harry Hickles). Phil helps her to rescue Dennis and they return with Phil to Walford. When Phil gets home, he finds that Shirley knows the truth about Heather's death. After a furious confrontation, he tries to convince her not to tell the police but Ben confesses {{to the police and}} is charged with Heather's murder. Jay is charged with perverting the course of justice and Phil orders him to change his statement so Ben <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> to prison, but Jay refuses and Phil disowns him but does manage to convince his cousin, Roxy, to lie in her statement. His solicitor, Ritchie Scott (Sian Webber), tells him that Ben could face a minimum of 10 years in prison. Shirley ends her relationship with Phil as she is unable to cope with his betrayal. Phil visits Ben in prison with Ian in the hope of persuading Ben to retract his confession but Ben refuses, insisting that he is doing the right thing as he needs to be punished. Ben refuses to have any contact with his family until his release.|$|E
