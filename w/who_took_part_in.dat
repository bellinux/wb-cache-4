5|$|As cancers do not {{immediately}} emerge after {{exposure to radiation}} instead radiation-induced cancer has a minimum latency period of some 5+ years. An epidemiology study by the RERF estimates that from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancers of unspecificed lethality, {{could be due to}} radiation from the bombs, with the statistical excess being 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality.

In addition to the casualties inflicted upon them by North Vietnamese artillery, the civilians were also hit by air strikes from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. As a result of those huge losses, Route 7 became known as the ‘convoy of tears’.|$|E

5|$|Koushun Takami {{completed}} Battle Royale when {{he stopped}} working as a journalist in 1996.

Battle Royale was first published in April 1999 by Ohta Publishing. In August 2002, it was released in a revised, two-part pocket edition by Gentosha.|$|E
5|$|Many American pilots <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>part</b> <b>in</b> World War II grew {{up during}} the 1930s enthusiastically reading flying pulps such as Flying Aces, and were captivated by the {{adventure}} stories, an experience that no doubt {{played a part in}} their decision to become military aviators themselves. Joseph W.
