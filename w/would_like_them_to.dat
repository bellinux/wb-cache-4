But I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> watch {{the best among}} the lotNool Veli, Mullum Malarum, Udiripookal, Salangai Oli and Amirthavarshini (Kannada)". In 2006, {{director}} S. Shankar said that he entered the film industry [...] "with dreams of directing films such as Mullum Malarum", though he never got to make such films. Asked for her favourite scene in any film, actress Sripriya replied: [...] "For me, {{that would be an}} entire movie– Mullum Malarum." [...] In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar asked eight Tamil directors to list ten of their favourite films; fourK. Balachander, K. Bhagyaraj, Mani Ratnam and K. S. Ravikumarnamed Mullum Malarum. Director Kathir said in July 2012 that Mullum Malarum inspired him to enter the film industry. The title of G. V. Prakash Kumar's film, Ketta Paiyan Da Indha Karthi, is a play on the line [...] "Ketta Paiyan Sir Indha Kaali" [...] from Mullum Malarum. In October 2015, director Pa. Ranjith stated that Rajinikanth's characterisation in Mullum Malarum was a [...] "lesson" [...] of sorts for him, and the actor's character in Ranjith's Kabali (2016) was influenced by Kali in Mullum Malarum.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Lamm {{told his}} {{listeners}} {{that they should}} value and encourage the efforts of non-Orthodox leaders to more seriously integrate traditional Jewish practices {{into the lives of}} their followers. They should welcome the creation of Reform and Conservative day schools and not see them as a threat to their own. In many communities, Orthodox day schools, or Orthodox-oriented community day schools, have large numbers of students from non-Orthodox families. The liberal movements should be appreciated and encouraged because they are doing something Jewish, even if it is not the way that Orthodox Jews <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> <b>to,</b> he said. [...] "What they are doing is something, and something is better than nothing," [...] he said in his speech. [...] "I'm very openly attacking the notion that we sometimes find in the Orthodox community that 'being a goy is better'" [...] than being a non-Orthodox Jew, he said in an interview.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2006 Straw {{attracted}} controversy {{by suggesting}} {{to a local}} newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles {{in the past and}} it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: [...] "Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather." [...] He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.|$|E
2500|$|Following the pre-{{audition}}s, acts audition {{in front}} of (as of 2016) four celebrity judges. The judges may end an act's performance early by pressing their red buzzer, which lights up their corresponding X above the stage. If an act receives X's from all judges, they must stop their performance. In addition, large audiences have also been {{a factor in the}} judging process, as their reaction to an act's performance may swing or influence a judge's vote. This makes the audience the so-called [...] "fifth" [...] ("fourth", from seasons 1-4) judge. From seasons 1 to 4, voting worked on a majority-of-two basis where two positive votes were required. Starting from season 5, voting works on a majority-of-three basis as there are four judges. The judging panel give an act a [...] "Yes" [...] if they like them and <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> advance to the next stage of the competition, and a [...] "No" [...] if they dislike the act and do not wish to see them again.|$|E
2500|$|As for casting in general, the {{director}} expressed his {{dissatisfaction with the}} process. He felt Sorcerer [...] "needed stars" [...] and claimed that the actors hired for the roles of Scanlon and Manzon were his fifth, sixth or seventh preferred choices. Spanish actor Francisco Rabal, however, was his [...] "about second or third choice". Friedkin said that he wanted Rabal {{for the role of}} [...] "Frog One" [...] in The French Connection because he loved his performance in Luis Buñuel's Belle de Jour, but the casting director mistakenly got Fernando Rey instead. It was not until Sorcerer came along that Friedkin and Rabal finally worked together. Scanlon's role was also offered to Clint Eastwood and Jack Nicholson, neither of whom was willing to travel to the Dominican Republic. Despite liking Cremer, Friedkin felt that this role would benefit from the presence of Jean-Paul Belmondo or Lino Ventura. The abundance of foreign actors on the cast list prompted Sidney Sheinberg to ask {{the director}} whether he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> have Anglicized pseudonyms.|$|E

2500|$|Babe becomes {{suspicious}} when Stan frequently vanishes off the square. She {{follows him}} to the hospital, where she discovers he has terminal prostate cancer. She urges him to tell his family, but he insists he wants {{to deal with it}} alone. However, an upset Babe reveals the cancer at Lee's 22nd birthday celebrations. He is angry with her and tries to lie {{his way out of the}} truth, but later confesses that this Christmas is likely to be his last. Cora is very upset to realise the truth as well, as her husband died of cancer several years ago. Stan confronts Babe and reveals he knows she is hiding Shirley; this leads Mick and Dean to bring her back to Walford. Christmas lunch is unsettled when Stan's ex-wife Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) visits. Cora storms off upset and the day is later upset when Shirley admits that she is Mick's mother. Stan throws Babe out and urges Mick and Tina to carry on as normal, but he is left reeling when Mick tells him that Dean has raped Linda. [...] After he collapses in the Square, Stan tells Tina and Mick he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> help him end his life. Although Mick furiously refuses, Tina eventually agrees, but Mick stops her before she can. This causes Mick and Stan to fallout. Stan tries to arrange a trip to the dogs for the Carters, but they are concerned for his health. Before they can leave, he loses feeling in his legs and is rushed to hospital, where he tells them he does not want them to visit and wants the money he loaned Shirley and Dean for Blades' back. He learns that he will never be able to walk again due to his cancerous tumour pushing on his spine. Babe and Cora visit him, and he proposes to Cora, which upsets Babe as she reveals she never stopped loving him. Cora accepts after Babe gives her her blessing, delighting Stan.|$|E

6000|$|This {{had always}} been the {{conclusion}} of Will's hesitations. But he was not without contradictoriness and rebellion even towards his own resolve. He had often got irritated, as he was on this particular night, by some outside demonstration that his public exertions with Mr. Brooke as a chief could not seem as heroic as he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be, and this was always associated with the other ground of irritation--that notwithstanding his sacrifice of dignity for Dorothea's sake, he could hardly ever see her. Whereupon, not being able to contradict these unpleasant facts, he contradicted his own strongest bias and said, [...] "I am a fool." ...|$|E

To this end he wished to receive an impression of the Prince-Regent's arrival which should not be blurred or clouded by other interests. His wife knew the kind of thing he liked to see, and would have helped him out with his observations, but Kenby would have got in the way, and would have clogged the movement of his fancy in assigning the facts to the parts he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> play in the sketch.|$|E

There was the little china box, too--Dorcas's present, the pearl ear-rings, and a silk purse, with fifteen seven-shilling pieces in it, the presents Sir Christopher had made her on her birthday, ever since she had been at the Manor. Should she take the earrings and the seven-shilling pieces? She could not bear to part with them; it seemed as if they had some of Sir Christopher's love in them. She <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be buried with her. She fastened the little round earrings in her ears, and put the purse with Dorcas's box in her pocket.

Consequently he chose for the head of his cabinet a bright and sensible boy, and had him educated as a Minister of State. For Minister of Finance, he chose another boy with a very honest countenance, and for the other members of his cabinet, suitable youths were selected. He also said, that he thought there ought to be another officer, one who would be a sort of Minister of General Comfort, who would keep an eye on the health and happiness of the subjects, and would also see that every thing went all right in the palace, not only in regard to meals, but lots of other things. For this office he chose a bright young girl, and had her educated for the position of Queen.|$|E
60|$|Therefore, says Solomon to {{the young}} man, begin with that--with the solemn, earnest, industrious, God-fearing frame of mind--without that you will gain no wisdom. You may be as clever as you will, {{but if you are}} {{reckless}} and wild, you will gain no wisdom. If you are violent and impatient; if you are selfish and self-conceited; if you are weak and self-indulgent, given up to your own pleasures, your cleverness will be of no use to you. It will be only hurtful to you and to others. A clever fool is common enough, and dangerous enough. For he is one who never sees things as they really are, but as he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be. A bad man, let him be as clever as he may, is like one in a fever, whose mind is wandering, who is continually seeing figures and visions, and mistaking them for actual and real things; and so with all his cleverness, he lives in a dream, and makes mistake upon mistake, because he knows not things as they are, and sees nothing by the light of Christ, who is the light of the world, from whom alone all true understanding comes.|$|E
