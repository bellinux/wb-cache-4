5|$|The {{capital city}} was {{completely}} {{dependent on the}} water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians {{a picture of the}} prevailing surface <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> methods in use at that time in the semiarid regions of South India. Contemporary records and notes of foreign travelers describe how huge tanks were constructed by labourers. Excavations have uncovered the remains of a well-connected <b>water</b> <b>distribution</b> system existing solely within the royal enclosure and the large temple complexes (suggesting it was for the exclusive use of royalty, and for special ceremonies) with sophisticated channels using gravity and siphons to transport water through pipelines. The only structures resembling public waterworks are the remains of large water tanks that collected the seasonal monsoon water and then dried up in summer except for the few fed by springs. In the fertile agricultural areas near the Tungabhadra River, canals were dug to guide the river water into irrigation tanks. These canals had sluices that were opened and closed to control the water flow. In other areas the administration encouraged the digging of wells monitored by administrative authorities. Large tanks in the capital city were constructed with royal patronage while smaller tanks were funded by wealthy individuals to gain social and religious merit.|$|E

High winds in Lailenpi within Chin State damaged a school and a training center for community health workers. Four schools were damaged nationwide by Komen alone. The storm and the preceding floods damaged 490,000houses and destroyed another 21,000, causing 132deaths, at least 55 of whom in Rakhine State. Komen was directly responsible for at least 39deaths in the country.|$|E
30|$|In addition, for an {{accurate}} estimation of local <b>water</b> <b>distributions</b> and consequent gravity changes, hydrological and meteorological data must be collected near gravimeters. Researchers have carried out electrical resistivity surveys (Van Camp et al., 2006), lysimeter measurements (Creutzfeldt et al., 2010 a), and borehole-core sampling (Creutzfeldt et al., 2010 b), to understand, in detail, depth-dependent <b>water</b> <b>distributions</b> below the ground surface; however, such depth profile data {{is not available}} for all gravity observation sites, mainly because of financial limitations. A different approach is {{to realize that the}} bulk of the <b>water</b> mass <b>distribution</b> occurs in the uppermost ground layers, because soil pores and free spaces at the ground surface can preserve significant amounts of water in the form of soil water and snow (e.g., Sato et al., 2006). Therefore, it is vital to collect hydrological and meteorological data, such as precipitation, soil moisture and unconfined groundwater height, at the shallowest part of the ground {{in order to understand the}} gravity changes due to land-water distributions.|$|R
40|$|Obtaining a {{quantitative}} understanding of river–groundwater interactions is of high practical relevance, for instance {{within the context}} of riverbank filtration and river restoration. Modeling interactions between river and groundwater requires knowledge of the river’s spatiotemporal <b>water</b> level <b>distribution.</b> The dynamic nature of riverbed morphology in restored river reaches might result in complex river <b>water</b> level <b>distributions,</b> including disconnected river branches, nonlinear longitudinal water level profiles and morphologically induced lateral water level gradients. Recently, two new methods were proposed to accurately and efficiently capture 2 D <b>water</b> level <b>distributions</b> of dynamic rivers. In this study, we assessed the predictive capability of these methods with respect to simulated groundwater residence times. Both methods were used to generate surface <b>water</b> level <b>distributions</b> of a 1. 2 km long partly restored river reach of the Thur River in northeastern Switzerland. We then assigned these <b>water</b> level <b>distributions</b> as boundary conditions to a 3 D steady-state groundwater flow and transport model. When applying either of the new methods, the calibration-constrained groundwater flow field accurately predicted the spatial distribution of groundwater residence times; deviations were within a range of 30 % when compared to residence times obtained using a reference method. We further tested the sensitivity of the simulated groundwater residence times to a simplified river <b>water</b> level <b>distribution.</b> The negligence of lateral river water level gradients of 20 – 30 cm on a length of 200 m caused errors of 40 – 80 % in the calibration-constrained groundwater residence time distribution compared to results that included lateral water level gradients. The additional assumption of a linear <b>water</b> level <b>distribution</b> in longitudinal river direction led to deviations from the complete river <b>water</b> level <b>distribution</b> of up to 50 cm, which caused wide-spread errors in simulated groundwater residence times of 200 – 500 %. For an accurate simulation of groundwater residence times, it is therefore imperative that the longitudinal <b>water</b> level <b>distribution</b> is correctly captured and described. Based on the confirmed predictive capability of the new methods to estimate 2 D river <b>water</b> level <b>distributions,</b> we can recommend their application to future studies that model dynamic river–groundwater systems...|$|R

5|$|Initially, {{residents}} across Guam {{were critical}} of the delayed response by the U.S. government; no aid had arrived within two days of the storm, but unsafe conditions at airports had prevented aircraft from landing. With the majority of homes destroyed across Guam, structures that remained standing were used as temporary shelter for those left homeless. Similarly, damaged military installations at Anderson Air Force Base were made available to all civilians. By November14, the USS Daniel I. Sultan arrived in Guam with 1,100troops to provide emergency power. A U.S. Air Force AC-130 landed on the island that day carrying the first package of relief supplies. About 400troops and 80public works employees were sent from Hawaii on November14.

In {{accordance with the}} FRANZ agreement, the Government of New Zealand made an initial donation of NZ$350,000 for recovery efforts prior to the formal request for assistance on February13. Following said request, New Zealand prepped a C-130 Hercules aircraft with emergency supplies and New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF) personnel which arrived in Aitutaki on February15. The aircraft made four trips in all which provided several tonnes of aid to the island. The NZDF priority was repair of schools and hospitals, though they assisted the Red Cross with clearing debris, restoring power, and setting up temporary shelters for affected residents. The {{lack of access to}} clean water prompted significant concern, and a water and sanitation expert from the Australian Red Cross flew in on February12 to assist with restoration efforts. Immediate provisions of 600water bottles were sent to the island on February16. The Red Cross subsequently began pumping and filtering water, using a truck to distribute it to the island's villages.

Using previously published infiltration data, we investigated whether these two similarity solutions successfully describe infiltration into two &# 8220;normal&# 8221; soils. Although the theory using the first similarity assumption adequately describes horizontal cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate into both soils, it fails to estimate soil <b>water</b> <b>distributions</b> measured between soil profiles.

For an unsaturated granular material in pendular regime, pore water is discontinuously distributed at contact points in the form of capillary bridges, leading to the capillary force being the sum of the force component induced by air-water pressure difference on the section of the bridge neck and the force component induced by surface tension. Such a formulated contact model has been implemented in the DEM simulations. Directional statistical theory has been applied to study the statistical features of the contact interactions, the water bridges and the capillary forces. The impact of water bridges on the strength of unsaturated granular material has been interpreted through the SFF relationship to explain the capillary strengthening effect.
