5|$|As MalcolmX and his bodyguards {{tried to}} quell the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot him once in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun and two other men charged the stage firing {{semi-automatic}} handguns. MalcolmX was pronounced dead at 3:30pm, shortly after arriving at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. The autopsy identified 21 gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> the chest, left shoulder, arms and legs, including ten buckshot wounds from the initial shotgun blast.|$|E
5|$|Davey had {{sustained}} <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> his back, {{abdomen and}} legs, and was evacuated to England. After he had recovered sufficiently {{he received his}} Victoria Cross, and was then embarked to return to Australia in October. He was discharged from the AIF on 24 February 1919. His brothers Claude and Richard were also awarded the Military Medal during World War I, with Claude being killed in action in 1917.|$|E

5|$|Insects {{are also}} used in medicine, for example fly larvae (maggots) were {{formerly}} used to treat <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> prevent or stop gangrene, as they would only consume dead flesh. This treatment is finding modern usage in some hospitals. Recently insects have also gained attention as potential sources of drugs and other medicinal substances. Adult insects, such as crickets and insect larvae of various kinds, are also commonly used as fishing bait.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December, {{injured by}} bomb <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> {{his face and}} head, Cherry was {{evacuated}} to Egypt, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 9 December. Three days later, the 26th Battalion was withdrawn from Gallipoli and evacuated to Egypt where Cherry rejoined them in preparation for service on the Western Front. Remaining in Egypt during this time, Cherry was selected {{to attend a machine}} gun course in March 1916. After completion of this, he was transferred to the 7th Machine Gun Company in France.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 2007 a {{shooting}} incident occurred at around 2.45am following {{a performance by}} Pretty Ricky at the university. A 21-year-old student at the university, who was employed as security staff at the event, received gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> his abdomen and was taken to hospital where his condition was not believed to be life-threatening. Six others were also injured during what {{was described as a}} scuffle that broke out after CS gas (tear gas) was sprayed following the event.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{had trouble}} with alcohol and other drugs {{throughout}} his life, while suffering from depression, and these topics often appear in his lyrics. In 2003, aged 34, he died in Los Angeles, California, from two stab <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive {{as to whether the}} wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was posthumously completed and released in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am.

5|$|A {{weather station}} in Norfolk, Virginia {{recorded}} gusts of 3844mph (6171km/h) and 0.17inches (4.31mm) of rainfall. In Cape Henry, sustained winds of 42mph (68km/h) and a precipitation total of 0.02inches (0.5mm) were reported. Coastal sections of southeastern Virginia experienced tides 2.26.1feet (0.61.8m) above normal, resulting in minor tidal flooding. One indirect fatality was attributed from Gladys {{when a man}} suffered fatal <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> his throat due to flying debris. High winds and strong ocean currents from Gladys produced beach erosion in New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts. In Rhode Island, the outer bands of Gladys produced light rainfall, peaking at 0.38inches (9.6mm). A boy was washed into the sea by the waves offshore Narragansett and was rescued by United States Coast Guard servicemen, who dove into the water after two previous attempts to rescue him failed.|$|E
5|$|For part of 31 October, Derrick assumed {{command of}} his company after all of the unit's {{officers}} had been killed or wounded in fierce fighting. On 21 November 1942, Derrick was briefly admitted to the 2/3rd Australian Field Ambulance with slight shrapnel <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> {{his right hand and}} buttock. Twelve days later, the 2/48th Battalion left El Alamein and returned to Gaza in Palestine, where, later that month, Derrick attended a corps patrolling course. In January 1943, the 2/48th Battalion sailed home to Australia, aboard the S.S. Nieuw Amsterdam, {{along with the rest of}} the 9th Division.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} {{animals are}} predators of or otherwise {{pose a threat}} to the wood turtle. They include snapping turtles, porcupines, raccoons, otters, foxes, and cats. All of these species destroy unhatched eggs and prey upon hatchlings and juveniles. Several animals that often target wood turtle eggs are the common raven and coyote, which may completely destroy the nests they encounter. Evidence of predatory attacks (<b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> the skin and such) are common on individuals, but the northern populations tend to display more scarring than the southern ones. In addition to these threats, wood turtles also suffer from leech infestations.|$|E

5|$|On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while {{participating}} in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas. Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due {{to at least one}} lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart. Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{depiction}} {{is common}} in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions {{with members of the}} same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named Labrosaurus ferox is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes.|$|E
5|$|The 12th Battalion {{spent the}} next two months engaged in minor {{operations}} in Belgium, before once again transferring to the trenches in France during December. During this time, Whittle was re-promoted to the rank of sergeant. With the commencement of the German Spring Offensive of 1918, the 12th Battalion assisted in repulsing the assault in the months of March and April. While engaged in this operation, Whittle was wounded on 19 March and admitted to a field hospital suffering shrapnel <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> his right hand. Recovering from the wound, he returned to the 12th Battalion in April. Later that month, Whittle was charged with conduct to the prejudice of good order and Military Discipline a second time for mutilating his pay book; he was reprimanded by the battalion's commanding officer as a result.|$|E

5|$|The coroner of Park County, Sharon Morris, {{confirmed}} that the body of Morrison (which had four bullet wounds, three non-fatal from police and one fatal shot from his own gun) {{was still in the}} second-floor classroom as of 6:00 p.m. An autopsy report later revealed that Morrison suffered two gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> the head (including the fatal one fired from his gun), two additional in the right shoulder, and a graze wound to his right hand, while Emily Keyes died of a single gunshot wound to the right side of her head. District officials stated that both the high school and Fitzsimmons Middle School would be closed for September 28 and September 29; a counseling center set up at a local church would open at 7:00 a.m. for students.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was questioned}} by François Therrien and colleagues (2005), {{who found that}} the biting force of Carnotaurus was {{twice as high as}} that of the American alligator, which may have the strongest bite of any living tetrapod. These researchers also noted analogies with modern Komodo dragons: the flexural strength of the lower jaw decreases towards the tip linearly, indicating that the jaws were not suited for high precision catching of small prey but for delivering slashing <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> weaken big prey. As a consequence, according to this study, Carnotaurus must have mainly preyed upon large animals, possibly by ambush.|$|E
5|$|A {{skeleton}} of the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus annectens {{has been described}} from Montana with healed tyrannosaur-inflicted damage on its tail vertebrae. The fact that the damage seems to have healed suggests that the Edmontosaurus survived a tyrannosaur's attack on a living target, i.e. the tyrannosaur had attempted active predation. There is also evidence for an aggressive interaction between a Triceratops and a Tyrannosaurus {{in the form of}} partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal (a bone of the neck frill); the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. It is not known what the exact nature of the interaction was, though: either animal could have been the aggressor. Since the Triceratops wounds healed, it is most likely that the Triceratops survived the encounter and managed to overcome the Tyrannosaurus. Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that in a battle against a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> the Tyrannosaurus using its sharp horns.|$|E
