5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in <b>water</b> <b>density</b> is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high viscosity of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high viscosity is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E

At the cloud base, the concentration was 0grams of liquid water per kilogram of air. As altitude increased, the concentration rapidly increased to the maximum concentration near the middle of the cloud. The maximum concentration was found to be anything up to 1.25grams of water per kilogram of air. The concentration slowly dropped off as altitude increased to the height of the top of the cloud, where it immediately dropped to zero again.|$|E

Tidal mixing is the dominant driver of circulation patterns in the bay, where currents can reach up to 2.5 feet per second. Non-tidal currents such as the flow of low salinity water at the surface out of the bay and high salinity deep water into the bay contribute to a current of about 0.33 feet per second.|$|E

25|$|The {{successful}} {{outcome of}} fat-graft breast augmentation {{is enhanced by}} achieving a pre-expanded recipient site to create the breast-tissue matrix that will receive grafts of autologous adipocyte fat. The recipient site is expanded with an external vacuum tissue-expander applied upon each breast. The biological effect of negative pressure (vacuum) expansion upon soft tissues derives from the ability of soft tissues to grow when subjected to controlled, distractive, mechanical forces. (see distraction osteogenesis) The study Non-surgical Breast Enlargement using an External Soft Tissue Expansion System (2000) reported the technical effectiveness of recipient-site pre-expansion. In a single-group study, 17 healthy women (aged 18–40 years) wore a brassiere-like vacuum system that applied a 20-mmHg vacuum (controlled, mechanical, distraction force) to each breast for 10–12 hours daily for 10-weeks. Pre- and post-procedure, the breast volume (size) was periodically measured; likewise, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the breast-tissue architecture and <b>water</b> <b>density</b> was taken during the same phase of the patient's menstrual cycle; of the 17-woman study group, 12 completed the study, and 5 withdrew, because of non-compliance with the clinical trial protocol.|$|E

25|$|The {{buoyancy}} {{force on}} the diver is {{the weight of the}} volume of the liquid that they and their equipment displace minus the weight of the diver and their equipment; if the result is positive, that force is upwards. The buoyancy of any object immersed in water is also affected by the <b>density</b> of the <b>water.</b> The <b>density</b> of fresh <b>water</b> is about 3% less than that of ocean water.

Furthermore, differences were found between profiles on adaxial and abaxial surfaces, which were considered to be caused by more turbulent air current and higher transpiration rate on abaxial leaf surface. Air conditions such as temperature, saturation vapor deficit and wind velocity of ambient air outside the boundary layer affected the profile of <b>water</b> vapor <b>density,</b> and these effects of air conditions closely related to stomatal responses which made the stomatal resistance higher at the lower air temperatures, the higher saturation deficits and the higher wind velocities...|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{method for}} determination of in situ soil <b>water</b> flux <b>density</b> {{continues to be}} the most sought after and yet elusive hydrologic measurement. The penta-needle heat pulse probe (PHPP) employs a central heater needle surrounded by an orthogonal arrangement of four thermistor needles for two-component <b>water</b> flux <b>density</b> estimation. An analytical solution and inverse fitting method are presented for simultaneous estimation of thermal properties and soil <b>water</b> flux <b>density</b> using PHPP measurements. The approach yields estimates of both components of the flux in a plane normal to the axis of the PHPP needles. The method was evaluated using data measured by PHPPs in a laboratory experiment using a wide range of saturated water fluxes ranging from 1. 2 to 33, 200 cm d− 1. Improved <b>water</b> flux <b>density</b> determination was achieved from zero-flux adjusted estimates of the apparent heater-thermistor radii, radj, which were used in the inverse analysis. Thermal diffusivity and conductivity were estimated with coefficients of variation less than 1. 35 %, indicating that the inverse problem is well posed and yields unique parameter estimates when water flux is less than 2000 cm d− 1. Estimates of the x and y components of <b>water</b> flux <b>density</b> agreed well with measured water fluxes up to 7000 cm d− 1 exhibiting R 2 values greater than 0. 976.

2500|$|The ocean can {{be divided}} into three density zones: the surface zone, the pycnocline, and the deep zone. The surface zone, also called the mixed layer, refers to the {{uppermost}} density zone of the ocean. Temperature and salinity are relatively constant with depth in this zone due to currents and wave action. The surface zone contains ocean water that is in contact with the atmosphere and within the photic zone. The surface zone has the ocean's least dense water and represents approximately 2% of the total volume of ocean water. The surface zone usually ranges between depths of [...] to [...] below ocean surface, but this can vary a great deal. In some cases, the surface zone can be entirely non-existent. The surface zone is typically thicker in the tropics than in regions of higher latitude. The transition to colder, denser water is more abrupt in the tropics than in regions of higher latitudes. The pycnocline refers to a zone wherein density substantially increases with depth due primarily to decreases in temperature. The pycnocline effectively separates the lower-density surface zone above from the higher-density deep zone below. The pycnocline represents approximately 18% of the total volume of ocean water. The deep zone refers to the lowermost density zone of the ocean. The deep zone usually begins at depths below [...] in mid-latitudes. The deep zone undergoes negligible changes in <b>water</b> <b>density</b> with depth. The deep zone represents approximately 80% of the total volume of ocean water.

40|$|Coastal polynyas in the Adelie Depression are an {{important}} source of Antarctic Bottom Water to the Australian-Antarctic Basin. We present time series (April 1998 to May 1999 and August 1999 to February 2000) of data from temperature-salinity sensors, in both the Adelie Depression and the known outflow region of the Adelie Sill, to describe the annual cycle of shelf <b>water</b> <b>densities.</b> From April through September, salinification beneath the polynya produces dense shelf waters. During September–October, shelf <b>water</b> <b>densities</b> in the depression peak at 27. 94 kg m 3, and the cooling and freshening signature of Ice Shelf Water is observed north of Buchanan Bay. In November–December, shelf <b>water</b> <b>densities</b> decrease as intrusions of warm and relatively fresh modified Circumpolar Deep Water enter east of the Ade´lie Sill. From January–March the surface layer is conditioned by the cooling of the atmosphere, which overturns the upper water column.

Using an idealized outflow region with a rectangular cross-sectional area (6 106 m 2), we present the first estimates of shelf water export by potential density class. Assuming shelf water with a minimum density of 27. 88 kg m 3 has sufficient negative buoyancy for downslope mixing and a fourfold volume increase (1 : 3 mixing ratio) from entrainment, the dense shelf water export of 0. 1 – 0. 5 Sv results in an annual average production of bottom water in this region of between 0. 4 and 2. 0 Sv. The wide range in bottom water estimate results from data limitations, and a narrowing of this range requires further mooring observations...|$|R

A simple system for on-line measurement of <b>water</b> vapor <b>density</b> within leaf boundary layer was developed, and <b>water</b> vapor <b>density</b> (WBO) at the cucumber leaf surface was analyzed {{in relation to}} transpiration rate (E). In the system, air near the leaf surface was sampled continuously through a capillary tube (~ 0. 4 mm) and drawn into a sampling capsule (1. 2 cm 3 in volume) by using an air pump.
