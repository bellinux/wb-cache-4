40|$|AbstractInternal {{stability}} {{refers to}} the ability for the coarse fraction of a soil to prevent the loss of its fine fraction due to seepage flow. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to extend internal stability criteria for well-graded and gap-graded soils using control variables selected based on a physical understanding of the microstructures of the soils. The feasibility of three commonly used geometric criteria is first evaluated based on the information of 131 soils in a laboratory test dataset. The control variables for soils of various fines contents are then identified based on their microstructures. Finally, composite internal stability criteria for both well-graded and gap-graded soils are proposed. <b>A</b> well-graded soil <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fines</b> content of less than 5 % is internally stable if it satisfies (H/F) min> 1. 0 (F=mass fraction of particles finer than grain size d, H=mass fraction of particles ranging from d to 4 d). <b>A</b> gap-graded soil <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fines</b> content of less than 10 % is internally stable if its gap ratio is smaller than 3. 0. <b>A</b> well-graded soil <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fines</b> content of more than 20 % or <b>a</b> gap-graded soil <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fines</b> content of more than 35 % is deemed to be internally stable...|$|R

The bill also would have created a new crime—being under the influence of marijuana—punishable by a fine of up to $5,000. The bill would have passed according to the positions of state senators, but was blocked on a technical basis which prevented it from coming to the floor the same day it was read—which allows public input—unless overridden by a vote.|$|E
5|$|Static {{balance is}} {{provided}} by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule. Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths shift position. This shift alters {{the positions of the}} filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E

5|$|Judah Beer was {{a leader}} of the Berlin Jewish {{community}} and maintained a private synagogue in his house which leaned towards reformist views. Jacob Beer wrote an early cantata for performance at this synagogue. Both Judah Herz Beer and his wife were close to the Prussian court; when Amalia was awarded in 1816 the Order of Louise, she was given, by Royal dispensation, not the traditional Cross but a portrait bust of the Queen. The Beer children were provided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> education; their tutors included two {{of the leaders of the}} enlightened Jewish intelligentsia, the author Aaron Halle-Wolfssohn and Edmund Kley, (later a reform movement rabbi in Hamburg) to whom they remained attached into their maturity.

5|$|Meanwhile, in {{an attempt}} to avoid losing large {{quantities}} of circulating nickels to melting, the United States Mint introduced new interim rules on December 14, 2006, that criminalized the melting and export of pennies (which as of 2013 cost 1.83 cents to produce) and nickels. Violators of these rules can be punished <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> of up to $10,000, five years imprisonment, or both. The rules were finalized on April 17, 2007. The melt value of a nickel for some time was more than five cents, including nearing over one-and-a-half times its face value in May 2007. Since then, the supply and demand of the coin's composition metals have stabilized. A nickel's melt value fell below its face value from late 2008 through mid-2010, and more recently again from late mid-2012 through the present. In February 2014, it was reported that the Mint was conducting experiments to use copper-plated zinc (the same composition used for the United States 1 cent coin) for the nickel.|$|E

5|$|Upper Paleolithic people {{specialized}} in organized, group hunting of large mammals; they sometimes pursued and drove entire herds into traps. Their nutritional needs were met largely by meat consumption, as the vegetation {{was limited to}} tundra and steppe and the land was covered by ice and snow (Vistula final glaciation) for long periods. More sophisticated tool making methods resulted {{in the production of}} long (some over two feet), narrow and sharp flintstone splits. In a cave near Nowy Targ (East-Gravettian culture), a 30,000-year-old boomerang, the world's oldest, was found. It is a crescent-shaped 70cm long object <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> finish, made of mammoth tusk. Mammoths were hunted in the Kraków area during 25,000-20,000 BCE.

5|$|Lambertia formosa grows as a {{spreading}} shrub to 2m (7ft) tall, {{with one}} or more stems arising from a woody base known as a lignotuber. The new growth is covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> brownish hair. The stiff leaves are arranged in whorls of 3, or sometimes up to 4 to 6, on the stems, and are linear to narrow-oblanceolate in shape. Measuring anywhere from 1 to 8cm (0.4–3in) in length and 0.2–0.7cm wide, they have a pointed tip or apex. Flowers are seen at any time of the year, but more often over spring and summer (September to January). Their bases are covered by greenish and reddish bracts. The inflorescences are almost always made up of seven smaller individual flowers (less than 1% of flowerheads have either six or eight flowers), known as florets, and can be shades of red or pink in colour. The tubular perianths are 4.5cm (1.6in) long, with the styles protruding another 1–1.5cm (0.5in) beyond. Flowering is followed by the development of woody fruit which measure 2–3 by 1–2cm. They have two 1–1.5cm sharp horny protuberances, and a 0.5cm 'beak', initially pale green in colour before fading to a grey-brown. These woody follicles each have two flat, winged seeds that are retained until burnt by fire.|$|E
