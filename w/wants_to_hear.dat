5|$|When Brian advises Stewie to “wait and see” {{whether or}} not he has cancer, Stewie says “Jim Henson had a wait and see attitude, and look what {{happened}} to him. Now we’ve got wrong-sounding Muppets,” a reference to Henson’s deadly Streptococcus pneumoniae infection that was discovered too late which led to his death in 1990. The scene then cuts to Kermit the Frog and the Swedish Chef in a dialogue sequence, with much different voice tones. The two would later appear {{at the end of the}} show, discussing the preceding events, when Fozzie Bear walks in, and says in a deep voice (supplied by actor Michael Clarke Duncan): “Wocka wocka. Who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> a funny-ass joke?”.|$|E
5|$|Seeing the {{positive}} reception by the female audience, Glenda tries to convince Deke {{to join the}} Tex Warner Show. Driving in Deke's hotrod, she tells him about his potential. Not willing to leave his first steady job in a year, he rejects the offer, but Glenda asks him to think about it. Upon returning to town, Glenda calls the Highway Beverage Company, after which she and Tex quit the Tallman campaign {{to return to their}} own roadshow. Later that night, Deke is provoked at a restaurant by the boyfriend of one of his fans, who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> him sing a song. After singing to a tune from the jukebox, he starts a fight with him. He is later exonerated by the police.|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Man {{meets with}} the Syndicate, who are {{responsible}} for the bees. Soon afterward a swarm of bees attacks a school in Columbia, South Carolina, and one of the teachers dies as a result. Skinner heads to the hospital, where he is met by Covarrubias. She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier for some sort of experiment. Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been working against him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder turns in the gun with the serial number filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder. That night Skinner confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will die if he kills him and Skinner leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder what he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone.|$|E

He tries to achieve this aim by playing cards with Warbucks and cheating (using the cold-deck method). He and Annie team up to stop the cheating.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, Estragon dozes off and Vladimir rouses him {{but then}} stops {{him before he}} can share his dreams another {{recurring}} activity between the two men. Estragon <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> an old joke, which Vladimir cannot finish without going off to urinate, since every time he starts laughing, a kidney ailment flares up. Upon Vladimir's return, the increasingly jaded Estragon suggests that they hang themselves, but they abandon the idea when the logistics seem ineffective. They then speculate on the potential rewards of continuing to wait for Godot, but can come to no definite conclusions. When Estragon declares his hunger, Vladimir provides a carrot (among a collection of turnips), at which Estragon idly gnaws, loudly reiterating his boredom.|$|E
25|$|Younis {{said he did}} {{not want}} to blame {{individuals}} but largely singled out players, particularly Afridi. He said Akmal should not have been selected, instead it should be players who are 'proud' to represent their country. He also said that the team lost the Asia cup in February 2016 because they were 'unfit' as they had not trained during PSL season and said it was like a 'holiday for them'. Overall, he blamed it on poor captaincy from Afridi. He said it was unfair for him to first use Mohammad Nawaz, a new player, as a bowler in the Asia Cup 2016 because it 'destroyed' his confidence when he was unable to handle it after being hit for 38 runs in 3 overs. Younis later posted on his Twitter – 'no one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the truth'.|$|E

Quantum of Solace director Marc Forster suggested that Dench's casting gave the character maternal overtones in her relationship with Bond, overtones made overt in Skyfall, in which Silva repeatedly refers to her as [...] "Mother" [...] and [...] "Mommy". In Skyfall she is revealed to be a widow.|$|E

However, {{it would have to be}} pushed back to 2013. Pusha T described the tape as street-oriented music intended for his longtime fans. [...] "Wrath of Caine is basically just me catering to my core. It's all about just street Hip Hop, street music" [...] he said. [...] "It's just something that I like to do. It's something that I feel like has no boundaries, no parameters. I can do what I really, really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do…approach to the mixtape is not about more of a creative decision, I just think it's about more of what I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> for myself and what my fans <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> They <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> lyrics, they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> street music…it's just the whole street life perspective." ...|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} telling this story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about this kind of history.

500|$|Edna asks [...] "Woodrow" [...] for a photograph, so Bart {{searches}} {{through a}} book called NHL Stars of 1969 and sends her a picture of ice hockey star Gordie Howe. Bart, as Woodrow, writes Edna other letters, using dialogue from old romance films {{to tell her what}} she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> He then sends a letter asking for them to meet at the Gilded Truffle restaurant. Bart sees Edna waiting for Woodrow, and laughs as he goes to watch a movie. When he comes back and sees Edna still at the restaurant on the verge of tears, Bart is upset and guilty to see her crying. Meanwhile, Homer resists temptations to curse but nevertheless experiences intense feelings of rage. However, his constant swearing eventually puts enough money in the jar to purchase a dog house.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{includes}} {{a variety of}} cultural references. Among Smithers' paintings of Burns is a parody of a photograph of Russian president Vladimir Putin riding a horse while bare-chested. Smithers likens Homer, Lenny and Carl to The Three Stooges, and Homer chooses Smithers' potential partners via the gay dating app Grindr. At the party, George Takei asks another man if he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> [...] "horror stories" [...] about his Star Trek co-star William Shatner, and he is pleased that the man does not know who Shatner is. A billboard outside the school's production of Casablanca advertises that the kindergarten are putting on a production of zoophilia-themed play Equus the following night. [...] The end sequence with the treasure hunt pays homage to Bogart's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The African Queen.|$|E
500|$|Amidst these drastic changes, large {{proportions}} of the freshmen classes (some as high as 30%) contained all-state high school band members. As the band's experience and musical talents grew, {{the quality of the}} music improved dramatically. Haney even rewrote the drills to include a portion where the band stopped moving and played to the audience. This innovation was well received and became a staple of the band's repertoire. In 1975, at a televised game versus the University of Arkansas, the Aggie Band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in the game. By the fourth quarter, the Aggie Band had played on TV during every break and Colonel Haney, trying his best to be fair, told the cameraman that they really should let the Razorback Band play a little too. The cameraman called up to the broadcast booth to get guidance and then replied, [...] "The director doesn't want to hear the Arkansas band, he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the Aggie Band." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 23, 2009, {{the band}} {{released}} their sixth studio album internationally via Roadrunner Records, titled Wrath {{and one day}} later in America via Epic Records. The album is dedicated to Mikey Bronsnan, who helped them get started in Philadelphia, PA. In November 2008, Bronsnan {{was killed by a}} drunk driver. According to drummer Chris Adler, [...] "Without Mikey, we'd very well might not be a band today." [...] Drummer Chris Adler was quoted saying [...] "This album is going to surprise a lot of people. Typically bands that get to where we are in our career begin to slack off, smell the roses and regurgitate. We chose a different path. No one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> another band member hyping a new record. ‘Wrath’ needs no hype. We have topped ourselves and on February 24 you will feel it." [...] "Wrath" [...] debuted on the Billboard 200 at number two, selling over 68,000 copies in its first week.|$|E
500|$|Stephanie McGrath of Jam! {{said the}} song is [...] "a nice break from the 'baby babys', 'yeah yeahs' and insistent drum beats that pepper the other songs" [...] of Oops!. David Veitch of the Calgary Sun {{compared}} the backing vocals to [...] "nicely old-fashioned shoo-be-doo-doos". Lyrically, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] alludes to how Spears <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> her boyfriend say he needs her {{all the way and}} that he loves her. Spears considered it a [...] "pure and delicate" [...] song. [...] "It's just one of those songs that pull you in. That's why I like it, and I like singing it as well," [...] she continued. [...] "I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, if you really listen... they're more of what I can relate to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think. I don't think Shania would probably sing some of the words that I'm saying." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} running {{too long to}} use the normal opening sequence. It {{therefore}} did not feature a chalkboard gag or a couch gag. Instead, it just cut to {{an image of the}} Simpson house. David Silverman was the director and was somewhat stressed, because he was doing storyboards for this episode while also directing [...] "Bart the Genius". Originally, he had planned to use the song [...] "War" [...] by Edwin Starr in the episode. The plans were dropped, when they decided that the song did not really fit the story. The episode had problems with the censors, who did not want the characters to say [...] "family jewels" [...] on prime time television. The producers ignored the notes and [...] "family jewels" [...] remained in the episode. This act of attempted censorship was reflected in the part where Grampa Simpson writes a letter complaining of how sexualized television has become and gives a list of words he never <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> on TV again, two of which are [...] "family jewels".|$|E

500|$|Mansukhani later {{added the}} gay storyline {{because he thought}} it was an issue that needed to be touched on. However, the {{director}} did not want the film to be serious or preachy: [...] "I also realise that when you preach via cinema nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it". [...] "The film has a message, if you get it, great. If you don’t, no problem, sit back, relax and enjoy the film", he said about making Dostana a romantic comedy. In February 2008, Johar announced the film's title; the producer named it after a 1980 film produced by his father, Yash Johar. Asked if his film was also a love triangle, he replied: [...] "Well, yes and no. Though it's a love story, there's a never-before twist in the tale. All I can say on record is that we've never had a love triangle like this before." [...] The gay storyline was not disclosed until the trailers were released. Manan Sagar was hired to edit the film, and the duo Salim–Sulaiman composed the background score.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, after Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) reveals to Robert that he {{sent her}} a sexually suggestive {{voicemail}}, Robert tasks Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with finding what the voicemail entailed. Initially, Pam tries to trick Nellie into divulging {{the contents of the}} message, but this plan is ruined when Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) shows up, claiming that she was Robert's [...] "back-up plan" [...] in case Pam failed. Finally, Pam steals Nellie's phone and brings it to Robert and the two listen to the various voice messages. After hearing several which paint a life for Nellie that is sad and lonely—she is unable to adopt a child and she has maxed out her credit cards—Pam relents and tells Robert that she will not help him anymore. Pam returns Nellie's phone and the two strike up a conversation. Nellie reveals to Pam her disgust for Robert, saying that he is sexually obsessed. She asks Pam if she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about Robert's voicemail, but Pam declines her offer. In the end, Nellie reveals to the camera that she is deeply moved to have a real friend at her work place.|$|E
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, and she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with a certain volume in my voice. I am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix as we go, {{so by the time}} we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If you touch a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|E
