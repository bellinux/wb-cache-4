25|$|The {{morning that}} his {{resignation}} took effect, the President, with Mrs. Nixon and their family, said {{farewell to the}} White House staff in the East Room. A helicopter carried them from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Nixon later wrote that he thought, “As the helicopter moved on to Andrews, I found myself thinking not of the past, but of the future. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> do now?” At Andrews, {{he and his family}} boarded Air Force One to El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in California, and then were transported to his home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

2500|$|Waldheim {{called the}} {{allegations}} [...] "pure lies and malicious acts". In a telex to Bronfman, {{he said that}} his past had been “deliberately misinterpreted.” Nevertheless, he admitted that he had known about German reprisals against partisans: [...] "Yes, I knew. I was horrified. But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> do? I had either to continue to serve or be executed." [...] He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan. His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had [...] "remained confined to a desk".|$|E
2500|$|Tatum {{tended to}} work and to record unaccompanied, partly because {{relatively}} few musicians could keep pace with his fast tempos and advanced harmonic vocabulary. Other musicians expressed amazed bewilderment at performing with Tatum. Drummer Jo Jones, who recorded a 1956 trio session with Tatum and bassist Red Callender, is quoted as quipping, [...] "I didn't even play on that session [...] all I did was listen. I mean, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> add? [...] I felt like setting my damn drums on fire." [...] Clarinetist Buddy DeFranco said that playing with Tatum was [...] "like chasing a train." [...] Tatum said of himself, [...] "A band hampers me." ...|$|E

Former Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky, of Jewish origin, denounced the actions of the World Jewish Congress as an [...] "extraordinary infamy", adding that Austrians would not [...] "allow the Jews abroad to ... tell us who should be our President." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Beckett {{refused to}} be drawn on the {{backgrounds}} of the characters, this has not stopped actors looking for their own motivation. Jean Martin had a doctor friend called Marthe Gautier, who {{was working at the}} Salpêtrière Hospital, and he said to her: [...] "'Listen, Marthe, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> find that would provide some kind of physiological explanation for a voice like the one written in the text?' [...] said: 'Well, {{it might be a good}} idea if you went to see the people who have Parkinson's disease.' So I asked her about the disease ... She explained how it begins with a trembling, which gets more and more noticeable, until later the patient can no longer speak without the voice shaking. So I said, 'That sounds exactly what I need.'" [...] "Sam and Roger were not entirely convinced by my interpretation but had no objections." [...] When he explained to Beckett that he was playing Lucky as if he were suffering from Parkinson's, Beckett said, [...] "'Yes, of course.' He mentioned briefly that his mother had had Parkinson's, but quickly moved on to another subject." ...|$|E

In my heart of hearts I had the firm conviction that the ginger-polled ruffian knew all about Carissimo and all about the present whereabouts of that rascal Theodore.
