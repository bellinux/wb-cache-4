6000|$|... "El Greco was {{the painter}} of Toledo. Betty couldn't find the {{photograph}} I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you.</b> It's {{a picture that}} El Greco painted of the city he loved, and it's truer than any photograph. Come and sit at the table." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did not {{allude to}} any special case, I only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that riches do {{not by any}} means make doing good a simpler affair, but rather render it more {{difficult}} not to do an equal amount of harm." ...|$|E

6000|$|Jim {{looked hard}} at him, and {{although}} he was surprised did not doubt his statement. [...] "Then, I imagine he made the plan himself; <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> he was smart, but said nothing when it didn't work as smoothly as he thought." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} appeared, Baas, {{and what is}} more, if you had taken that Medicine off and thrown it away you would have disappeared, since the 'mamba would have killed you.

"Here I {{come for}} Thanksgiving," [...] she said, in a rich, clear tone, [...] "and here," [...] she added, drawing {{a roll of}} bills from her bosom, and putting it into the deacon's hand, [...] "here's the {{interest}} money for this year.

50|$|I {{think of}} songs as cinema, really. It's aural cinema. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> a movie when I'm playing a song. That's {{essentially}} what I'm doing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} afraid of saying too much, and all through that miserable veglione {{business}} I {{was trying to}} please you and him, because I was afraid I had said too much--gone too far. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that I disdained to be suspicious, that I was ashamed to suppose that a girl of your age could care for the admiration of a man of his." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> my fancy dress," [...] it said, {{and struck}} an {{attitude}} {{at the foot}} of his bed. Jon drew a long breath and leaned against the door. The apparition wore white muslin on its head, a fichu round its bare neck over a wine-coloured dress, fulled out below its slender waist. It held one arm akimbo, and the other raised right-angled holding a fan which touched its head.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, {{pretty well}} I think," [...] said he, sighing, {{as if he}} cared little about the matter. [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> this, Henrietta." [...] And he took up a book where he had marked a passage for her. She saw several paper marks in some other books, and {{perceived}} with shame {{that he had been}} reading yesterday, and choosing out what might comfort her, his selfish sister, as she could not help feeling herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{reasoning}} does you infinite credit," [...] he answered, with {{a slight}} sneer. [...] "You are quite a Machiavelli. Come; I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> over my--warehouse." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Don't Forget" [...] was {{directed}} by Robert Hales.

She said, [...] "They had treatments , but I was just like, 'No, scratch them.' I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> come up with the idea.

6000|$|He {{had risen}} with his {{question}} and after her reply he remained {{a moment on}} the spot. [...] "See--I've frightened you. It proves as easy as that. But I only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> and to be sure for myself. Now that I've the mental certitude I shall never wish otherwise to use it." [...] He turned away to begin again one of his absorbed revolutions. [...] "Mr. Longdon has asked you this time for a grand public adhesion, and what he turns up for now is to receive your ultimatum? A final irrevocable flight with him is the line he advises, so that he'll be ready for it on the spot with the post-chaise and the pistols?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} a sharp lesson," [...] he said, [...] "and I {{know that you have}} been on thorns for the last year. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> what folly it was to place {{yourself}} in the power of anyone to ruin you, and I fancy I have succeeded very well. There is no harm in a game of billiards now and then, but if you cannot play without betting you had better cut it altogether. As for the tables, it is simply madness. You must lose in the long run, and I am quite sure that I have got out of you several times the amount of the I. O. U.'s that I hold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pipes, Goliath!" [...] Rafael said gayly to {{a little}} negro with a silver collar (he spoke to him in his native tongue of Dongola); [...] "and welcome to our snuggery, my Codlingsby. We are quieter here than {{in the front of}} the house, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> a picture. I'm proud of my pictures. That Leonardo came from Genoa, and was a gift to our father from my cousin, Marshal Manasseh: that Murillo was pawned to my uncle by Marie Antoinette before the flight to Varennes--the poor lady could not redeem the pledge, you know, and the picture remains with us. As for the Rafael, I suppose you are aware that he was one of our people. But what are you gazing at? Oh! my sister--I forgot. Miriam! this is the Lord Codlingsby." ...|$|E

I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that {{this is the type of}} imagery that's been presented to all of us. And the only difference is a black dude in the middle of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was by {{the merest}} chance I had them. Now come, just one hand, since we are prisoners. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how nicely I can play. I won't corrupt you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{few of us}} do that, even in the parlor; {{but every}} one of the Biddies is better for being there, whether they are {{grateful}} or not. I ought not to have mentioned this, perhaps, but I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> one thing that we girls can do. We all complain about bad servants, most as much as if we were house-keepers ourselves; but it never occurs to us to try and mend the matter, by getting up a better spirit between mistress and maid. Then there 's another thing we can do," [...] added Polly, warming up. [...] "Most of us find money enough for our little vanities and pleasures, but feel dreadfully poor when we come to pay for work, sewing especially. Could n't we give up a few of the vanities, and pay the seamstresses better?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Markham, soothingly; [...] "he's ashore {{with the}} Padre, and {{everything}} else is all right too. But it's rather ridiculous to think that those idiotic Indians believed {{the only way they}} could show Mr. Hurlstone that they meant us no harm was to drag us all up to THEIR Mission, as they call that half heathen cross of theirs--for safety against--who do you think, dear?--the dreadful AMERICANS! And imagine all the while the Padre and I were just behind you, bringing up the rear of the procession--only they wouldn't let us join you because they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> special honor as"--she sank her voice to a whisper in Eleanor's ear--"as the future Mrs. Hurlstone! It appears they must have noticed something about you two, {{the last time you were}} there, my dear. And--to think--YOU never told me anything about it!" ...|$|E
60|$|Herbert glanced reflectively at his companion. 'You mustn't let me tire you,' he said; 'but even on our theory {{it would}} not {{necessarily}} follow that you yourself would be much affected. It's true this fellow Sabathier really {{was something of a}} personality. He had a rather unusual itch for life, for trying on and on to squeeze something out of experience that isn't there; and he seemed never to weary of a magnificent attempt to find in his fellow-creatures, especially in the women he met, what even--if they have it--they cannot give. The little book I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> is partly autobiographical and really does manage to set the fellow on his feet. Even there he does absolutely take one's imagination. I shall never forget the thrill of picking him up in the Charing Cross Road. You see, I had known the queer old tombstone for years. He's enormously vivid--quite beyond my feebleness to describe, with a kind of French verve and rapture. Unluckily we can't get nearer than two years to his death. I shouldn't mind guessing some last devastating dream swept over him, held him the breath of an instant too long beneath the wave, and he caved in. We know he killed himself; and perhaps lived to regret it ever after.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sixteen years," [...] Helen told him. [...] "Philippa is twenty-nine. And now, don't be {{inquisitive}} any more, please, {{and come}} with me. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> where <b>to</b> change your clothes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Who knows? We're {{only at the}} beginning. We'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> a brick-making plant, out on the prairie, run by gas. But {{just now}} we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> one of our pet farms.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> the room," [...] {{she hurried}} on, closing his disclaimer. [...] "Dick {{gave me a}} free hand with it. It's all mine, you see, even to its proportions." ...|$|R
