He {{was taken to a}} nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. Soldiers filled the streets and blocked {{entrance}} to the capitol. Defiantly, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall. By a strictly party-line vote, they adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices.|$|E

On the morning of January 30, as Goebel and two friends <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> capitol building, a shot rang out, and Goebel fell wounded. He {{was taken to a}} nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. As expected, the contest committee recommended invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor, and the General Assembly voted to certify the recommendation. Goebel was sworn in as governor, but he died on February 3. Beckham then took the oath of office and continued the legal challenge against Taylor and his lieutenant governor, John Marshall.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Armed men from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky filled the capital. On the morning of January 30, 1900, as Goebel and two friends <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> capitol building, shots were fired, and Goebel fell wounded. After being denied entrance to the state capitol by armed men, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall and, by a strict party-line vote, adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices. When Democratic legislators attempted to convene to approve the committee's report, they found {{the doors to the}} state capitol and other public locations in Frankfort blocked by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Still lying on his sick bed, Goebel took the oath of office.|$|E

25|$|When the {{cafeteria}} bombs failed to explode, Harris and Klebold convened and <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> school. Both armed, they {{climbed to the}} top of the outdoor west entrance steps, placing them on a level with the athletic fields west of the building and the library inside the west entrance, directly above {{the cafeteria}}. From this vantage point, the cafeteria's west entrance was located at the bottom of the staircase, next to the senior parking lot.|$|E

A crowd of Democratic Party {{supporters}} <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> home of Republican Party leader, Joseph Bruno. Frustration with Bruno family {{control of the}} school board and other local offices had been growing for years. Shots were fired from the Bruno home and yard located at Fourth & Centre Streets. Several people were killed and more than 20 marchers were injured.|$|E
25|$|Utilizing {{available}} forensic data, Robert Graysmith {{postulated that}} another car {{pulled into the}} turnout, just prior to 11:00pm and parked beside the couple. The killer apparently exited the second car and <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Rambler, possibly ordering the couple out of the Rambler. Jensen appeared to have exited the car first, yet when Faraday was halfway out, the killer apparently shot Faraday in the head. Fleeing from the killer, Jensen was gunned down twenty-eight feet from the car with five shots through her back. The killer then drove off.|$|E

[...] became a commonplace term; being seen on T-shirts, bumper stickers, and advertising.

500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> corner of the house and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out the window to see what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E

2500|$|They shot toward {{students}} standing {{close to}} a soccer field but did not hit anyone. They <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west entrance, throwing pipe bombs, very few of which detonated. Meanwhile, inside the school, Patti Nielson, an art teacher, had noticed the commotion and <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west entrance with a 17-year-old student, Brian Anderson. She had intended to walk outside to tell the two students to [...] "Knock it off," [...] thinking Klebold and Harris were either filming a video or pulling a student prank. As Anderson opened {{the first set of}} double doors, Harris and Klebold shot out the windows, injuring him with flying glass and hitting Nielson in the shoulder with shrapnel. Nielson stood and ran back down the hall into the library, alerting the students inside to the danger and telling them to get under desks and keep silent. Nielson dialed 9-1-1 and hid under the library's administrative counter. Anderson remained behind, caught between the exterior and interior doors.|$|E
2500|$|Carrying {{a bundle}} {{wrapped in a}} {{checkered}} blanket, Huberty looked toward his elder daughter, Zelia, as he <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{front door of the}} family home and said, [...] "Goodbye.

According to eyewitnesses, he drove first toward the Big Bear supermarket and then toward the U.S. Post Office, before entering {{the parking lot of a}} McDonald's restaurant located approximately 200yards from his apartment.|$|E
2500|$|In 873, {{in a grand}} ceremony, Emperor Yizong welcomed {{what was}} {{claimed to be a}} relic (a finger bone) of Gautama Buddha to the palace, despite {{warnings}} by some that his grandfather Emperor Xianzong died shortly after also welcoming the same relic to the palace. [...] (Emperor Yizong responded to the warnings by stating, [...] "As long as I can see it once while living, I do not have regrets about dying.") [...] The ceremony was said to bring out great offerings by the households of Chang'an. [...] Emperor Yizong himself <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> relic and bowed on the ground in tears.|$|E

2500|$|Entering the {{restaurant}} minutes later, Huberty first aimed his shotgun at a 16-year-old employee named John Arnold. The assistant manager, Guillermo Flores, shouted, [...] "Hey, John. That guy's {{going to shoot}} you." [...] According to Arnold, when Huberty pulled the trigger, [...] "nothing happened". As Huberty inspected his gun, the manager of {{the restaurant}}, 22-year-old Neva Caine, <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> service counter of the restaurant in the direction of Arnold, as Arnold—believing the incident to be a distasteful joke—began {{to walk away from the}} gunman. Huberty fired his shotgun toward the ceiling before aiming the Uzi at Caine, shooting her once beneath her left eye. Caine died minutes later.|$|E
2500|$|After firing {{through the}} windows at {{evacuating}} students and the police, Klebold fired his shotgun at a nearby table, injuring three students: Patrick Ireland, Daniel Steepleton, and Makai Hall. He removed his trench coat. As Klebold fired at the three, Harris grabbed his shotgun and <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> lower row of computer desks, firing a single shot under the first desk without looking. He hit 14-year-old Steven Curnow with a mortal wound to the neck. Harris then shot under the adjacent computer desk, injuring 17-year-old Kacey Ruegsegger with a shot which passed completely through her right shoulder and hand, also grazing her neck and severing a major artery. When she started gasping in pain, Harris tersely stated, [...] "Quit your bitching." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{approximately}} 1:11–1:14p.m., Tippit {{was driving}} slowly eastward on East 10th Street — about [...] past {{the intersection of}} 10th Street and Patton Avenue — when he pulled alongside a man who resembled the police description. Oswald walked over to Tippit's car and apparently exchanged words with him through an open vent window. Tippit opened his car door and as he <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> front of the car, Oswald drew his handgun and fired four shots in rapid succession. One bullet hit Tippit in the chest, one in the stomach, another in his right temple (one bullet hit a button and did not penetrate his skin). Tippit's body was transported {{from the scene of}} the shooting by ambulance to Methodist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:25 p.m. by Dr. Richard A. Liguori.|$|E

2500|$|On September 29, 1981, Texas Department of Public Safety Officer David Rucker {{was shot}} and killed along a stretch of highway a few miles north of Brownsville, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley. Rucker's body, {{discovered}} by a passer-by, was lying beside his patrol car. He {{had been shot in the}} head. Around the same time, Los Fresnos Police Officer Enrique Carrisalez observed a speeding vehicle traveling on the same road away from where Rucker's body had been found. [...] Carrisalez and his partner turned on the patrol car's flashing red lights and pursued the vehicle, which pulled over. Carrisalez took a flashlight and <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> car. The driver of the vehicle opened his door and exchanged words with Carrisalez before firing at least one shot at Carrisalez' chest. He died nine days later. Leonel Torres Herrera was arrested a few days later and was charged with the capital murder of both Carrisalez and Rucker.|$|E
2500|$|Harris <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> bookcases {{between the}} west and center section of tables in the library. He jumped on one and shook it, then shot in an unknown {{direction}} within that general area. Klebold walked through the main area, past the first set of bookcases, the central desk area and a second set of bookcases into the east area. Harris walked from the bookcase he had shot from, past the central area to meet Klebold. The latter shot at a display case located next to the door, then turned and shot toward the closest table, hitting and injuring 17-year-old Mark Kintgen in the head and shoulder. He then turned toward the table to his left and fired, injuring 18-year-olds Lisa Kreutz and Valeen Schnurr with the same shotgun blast. Klebold then moved toward the same table and fired with the TEC-9, killing 18-year-old Lauren Townsend. At this point, the seriously injured Valeen Schnurr began screaming, [...] "Oh my God, oh my God!" [...] In response, Klebold asked Schnurr if she believed in the existence of God; when Schnurr replied she did, Klebold simply asked [...] "Why?" [...] before walking from the table.|$|E
2500|$|At {{approximately}} 2:30a.m. on March 13, 1964, Genovese {{left the}} bar {{she worked at}} and began driving home in her red Fiat. While waiting for a traffic light to change on Hoover Avenue, she was spotted by Winston Moseley, who {{was sitting in his}} parked car. Genovese arrived home around 3:15a.m. and parked her car in the Kew Gardens Station Long Island Rail Road parking lot, about [...] from her apartment's door, in an alleyway {{at the rear of the}} building. As she <b>walked</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> apartment complex, Moseley, [...] who had followed her home, exited his vehicle, which he had parked at a corner bus stop on Austin Street, and approached Genovese armed with a hunting knife. Genovese ran toward the front of the building, and Moseley ran after her, overtook her and stabbed her twice in the back. Genovese screamed, [...] "Oh my God, he stabbed me! Help me!". Several neighbors heard her cry, but only a few of them recognized the sound as a cry for help. When Robert Mozer, one of the neighbors, shouted at the attacker [...] "Let that girl alone!", Moseley ran away and Genovese slowly made her way toward the rear entrance of the building, seriously injured and out of view of any witnesses.|$|E
