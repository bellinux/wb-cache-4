40|$|<b>Wine</b> <b>cooperatives</b> were {{relatively}} scarce in Europe before the Second WorldWar, but {{accounted for more}} than half of all wines made in France, Italy, and Spain, thethree major producer countries, by the 1980 s. This article argues that their initial slowdiffusion was caused by the difficulties in measuring and controlling grape quality, andthat this provided incentives for members to produce large volumes of poor fruit whichadversely affected the <b>wines.</b> <b>Cooperatives</b> only became popular when the state offeredmaterial incentives to growers that helped compensate these problems of collectiveaction. This initially involved cheap credit to help build wineries but, from the 1950 s,growers enjoyed additional incentives to join cooperatives as governments attempted toregulate wine markets and provide income support. The problems associated with grapequality were never resolved and, with the major decline in consumption from the 1980 sand move away from bulk towards premium <b>wines,</b> <b>cooperatives</b> became increasinglyuncompetitive in the market place...|$|R

But only with the establishment of the <b>wine</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> in the twentieth century, it triggered a series of processes of transformation involving the territory from the architectural point of view, social and landscape. Located at the entrance of the villages, they are the first buildings that meet and represent the bond between the world of agricultural work and the life of the village. These architectures, for monumentality, visually impose their presence in the landscape, the same way as municipal buildings, the church or the castle. The continuous evolutionary process of the <b>wine</b> <b>cooperatives</b> leads us through new construction projects, expansion, technological adjustments, until the current phase involving in some cases the reconstruction "ex novo" of the installations, in others the recovery of existing depending on the enhancement of the territory and cultural identity of its inhabitants...|$|R

40|$|Facing market {{globalization}} and volatility, farmers find in agricultural cooperatives a secure way to sale their products, especially in wine sector (strong crisis before 2010). In the same time, cooperatives members and employees {{became more and}} more vertical organization averse and look for collaborative decision making process. In this context, traditional corporate governance models based on the classical agency theory appear not to be accurate for agricultural cooperatives governance. Considering a multi paradigmatic model with three dimensions (disciplinary, partnership and cognitive governance), we focused on the link between governance and overall corporate performance. We studied Languedoc-Roussillon <b>wine</b> <b>cooperatives</b> which represent 70 % of the output of this huge wine-growing area and we analysed how they overcame their financial difficulties thanks to the involvement of their stakeholders. We used original data, coming from COOPERFIC, a specific decision aid tool designed and managed by Coop de France Languedoc-Roussillon. The results showed the crucial role of the partnership dimension of cooperative governance via stakeholders’ and especially grape growers’members involvement (directors role). Top financial performance fitted partnership relations inside <b>wine</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> whereas disciplinary and cognitive governance seemed less relevant. Moreover, the three dimensions of agricultural cooperative governance appeared partially interconnected...|$|R

A first agglomeration seems to have appeared {{at the beginning of the}} Roman era, on a little mountain pass overhanging the Drôme, and the small valley of Meyrosse, at the crossroad between the valley and the path to Trièves. Lots of clues show the extension of urbanisation during the 1st century.At the beginning of the 2nd century, the city of Die constructs monuments and becomes a Roman capital, replacing Luc-en-Diois in that function for the Celtic people of northern Voconces. It seems it will be named as a colony towards the end of the 2nd century or during the 3rd century because the town became an important centre of fertility goddess Cybele’s cult.|$|E

40|$|Italian agro-food cooperatives are {{involved}} in mergers, acquisition and alliances processes, that require a renovating model of membership management. Wine cooperatives are particularly dynamic in this context. The {{aim of the research}} is to identify new integration patterns between the cooperative and its members, starting from the analysis of the members’ structural and strategic choices. The research has been conducted in a <b>wine</b> <b>cooperative</b> of Veneto Region. Five elements of differentiation have been discussed and moving from five clusters of members, a linear regression model has been applied. The actual mechanism of patronage return does not comprehend the complexity of membership, but it confirms the hypothesis that the cooperative should follow differerentiated integration strategies for the diverse typologies of members. The large structural, strategic, social-demographic and cultural heterogeneity of the members (especially in the big cooperatives) suggests to foresee different patterns in term of development projects, in order to propose diverse solutions for new investment initiatives and the quality improvement of deliveries, ensuring a more widespread satisfaction of stakeholders’ expectations. <b>Wine</b> <b>Cooperative,</b> Cooperative Nexus, Patronage Return, Membership Integration, Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E

40|$|The {{cooperative}} vineyard {{from the}} Var {{is the biggest}} vineyard at {{the east of the}} Rhône (44 OOO ha). The Var is the fourth department in France for the cooperative production with its 25 000 cooperators producing 2 OOO OOO hi among which about 400 OOO hi are VDQS or VAOC. A division into average cooperatives and prevailing small ones (av. — 20 000 hi) constituted above all by small winegrowers is a characteristic feature of this old cooperation (it celebrates its seventieth year of existence this very year) which has been able to equip itself with a plant on the whole considerable but too much dispersed. Serious problems about the management and development of these <b>wine</b> <b>cooperatives</b> arise due to their ocupation not only by part time cooperative winegrowers but also by urban people who, needless to say, have no interests incommom with the former ones. Confronted with a more and more powerful and concentrated trade, efforts in associating cooperatives together are not easily attempted. The <b>wine</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> the management of which is difficult, go on playing a protective and still conservative part of small production structures, thus creating among a lot of small winegrowers a mentality of wage workers. de Reparaz André, Bérard Claude.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} aims {{to engage}} critically with the commercial wine estate typology in the Stellenbosch wine {{region in the}} Western Cape. The social problems faced by farm workers in the region calls for a re-interpretation of the winery typology to ensure a more socially sustainable future for the viticultural industry in South Africa. In order to achieve this, the general state of the commercial wine estate in the region will be read in relation to aspects such as heritage, social responsibility and spatial relationship to urban areas and farm worker communities. To develop this new typology, a site with agricultural potential and a direct connection to an urban farm workers settlement will be used. The potential of the urban environment will be analysed {{in relation to the}} existing facilities in the community to determine a solution for a new typology of winery which will bridge the divide between community and the farm in such a way where it will be beneficial for both and through this create a new social structure for the wine estate.

The <b>wine</b> <b>cooperative</b> system in vineyards in mountain regions, {{such as in}} Banyuls-sur-Mer, France and the Val di Cembra, Italy, offers a privileged context for studying the opportunities for individual action that affect precarious socio-economic balances. To understand, and sometimes predict, changes in the socio-economics and landscapes of a region due to cooperatives, {{we have used a}} multi-agent system (MAS) to model the behavior of the actors involved in wine production in a cooperative.

For nearly a century, they have represented an important means of organisational and strategic structuring of agricultural and food sectors in France.

The analysis of 14 <b>wine</b> <b>cooperatives</b> mergers in Languedoc Roussillon between 2004 and 2010 is our empirical field.
