40|$|This {{research}} explores to {{what extent}} peopleâ€™s <b>work</b> <b>locations</b> are {{similar to that of}} those who live around them. Using the Longitudinal Economic and Household Dynamics data set and the US census for the Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St. Paul) metropolitan area, we investigate the home and <b>work</b> <b>locations</b> of different census block residents. Our aim is to investigate if people who live close to one another, also work close to one another to a degree beyond what would be expected at random. We find a significantly non-random correlation between joint home and joint <b>work</b> <b>locations.</b> Further, we show what features of particular neighborhoods are associated with comparatively higher incidences of people sharing <b>work</b> <b>locations.</b> One reason for such an outcome can be the role neighborhood level social networks play in locating jobs; or conversely work place social networks play in choosing the home location or both. Such findings should be used to refine work trip distribution models that otherwise depend mainly on impedance between the origin and destination. ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} four decades a great deal of {{research}} has been carried out investigating aspects of the spatial mismatch hypothesis. At its foundation, the notion of spatial mismatch is driven largely by social justice, as some groups are disproportionately disadvantaged by the patterns of metropolitan growth and development. We offer geographical insights into this dimension of spatial mismatch through an exploratory spatial analysis of metropolitan-scale home and <b>work</b> <b>locations.</b> This is achieved by developing a conceptual framework that synthesizes research on spatial mismatch and jobsÂ â€“Â housing balance. Following this, a model is employed to detect homeÂ â€“Â work imbalances, controlling for race, ethnicity, and the mode of commute. The approach is applied to data on the residential and <b>work</b> <b>locations</b> for commuter groups in the Atlanta, GA metropolitan area. The results reveal how potential commute options differ across commuter groups and show that minority homeÂ â€“Â work alternatives are more spatially constrained. ...|$|R
