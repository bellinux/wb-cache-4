Three years earlier they had {{destroyed}} {{the army of}} Hasdrubal Barca who had marched from Iberia through the Alps into Italy to help his brother Hannibal. Publius Cornelius Scipio had taken advantage of Hasdrubal’s departure and broke the Carthaginian power on the Iberian peninsula {{as a result of}} the battle at Ilipa.

25|$|In the 1980s, Los Muñequitos de Matanzas greatly {{expanded}} the melodic {{parameters of the}} drums, inspiring a wave of creativity that ultimately led to the modernization of rumba drumming. Freed from {{the confines of the}} traditional drum melodies, rumba became more an aesthetic, rather than a specific combination of individual parts. The most significant innovation of the late 1980s was the rumba known as guarapachangueo, created by Los Chinitos of Havana, and batá-rumba, created by AfroCuba de Matanzas. Batá-rumba initially <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> combining guaguancó and chachalokuafún, but it has since expanded to include a variety of batá rhythms.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s {{research}} in both {{animals and humans}} began to provide evidence that sex hormones {{play an important role}} in early life in promoting or constraining adult sex-dimorphic sexual behavior and even gender identity. Examples of apparent androgen determination of gender identity in XY people with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency in the Dominican Republic had been published, along with reports of masculinized behavior in girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and unsatisfactory sexual outcomes in adult women with CAH. Many endocrinologists were becoming skeptical that reassignment of genetic males to females <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> learning and appearance, or that the newer clitoral reductions would be more successful than clitoral recessions.|$|E

500|$|When {{deciding}} on musicians {{to perform on}} the album, Moore said that he [...] "picked people who were around". His girlfriend, Bige Akdeniz, performed vocals, Theron Patterson did programming and Patterson's drum teacher, Utku Ünal, performed the drums. The only musician Moore actively sought out was guitarist Erdem Helvacıoğlu, who performed on one track. Moore noted {{that none of the}} music was technically demanding, [...] "it's just more of a feel that we’re going for so it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> getting comfortable and getting in the mood and playing stuff together." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1965 season Tauranac {{was losing}} {{interest}} in this arrangement, reasoning that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> a lot of effort for no real interest because I didn't get to go racing very much" [...] and [...] "I might as well get on with my main line business, which was selling production cars." [...] Although Brabham investigated using chassis from other manufacturers, the two men eventually agreed that Tauranac would have a greater interest in the Formula One team, which MRD eventually took over completely from BRO. This agreement was not reached until November 1965. Repco delivered the first example of the new engine to the team's headquarters in the United Kingdom in late 1965, just weeks before the first Formula One race to the new regulations, the non-championship South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1966. Rather than build a new car in the limited time available, BRO pressed chassis number F1-1-1965, the sole and unused BT19, into service.|$|E
500|$|Case, who had {{previously}} worked on the soap operas General Hospital and As the World Turns, was cast in August 1994. She was selected {{from a group of}} six other possible recasts after a screen testing with co-star Joshua Morrow, and began airing on September 7, 1994. Initially, Case believed she would only be playing the role for a maximum of six months. Of her casting, she stated: [...] "Not only is this my third soap, but I'm also the third actress {{to play the role of}} Sharon Collins. So, if three times is the charm, this should be it." [...] The actress wanted to [...] "breathe new life" [...] into the role and make it her own. In 2003, Case was off-screen from February 17 to May 1, during contract negotiations. These were resolved that April, when she signed a new contract to remain on the show for another four years, until 2007. Case revealed that while she considered leaving the series, [...] "I would not have been negotiating if I did not want to come back. I've always had a great story to play. I love the way they write Sharon. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> hammering out the deal points." ...|$|E

[...] The second stated [...] "'Jeremy Deller presents '1997 What The Fuck's Going On'", a reference to The JAMs' debut album 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?). [...] It continued, [...] "Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond invite you to a 23 minute performance during which the next 840 days of our lives will be discussed". The Independent {{looked forward to the}} event, saying that [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> time before Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond hatched another prank and put a grin back on the face of pop music." [...] "You just ache for them to be No. 1 again....", they said, but [...] "One hopes they are not about to shoot themselves in the foot" [...] because [...] "the idea walks the tightrope between lunacy and brilliance.... the pop world's countdown to the millennium surely starts here".|$|E

2500|$|Sam Kellerman was 29 years old. In {{speaking}} about his brother, Max Kellerman recalls that [...] " [...] was a creative genius... He {{was the best}} writer for his age I've ever read.

When it came to writing, I felt like Salieri to Sam's Mozart. Sam wanted to direct film, but I think he was fated to write and be in front of the camera. He was starting to get work as an actor. He was in several national commercials. And acting wasn't even what he did best. Sam was a sure thing. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> time before he made it big." ...|$|E

He advocated a move toward [...] "civilization", by which he meant material and spiritual well-being, which elevated human life to a [...] "higher plane". Because material and spiritual well-being corresponded to knowledge and [...] "virtue," [...] to [...] "move toward civilization" [...] was to advance and pursue knowledge and virtue themselves. He contended that people could find the answer to their life or their present situation from [...] "civilization."

2500|$|The battle {{caused a}} rise in anti-war {{sentiment}} in the Northern states. Grant {{became known as the}} [...] "fumbling butcher" [...] for his poor decisions. It also lowered the morale of his remaining troops. But the campaign had served Grant's purpose—as ill-advised as his attack on Cold Harbor was, Lee had lost the initiative and was forced to devote his attention to the defense of Richmond and Petersburg. He beat Grant to Petersburg, barely, but spent the remainder of the war (save its final week) defending Richmond behind a fortified trench line. Although Southerners realized their situation was desperate, they hoped that Lee's stubborn (and bloody) resistance would have political repercussions by causing Abraham Lincoln to lose the 1864 presidential election to a more peace-friendly candidate. The taking of Atlanta in September dashed these hopes, {{and the end of the}} Confederacy <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|E

2500|$|One {{of these}} new readers was a young {{suburban}} Indianapolis teacher {{by the name of}} Hulda Augusta Eickhoff. [...] Impressed by the solid message and zestful writing style of the articles signed only with the initials “W.A.M.”, Miss Eickhoff decided to join the Walther League and become a part of their vision. Soon Hulda was elected secretary of the Indianapolis chapter. Her program material had to be approved by “W.A.M.” in Milwaukee, who became as smitten with her writing as she was with his. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> time before the handsome twenty-seven-year-old national secretary met the secretary of the Indianapolis chapter; a slender brunette with expressive brown eyes and sparkling smile who was destined to become his bride. [...] Married in 1924, they eventually had two sons: Walter A. Maier II, born in 1925; and Paul L. Maier, born in 1929. Maier continued in his capacity as editor of the Messenger through 1945.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by a {{performance}} of Japanese taiko drummers Witer formed Big Pig: [...] "When I saw them, the key to it was orchestration – that each guy had his own part. There was no improvisation at all. So from that point on, I {{knew how to do}} it. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> getting the right people". The initial incarnation involved eight or nine drummers, with Witer trying to sing over the poly-rhythmic din; while members of the band came and went. At an early gig Witer's former band mate, Sherine Abeyratne, attended and subsequently joined the ensemble. As a vocalist, she {{had been a member of}} various groups: Grand Wazoo, The Editions, Bang, Big Choir, Bob Starkie Shape Up, Gospel Truth, Jo Jo Zep Band, Black Coffee, Dianna Boss and The Extremes, and The Rock Party. In 1988 Sherine recalled [...] "I started joining bands eight years ago, as long as the music was high-energy, really strong, that was the criterion". She had also toured with INXS as a backing vocalist. Another early member was Nick Disbray on vocals and percussion.|$|E

But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather leaning against the wall, and as I was routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing. And {{all of a sudden he}} got up and started singing, along with another run-through, and he must have had 80% of the words there ...
