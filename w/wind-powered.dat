5|$|Nguyễn Ánh {{began by}} {{deploying}} his expanded and modernised naval fleet in raids against coastal Tây Sơn territory. His fleet left Saigon and sailed northward {{on an annual}} basis during June and July, carried by southwesterly winds. The naval offensives were reinforced by infantry campaigns. His fleet would then return south when the monsoon ended, on the back of northeasterly winds. The large European <b>wind-powered</b> vessels gave the Nguyễn navy a commanding artillery advantage, as they had a superior range to the Tây Sơn cannons on the coast. Combined with traditional galleys and a crew that was highly regarded for its discipline, skill and bravery, the European-style vessels in the Nguyễn fleet inflicted hundreds of losses against the Tây Sơn in 1792 and 1793.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} {{powered by the}} wind, is distinct from a storm's <b>wind-powered</b> currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E
5|$|The fen was {{inundated}} in 1798, and {{the civil}} engineers William Jessop and John Rennie were asked to assist the local engineers Edward Hare and George Maxwell. There was a clear understanding that the outfalls were too high to allow proper drainage by gravity, and two possible solutions were considered. The first was an outfall at a lower level, which would involve hugh expense in its construction, and the second, favoured by Jessop and Rennie, was the provision of steam pumping engines at Pode Hole. These would pump water from the internal drains of the fen to Vernatt's Drain, and the lower internal water levels would allow the existing <b>wind-powered</b> drainage mills to work efficiently. A report was produced, which {{formed the basis for}} the Deeping Fen Act of 1801. The channel of the Welland above Spalding was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains which crossed the fen to join Vernatt's Drain at Pode Hole were made deeper. At the time there were no steam engines working in the fens, and Rennie's recommendation of a steam pumping station at Pode Hole was not implemented.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposed}} Kajiado Wind Power Station, also Kipeto Wind Power Project, is {{a potential}} 100 megawatt <b>wind-powered</b> electricity power station in Kenya.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>wind-powered</b> {{vehicles}} typically sail at {{apparent wind}} angles {{aligned with the}} leading edge of the sail, the sail acts as an airfoil and lift is the predominant component of propulsion. Low forward resistance to motion, high speeds over the surface, and high lateral resistance help create high apparent wind speeds—with closer alignment of the apparent wind to the course traveled for most points of sail—and allow <b>wind-powered</b> vehicles to achieve higher speeds than conventional sailing craft.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>wind-powered</b> {{vehicles}} are built solely {{to demonstrate a}} limited principle, e.g. the ability to go upwind or downwind faster than the prevailing windspeed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wind-powered</b> {{electric}} vehicles primarily use wind-turbines installed at a strategic {{point of the}} vehicle, which are then converted into electric energy which causes the vehicle to propel.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>wind-powered</b> conveyances include sailing {{vessels that}} travel on water, and {{balloons}} and sailplanes that {{travel in the}} air, {{all of which are}} {{beyond the scope of this}} article.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Urban Green Energy {{introduced}} the world's first <b>wind-powered</b> electric vehicle charging station, the Sanya SkyPump. The design features a 4kW vertical-axis wind turbine {{paired with a}} GE WattStation.|$|E
25|$|The Éolienne Bollée {{is unique}} amongst {{other forms of}} {{windmill}} because of the stator. All windmills have a rotor, {{whether it is the}} sails on a traditional windmill or the blades of a modern wind turbine. The Éolienne Bollée is the only <b>wind-powered</b> turbine where the wind passes through a set of fixed blades (stator) before driving the windmill itself (rotor).|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the raids}} were {{successful}} {{because of the}} fast watercraft in the employ of the raiders. It {{was not until the}} commission of the vapor, fast steamships, in the mid-18th century that the Spanish navy successfully patrolled the archipelagic waters, and fared well against the <b>wind-powered</b> native seacraft of the pirates. Many pirate fleets were sunk at sea, or confined to their hiding places.|$|E
25|$|The Ventomobile was a <b>wind-powered</b> {{lightweight}} three-wheeler {{designed by}} University of Stuttgart students. It had a carbon-fiber rotor support that was directed {{into the wind}} and variably pitched rotor blades that adjust for wind speed. Power transmission between the rotor and the driving wheels was via two bicycle gearboxes and a bicycle chain. It won the first prize at the Racing Aeolus held at Den Helder, Netherlands, in August 2008.|$|E
25|$|Rotor-powered {{vehicles}} are <b>wind-powered</b> vehicles that use rotors—instead of sails—which {{may have a}} shroud around them (ducted fan) or constitute an unducted propeller, and which may adjust orientation to face the apparent wind. The rotor may be connected via a drive train to wheels or to a generator that provides electrical power to electric motors that drive the wheels. Other concepts use a {{vertical axis wind turbine}} with airfoils that rotate around a vertical axis.|$|E
25|$|After {{restoration}} {{work was}} completed, {{she was taken}} to her permanent berth—Constellation Dock, Inner Harbor at Pier 1, 301 East Pratt Street, Baltimore, Maryland on 4 July 1961. She was designated a National Historic Landmark on 23 May 1963, and {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places on 15 October 1966. She is the last existing intact naval vessel from the American Civil War, and {{she was one of the}} last <b>wind-powered</b> warships built by the U.S. Navy.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, a {{large share}} of Iran's natural gas {{reserves}} were untapped. The addition of new hydroelectric stations and the streamlining of conventional coal and oil-fired stations increased installed capacity to 33,000 megawatts. Of that amount, about 75% was based on natural gas, 18% on oil, and 7% on hydroelectric power. In 2004, Iran opened its first <b>wind-powered</b> and geothermal plants, and the first solar thermal plant was to come online in 2009. Iran is the world's third country to have developed GTL technology.|$|E
25|$|The new craze for {{chocolate}} {{brought with it}} a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cacao bean was manual. Cacao plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cacao production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. <b>Wind-powered</b> and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.|$|E
25|$|Of the 10,000 {{windmills}} {{in use in}} the Netherlands around 1850, about 1,000 {{are still}} standing. Most of these are being run by volunteers, though some grist mills are still operating commercially. Many of the drainage mills have been appointed as backup to the modern pumping stations. The Zaan district has been {{said to have been}} the first industrialized region of the world with around 600 operating <b>wind-powered</b> industries {{by the end of the}} eighteenth century. Economic fluctuations and the industrial revolution had a much greater impact on these industries than on grain and drainage mills, so only very few are left.|$|E
25|$|The local {{environment}} and the construction materials it can provide, govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees will develop a wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early California redwood water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouses) {{were part of a}} self-contained <b>wind-powered</b> domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, almost by definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular.|$|E
25|$|Downtown {{improvements}} {{became more}} {{evident in the}} first decade. The Coronado Theatre reopened after an $18.5 million renovation in 2001. The controversial pedestrian mall was removed, returning Main Street to a two-lane thoroughfare complete with cafe-style seating and <b>wind-powered</b> streetlights. The MetroCentre underwent a $20 million renovation, prompting interest in the purchasing of its naming rights; the arena was subsequently renamed the BMO Harris Bank Center. An open-air amphitheatre and a riverwalk were constructed to tie the Discovery Center Museum and the Burpee Museum of National History together. Most significantly, the Stanley J. Roszkowski U.S. Courthouse was constructed for $100 million and the restoration of daily Black Hawk rail service began, scheduled for completion in 2015, for $223 million.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Grylls led {{a team of}} four {{to climb}} {{one of the most}} remote unclimbed peaks in the world in Antarctica, to raise funds for children's charity Global Angels and promote the use of {{alternative}} energies. During this mission the team also aimed to explore the coast of Antarctica by inflatable boat and jetski, part powered by bioethanol, and then to travel across some of the vast ice desert by <b>wind-powered</b> kite-ski and electric powered paramotor. However, the expedition was cut short after Grylls suffered a broken shoulder while kite skiing across a stretch of ice. Travelling at speeds up to 50km/h (30mph), a ski caught on the ice, launching him in the air and breaking his shoulder when he came down. He had to be medically evacuated.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th century {{windmills}} {{became popular}} in Europe; {{the total number}} of <b>wind-powered</b> mills is estimated to have been around 200,000 at its peak in 1850, which is modest compared to some 500,000 waterwheels. Windmills were applied in regions where there was too little water, where rivers freeze in winter and in flat lands where the flow of the river was too slow to provide the required power. With the coming of the industrial revolution, the importance of wind and water as primary industrial energy sources declined and were eventually replaced by steam (in steam mills) and internal combustion engines, although windmills continued to be built in large numbers until late in the nineteenth century. More recently, windmills have been preserved for their historic value, in some cases as static exhibits when the antique machinery is too fragile to put in motion, and in other cases as fully working mills.|$|E
500|$|Tom Chick from FidGit {{compared}} Ancient Trader {{to video}} games such as The Seven Cities of Gold and Sid Meier's Pirates!, {{as well as}} to other indie games such as [...] "the sci-fi space operettas Strange Adventures in Infinite Space and Flotilla, but <b>wind-powered</b> and sepia-toned". Like most reviewers, Chick highly praised the artistic design, as well as the game's atmospheric music and vividness of the environment: [...] "It's all ink and vellum and cursive script and layers of lovingly drawn facades drawn on plywood and stacked up for a 19th Century stage production." ...|$|E
500|$|After the sun {{disappeared}} on 25 October {{the ship}} was lit by electric lamps from a <b>wind-powered</b> generator. The crew settled down to a comfortable routine in which boredom and inactivity were the main enemies. Men began to irritate each other, and fights sometimes broke out. Nansen attempted to start a newspaper, but the project soon fizzled out through lack of interest. Small tasks were undertaken and scientific observations maintained, {{but there was no}} urgency. Nansen expressed his frustration in his journal: [...] "I feel I must break through this deadness, this inertia, and find some outlet for my energies." [...] And later: [...] "Can't something happen? Could not a hurricane come and tear up this ice?" [...] Only {{after the turn of the}} year, in January 1894, did the northerly direction become generally settled. The 80° mark was finally passed on 22 March.|$|E
500|$|Reports on {{improvements}} to the system were produced in 1843 by the surveyor Mr W Lewin and in 1845 by Sir John Rennie. Rennie's scheme involved the provision of a catchwater drain to collect water draining from the higher ground to the west before it entered the fenlands, but an Act of Parliament to authorise its construction was defeated, and so in 1846 a report by Mr W Cubit which proposed {{improvements to}} the existing infrastructure was accepted by the Commissioners. A new Black Sluice, including a [...] wide navigation lock, was constructed {{to the south of}} the original one, with the cill level [...] lower, which enabled the gradient of the South Forty-Foot Drain to be increased to 3inches per mile (5cm/km). Many of the tributary drains were also improved. 1846 also {{marked the beginning of the}} use of steam engines for pumping. Ten years later, a map covering [...] of the Black Sluice area showed nine steam-powered and eight <b>wind-powered</b> drainage engines in use.|$|E
500|$|The main reedbed on {{the site}} is known as Newlands, an {{extensive}} area forming {{the eastern end of}} the reserve. [...] Together with other areas in the West Marsh, the total area of reedbed is now around 25 hectares (61 acres). A <b>wind-powered</b> water pump is currently installed to lift water from the flood plain to irrigate a further 9 hectare (22 acre) area near the Visitor Centre. This project is part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan which has targeted the creation of 1,200 hectare (3,000 acres) of reedbed nationwide. The reedbeds support a number of acrocephalid warblers such as the reed warbler, sedge warbler and marsh warbler as well as others such as grasshopper warbler, {{and it was the first}} recorded breeding site in the region for Cetti's warbler. There is a long-term plan to have an endangered species, the Eurasian bittern, breeding here by 2014 and regular sightings of the species have already occurred, with up to three individual birds being sighted during late 2009. [...] A new hide overlooking Newlands, named after Brandon volunteer Ted Jury who died in 2009, was opened in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Nowadays, a {{yardstick}} used {{to determine}} the best locations for wind energy development is referred to as wind power density (WPD). It is a calculation relating to the effective force of the wind at a particular location, frequently expressed in terms of the elevation above ground level over a period of time. It takes into account wind velocity and mass. Color coded maps are prepared for a particular area are described as, for example, [...] "mean annual power density at 50meters". The results of the above calculation are included in an index developed by the National Renewable Energy Lab and referred to as [...] "NREL CLASS". The larger the WPD calculation, the higher it is rated by class. At the end of 2008, worldwide nameplate capacity of <b>wind-powered</b> generators was 120.8gigawatts. Although wind produced only about 1.5% of worldwide electricity use in 2009, it is growing rapidly, having doubled in the three years between 2005 and 2008. In several countries it has achieved relatively high levels of penetration, accounting for approximately 19% of electricity production in Denmark, 10% in Spain and Portugal, and 7% in Germany and the Republic of Ireland in 2008. One study indicates that an entirely renewable energy supply based on 70% wind is attainable at today's power prices by linking wind farms with an HVDC supergrid.Wind power has expanded quickly, its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1%. In 2011 wind energy was also used to power the longest journey in a wind powered car which travelled a distance of 5,000km (3,100 miles) from Perth to Melbourne in Australia.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Wind-powered</b> {{vehicles}} {{derive their}} power from sails, kites or rotors and ride on wheels—which {{may be linked}} to a <b>wind-powered</b> rotor—or runners. Whether powered by sail, kite or rotor, these vehicles share a common trait: As the vehicle increases in speed, the advancing airfoil encounters an increasing apparent wind at an angle of attack that is increasingly smaller. At the same time, such vehicles are subject to relatively low forward resistance, compared with traditional sailing craft. [...] As a result, such vehicles are often capable of speeds exceeding that of the wind.|$|E
