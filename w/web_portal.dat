Digital continued its lead in Internet and Web development through difficult times, but Kotok questioned a corporate strategy that he believed consumed Web and Internet resources to sell Digital products like the AlphaServer.

40|$|<b>Web</b> <b>portals</b> are {{entry points}} for {{information}} presentation and exchange {{over the internet}} used by a community of interest. Therefore they require efficient support for communication and information sharing. Current Web technologies employed to build up these portals present serious limitations regarding facilities for searching, accessing, extracting, interpreting and processing for information. These limitations are naturally inherited by existing portals, thus hampering the communication and information sharing process between community members. The application of Semantic Web technologies {{has the potential of}} overcoming these limitations and, therefore, they canbe used to evolve current <b>Web</b> <b>portals</b> to semantically enhanced <b>Web</b> <b>portals.</b> This paper presents {{the state of the art}} application of Semantic Web technologies in <b>web</b> <b>portals</b> and the improvements achieved by the use of such technologies.

Based on an analysis of all 362 libraries and <b>web</b> <b>portals,</b> defined in a broad sense, including three illustrative case studies based on typical case sampling (Patton 2002), the article argues that an increasing amount of information will be made available in English on library <b>web</b> <b>portals,</b> but that the process will stop short of full bilingual provision. 1...|$|R

Methods: This article, which is based upon bibliographic searches in PubMed, reviews important developments in <b>web</b> <b>portals</b> for primary and secondary disease prevention, including patient <b>web</b> <b>portals</b> tethered to electronic medical records, disease-specific portals, health disparities, and health-related community <b>web</b> <b>portals.</b> Results: Although findings have not been uniformly positive, several studies {{of the effectiveness of}} health care system patient portals in chronic disease management have shown promising results with regard to patient outcomes. Patient <b>web</b> <b>portals</b> have also shown promising results in increasing adherence with screening recommendations. Racial and ethnic minorities, younger persons, and patients who are less educated or have lower health literacy {{have been found to be}} less likely to use patient portals. Conclusion: Additional studies are needed of the utility and effectiveness of different elements of <b>web</b> <b>portals</b> for different patient populations.

40|$|There is an {{extensive}} set of published {{information on the}} Internet. Human based approach to discover and utilize this information is not only time consuming, but also requires continuous user interaction. <b>Web</b> <b>portals</b> are the next evolution in Internet services as they provide a more robust one-point access {{to a variety of}} core information, and ideally offer a single sign-on point. So far, most of the activities performed on the <b>Web</b> <b>portals</b> can be characterized as solitary ones where users/agents logged in on <b>Web</b> <b>portals</b> can only browse around pages experiencing everything on their own. In this paper we demonstrate the use of agent technology to enable user-centric discovery and utilization of <b>Web</b> <b>portals.</b> We have developed collaborative agents-based architecture aimed at supporting, as a particular kind of collaboration, for user-centric searching and managing of the <b>Web</b> <b>portals.</b> As the system is agent driven, each agent conforms to a communication protocol that allows it to send/receive messages to/from another agent.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Web</b> <b>Portals</b> are {{increasingly}} being used for important tasks, at a work, personal or leisure related issues. Since <b>Web</b> <b>Portals</b> provide with applications, services and information, their levels of quality are an important prerequisite for their success, and hence, a {{way to ensure that}} they do not disappear as a consequence of their not having been used. According to the ISO, there are various perspectives of quality: internal, external, and in use. Although issues related to external quality and internal quality have been widely studied in literature, we consider that it is also necessary to take account the importance of quality in use of <b>web</b> <b>portals.</b> This paper is aimed at defining a quality model to assess the level of quality in use of <b>Web</b> <b>Portals.</b> The model is founded on the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, and on some related works found in literature...|$|R

AOL {{was one of the}} early pioneers of the Internet in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the U.S. It originally provided a dial-up service to millions of Americans, as well as providing a <b>web</b> <b>portal,</b> e-mail, instant messaging and later a web browser following its purchase of Netscape. At the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate Time Warner in the largest merger in U.S. history. AOL rapidly declined thereafter, partly due to the decline of dial-up to broadband. AOL was eventually spun off from Time Warner in 2009, with Tim Armstrong appointed the new CEO. Under his leadership, the company invested in media brands and advertising technologies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Semantic Web {{will never}} be a reality unless the {{quantity}} of Semantic Web pages significantly increases. Our thesis is that enlargement of the Semantic Web content is possible and effective by acquisition of ontological structures from human users of community Semantic <b>Web</b> <b>portals.</b> An important aspect of the proposed approach is that ontology structure acquisition from humans takes place merely by the portal exploitation without significant effort from the user side. We describe the People’s portal environment that motivates and allows the People’s portal users to develop, populate and share ontologies, define the ways to manage the content on the community Semantic <b>Web</b> <b>portals,</b> and to reach dynamic consensus on the basis of heterogeneous ontologies. This work contributes to overcoming the limitations of the existing <b>web</b> <b>portals</b> by specifying and prototyping the People’s portal environment, i. e., a framework for user-driven community Semantic <b>Web</b> <b>portals.</b> ...|$|R
