It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a private language in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language - if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others. The private language being considered is not simply a language in fact understood by one person, but a language that in principle can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it.|$|E

500|$|According to Volk, [...] "The basic {{tenet of}} what <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> Manilius' natural {{philosophy}} {{is the idea}} that the universe is divine". With that said, she contends that the poet is inconsistent {{when it comes to the}} location of this divinity. For instance, in his first book, Manilius claims that the perfectly regular movement of the heavenly bodies is proof that the universe is the product of a god, but at the same time he asserts that the universe itself is also a god (mundum ... ipsum esse deum). Later in the same book, Manilius once again argues that the universe is the [...] "work of a great divinity" [...] (magni ... numinis ordo). Concerning this vacillation, Volk writes: [...] "It is clear that there is a certain elasticity to Manilius' concept of the divinity of the universe ... Is the world simply ruled by a diuinum numen (cf. 1.484) or is it a deus (cf 1.485) itself?" [...] Volk answers that in the cosmology of the Astronomica, [...] "God can be understood as the soul or breath ... present within the world [...] since this divine entity completely pervades the cosmos, it makes equally much sense to call the cosmos itself a god." [...] According to Volk, this interpretation of the universewhich states that it has a sense of intellect and that it operates in an orderly waythus allows Manilius to contend both that there is an unbroken chain of cause and effect impacting everything within the cosmos, [...] and that fate rules all.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt commented that the video was [...] "B's show—La Gaga's just guesting in it." [...] Greenblatt also praised the fashion designs used in the video and the Bettie Page [...] "vibes".

However, he said that [...] "Even with Gaga involved, the Hype Williams-produced video doesn't veer too much into the weird; it's certainly not Gaga-setting-men-on-fire weird." [...] Margaret Wappler of The Arizona Republic praised the video saying that it had [...] "electrifying color schemes and high-shine lighting, resulting in a fantastical pop mirage between Lady Gaga and Beyonce". She further called it a [...] "kinetic spectacle to behold, with enough guns to make Ted Nugent weep with jealousy and some hot Bettie Page bangs on Beyonce that should prompt plenty of ladies to run to the hairdresser". Wappler finished her review by concluding that [...] "the whole video has a distinct and not unpleasant 90s vibe."

2500|$|... "Diamond Age" [...] is an {{extension}} of labels for archeological time periods that take central technological materials to define an entire era of human history, such as the Stone Age, the Bronze Age or the Iron Age. Technological visionaries such as Eric Drexler and Ralph Merkle, both of whom receive an honorary mention in The Diamond Age, have argued that if nanotechnology develops the ability to manipulate individual atoms at will, it will become possible to simply assemble diamond structures from carbon atoms, materials also known as diamondoids. Merkle states: [...] "In diamond, then, a dense network of strong bonds creates a strong, light, and stiff material. Indeed, just as we named the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Steel Age after the materials that humans could make, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> the new technological epoch we are entering the Diamond Age". In the novel, a near future vision of our world, nanotechnology has developed precisely to this point, which enables the cheap production of diamond structures.|$|E

Balancing the emotional complexity is Chris Manley’s refreshingly unaffected cinematography; the drama of a free kick, {{like that of a}} good movie, is best viewed through a steady lens." [...] Bill Zwecker, of the Chicago Sun-Times, stated, [...] "It's a sweet and uplifting film, and though quite predictable, gives us a family drama that showcases simple truths about overcoming seemingly impossible odds and leaves you with a warm and very satisfying feeling deep down.

2500|$|In 1975, {{the turn}} towards {{building}} a synthesizer of sorts over an organ came to fruition in Moog’s Polymoog. [...] Many patents exist from this keyboard. [...] It incorporated velocity sensitivity for one thing. [...] Each note {{had its own}} circuit board with a VCF/VCA chip {{so that it was}} truly fully polyphonic. [...] Many were disappointed that the filter lacked the facilities of the more flexible moog filter used in other keyboards. [...] And that there were so many connectors and they were not all that reliable. Also in 1975 Crumar of Italy produced the [...] "Multiman" [...] which also was an organ with synthesizer facilities. [...] It had a bass option, a brass with filter controls and simple envelope, a piano and clavi preset, and a couple string tabs with decay control and vibrato control.

2500|$|Gellius {{says that}} in his day humanitas is {{commonly}} used as a synonym for philanthropyor kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human beings. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> [...] "humane" [...] or [...] "polite" [...] learning, or the Greek equivalent Paideia. Yet in seeking to restrict the meaning of humanitas to literary education this way, Gellius was not advocating a retreat from political engagement into some ivory tower, though it might look like that to us. He himself was involved in public affairs. According to legal historian Richard Bauman, Gellius was a judge {{as well as a}} grammarian and was an active participant the great contemporary debate on harsh punishments that accompanied the legal reforms of Antoninus Pius (one these reforms, [...] for example, was that a prisoner was not to be treated as guilty before being tried). [...] "By assigning pride of place to Paideia in his comment on the etymology of humanitas, Gellius implies that the trained mind is best equipped to handle the problems troubling society." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richardson {{is also an}} {{important}} feminist writer, because of the way her work assumes the validity and importance of female experiences as a subject for literature. She records that when she began writing, [...] "attempting to produce a feminine equivalent of the current masculine realism", and after setting aside [...] "a considerable mass of manuscript" [...] finding [...] "a fresh pathway". Her wariness of the conventions of language, her bending of the normal rules of punctuation, sentence length, and so on, are used to create a feminine prose, which Richardson saw as necessary for the expression of female experience. Virginia Woolf in 1923 noted, that Richardson [...] "has invented, or, if she has not invented, developed and applied to her own uses, a sentence which <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> the psychological sentence of the feminine gender." [...] In her 1938 [...] "Foreword" [...] to the Collected Edition of Pilgrimage Richardson responded to criticism of her writing, [...] "for being unpunctuated and therefore unreadable", arguing that [...] "Feminine prose, as Charles Dickens and James Joyce show themselves to be aware, should properly be unpunctuated, moving from point to point without formal obstruction".|$|E
