40|$|Nodules of the {{tropical}} <b>warble-fly</b> (Dermatobia hominis) in Canchim cattle breed ranging from 24 to 36 months of age were counted in males and females, to study its epidemiology in the SÃ£o Carlos region. The nodules of the <b>warble-fly</b> were counted in groups of 15 animals in the left side every 14 days. The counts started in January, 1982 and ended in December, 1983. The heaviest <b>warble-fly</b> infestations were observed in February, September, October and December which represent the frequencies of 14. 5 %, 17. 5 %, 17. 5 % and 9. 7 %, respectively. The lowest <b>warble-fly</b> infestations were observed in July and August with 1. 2 % and 0. 9 % respectively. During the months of January, March, April, May, June and November, the animals showed an intermediary warble fly count being of 5. 8 %, 4. 5 %, 7. 5 %, 7. 4 % and 7. 7 %, respectively. The highest frequencies of <b>warble-fly</b> nodules were observed during the warm and humid period, while the lowest frequencies were found during the cold and dry seasons...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} seroprevalence of Hypoderma spp. and to develop a spatial model describing the risk surface of <b>warble-fly</b> infection in Belgian cattle herds (adjusting for herd size, herd type, local temperature, rainfall, relative air humidity and land-cover). This survey was carried out in 390 selected herds of all types (dairy, mixed and beef) from December 1997 to March 1998, which were included in a national infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and paratuberculosis (Johne's-disease) survey. All animals > 24 months old were blood sampled and an ELISA was used on pooled serum samples (10 animals per pool). The herd seroprevalence was 48. 7 % (95 % confidence interval: 43. 6 - 53. 8); positive herds were mainly in the south of the country and along the North Sea coast. The logistic multiple-regression model of herd-level seropositivity indicated that mixed-type and beef-cattle herds have more than four-fold and two-fold increases in the odds of being Hypoderma-positive, respectively, compared with dairy herds.

25|$|Obligate myiasis {{of various}} forms {{are typical of}} the oestrid genera. Larval Dermatobia torsalo-flies infest the skin and {{underlying}} tissues of cattle causing distress, reduced gain in weight and damage to skins used for leather. Larval Gasterophilus stomach-bots infest the upper gastric tract and stomach of horses and other equids. Larval Hypoderma <b>warble-flies</b> infest the skin and muscles of cattle. Larval Oestrus nasal-bots infest the nasal cavities of sheep and goats. In the case of stomach-bots it is often uncertain how much clinical disease or loss of production small levels of infestation causes the host. With infestations of <b>warble-flies</b> and nasal-bots severe distress to the hosts may be caused and there are production losses from reduction of value of cattle hides, and reduced grazing time by sheep. Harm to cattle may be caused through panic (known as gadding) at {{the approach of the}} flies if that leads to traumatic injury. There are no organisms of known importance transmitted by oestrid flies.|$|R
25|$|Many {{species of}} flies of the two-winged type, Order Diptera, such as mosquitoes, horse-flies, blow-flies and <b>warble-flies</b> cause direct {{parasitic}} disease to domestic animals, and transmit organisms that cause diseases. These infestations and infections cause distress to companion animals, and in livestock industry the financial costs of these diseases are high. These problems occur wherever domestic animals are reared. This article {{provides an overview}} of parasitic flies from a veterinary perspective, with emphasis on the disease causing relationships between these flies and their host animals. The article is organized following the taxonomic hierarchy of these flies in the Phylum Arthropoda, Order Insecta. Families and genera of dipteran flies are emphasized rather than many individual species. Disease caused by the feeding activity of the flies is described here under Parasitic disease. Disease caused by small pathogenic organisms that pass from the flies to domestic animals is described here under Transmitted organisms; prominent examples are provided from the many species.|$|R
