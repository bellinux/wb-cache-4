"What chief {{marketing}} {{officers are}} always looking for is touch points with consumers, and this is just a big, big, big touch point that's not being served," [...] says Mintel Research Director David Lockwood.

Gemma Whelan, who plays Yara, talked about filming the scene: [...] "Oh my goodness – I was so excited when I saw that I had a scene with those two [...]" [...] About the dynamic between the two women, Whelan said: [...] "It's clear as the scene plays out that Yara quite likes Dany. We share a lot of little looks and there's some playful language in how <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> one another – Dany asks if the Iron Islands ever had a queen, and Yara says, 'No more than Westeros.' They recognize the girl-power undertow between the two of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Masuda {{considers}} the starter Pokémon {{to be among}} the most important in the franchise; Yoshida goes further and calls them [...] "the face of that generation" [...] and says that [...] "they're the ones that should be on the packaging". The three starter Pokémon of each generation are Grass-, Water-, and Fire-types, a trio that Masuda considers to be the easiest to understand for new players. In an interview with GamesRadar in 2009, Masuda stated that simple Pokémon take around six months to design and develop, whereas Pokémon that play a more important part in the games (such as starter Pokémon) may take over a year. Masuda added, [...] "We also want the designer to have as much freedom as possible, we don't want to narrow down their imagination by saying 'We want this kind of Pokemon.' When <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the designer we always stress that they shouldn't think of Pokemon necessarily, but should instead just be as creative as they can." [...] After the Pokémon is designed it is sent to the [...] "Battle Producer", who decides which moves and stats the Pokémon should have.|$|E

We were in a town four-to-five hours away by bus from the cable car; about 80 kilometers. We chose the people, we gave them a ride, <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> them.

2500|$|In mid-February, the Grand Mufti of Egypt, Ali Gomaa, {{responded to}} the calls for Kashgari's {{execution}} stating, [...] "We don't kill our sons, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them." [...] He listed [...] "three points before [...] any judgments": verifying what Kashgari [...] "really said", deciding if Kashgari's statements were [...] "a form of misconduct, an expression of doubt, or an actual insult", and [...] "if one repents it should be accepted". On February 12, the Association of British Muslims called for King Abdullah to drop any charges laid against Kashgari, stating [...] "Thought crime is no crime at all...Any state enforced penalty for perceived blasphemy runs contrary to the true spirit of Islam, and of our Prophet, peace be upon him, who was compassionate even to those who scorned him...No one should be legally prosecuted, imprisoned or detained for simply expressing themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Atkinson's second Hindu-sounding pseudonym, Swami Bhakta Vishita, {{billed as}} [...] "The Hindoo Master" [...] was not authentically Hindu, {{nor did he}} write {{on the topic of}} Hinduism. His best-known titles, which have {{remained}} in print for many years after entering the public domain, were [...] "The Development of Seership: The Science of Knowing the Future; Hindoo and Oriental Methods" [...] (1915), [...] "Genuine Mediumship, or Invisible Powers", and [...] "Can <b>We</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> Spirit Friends?" [...] Atkinson produced more than two dozen Swami Bhakta Vishita books, plus a half-dozen saddle-stitched paper pamphlets under the Vishita name. All of them dealt with clairvoyance, mediumship, and the afterlife. Like Ramacharaka, Vishita was listed as a regular contributor to Atkinson's Advanced Thought magazine, but his books were published by the Advanced Thought Publishing Company, not by the Yogi Publication Society, which handled the Ramacharaka titles.|$|E

2500|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of polling data {{of support for}} same-sex marriage in Australia and membership demographics of the SDA found that the socially conservative positions of the SDA leadership - particularly de Bruyn - {{are likely to be}} at odds with the rank-and-file of the union. The lobby group Australian Marriage Equality challenged the SDA to survey its membership before contributing further to the same-sex marriage debate in Australia. In response to a 2014 poll with 72 percent support for same-sex marriage, de Bruyn dismissed the figures but refused to poll his members on the issue. He says he [...] "knows they agree with him absolutely. When <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> our members about out these things they agree with us". Some SDA-aligned Labor MPs do not agree with the SDA's stance on same-sex marriage and in fact support same-sex marriage in defiance of the SDA, some South Australian examples being Kate Ellis, Amanda Rishworth and Nick Champion.|$|E

30|$|With {{the help}} of the PhysTEC leadership, we reached out to at least two key {{informants}} (including the champion in the physics department) at each institution, conducting a total of eleven interviews. The second person <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> was often a champion in education (at VTech, CSULB, UMN, and BU). At Towson, <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> two science educators in the physics department. We had not originally planned to interview TIRs because we expected them to execute and implement the vision developed by champions, faculty members, and administrators. However, in the case of two sites (BU and VTech), the TIRs ended up staying more than the year recommended by PhysTEC and took a leadership role in ensuring the continued existence of their position as well as supporting other PhysTEC efforts. In these cases, when the TIR became an active advocate and creator of change, we felt their perspectives were relevant to our research questions.|$|R

6000|$|But, Lord, Sir, said Will Atkins to me {{how could}} we teach them religion, who know nothing of it ourselves? How can <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> our wives of God, Jesus Christ, heaven, and hell? Why they would only laugh at us, who never yet have practiced religion, but on the {{contrary}} all manner of wickedness. Will Atkins, said I, cannot you tell your wife {{she is in the}} wrong, and that her gods are idols, which can neither speak nor understand; but that our God, who has made, can destroy all things; that he rewards the good and punishes the wicked; and at last will bring us to judgment; cannot you tell her these things? That's true, said Atkins, but then she'll tell me it is utterly false, since I am not punished and sent to the devil, who hath been such a wicked creature. These words I interpreted to the priest. [...] "Oh!" [...] said he, [...] "tell him, his repentance will make him a very good minister to his spouse, and qualify him to preach on the mercy and long suffering of a merciful Being, who desires not the death of a sinner, and even defers damnation to the last judgment; this will lead him to the doctrine of the resurrection and will make him an excellent preacher to his wife." [...] I repeated this to Atkins, who being more than ordinary affected with it, replied, I know all this, Sir, and a great deal more; but how can I have the impudence to talk thus to my wife, given my conscience witnesses against me? Alas! said he (with tears in his eye, and giving a great sigh) as for repenting, that is for ever past me. Past you! Atkins, said I, what do you mean? You know well enough, said he, what I mean, I mean it is too late.|$|E
