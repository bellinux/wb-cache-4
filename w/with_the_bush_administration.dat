25|$|In {{the first}} ten months of 2001, the Abramoff {{lobbying}} team logged almost 200 contacts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration.</b> He may have used these senior level contacts to assist in his lobbying for Indian tribes concerning tribal gaming.

From 2000 to 2003, six Indian tribes paid Abramoff over $80 million in lobbying fees.|$|E

25|$|Clarke and his {{communications}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> regarding bin Laden {{and associated}} terrorist plots targeting the United States were mentioned frequently in Condoleezza Rice's public interview by the 9/11 investigatory commission on April 8, 2004.

He asked Cheney why she had waited two years after the 2004 election to speak publicly about gay marriage and rights, and asked whether she had any input <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> regarding gay issues. Cheney responded that she did not, and that it had not been her job to do so.|$|E
500|$|Following Republican {{efforts to}} pass the Medicare Act of 2003, Bush signed the bill, which {{included}} major changes to the Medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits. The retired persons lobby group AARP worked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly [...] "better choices and {{more control over their}} health care".|$|E
500|$|Sherwood Boehlert, the Republican {{chair of}} the House Committee on Science during most of Marburger's tenure, said that [...] "the {{challenge}} he faced was serving a president who didn't really want much scientific advice, and who let politics dictate {{the direction of his}} science policy... and he was in the unenviable position of being someone who had earned the respect of his scientific colleagues while having to be identified with policies that were not science-based." [...] On the other hand, Robert P. Crease, a colleague of Marburger at Stony Brook University, characterized him as someone who [...] " [...] to the White House as a scientist, not an advocate. He refused to weigh in on high-profile, politically controversial issues, but instead set about fixing broken connections in the unwieldy machinery by which the government approves and funds scientific projects.... Some bitterly criticized him for collaborating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration.</b> But he left the office running better than when he entered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days before}} the HELP {{confirmation}} hearing, former Surgeon General Richard Carmona went public <b>with</b> claims that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> censored his speeches and buried his scientific reports.

I would resign." ...|$|R
50|$|Historian Philip Jenkins {{explored}} how heated {{topics such}} as the Franklin allegations, {{whether or not they}} are worthy of attention or credible on their own merits, are seized by political opportunists for their own purposes. He also described how cases such as the Franklin allegations can acquire credibility, even if they lack any credibility inherently, when reported in various media in a crediblevoice. Numerous conspiracy theories evolved and persist, claiming that the alleged abuse was part of a widespread series of crimes including devil worship, cannibalism, drug trafficking, CIA arms dealing and links <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration.</b>|$|R
50|$|Secretary of State Colin Powell is {{depicted}} as being increasingly at odds <b>with</b> members of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration,</b> and even goes {{as far as to}} reject some of the evidence put forward on weapons of mass destruction. However, {{by the end of the}} book, Powell ultimately endorses the invasion, a decision which is not entirely explained, other than to suggest Powell may have lined up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> President out of a sense of duty.|$|R
2500|$|On March 9, 2008, Rove {{appeared}} at the University of Iowa as a paid speaker to a crowd of approximately 1,000.

2500|$|Supporting Clarke's {{claim that}} {{in the months leading}} up to 9/11 what should have been {{considered}} an alarming amount of intelligence forewarning of attacks was delivered to the president, Former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, the sole member of the 9/11 Commission permitted (under an agreement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration)</b> to read the President's Daily Brief, reported in the hearings that information in the documents [...] "would set your hair on fire"; though barred by secrecy rules from disclosing much of the details contained in the documents, she reported that they contained [...] "an extraordinary spike" [...] in intelligence warnings of al-Qaida attacks that had [...] "plateaued at a spike level for months" [...] before 9/11.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2000, President Clinton {{wanted to}} visit Pyongyang. However, the {{intended}} visit never happened, due to the controversy surrounding {{the results of the}} 2000 U.S. Presidential Election. Around April or May 2001, Kim Dae-jung was expecting to welcome Kim Jong-il to Seoul. Returning from his meeting in Washington with newly elected President Bush, Kim Dae-jung described his meeting as embarrassing while privately cursing President Bush and his hardliner approach. This meeting negated any chance of a North Korean visit to South Korea. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> labeling North Korea as being part of the [...] "axis of evil", North Korea renounced the nonproliferation treaty, kicked out UN inspectors, and restarted its nuclear program. In early 2005, the North Korean government confirmed that the country had successfully become a nuclear armed state.|$|E
50|$|The CDA often criticised free-market {{economics}} and Americanisation in the United Kingdom, {{both of which}} it perceived to be after-effects of Thatcherism. That {{may be seen as}} distinguishing it from Iain Duncan Smith's Conservative Party leadership, which CDA members often criticised as neoconservative. The CDA was also fervently opposed to the European Union and to close links <b>with</b> <b>the</b> George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|R

5000|$|An {{article in}} the NYT, in August 2007, on a lawsuit {{involving}} Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication concludes that {{it would seem that}} <b>the</b> unprecedented frequency <b>with</b> which <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> invoked and invokes this principle has made judges more skeptical and willing to ask the government to validate its claims. In the words of Tom Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington UniversityWhat seems clear is that until a year or two ago, the judges rarely even questioned it when the government raised the 'state secrets' claim. It was a neutron bomb [...] - [...] no plaintiffs left standing. But we're now seeing that judges are starting to actually look behind the government's secrecy claims and see what's really there.|$|R
