5|$|In Time Trials, {{the player}} can freely race {{on a course}} to perform the best times, which are {{recorded}} in the game's data. In the Stunt Mode, the player must earn points by executing stunts and passing through rings. The points depend upon how many rings the player passes through <b>without</b> <b>missing,</b> {{as well as the}} class of stunt that has been performed. The multiplayer mode uses a horizontal split-screen and allows two players to compete against each other on a chosen course. Only the courses that have been unlocked in the Championship mode can be played in the Time Trials, Stunt, and multiplayer modes. The game offers four personalized racers for players to select from, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak can be used to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.|$|E

25|$|After {{dropping}} the float, the Cuban squadron chief ordered {{the commander of}} CS-13, Ensign Mario Ramirez Delgado, to explore the area pointed out by the plane. Once the order was received, the CS-13 sailed speedily toward the area, where the patrol boat's sonar received a clear and precise contact at 900 yards. The seaman operating the sonar, Norberto Collado Abreu, was glued to the equipment, <b>without</b> <b>missing</b> a sound. Then the attack started: three depth charges set to explode at 100, 150, and 250 feet, were dropped from the stern, {{in accordance with the}} calculated speed of the submarine.|$|E
25|$|In {{people with}} a low or {{moderate}} suspicion of PE, a normal D-dimer level (shown in a blood test) is enough to exclude the possibility of thrombotic PE, with a three-month risk of thromboembolic events being 0.14%. D-dimer is highly sensitive but not specific (specificity around 50%). In other words, a positive D-dimer is not synonymous with PE, but a negative D-dimer is, with a good degree of certainty, an indication of absence of a PE. The typical cut off is 500nbsp&μg/L, although this varies based on the assay. However, in those {{over the age of}} 50, changing the cut-off value to the person's age multiplied by 10nbsp&μg/L (accounting for assay which has been used) is recommended as it decreases the number of falsely positive tests <b>without</b> <b>missing</b> any additional cases of PE.|$|E

25|$|When {{faced with}} refusals of basing and {{overflight}} rights from continental European countries during Operation El Dorado Canyon, the U.S. {{was forced to}} use the UK-based F-111s in the 1986 air-strikes against Libya. The KC-10s and KC-135s allowed 29 F-111s, along with other Air Force and Navy aircraft, to reach their targets. The KC-10 again {{played a key role}} during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1991; KC-10s facilitated the deployment of tactical, strategic, and transport aircraft to Saudi Arabia. In the early stages of Operation Desert Shield, aerial refueling was key to the rapid airlift of materiel and forces. In addition to refueling airlift aircraft, the KC-10, along with the smaller KC-135, moved thousands of tons of cargo and thousands of troops in support of the massive buildup. The KC-10 and the KC-135 conducted about 51,700 separate refueling operations and delivered 125 million gallons (475 million liters) of fuel <b>without</b> <b>missing</b> a single scheduled rendezvous.|$|E
25|$|In 1880, S.D. Castle and Henry House became {{interested}} in the picking of furs. Buffalo hides were getting scarce, and Castle wanted to use muskrat or beaver, but he found the pelts had to be picked of the outer long hair, a tedious job for an unskilled hand. After a few months, House had a small machine working that would pick large or small pelts <b>without</b> <b>missing</b> a hair. The machine-picked skins were shown to furriers in New York. A few days later, a Mr. Frasure of Wall Street, New York, called on House at Bridgeport, and the two reached an agreement for House to develop a machine that would pick a bull pelt six feet long and three feet wide, while being kept moist and warm. This patent, also the first of its kind, for treating pelts, was issued on October 19, 1882 just one month and five days after the application was made.|$|E

500|$|In Tampa, June {{joined a}} defense that had been among the top 10 in the league for a decade until the 2006 Buccaneers faltered with a 412 record. In 2006, they fell from 1st to 17th in team defense. When June arrived it was fairly clear that Derrick Brooks would not be {{changing}} from his weakside linebacker position and that June would be moving to strongside linebacker. [...] When he became a Buccaneer, he stood out for his dedication and enthusiasm. [...] For example, when the Colts had their Super Bowl ring ceremony, June flew to Indianapolis and back <b>without</b> <b>missing</b> any Buccaneers practice time. As strongside linebacker he beat out Ryan Nece as the 2007 Buccaneers starter, although he was considered the heir apparent to 13-year veteran and 10-time Pro Bowler Brooks at the weakside position. June again wore the #59 as a Buccaneer. Because of his weakside linebacker and safety experience, June was expected {{to remain in the}} game during passing situations unlike most strongside linebackers. [...] June also expected defenses to run at him because at , [...] he was small for an NFL strongside linebacker and one of the smallest linebackers in the NFL.|$|E
