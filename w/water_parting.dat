The boat lay {{plunging}} on the heave that was streaked with flecks of froth, and there was a long trail of sliding haze not far away from them. From out of it came the sound of <b>water</b> <b>parting</b> under iron bows. Then two tall spars that swung a little rose out of the vapor, and next moment a blur of shadowy hull grew into visibility. It lengthened rapidly, a smear of smoke streamed across the sea, but there was no blink of light beneath it, and with the froth piled up at her bows the vessel came down upon them, portentous in her blackness and silence.|$|E
6000|$|On February 24, 1854, Dr. Livingstone, {{after leaving}} {{what he calls}} the [...] "Dilolo Lake," [...] found on an almost level plain, some 4,000 to 5,000 feet high and then flooded after rains, a great <b>water</b> <b>parting</b> between the eastern and the western {{continental}} shores. I have carefully considered the strictures upon this subject by the author of [...] "Dr. Livingstone's Errors" [...] (p. 101), and {{have come to the conclusion}} that the explorer was too experienced to make the mistakes attributed to him by the cabinet geographer. The translation [...] "despair" [...] for [...] "bitterness" [...] (of the fish?) and the reference to Noah's Deluge may be little touches ad captandum; but the Kibundo or Angolan tongue certainly has a dental though it lacks a cerebral d.|$|E
6000|$|The article proves hypsometrically {{that the}} Lualaba, {{in which the}} {{explorer}} found the head waters of the Egyptian river, cannot feed the Tanganyika nor the Lake Nzige (N'zíghe, Mwutan, Chowambe, or Albert Nyanza Lake), nor even the Bahr el Ghazal, as was once suspected. From the latter, indeed, it is barred by the <b>water</b> <b>parting</b> of the Welle, the [...] "Babura" [...] of Jules Poncet (1860), {{in the land of}} the Monbuttú; whose system the later explorer, Dr. Schweinfurth, is disposed to connect with the Shari. Hydrometrically considered, the Lualaba, which at Nyangwe, the most northerly point explored by Dr. Livingstone (1870), rolls a flood of 124,000 cubic feet per second in the dry season, cannot be connected either with the Welle (5,100 cubic feet), nor with the Bahr el Ghazal (3,042 to 6,500 cubic feet), nor with the Nile below the mouth of the Bahr el Ghazal (11,330); nor with the Shari (67,500); nor with the shallow Ogobe, through its main forks the Rembo Okanda and the Rembo Nguye.|$|E

Some shouted {{to those who were}} nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the {{officers}} to shoot him dead. Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting through the crowd as if he were <b>parting</b> <b>water,</b> cried, beneath the window, in a voice that rose above all others, 'Twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Gravestones. Jacobovici {{suggests}} {{that three of}} the stones marking the wealthy tombs of Grave Circle A in Mycenae depict the parting of the Sea of Reeds. The stones, Jacobovici claims, show a man on a chariot in pursuit of a man on foot carrying a long, straight object. Jacobovici proposes that the man on the chariot is Ahmose I, the man on foot is Moses, and the long, straight object is the staff of Aaron. Above and below the scene are rows of swirls which, in Jacobovici's interpretation, represent the <b>parting</b> <b>waters.</b> He admits, however, that archaeologists have typically interpreted the scene as a chariot race, with the long, straight object being a spear or sword.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the small}} towns {{developed}} by the British during the 'hey days' of the empire, reached by a branch road from the Kalka-Shimla road, has the beautiful hill-station of Kasauli where the Pasteur Institute produces the antirabies vaccine against mad dog-bite and, at the same time, treats victims who have fallen prey to the deadly disease, Hydrophobia. If {{the victim of a}} dog-bite is not treated in time - hydrophobia, or fear of water occurs, resulting in his inability to swallow water. For the dog set, Louis Pasteur performed invaluable service when he perfected his vaccine in the late 19th century. The Central Research institute in Kasauli set up in 1900, is the oldest in India, taking care of police and army dogs as well as their masters. Nearby another institute produces other vaccines: the Central Research Institute works on immunity from Typhoid, smallpox has been eradicated, chlorea and snake-bite. This region has also been a witness to Gurkha expansion at now to ruins of old Gurkha Fort at Subathu. At 3647 mt, the Choordhar or Choor Chandni peak, looms over the sylvan surroundings, and just across the ranges, is Shimla. The upper and lower Malls are the two principal roads that run along the length of Kasauli, a thick cover of pine, oak, rhododendron, where horse chestnut trees embrace the entire area. Traffic is restricted on these roads, which is the reason why Kasauli is the quietest hill station in India. The resort's colonial aura is underlined by gabled houses with picturesque facades, cobbled alleys and rows of neat orchards and elegant gardens. The solan Hills stand on a <b>water</b> - <b>parting</b> between the Sutlej and the Giri, a tributary of the Yamuna. South of solan is the Panchmunda ridge which is crossed by a railway through a tunnel (the longest in the Kalka - Shimla run) at Barog, where a series of fissure to springs occur at its flank. the first ridge above Kalka rises abruptly to pineclad Kasauli at a height of 1927 meters and is joined by a 12 km bridle path. The distance by road, however, from Kalka is 36.5 km.|$|R

50|$|A {{drainage}} divide, water divide, divide, ridgeline, watershed, <b>water</b> <b>parting,</b> is {{the line}} that separates neighbouring drainage basins. In hilly country, the divide lies along topographical ridges, and {{may be in the}} form of a single range of hills or mountains, known as a dividing range. In flat country—especially where the ground is marshy—the divide may be harder to discern.|$|E

The village lies on the <b>water</b> <b>parting</b> between the Gélise and the Izaute and occupies the emplacement of an ancient castle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Azazael and Samiasa ... rise {{into the}} air with the two sisters.... The {{appearance}} of the land strangled by the ocean will serve by way of scenery and decorations. The affectionate tenderness of Adah for those from whom she is parted, and for ever, and her fears contrasting with the loftier spirit of Aholibamah triumphing in the hopes of a new and greater destiny will make the dialogue. They, in the meantime, continue their aërial voyage, everywhere denied admittance in those floating islands over the sea of space, and driven back by guardian-spirits of the different planets, till they are at length forced to alight on the only peak of the earth uncovered by <b>water.</b> Here a <b>parting</b> takes place between the lovers.... The fallen angels are suddenly called, and condemned, their destination and punishment unknown. The sisters cling to the rock, the waters mounting higher and higher. Now enter Ark. The scene draws up, and discovers Japhet endeavouring to persuade the Patriarch, with very strong arguments of love and pity, to receive the sisters, or at least Adah, on board. Adah joins in his entreaties, and endeavours to cling to the sides of the vessel. The proud and haughty Aholibamah scorns to pray either to God or man, and anticipates the grave by plunging into the waters. Noah is still inexorable. [Adah] is momentarily in danger of perishing before the eyes of the Arkites. Japhet is in despair. The last wave sweeps her from the rock, and her lifeless corpse floats past in all its beauty, whilst a sea-bird screams over it, and seems to be the spirit of her angel lord. I once thought of conveying the lovers to the moon or one of the planets; but it is not easy for the imagination to make any unknown world more beautiful than this; besides, I did not think they would approve of the moon as a residence. I remember what Fontenelle said of its having no atmosphere, and the dark spots having caverns where the inhabitants reside. There was another objection: all the human interest would have been destroyed, which I have even endeavoured to give my angels."] ...|$|R
5000|$|Sheep Creek raises {{from the}} Sheep Mountain at an {{elevation}} of 4238 ft. Flowing from the <b>water</b> <b>parting</b> next to Grindstone Creek, {{the course of the}} main valley runs from southeast to northwest. About [...] from its head, the stream makes a broad turn and in the lower , flows toward the southwest. The total length of the river valley is about [...] The upper and lower thirds of its course have steep grades, but the middle course is over a gravel flat sloping from 700 - 550 ft elevation. Below the gravel flat, the tributary slopes are very narrow and there are no side gulches. Practically all of the drainage comes into the upper basin, where the walls of the valley are steep, though up to {{an elevation of}} about 1800 ft, they are covered with alder brush and grass, and are generally sodded nearly to the summit of the surrounding ridges. The latter are nowhere more than [...] distant from the stream, though they rise to elevations of from 2500 - 3800 ft. The generally smooth, but somewhat corrugated character of the slopes points to the molding action of ice, and the recency of glaciation is indicated by the shallowness of the rills, which collect the drainage from the mountain sides.|$|E
40|$|Existe gestão democrática dos recursos hídricos na bacia litorânea do Paraná? A atividade de geração hidrelétrica tem influência neste fato? A resposta a estes questionamentos constitui a linha mestra de condução deste trabalho, que possui como período de interesse aquele {{posterior}} à edição da Lei Federal de Recursos Hídricos (Lei Federal n 9433 / 1997) até a presente data. A verificação da implementação (ou não) da gestão democrática e participativa da água {{no local}} estudado foi buscada mediante aprofundamento no local investigado e suas relações sociais, busca de conhecimentos específicos sobre os efeitos da atividade de geração hidrelétrica, análise dos marcos jurídicos balizadores da política de recursos hídricos e uma incursão teórico-conceitual. O objetivo específico do trabalho dirige-se à verificação da existência de gestão participativa da água na bacia hidrográfica do litoral do Paraná e a influência das geradoras hidrelétricas neste contexto, bem como da geração de externalidades econômicas e impactos ambientais negativos ocasionados pela operação destes empreendimentos na região. Para avanço no processo de pesquisa e elaboração da dissertação partiu-se de uma perspectiva ancorada na complexidade das relações entre sociedade e ambiente, estabelecendo-se uma pergunta de partida que foi desdobrada em hipótese, a qual deu origem a variáveis, cuja apuração subsidiou a resposta ao problema proposto. Com relação à base de dados, foram coletados elementos junto ao poder público, agentes do mercado, pesquisadores, sociedade civil e comunidades ribeirinhas, conjugando-se aqueles produzidos num ambiente de conhecimento científico com informações marcadas por impressões do senso comum. O encadeamento do estudo teórico e os dados coletados permitiram o oferecimento de resposta à pergunta inicial, a qual aponta para a não implementação da gestão democrática e participativa dos recursos hídricos na bacia litorânea do Paraná, com influência da atividade de geração hidrelétrica para perpetuação desta condição. Is there a democratic {{management of the}} water resources at the coastline basin of Paraná? Does the hydroelectric generation activity influence this fact? The answer of these questions constitute the master line in the conduction of this academic work, that has as interest period the one before the Water Resources Federal Law (Federal Law n 9433 / 1997) {{up to the present}} date. The implementation verification (or not) of the democratic management and participative of the water at the studied place was searched through deepen at the researched place and its social relations, search of specific knowledge about the hydroelectric generation activity effects, analyses of the referential juridical limit of the hydroelectric generation activity and a theory conceptual incursion. The specific objective of the work addresses to determinate the existence of water participatory management in the <b>water</b> <b>parting</b> of the Paraná coast, the influence of hydroelectric dams in this context, but also the generation of economic externalities and negative environmental impacts associated with the operation of these developments in the region. The advance in the process of research and preparation of the dissertation came from a perspective rooted in the complexity of the relationships between society and environment, establishing a starting question that was deployed in hypotheses, which gave rise to variables, whose determination supported the answer to the proposed problem. Regarding the database, information was collected with the government, market players, researchers, civil society and coastal communities, combining those produced in an environment of scientific knowledge with information marked by common sense impressions. The link of the theory study and of the collected data will allow the initial question to be answered, which signalizes to the non implementation of the democratic management and participative of the water resources at the coastline basin of Paraná, with influence of the hydroelectric generation activity for the perpetuation of this condition...|$|E
