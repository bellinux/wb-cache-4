Under a such context, to choose a good soil tillage management is an important decision to improve grain yield and quality. The paper presents aspects regarding the influence of several soil tillage methods, fertilizers and three track-by-track passings of tractor prior to seedbed preparation on sunflower yield under dryland conditions. Field experiments were conducted during 1987 - 2004 at The National Agricultural Research and Development Institute from Fundulea (Romania) on a leached chernozem, well drained, formed on loess, with 33 % clay content and 2. 8 % organic matter in arable layer. The wheel pressure induced a soil compaction down to 40 cm depth as shown by an increase of bulk density and a decrease of total and air porosities, below minimum level accepted for a normal crop development. The plant height and leaf area were reduced by compaction, {{as a result of}} worsening of soil conditions for root growth; the root biomass was lower by 16 - 33 % in compacted soil, as compared to non-compacted one. <b>Working</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> only by disking before sowing created unfavourable conditions for root and plant growth, similar with those obtained by soil compaction.

40|$|To {{test whether}} {{flocculation}} {{is a prerequisite}} for granulation and a waterstable structure or whether drying (close contact) is sufficient, homoionic suspensions were prepared from pure sodium, potassium, calcium or magnesium montmorillonite, illite or kaolinite and from the respective soil clays. Forms other than Na were prepared from Na suspensions without drying; the ultimate salt concentration was below flocculation value. Suction-moisture curves were established and reswelling (pF 1 after positive pressure) was studied. Sodium clays except latosol swelled again completely after drying; potassium clays, except pure montmorillonite, swelled again completely up to high suctions; calcium and magnesium clays showed partial reswelling; latosol none, except with Na at high pH; pure illites swelled again but the soil clays behaved like soil montmorillonite. Inversion shaking was used to estimate the stability of granules formed by complete or partial water desorption. The stability of calcium and magnesium clays, and soil clays depended slightly on salt concentration; with Na or K, stability depended strongly on salt concentration, except in potassium illite soil clay; stability of all latosols decreased with salt concentration.

40|$|Aim of study: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{finalize}} a new method of truffle cultivation in order to obtain an earlier, more regular and sizeable production of high quality fruiting bodies. Area of study: The experimentation was carried out in France (country of Dordogne, south-western France) and Italy (country of Marches, eastern central Italy) for more than one decade. Material and methods: For the first time the method is based on scientific data on truffle biology particularly: the dynamic system of mycorrhization by the truffle and by other fungi; the saprophytic capability of the truffle; the ability of its mycelium for decomposing certain minerals and organic materials in the "brules". The basic principle concern the work of the soil and the upkeep of the root system: to work the soil immediately after the plantation of mycorrhizal seedlings, deeply enough, with adapted tools, in order to do not compact the soil, aerate it, favour the production of deep fruiting bodies not exposed to high temperatures, dryness, frost, parasites [...] .; cut accurately the roots in order to regenerate them and consequently to provide food for the truffle mycelium.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the bioavailability of organic solvents following dermal exposures to contaminated soil and water. Breath analysis is being used to obtain real-time measurements of volatile organics in expired air following exposure in rats and humans. Rhesus monkeys will be used as surrogates for humans in benzene exposures. The exhaled breath data is being analyzed using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to determine the dermal bioavailability of organic solvents under realistic exposure conditions. The end product of this research will be a tested framework for the rapid screening of real and potential exposures while simultaneously developing physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to comprehensively evaluate and compare exposures to organics from either contaminated soil or water. This report summarizes work 7 months into a 3 -year project. Method development has produced systems for solvent exposure from soil and water which mimic actual exposure, and for which animals and human volunteers can be safely tested. Soil exposure is generally open to the air (<b>working</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil)</b> while water exposure is generally immersion. For 6 [...] 8 hour test exposure, a patch has been developed where soil is contained against the skin by a non-occlusive membrane, while simultaneously allowing volatilization of test solvent to the environment (activated charcoal). The water counterpart is an occlusive glass culture dish, sealed to skin with silicone adhesive. Shorter term exposure is done by one hand immersion in a bucket containing circulating water or soil, the volunteer instructed to move fingers through the water or soil. Human volunteers and animals breathe fresh air via a new breath-inlet system that allows for continuous real-time analysis of undiluted exhaled air. The air supply system is self-contained and separated from the exposure solvent-laden environment. The system uses a Teledyne 3 DQ Discovery ion trap mass spectrometer (MS/MS) equipped with an atmospheric sampling glow discharge ionization source (ASGDI). The MS/MS system provides an appraisal of individual chemical components in the breath stream in the single-digit parts-per-billion (ppb) detectable range for each of the compounds proposed for study, while maintaining linearity of response over a wide dynamic range. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite its {{quiet and}} broad landscape, Kansas has endured {{a history that}} runs from antebellum violence, through buffalo {{slaughter}} and dust bowl despair, to wartime boom. Perhaps no time in Kansas history has seen more flux than the depression 1930 s and the wartime 1940 s; and doubtless no time has been better documented by able photographers. Thanks to Kansas-born Roy Stryker and the three documentary photography projects he headed during the period (for the Farm Security Administration, the Office of War Information, and Standard Oil of New Jersey), Kansans and the world have a sharper idea of {{what life was like}} in the Sunflower State during that strange time when dust storms and foreclosures began to give way to war production and bond drives. Under Stryker 2 ̆ 7 s guidance nine photographers sampled the people, events, and places of Kansas between 1936 and 1949, and in Bust to Boom the reader is treated to 103 carefully selected and sequenced photographs, complete with original captions and negative numbers. Here are Kansas icons of the era: topsoil-buried fences, a county fair, overalled men <b>working</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> print-dressed women with their home canning, barefoot kids fishing, drovers, soldiers, railroad workers. Here are oil field roughnecks, street scenes, rural landscapes, grain elevators, aerial views of corn and wheat. Of course the photographs are not representative, and the editor and commentator address that fact. Bust to Boom renders a small selection of images from a state of 82, 000 square miles over a span of thirteen years. Readers will find no pictures of universities, of the leisure class, and few of urban places. But the images fulfill their intentions: they give readers-and viewers-some concrete idea of a past existence, some feeling for what life was like in a world that grows more distant with each new netsite or cellphone in our own. Donald Worster 2 ̆ 7 s commentary, though once in a while straying a bit far from the photographs, provides an accurate and valuable context for understanding Kansas in this era. Constance Schulz 2 ̆ 7 s concise text about the photographs 2 ̆ 7 creation could well serve as a primer to viewing the documentary projects of the 1930 s and 40 s. Indeed, their presentation is so engaging that at times one wishes for more information than the useful caption material which each photograph provides: the authors might have exploited their Kansas knowledge to elaborate on what has become of the Santa Fe locomotive shops in Topeka and ditch irrigation in western Kansas. Carefully researched and written, beautifully designed, and well printed, Bust to Boom takes its place among the finest in a growing list of books that have brought to us, state by state, the best work of the FSA and other documentary photography projects...|$|E
