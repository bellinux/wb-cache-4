5|$|H. reaumuri {{differs from}} other desert {{woodlice}} {{in a number}} of respects. It is crepuscular, <b>while</b> <b>other</b> species are nocturnal. Apart from at the highest temperatures, it is also positively phototactic (is attracted to sunlight), <b>while</b> <b>other</b> species are negatively phototactic (move away from bright light). Compared to other woodlice, H. reaumuri walks in an unusual manner, with its body held high off the ground.|$|E

5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are found}} in all adult tetrapods; they vary in their number and position. Mammals {{typically}} have four parathyroid glands, <b>while</b> <b>other</b> types of animals typically have six.

50|$|The term lipid {{comprises}} {{a diverse}} range of molecules {{and to some extent}} is a catchall for relatively water-insoluble or nonpolar compounds of biological origin, including waxes, fatty acids (including essential fatty acids), fatty-acid derived phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids and terpenoids, such as retinoids and steroids. Some lipids are linear aliphatic molecules, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> have ring structures. Some are aromatic, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> are not.

5|$|A. ^ General Motors, {{the owner}} of the Detroit Marriott at the Renaissance Center, {{maintains}} that the building has 73 floors. Hines Interests, the property management firm for the building, gives a floor count of 74, while architect Skidmore, Owings and Merrill gives a floor count of 75. Emporis and other building database sites usually give the floor count as 70, <b>while</b> <b>other</b> sources state 73 stories.

5|$|According to Dallas, {{it rained}} on days that were {{supposed}} to be sunny, <b>while</b> <b>other</b> days of production lacked rain when {{they were supposed to be}} rainy. Goodwin added that the scene of Snow and Charming releasing the birds was freezing because of the heavy rain. Their scene in the cabin took place on the first day of the episode's production. Her near-death scene involved a real cliff, though the height was exaggerated later using CGI and a green screen; a stunt double stood in for some of the shots.|$|E

5|$|After {{taking the}} Family Portrait series of images, which {{included}} Pale Blue Dot, NASA mission managers commanded Voyager 1 to power its cameras down, as the spacecraft {{was not going}} to fly near anything else of significance for the rest of its mission, <b>while</b> <b>other</b> instruments that were still collecting data needed power for the long journey to interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|After the Angolan War of Independence of 1975, the Soviet Union's role in Third World {{politics}} increased dramatically. Some of {{the regions}} were important for national security, <b>while</b> <b>other</b> regions {{were important to}} the expansion of Soviet socialism to other countries. According to an anonymous Soviet writer, the national liberation struggle was the cornerstone of Soviet ideology, and therefore became a cornerstone for Soviet diplomatic activity in the Third World.|$|E
5|$|After the spherical {{aberration}} was corrected during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, the improved imaging {{capabilities of the}} telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields <b>while</b> <b>other</b> instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{and reflect on}} seven recurring critiques {{of the concept of}} ecosystem services and respective counter-arguments. First, the concept is criticized for being anthropocentric <b>while</b> <b>others</b> argue that it goes beyond instrumental values. Second, some argue that the concept promotes an exploitative human-nature relationship, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> state that it re-connects society to ecosystems, emphasizing humanity's dependence on nature. Third, concerns exist that the concept may conflict with biodiversity conservation objectives <b>while</b> <b>others</b> emphasize complementarity. Fourth, the concept is questioned because of its supposed focus on economic valuation, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> argue that ecosystem services science includes many values. Fifth, the concept is criticized for promoting commodification of nature, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> point out that most ecosystem services are not connected to market-based instruments. Sixth, vagueness of definitions and classifications are stated to be a weakness, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> argue that vagueness enhances transdisciplinary collaboration. Seventh, some criticize the normative nature of the concept implying that all outcomes of ecosystem processes are desirable. The normative nature is indeed typical for the concept, but should not be problematic when acknowledged. By disentangling and contrasting different arguments we hope to contribute to a more structured debate between opponents and proponents of the ecosystem services concept...|$|R
5|$|Agent Orange was to {{a lesser}} extent used outside Vietnam. Land in {{neighbouring}} Laos and Cambodia was also sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War because forests on the border with Vietnam were used by the Vietcong. Some countries, such as Canada, saw testing, <b>while</b> <b>other</b> countries, such as Brazil, used the herbicide to clear out sections of land for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|All NHLs {{are also}} {{included}} on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), a list of historic properties that the National Park Service deems to be worthy of preservation. The NHLs in Michigan comprise approximately 2% of the 1,757 properties and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan as of January 2012. The primary difference between a NHL and a NRHP listing is that the NHLs are determined to have national significance, <b>while</b> <b>other</b> NRHP properties are deemed significant at the local or state level.|$|E
5|$|All {{specimens}} of Ocepeia {{come from the}} Ouled Abdoun Basin of Morocco, a phosphate basin. Research on Ocepeia {{has been carried out}} by French and Moroccan researchers led by Dr. Emmanuel Gheerbrant of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. Ocepeia fossils have been recovered from the Grand Daoui, Meraa El Arech, and Sidi Chennane quarries, with the latter bearing the most complete specimens. Some of the original material was collected on-site as early as 1997, <b>while</b> <b>other</b> material was obtained from fossil dealers.|$|E

5|$|Amongst {{local media}} outlets, only Apple Daily and Ming Pao ran {{coverage}} on their front pages initially, <b>while</b> <b>other</b> local newspapers carried only brief pieces about a missing person. Television viewers remarked that TVB {{did not run}} the story during its prime time news programmes {{for the first few}} days after news of the Lee Bo disappearance broke. Lee Bo's disappearance spurred renewed interest about Lam Wing-kee, and his family received a police visit the same day after chief executive CY Leung spoke publicly on the case.|$|E
5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy for a few hours, {{then go back to}} secure positions to sleep, <b>while</b> <b>other</b> rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E
