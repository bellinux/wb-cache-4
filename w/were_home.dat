5|$|The Roman army {{succeeded in}} conquering many territories {{covering}} the entire Mediterranean region and coastal regions in southwestern Europe and north Africa. These territories <b>were</b> <b>home</b> to many different cultural groups, both urban populations and rural populations. Generally speaking, the eastern Mediterranean provinces were more urbanised than the western, having previously been united under the Macedonian Empire and Hellenised by {{the influence of}} Greek culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{burial of}} algae and {{bacteria}} below the mud {{of the sea}} floor during this time resulted {{in the formation of}} North Sea oil and natural gas, much of it trapped in overlying sandstone by deposits formed as the seas fell to form the swamps and salty lakes and lagoons that <b>were</b> <b>home</b> to dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|In Oosterbeek, the {{situation}} was becoming more desperate. Hackett {{was wounded in the}} morning and had to give up the eastern command. The RAF attempted some close support around the perimeter which just held, but shelling and sniping increased casualties by the hour. The aid stations <b>were</b> <b>home</b> to some 2,000 men, both British and German as well as Dutch civilian casualties. Because many of them were actually in the front line in homes taken over earlier in the battle, the odd situation was created where casualties were evacuated forward rather than rearwards. Without evacuation, the wounded were often injured again and some posts changed hands between the British and Germans several times as the perimeter was fought over.|$|E

Song Chinese trade ships traveled to ports in Japan, Champa in southern Vietnam, Srivijaya in Maritime Southeast Asia, Bengal and South India, and the coasts of East Africa.|$|E
5|$|Nevin {{had only}} two hits in his last 32 at-bats with the Rangers, though both of them <b>were</b> <b>home</b> runs. The Chicago Cubs sought a {{slugging}} first baseman to replace the injured Derrek Lee, and the Rangers traded Nevin to Chicago on May 31, 2006. The Rangers received second baseman and outfielder Jerry Hairston, Jr. in return. The Rangers also agreed to pay {{the difference in the}} two players' salaries. On August 31, the deadline for trades of players who had cleared waivers, the Cubs traded Nevin to the Twins for cash and a player to be named later. To make room for Nevin, Twins' outfielder Shannon Stewart was placed on the 60-day disabled list.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota is {{relatively}} notable for {{its lack of}} large urban centers. Sioux Falls, the largest city in the state, only ranks as the 152nd largest in the country, and the state's third-largest city, Aberdeen, {{has a population of}} less than 25,000. However, because the population in many rural areas has decreased over the last 50 years, and many cities in the state have grown at a rapid pace; the population has become more concentrated and less rural than it once was. According to 2007 census estimates, the three most populous counties in the state, Minnehaha, Pennington, and Lincoln, <b>were</b> <b>home</b> to 38.8% of South Dakotans, while in 1910, those counties held only 9.3% of the population.|$|E

At least seven bullets hit the second floor. Neither the president nor First Lady Michelle Obama <b>were</b> <b>home</b> at the time, although their youngest daughter, Sasha, and the first lady's mother, Marian Shields Robinson, were. No one was injured. It took four days for the Secret Service to realize that bullets had struck the White House. Michelle Obama learned of the shooting from an usher, then summoned Mark J. Sullivan, director of the Secret Service, {{to find out why}} the first family had not been informed.|$|E
5|$|The Wintu {{people are}} the first {{recorded}} indigenous group in the Trinity River area. Their traditional lands included much of the upper (eastern) Trinity River in the present day area of Shasta-Trinity National Forest. There were nine major groups of Wintu spread across the Trinity, Upper Sacramento, and McCloud River valleys as well as parts of the South Fork Trinity River and its tributary Hayfork Creek. The Trinity River Wintu were known as nomsu's ("those being west"), and the Hayfork Wintu as norelmaq ("south-uphill people"). Many Wintu villages were located along the Trinity River, and <b>were</b> <b>home</b> to up to 150 people. Each village operated as an independent unit led by a chief, although the villagers interacted frequently through trade with each other as well as neighboring tribes, such as the Nomlaki, Achomawi and Shasta.|$|E
5|$|The virgin forests cooled {{the land}} and streams, and centuries of {{accumulated}} organic matter in the forest soil caused slow percolation of rainfall into the creeks and runs so that they flowed more evenly year-round. Pine Creek and its tributaries <b>were</b> <b>home</b> to large numbers of fish, including trout, but dams downstream on the Susquehanna River have eliminated the shad and eels once found here by blocking their migrations. Habitat for land animals was destroyed by the clearcutting of forests, {{but there was also}} a great deal of hunting, with bounties paid for large predators.|$|E

5|$|As Harvey's {{interests}} {{shifted to}} the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended {{and the number of}} visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) <b>were</b> <b>home</b> to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.|$|E
5|$|By 1933, the Nazi Party was {{the largest}} elected party in the German Reichstag and led to Hitler's {{appointment}} as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. He aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter {{what he saw as}} the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I and the annexation of territories that <b>were</b> <b>home</b> to millions of ethnic Germans which gave him significant popular support.|$|E

5|$|The seven {{islands that}} came to {{constitute}} Mumbai <b>were</b> <b>home</b> to communities of fishing colonies of the Koli people. For centuries, the islands were {{under the control of}} successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.|$|E
