50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{haemophilia}}: haemophilia A, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> due to not enough clotting factor VIII, and haemophilia B, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> due to not enough clotting factor IX. They are typically inherited from one's parents through an X chromosome with a nonfunctional gene. Rarely a new mutation may occur during early development or haemophilia may develop later in life due to antibodies forming against a clotting factor. Other types include haemophilia C, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> due to not enough factor XI, and parahaemophilia, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> due to not enough factor V. Acquired haemophilia is associated with cancers, autoimmune disorders, and pregnancy. Diagnosis is by testing the blood {{for its ability to}} clot and its levels of clotting factors.|$|R

40|$|The {{administration}} of p-chlorophenylalanine to mice prevents {{the rise in}} brain 5 -hydroxytryptamine concentration associated with ethanol withdrawal but {{does not affect the}} increase in brain catecholamines <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> at the same time.
