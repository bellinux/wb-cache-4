5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} {{required}} in PSPs {{that have not}} responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a <b>water</b> <b>seal,</b> or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it {{for a period of}} time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.|$|E

25|$|The Nivkh had {{a diverse}} diet being semi-sedentary before colonization. Fish {{was the main}} source of food for the Nivkh, {{including}} pink, Pacific, and chum salmon as well as trout, Red Eye, burbot and pike found in rivers and streams. Salt water fishing provided saffron cod, flatfish, and marine goby caught in the littoral coasts of the Strait of Tartary, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean, though over fishing by Russian and Japanese trawlers have depleted many of these fish stocks. Additionally, industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals in the Amur River have devastated fish stocks and damaged the soil of the estuaries. A traditional preservation process called Yukola, involving slicing the fish in a particular way and drying the strips by hanging them in the frigid air, without salt, was used before foreign influences. The preservation process created a lot of dried fish waste, unpalatable for human consumption but utilized for dog food. Pulverizing dried fish and mixing it with fish skins, <b>water,</b> <b>seal</b> fat, and berries until the mixture had a sour cream consistency is a favorite Nivkh dish called mos. Nivkhs would hunt seal (Larha, Reinged, Reibbon, Sea-lions), duck, sable, and otters. They would gather various berries, wild leeks, lilybulbs, and nuts. Contacts with the Chinese, Manchu, and Japanese from the 12th century on introduced new foods incorporated in the Nivkhs diet such as salt, sugar, rice, millet, legumes and tea. Russian 19th century colonisation introduced flour, bread, potatoes, vodka, tobacco, butter, canned vegetables and fruits, and other meats.|$|E

Construction of the channel, together with improvements to the Kings Sedgemoor Drain and the rebuilding of the clyce at Dunball, to create a fresh <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> which prevents salt water entering the drain from the river, cost £1.4million. The scheme has resulted in less flooding on Aller Moor.|$|E
40|$|Metam sodium is {{the most}} widely used soil {{fumigant}} in the United States. The primary breakdown product of metam sodium in soil is methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), an active pesticidal agent with a high toxicity and a great potential for volatilization. Reducing atmospheric emissions of MITC is therefore critical to maintain air quality. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the rate and efficiency of conversion of metam sodium to MITC in soil and to investigate the potential of using surface <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> to reduce MITC emissions. The conversion of metam sodium to MITC was a rapid abiotic decomposition process. At typical field application rates, the conversion efficiency depended on the initial content of metam sodium in soil, but was independent of soil moisture, soil type, and soil atmospheric conditions. A soil column system was used to measure the emission and distribution of MITC after subsurface and surface application of metam sodium. Volatilization flux and cumulative emission loss of MITC was substantially reduced with surface <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> compared to uncovered soil columns after subsurface application of metam sodium. When metam sodium was surface applied in simulated chemigation, surface <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> was ineffective, suggesting the need for additional emissions reduction practices when metam sodium is broadcast. Overall, the results of the column experiment indicate that surface <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> with subsurface application of metam sodium may be an effective and economical strategy to reduce MITC emissions while maintaining pest control efficacy. r 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

2500|$|Pit latrines are {{sometimes}} {{also referred to}} as [...] "dry toilets" [...] but this is not recommended because a [...] "dry toilet" [...] is an overarching term used for several types of toilets and strictly speaking only refers to the user interface. Depending on the region, the term [...] "pit latrine" [...] may be used to denote a toilet that has a squatting pan with a <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> or siphon (more accurately termed a pour-flush pit latrine – very common in South East Asia for example) or simply {{a hole in the ground}} without a <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> (also called a simple pit latrine) – the common type in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Whilst a dry toilet can be with or without urine diversion, a pit latrine is almost always without urine diversion. The key characteristic of a pit latrine is the use of a pit, which infiltrates liquids into the ground and acts as a device for storage and very limited treatment.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} to U-trap or siphon designs is to incorporate a counter-weighted trap door mechanism that provides an air-tight <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> in the closed position. [...] Addition {{of a small}} amount of water (generally less than 500ml) overcomes the counterweight and allows the fecal matter to enter the pit. The devices are sold under the name of [...] "SaTo pan" [...] for as little as $1.85 USD and more than 800,000 of them have been installed worldwide since introduction in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|In a pourflush pit latrine, a {{squatting}} toilet with a <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> (U-trap or siphon) is used {{over one}} or two offset pits instead of a plain hole or seat.

The fecal sludge that is removed from the full pits of twin-pit pour-pour flush pit latrines is somewhat safer to handle and reuse than the fecal sludge from single pit pour-flush latrines, although significant health risks remain in either case and are a cause for concern.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of an adjustable inspiratory occlusion valve in experimental bronchopleural fistula during mechanical ventilation. METHODS:We studied six mechanically ventilated pigs in a surgically created, reproducible model of bronchopleural fistula managed with mechanical ventilation and water-sealed thoracic drainage. An adjustable inspiratory occlusion valve was placed between the thoracic drain and the endotracheal tube. Hemodynamic data, capnography and blood gases were recorded {{before and after the}} creation of the bronchopleural fistula as well as after every adjustment of the inspiratory occlusion valve. RESULTS:When compared with the standard water-sealed drainage treatment, the use of an adjustable inspiratory occlusion valve improved the alveolar tidal volume and reduced bronchopleural air leak (p< 0. 001), without hemodynamic compromise when compared with conventional <b>water</b> <b>sealed</b> drainage.

40|$|There are an {{increasing}} number of nuclear reactors around the world operating well beyond their original design lives. Some pump seals supplied by original equipment manufacturers are either no longer available or their performance does not meet current requirements. This paper describes both the testing and operational experience of two nuclear pump seals that have been developed by AECL to replace the original equipment manufacturer’s seals in AECL’s National Research Universal reactor, which has been operating since 1957. The two seals described are the main heavy <b>water</b> pump <b>seal</b> and the heavy <b>water</b> degassing pump <b>seal.</b> The main heavy <b>water</b> pump <b>seal</b> is a tandem seal containing two identical, but 180 º offset, eccentric seals of 95 mm balance diameter. The requirements were low pressure (0. 3 MPa), low leakage (< 0. 2 mL/min) and long, reliable lifetime (seven years).

40|$|Due to {{the impact}} of the 1999 Chi-Chi {{earthquake}} (ML = 7. 3) and the following typhoon induced heavy rainfalls and floods, the tailrace tunnel of the Kukuan Hydropower Plant was severely blocked and must be realigned and rebuilt. The new tailrace tunnel is 1991 m long with a 140 m section passing underneath the Tachia River, where the shallowest rock cover is 3. 5 m. In view of the common phenomenon that weak zone developed along river channel and debris accumulated on river bed, the ground improvement from the surface to the tunnel is difficult. Therefore, a construction shaft, a <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> pre-grouting plan and a special supporting system were designed to prevent the potential water inflow when tunneling underneath the Tachia River. In the construction phase, adequate excavation cross sections, support elements, auxiliary treatments, and <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> grouting methods were selected to overcome the difficult ground condition encountered. The experience learned from this successful case can be a valuable reference for the design and construction of similar river crossing tunnels in the future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
