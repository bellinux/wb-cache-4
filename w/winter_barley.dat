The trials with 19 two-rowed <b>winter</b> malting <b>barley</b> genotypes were conducted during three years.

60|$|Wheat quickly assumes new {{habits of}} life. The {{summer and winter}} kinds were classed by Linnaeus as {{distinct}} species; but M. Monnier (9/37. Quoted by Godron 'De l'Espece' volume 2 page 74. So it is, according to Metzger 'Getreidearten' s. 18, with summer and <b>winter</b> <b>barley.)</b> has proved {{that the difference between}} them is only temporary. He sowed winter-wheat in spring, and out of one hundred plants four alone produced ripe seeds; these were sown and resown, and in three years plants were reared which ripened all their seed. Conversely, nearly all the plants raised from summer-wheat, which was sown in autumn, perished from frost; but a few were saved and produced seed, and in three years this summer-variety was converted into a winter-variety. Hence {{it is not surprising that}} wheat soon becomes to a certain extent acclimatised, and that seed brought from distant countries and sown in Europe vegetates at first, or even for a considerable period (9/38. Loiseleur-Deslongchamps 'Cereales' part 2 page 224. Le Couteur page 70. Many other accounts could be added.) differently from our European varieties. In Canada the first settlers, according to Kalm (9/39. 'Travels in North America' 1753-1761 English translation volume 3 page 165.), found their winters too severe for winter-wheat brought from France, and their summers often too short for summer-wheat; and they thought that their country was useless for corn crops until they procured summer-wheat from the northern parts of Europe, which succeeded well. It is notorious that the proportion of gluten differs much under different climates. The weight of the grain is also quickly affected by climate: Loiseleur-Deslongchamps (9/40. 'Cereales' part 2 pages 179-183.) sowed near Paris 54 varieties, obtained from the South of France and from the Black Sea, and 52 of these yielded seed from 10 to 40 per cent heavier than the parent-seed. He then sent these heavier grains back to the South of France, but there they immediately yielded lighter seed.|$|E

Sometimes, he added, {{buckwheat}} or turnips were planted after wheat before the ground was allowed to lie fallow. Cazenove in his Journal gives a very complete picture of crop rotation in various parts of Pennsylvania in 1794. Around Bethlehem, wheat was sowed the first year followed by oats, corn, or buckwheat in the second year, clover the third year, and clover and plowed to sow in the fourth. … In Cumberland County, no “consistant or very well thought-out” crop rotation was practiced, and the farmers “followed too much their humor,” but good farmers, on good land, sowed wheat the first year, after thrice plowing the land, oats or corn the second year, and clover and fallow the third and fourth years. … A travel account of 1794, which indicated that Lancaster County was the best cultivated of any part of Pennsylvania, gave the following account of rotation there: the first crop, Indian corn, was planted in late May or early June, was harvested in the fall in time to sow the second crop, winter wheat. In the spring of the second year, before the wheat sowed the previous fall had been harvested, clover was sowed among the wheat. After the wheat was reaped in late summer, a few cattle were turned into the now ripe clover for a short time. In the third and fourth years, clover was sowed, and was mowed twice in each year. After the last mowing in Autumn of the fourth year, the ground was plowed and harrowed, and in May of the fifth year the cycle was begun again with Indian corn. Occasionally, rye or <b>winter</b> <b>barley</b> was substituted for wheat, and oats for Indian corn, in which case the oats were sowed in April.
