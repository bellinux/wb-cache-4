500|$|Writing in A Moveable Feast, Hemingway remembered [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", recalling when he [...] "sat in {{a corner}} with the {{afternoon}} light coming in over my shoulder and wrote in the notebook.... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> writing I {{did not want to}} leave the river where I could see the trout in the pool, its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log-driven piles of the bridge. The story was about coming back from the war but {{there was no mention of}} the war in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just two laps later, {{immediately}} after Ralf Schumacher had spun and stalled his Williams in Turn 6, the crowd {{on the front}} straight groaned as Montoya moved over to the pit wall and rolled to a stop. [...] "It (the Williams) was really good," [...] Montoya said a few minutes later, {{at the back of}} his garage. [...] "The car was really competitive. I wanted to really go for the win here, and it's a big disappointment we couldn't finish the race. I think the engine was running really strong. I don't know, I think it was a hydraulic (problem) because I lost all the gears and everything. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped,</b> the engine was still running." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer and pianist Sergio George {{helped to}} revive salsa's {{commercial}} {{success in the}} 1990s by mixing salsa with contemporary pop styles with Puerto Rican artists like Tito Nieves, La India, and Marc Anthony. George also produced the Japanese salsa band Orquesta de la Luz. Brenda K. Starr, Son By Four, VÃ­ctor Manuelle, and the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan enjoyed crossover success within the Anglo-American pop market with their Latin-influenced hits, usually sung in English. More often than not, clave was not a major consideration in the composing or arranging of these hits. Sergio George is up front and unapologetic about his attitude towards clave: [...] "Though clave is considered, {{it is not always}} {{the most important thing in}} my music. The foremost issue in my mind is marketability. If the song hits, that's what matters. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> trying to impress musicians and started getting in touch with what the people on the street were listening to, I started writing hits. Some songs, especially English ones originating in the United States, are at times impossible to place in clave." [...] As Washburne points out however, a lack of clave awareness does not always get a pass: ...|$|E
