5|$|In 1923 fifty {{motor car}} bodies {{were ordered to}} allow some of the {{original}} 1904–05 car bodies to be scrapped. From 1926 two stock pools were created. Main line trains were formed from 101 new motor cars supplemented by motor cars rebuilt from the steel bodied cars originally constructed in 1910–14 and 1923, and trailers modified from the original wooden bodied cars. A small pool of unmodified 'local stock' <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> shuttles from Acton Town to South Acton, South Harrow and Hounslow.|$|E

5|$|The show's title {{character}} is {{portrayed in the}} two pilots by Pal, the MGM film Lassie. Thereafter, five of his male descendants played the role. His son Lassie Junior performed through the Jeff years and first two Timmy years before retiring in 1959 to battle cancer. Though he recovered, Lassie Junior never <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> show again. His son Spook was rushed into the series while his brother Baby was in training for the role. Spook was inadequately prepared and never became comfortable on the set after an overhead light crashed to the floor on his first day. Weatherwax, however, coaxed a natural and seemingly confident performance from the frightened dog, and some regard Spook's portrayal as Weatherwax's finest work. Spook played the role {{in the spring and}} fall of 1960. Baby, son of Lassie Junior and brother to Spook, <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> show for six years. He appeared in the last Timmy years, and two of the Forest Service seasons. Baby died at eight years of age, the only Lassie not to live at least seventeen years. He was followed in the role by Mire who played Lassie for five years. He portrayed the fictional collie in the syndicated seasons.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1904 {{he built}} the Chalet de Catllaràs, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi Güell. It has a simple {{structure}} though very original, {{in the shape}} of a pointed arch, with two semi-circular flights of stairs leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> Park Güell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the show}} was a bigger hit in prime time, Moore always {{preferred}} the daytime housewife audience. He thought that it gave the lonely housewives something to listen to and watch while they <b>worked.</b> <b>The</b> show provided a break into show business for many performers, including Alan King, Jonathan Winters, Carol Burnett, and Dorothy Loudon. The Garry Moore Show featured regular supporting cast members Durward Kirby, Marion Lorne, Denise Lor, and Ken Carson, {{as well as a}} mixture of song-and-dance routines and comedy skits, and introduced the public to comedian Carol Burnett. After the show ended, Burnett became a star in her own right, hosting The Carol Burnett Show for many years.|$|E

Collard explained that the IDSO was set up at the instigation of the Chairman of De Beers, Sir Philip Oppenheimer, after an Interpol report stated that £10 million of diamonds were being smuggled out of South Africa each year, as well as additional amounts from Sierra Leone, Portuguese West Africa, the Gold Coast and Tanganyika.|$|E

5|$|Gum-digging was {{the major}} source of income for {{settlers}} in Northland, and farmers often <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> gumfields in the winter months to subsidise the poor income from their unbroken land. By the 1890s, 20,000 people were engaged in gum-digging, of which 7000 worked full-time. Gum-digging was not restricted to settlers or workers in the rural areas; Auckland families would cross the Waitematā Harbour by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead, causing damage to public roads and private farms, and leading to local council management of the problem.|$|E

5|$|In another story, Stowe and Calvin {{meet a man}} on a Mandarin dock who {{has been}} cheated out of much the land he was given by the government. Named Old Cudjo, he <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> small {{homestead}} on which he grew cotton for years. Where at first the neighbors surrounding the colony of former slaves from South Carolina were hesitant and suspicious, Old Cudjo and his colony were so industrious and honest that they won their white neighbors over. One who was a justice of the peace intervened on his behalf and Old Cudjo's land was returned to him. Stowe's final chapter is dedicated to defending the notion that blacks should be employed to help build the state of Florida to transform it from a wilderness into a civilization. They are better suited for work in the hot sun, more resistant to malaria, and are trustworthy and extremely eager to learn. She also dedicates a few pages to her interested observations on their culture as she details overhearing their festivities at night and sitting outside an informal church service.|$|E
