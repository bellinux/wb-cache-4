5|$|When the Achaeans {{arrived at}} Argos for an assembly, Cleomenes {{came down from}} Tegea to meet them. However, Aratus—who had reached an {{agreement}} with Antigonus—demanded that Cleomenes present 300 hostages to the Achaeans and enter the city alone, or approach the city with all his forces. When this message reached Cleomenes, he declared {{that he had been}} <b>wronged</b> and once again declared war on the Achaeans.|$|E
5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to see}} themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had <b>wronged</b> them.|$|E
5|$|In 1844 in Japan as the Tokugawa shogunate is in decline, Lord Matsudaira Naritsugu of Akashi rapes, tortures, and murders his {{citizens}} at will. He is shielded {{because the}} Shogun is his half-brother. Sir Doi Toshitsura, the Shogun's Justice, {{realizes that the}} situation will escalate after Naritsugu ascends to a higher political position. After a <b>wronged</b> party publicly commits seppuku {{as a way of}} showing disdain for Lord Naritsugu, SirDoi seeks out a trusted older samurai, Shimada Shinzaemon, who served under the former shogun, and secretly hires him to assassinate Naritsugu. However, Naritsugu's loyal retainers, led by Hanbei, an old contemporary of Shinzaemon, learn of the plot by spying on Doi's meetings.|$|E

When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law? When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? … in many parts of our country where the colored population is large the people of that race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is <b>wronged.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been <b>wronged</b> by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} <b>wronged</b> them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E

50|$|Another way {{of looking}} {{is that at the}} start we have 2 'right' cups and 1 'wrong'. By {{changing}} 1 right and 1 <b>wrong,</b> situation remains the same. By changing 2 rights, we land up at 3 <b>wrongs.</b> Next move takes us back to the original position of 1 <b>wrong.</b> Thus, any number of moves leaves us either with 3 <b>wrongs</b> or with 1 <b>wrong,</b> and never with 0 <b>wrongs.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{theological}} {{basis for}} forgiveness in Hinduism {{is that a}} person who does not forgive carries a baggage of memories of the wrong, of negative feelings, of anger and unresolved emotions that affect his or her present as well as future. In Hinduism, not only should one forgive others, but one must also seek forgiveness if one has <b>wronged</b> someone else. Forgiveness is to be sought from the individual <b>wronged,</b> as well as society at large, by acts of charity, purification, fasting, rituals and meditative introspection.|$|E

25|$|Jews {{observe a}} Day of Atonement Yom Kippur {{on the day}} before God makes {{decisions}} regarding what will happen during the coming year. Just prior to Yom Kippur, Jews will ask forgiveness of those they have <b>wronged</b> during the prior year (if they have not already done so). During Yom Kippur itself, Jews fast and pray for God's forgiveness for the transgressions they have made against God in the prior year. Sincere repentance is required, and once again, God can only forgive one for the sins one has committed against God; this is why it is necessary for Jews also to seek the forgiveness of those people who they have <b>wronged.</b>|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} {{claimed that the}} fact that some <b>wrongs</b> are public is a fact that is {{important}} to our thinking about permissible criminalisation. We argue that it is not. Some say: what gives us reason to criminalise wrongs—when we have such a reason—is the fact that those <b>wrongs</b> are public. Others say: the fact that a <b>wrong</b> is public is a necessary condition of there being reason to criminalise that <b>wrong,</b> or of its permissible criminalisation. What we should make of these statements depends on what is meant by a public <b>wrong.</b> If the claim that a <b>wrong</b> is public is simply the conclusion of a sound argument that there is reason to criminalise the <b>wrong,</b> or that the <b>wrong</b> is permissibly criminalised, the above statements are true, but trivially so. If the claim that a <b>wrong</b> is public is a premise in an argument that there is reason to criminalize the <b>wrong,</b> or that the <b>wrong</b> is permissibly criminalised, the above statements, we argue, are false. We conclude that it would be better, when we think about permissible criminalisation, to do without the idea of a public <b>wrong...</b>|$|R

40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that pre-existing misconceptions negatively impact {{the effectiveness of}} traditional physics education. Research has also shown that activity based instruction improves posttest scores on conceptual evaluations. However, the specific effect of activity based instruction on students who have pre-existing misconceptions that lecture instruction fails to remove is an important but unanswered question due to the impossibility of instructing a given student by two different methods. In this paper pre and posttest Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation results are characterized in terms of <b>wrong</b> to same <b>wrong,</b> <b>wrong</b> to different <b>wrong,</b> <b>wrong</b> to right, etc., and a method of inferring the effect of activity based instruction on a lecture student using the right to <b>wrong</b> responses is presented. Results {{indicate that}} a <b>wrong</b> to same <b>wrong</b> response by a lecture student {{would be more likely}} to be converted to a <b>wrong</b> to right by activity based instruction than would be a <b>wrong</b> to different <b>wrong</b> response. This result is consistent with cognitive conflict as an aid to learning in activity based classes...|$|R
