Peter left him grumbling and growling, and chuckled to himself {{all the way back}} to the dear Old Briar-patch. He knew that Johnny Chuck would not dare disobey Old Mother Nature.|$|E
60|$|WELL, {{pretty soon}} {{the old man}} was up and around again, and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for not {{stopping}} school. He catched me {{a couple of times and}} thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> much before, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap. That law trial was a slow business--appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just suited--this kind of thing was right in his line.|$|E
6000|$|Swiftly {{that winter}} passed. Pan had a happy growing time of it. Study had not seemed so irksome, perhaps {{owing to the}} fact that he had a horse and saddle; he could ride to and fro; he often stopped to see Lucy who was now big enough to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> herself; and the teacher had won his love. Pan kept out of fights with Dick Hardman until one recess when Dick called him [...] "teacher's pet." [...] That {{inflamed}} Pan, as much because of the truth of it as the shame. So this time, though he had hardly picked a fight, he was the first to strike. With surprising suddenness he hit the big Dick square on the nose. When Dick got up howling and swearing, his face was hideous with dirt and blood. Then began a battle that dwarfed the one in the barn. Pan had grown considerably. He was quick and strong, and when once his mother's fighting blood burned in him he was as fierce as a young savage. But again Dick whipped him.|$|E
