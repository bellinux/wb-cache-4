In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague. Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community found evidence of his or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal was forgotten.|$|E

5|$|Johansson {{played the}} cyborg, supersoldier Motoko Kusanagi in Rupert Sanders's 2017 film {{adaptation}} of the Ghost in the Shell franchise. The film received mixed reviews: it was praised for its visual style, acting, and cinematography but was controversial for <b>whitewashing</b> the cast, particularly Johansson's character. Responding to the criticism, {{she said she would}} never play a person of another race, but wanted to use this rare opportunity to star in a franchise with a female protagonist. The film grossed $169.8million worldwide against a production budget of $110million. In March 2017, Johansson hosted Saturday Night Live for the fifth time, making her the 17th person, and the fourth woman (after Candice Bergen, Drew Barrymore, and former cast member Tina Fey) to enter the NBC sketch comedy series' prestigious Five-Timers Club. In the black comedy film Rough Night (2017), Johansson played Jess Thayer, one of the five friends—alongside Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, Ilana Glazer, and Zoë Kravitz—whose bachelorette party goes wrong after a male stripper dies. Despite mixed critical reception for the film, it had moderate box office returns.|$|E

25|$|Despite not {{qualifying}} for the Main Tour directly, Liang received a wildcard {{nomination to the}} Main Tour; this was because he won the 2005 IBSF World Under-21 Championship and also because {{not all of the}} players that were eligible for the Main Tour took their places.

25|$|The Kremlin in the Putin era {{has often}} sought to {{maintain}} as much sway over {{the portrayal of}} history as over the governance of the country. In seeking to restore Russia's standing, Putin and other officials have stoked a nationalism that glorifies Soviet triumphs while playing down or even <b>whitewashing</b> the system's horrors. As a result, throughout Russia, many archives detailing killings, persecution and other such acts committed by the Soviet authorities have become increasingly off-limits. The role of the security services seems especially delicate, perhaps because Putin is a former KGB agent who headed the agency's successor, the FSB, in the late 1990s.|$|E

American soldiers vandalized the monastery by inscribing graffiti on the walls and by <b>whitewashing</b> the chapel, destroying its 600-year-old murals in the process. The structure was further damaged by looters. However, a military chaplain saw the importance of the site, and a commander ordered troops to vacate the monastery.

25|$|This {{retaliation}} {{played out}} as follows: In spring 1799, while returning to France from Egypt, Dumas was captured and imprisoned in Taranto {{in hopes of}} a ransom from Napoleon.

When Dumas was released after two years, Napoleon had risen to power and had summarily reinstated slavery and eliminated civil rights protection – resulting in a <b>whitewashing</b> of Dumas's military heroics during the Revolution. Physically incapacitated from the captivity, Dumas died in early 1806. Although his son was less than four years old at the time, he retained memories of his father, later honoring his legacy through his literary works The Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers.|$|E
