25|$|National glory {{returned}} in 2002–03 when Bayern achieved its fourth double {{by winning the}} Bundesliga with the second largest gap ever to the runner-up and a straight 3–1 win over 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the cup final. However, the whole season was overshadowed by Bayern's unceremonious exit from the Champions League in the first group stage, <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a single win in six matches. The following season, the team, enhanced with the €19 million acquisition of Dutch striker Roy Makaay from Deportivo de La Coruña, overcame at least this hurdle, but even an underperforming Real Madrid in crisis managed to eliminate the Reds in the round of 16. Bayern itself was not reaching any consistent form all year and even the formerly sturdy defence proved highly vulnerable. In the end, the club's second-placed finish in the league was not descriptive of Bayern's strength but rather of inconsistent performances by its competitors. The cup elimination by second division Alemannia Aachen was symptomatic for a season in which the team showed not a single convincing performance. Even the newcomers Michael Ballack and 2002 World Cup-winning defender Lúcio could not make a difference.|$|E
500|$|The group's early singles are {{collected}} on their eponymous debut (Profile, 1984), introducing rock references in [...] "Rock Box", and recognized {{then and now}} as the best album of hip hop's early years. The next year, they appeared at Live Aid and released King of Rock (Profile, 1985), on which they asserted [...] that they were [...] "never ever old school". Raising Hell (Profile, 1986) was a landmark, containing quintessentially hip hop tracks like [...] "Peter Piper", [...] "Perfection" [...] and [...] "It's Tricky", and going platinum {{in the year of}} its release {{on the back of the}} huge crossover hit [...] "Walk This Way". The group had rapped over the beat from the 1975 original in their early days, <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> knowing the name of the band. [...] When Raising Hells producer Rick Rubin heard them playing around with it in the studio, he suggested using the Aerosmith lyrics, and the collaboration between the two groups came about. The album's last track was [...] "Proud To Be Black", written under the influence of Chuck D of the as-yet unrecorded Public Enemy. On [...] "My Adidas" [...] the band rapped that they [...] "took the beat from the street and put it on TV".|$|E
500|$|Neuromancer {{was written}} on a [...] "clockwork typewriter," [...] the very one you may recall glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates {{from somewhere in the}} 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs {{slightly}} less than the Macintosh SE/30 I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black [...] "crackle" [...] paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 {{was one of the best}} portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> ever having touched an actual computer.|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{shall be}} no game {{at all in}} the house of a Sabbath eve," [...] said Mrs. Roundhand; and out she flounced from the room, <b>without</b> ever <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> wishing us good-night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Clara; [...] "but I {{well know}} how to manage that--he shall never ask the {{question}} at all. I will restore Lady Binks's admirer, <b>without</b> accepting <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a civility in ransom." ...|$|R
2500|$|Melody Makers Steve Sutherland also {{welcomed the}} new musical direction: [...] "The Banshees achieve an awesome, {{effective}} new pop <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a theory or qualm. Dreamhouse is an intoxicating achievement". Critic David Cleary of AllMusic would later describe the single [...] "Slowdive" [...] as [...] "a violin-colored dance beat number", with [...] "a catchy melodic hook {{away from being}} the real thing", and positively assessed the album, saying, [...] "This fine platter is well worth purchasing".|$|E
2500|$|David Bentley Hart, {{reviewing}} {{the book in}} the Christian journal First Things, interpreted the book as a [...] "rollicking burlesque, <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a pretense of logical order or scholarly rigor". Hart says [...] "On matters of simple historical and textual fact, moreover, Hitchens' book is so extraordinarily crowded with errors that one soon gives up counting them." [...] Hart notes that Hitchens conflates the histories of the 1st and 4th crusades, restates the long discredited assertion that the early church destroyed ancient pagan texts, and asserts that Myles Coverdale and John Wycliffe were burned alive when both men died of old age.|$|E
2500|$|Some general {{criticism}} of financial derivatives is also relevant to credit derivatives. [...] Warren Buffett famously described derivatives bought speculatively as [...] "financial {{weapons of mass}} destruction." [...] In Berkshire Hathaway's annual report to shareholders in 2002, he said, [...] "Unless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties to them. In the meantime, though, before a contract is settled, the counterparties record profits and losses—often huge in amount—in their current earnings statements <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a penny changing hands. The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen)." ...|$|E
60|$|Under his {{accumulated}} misfortunes, he grew {{not only}} more dull, more taciturn, than ever, but gloomy, moody, brooding as well. For hours he would sit staring straight before him into the fire, <b>without</b> moving <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a hair.|$|R
50|$|Fortress Test: Michael, a builder, {{could have}} easily put much {{stronger}} fortification on the homestead. Michael was also the one patrolling {{the rear of the}} building, and that's where the attackers entered, <b>without</b> Michael <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> firing a shot.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} he is up to my weight?" [...] Jos said. He was already on his back, in imagination, <b>without</b> ever <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a thought for poor Amelia. What person who loved a horse-speculation could resist such a temptation? ...|$|R
2500|$|The brotherhood of the Tau Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa {{underwent}} a great transition {{in the years}} of World War II and immediately afterward. [...] Many members of the classes of 1942 through 1945 were rushed through their academic studies {{and went off to}} war <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a graduation ceremony. [...] At the same time, the U.S. Navy organized a V-12 Navy College Training Program on the Dartmouth College campus. [...] Many Phi Sigma Kappa men from Dartmouth went off to war, and at least one spent time as a prisoner of war. When these same brothers returned to finish their education after the war, attitudes in the house were less innocent, which changed how the brotherhood treated one another. [...] Certain pre-war pledge activities, for example, were completely eliminated, as their shock value no longer entertained anyone.|$|E
2500|$|The day {{his term}} expired, Semmelweis petitioned the Viennese {{authorities}} {{to be made}} docent of obstetrics. A docent was a private lecturer who taught students and who had access to some university facilities. At first, because of Klein's opposition, Semmelweis's petition was denied. He reapplied, but {{had to wait until}} 10 October 1850 (more than 18 months), before finally being appointed docent of 'theoretical' obstetrics. The terms refused him access to cadavers and limited him to teaching students by using leather-fabricated mannequins only. A few days after being notified of his appointment, Semmelweis left Vienna abruptly and returned to Pest. He apparently left <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> saying good-bye to his former friends and colleagues, a move that may have offended them. According to his own account, he left Vienna because he was [...] "unable to endure further frustrations in dealing with the Viennese medical establishment".|$|E

"I {{believe we}} might sneak away from them," [...] Neal said, after looking {{fifteen or twenty}} minutes at the ledge beneath which the enemy had taken refuge, <b>without</b> seeing <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a man's head.

60|$|However, {{despite all}} {{my desire to}} make the service {{rendered}} appear perilous, I did not neglect any precautions for our safety, although I must confess to having been somewhat disappointed when, about midnight, we pulled in under the tumble-down wharf <b>without</b> having <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> seen the glint of a lobster back's belt buckle.|$|R
60|$|The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, {{that with}} Portuguese vengeance had whelmed {{a whole world}} <b>without</b> leaving <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a widow.

50|$|Buzz {{comes up}} with an idea that Jimmie tell the {{publisher}} that intelligence places the banker in Yucatán.

60|$|Jones and I rimmed {{a mile of}} our {{canyon and}} worked out almost to {{the west end of}} the Bay, <b>without</b> finding <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a single track, so we started to retrace our way. The sun was now hot; the snow all gone; the ground dry as if it had never been damp; and Jones grumbled that no success would attend our efforts this morning.|$|R
60|$|This {{time there}} was no mistake. It was a hail hardly more than a whisper, but yet so {{distinct}} as to prevent any possibility {{that it was a}} trick of the imagination.

25|$|At the Battle of Monmouth, an American Revolutionary War battle {{fought on}} June 28, 1778 in Monmouth County, American General Charles Lee led the advance and {{initiated}} the first {{attack on the}} column's rear. When the British turned to flank him, he ordered a general retreat <b>without</b> <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> firing {{a shot at the}} enemy, and his soldiers soon became disorganized. General George Washington continued the battle, earning respect for the Continental Army troops under his command. In the dining room of the Village Inn, located in the center of Englishtown, General Washington and Lord Stirling drew up the court martial papers citing Lee for his conduct during and after the battle.|$|R
