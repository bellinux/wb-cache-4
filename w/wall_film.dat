Wan Laiming and Wan Guchan were then recognized as China's animation pioneers when they produced the first animation short Uproar in the Studio running 10 to 12 minutes long in black and white. The brothers believed that Chinese animation should be instructive, logical and thought-provoking besides being entertaining to its audience. They wanted to emphasize the development of an animation style that was uniquely Chinese. It was a common trend at the time to combine live action film footages with 2D animation. By 1932 one of the Wan brothers, Wan Di-huan, would voluntarily leave the Great <b>Wall</b> <b>Film</b> company for his own photography studio. Some of the first wave of influential American animations that reached Shanghai were Popeye (大力水手), and a show known as (勃比小姐) that may be an off translation to what is known today as Betty Boop.|$|E
