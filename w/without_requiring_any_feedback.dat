The force transients obtained with this model show the major features observed with oscillatory insect fibrillar flight muscle. The effects of viscosity and cross-bridge detachment rate on the frequency of oscillation of the model resemble the effects of viscosity and ATP concentration on flagellar oscillation, and the relationship between turnover rate and frequency of oscillation is also consistent with observations on flagella. However, the amplitude of oscillation of the model does not show the degree of frequency-independence which is typical of flagella...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper details a new orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) {{modulator}} {{based on}} the use of a pseudorandom postfix (PRP) -OFDM and discusses low-complexity equalization and channel estimation/tracking architectures. The main property of this new modulation scheme is the ability to estimate and track the channel variations semi-blindly using order-one statistics of the received signal. Compared with known cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) pilot-symbol-assisted modulation (PSAM) schemes, the pilot overhead is avoided: The channel estimation is performed {{based on the}} exploitation of pseudorandomly weighted postfix sequences replacing the guard interval contents of CP-OFDM. PRP-OFDM is shown to be of advantage if the target application requires 1) a minimum pilot overhead, 2) low-complexity channel tracking (e. g., high mobility context), and 3) adjustable receiver complexity/performance trade-offs (available due to the similarities of PRP-OFDM to the zero-padded OFDM (ZP-OFDM) modulation scheme) <b>without</b> <b>requiring</b> <b>any</b> <b>feedback</b> loop to the transmitter.

30|$|Recently, {{broadband}} {{analog network}} coding (ANC) has intensively been studied {{due to its}} potential to increase the network capacity by exploiting the broadcasting nature of the wireless channel. However, channel state information (CSI) knowledge is required for self-information removal and signal detection. A low-complexity pilot-assisted channel estimation (PACE) scheme has been presented for broadband ANC, where feedback of the CSI estimates from the relay to the users is required. In this study, we propose a PACE scheme without CSI feedback from the relay for broadband ANC using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing. In the first time slot the users transmit their respective pilots to the relay {{and in the second}} time slot the relay simply amplifies and forwards the received pilot signals to both users. Each user can then estimate all the CSI it needs for self-information removal and coherent signal detection, <b>without</b> <b>requiring</b> <b>any</b> <b>feedback</b> of the CSI estimates from the relay. We theoretically analyze the channel estimator’s mean square error (MSE) performance and evaluate the bit error rate (BER) and throughput performance of broadband ANC using the proposed PACE by computer simulation. The results show that the increase in the MSE of the proposed CE scheme causes only a slight BER performance degradation compared to the conventional PACE scheme with ideal feedback. However, the benefit of eliminating the CSI feedback {{can be seen in the}} throughput performance.|$|E
30|$|As {{suggested}} in [1 – 3], {{the requirement of}} relaxed frequency synchronization {{is based on the}} necessity of deploying a waveform with reduced OOSBE compared to conventional OFDM. Therefore, frequency asynchronism caused by carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) is introduced in our simulations. In [2], it was pointed out that the CFO of a user can be estimated and compensated at the receiver <b>without</b> <b>requiring</b> <b>any</b> information <b>feedback</b> from the user. Some example methods of estimating CFOs can be found in [43, 44]. However, ICI will still occur because various CFOs of users are unable to be compensated for at the same time.|$|R

We propose the adaptive multi-agent system Amadeus whose goal is to learn from users' actions and contexts how to perform actions {{on behalf of the}} users in similar contexts. However, considering the possible changes of users preferences, a previously learnt behaviour may become misfit. So, Amadeus must be able to observe if its actions on the system are contradicted by the users or not, <b>without</b> <b>requiring</b> <b>any</b> explicit <b>feedback.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the introspection capabilities of Amadeus in order to detect users contradictions and to self-adapt its behaviour at runtime.

40|$|We {{show that}} Pilot symbol {{assisted}} modulation (PSAM) schemes {{can be improved}} by adapting the coded modulation strategy at the sender {{to the quality of}} the channel measurement at the receiver, <b>without</b> <b>requiring</b> <b>any</b> channel <b>feedback</b> from the receiver. The transmitter employs interleaved codes, with data symbols coded according to their distance from the nearest pilot symbols. The performance benefits from this approach are quantified in the context of binary signaling over time-varying Rayleigh fading channels described by a Gauss-Markov model. The spacing of the pilot symbols is optimized to maximize the mutual information between input and output in the preceding setting. Causal and non-causal channel estimators of varying complexity and delay are considered. It is shown that, by appropriate optimization for the spacing between consecutive pilot symbols, the adaptive coding techniques proposed can yield up to 30 % improvement in achievable rate, without <b>any</b> <b>feedback</b> from the receiver to the sender...|$|R
40|$|In rate-adaptive {{orthogonal}} {{frequency division}} multiplexing (OFDM) systems, limited feedback schemes {{are essential to}} reduce the number of subchannels for which the channel state information is fed back by the users. For the practically important best-M scheme, in which each user feeds back only its M strongest subchannels and their indices to the base station (BS), we derive a throughput-optimal rate adaptation policy that enables the BS to assign rates to the subchannels of every user. We present it in closed-form for the widely used exponential correlation model. The novelty of the policy lies in its exploitation of the structure of the information fed back by the best-M scheme and the correlation among subchannel gains. We also present a near-optimal, lower computational complexity approach. In effect, our approach facilitates rate adaptation and scheduling by the BS even on subchannels that are not fed back by a user due to feedback constraints. For various schedulers, we show that it improves the downlink throughput compared to several conventional approaches, <b>without</b> <b>requiring</b> <b>any</b> additional <b>feedback...</b>|$|R

The main objective of this project is to construct a wheelchair which can be directly controlled by the brain <b>without</b> <b>requires</b> <b>any</b> physical <b>feedback</b> as controlling input from the user. The method employed in this project is the Brain-computer Interface (BCI), which enables direct communication between the brain and the electrical wheelchair. The best method for recording the brain’s activity is electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG signal is also known as brainwaves signal. The device that used for capturing the EEG signal is the Emotiv EPOC headset. This headset is able to transmit the EEG signal wirelessly via Bluetooth to the PC (personal computer). By using the PC software, the EEG signals are processed and converted into mental command. According to the mental command (e. g. forward, left [...] .) obtained, the output electrical signal is sent out to the electrical wheelchair to perform the desired movement. Thus, in this project, a computer software is developed for translating the EEG signal into mental commands and transmitting out the controlling signal wirelessly to the electrical wheelchair...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Pilot symbol {{assisted}} modulation (PSAM) is {{a standard}} approach for transceiver design for time-varying channels, with channel estimates obtained from pilot symbols being employed for coherent demodulation of the data symbols. In this paper, we show that PSAM schemes can be improved by adapting the coded modulation strategy at the sender {{to the quality of}} the channel measurement at the receiver, <b>without</b> <b>requiring</b> <b>any</b> channel <b>feedback</b> from the receiver. We consider performance in terms of achievable rate for binary signaling schemes. The transmitter employs interleaved codes, with data symbols coded according to their distance from the nearest pilot symbols. Symbols far away from pilot symbols encounter poorer channel measurements at the receiver and are therefore coded with lower rate codes, while symbols close to pilot symbols benefit from recent channel measurements and are coded with higher rate codes. The performance benefits from this approach are quantified in the context of binary signaling over time-varying Rayleigh fading channels described by a Gauss–Markov model. The spacing of the pilot symbols is optimized to maximize the mutual information between input and output in this setting. Causal and noncausal channel estimators of varying complexity and delay are considered. It is shown that, by appropriate optimization for the spacing between consecutive pilot symbols, the adaptive coding techniques proposed can improve achievable rate, without <b>any</b> <b>feedback</b> from the receiver to the sender. Moreover, channel estimation based on the two closest pilot symbols is generally close to optimal.
