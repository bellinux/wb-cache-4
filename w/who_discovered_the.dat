5|$|Emilio Gino Segrè (1 February 1905 – 22 April 1989) was an Italian-American {{physicist}} and Nobel laureate, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> elements technetium and astatine, and the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle, {{for which he}} was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959.|$|E
5|$|In a 1988 Young All-Stars {{comic book}} written by Roy and Dann Thomas, Arthur Gordon Pym is a 19th-century {{explorer}} <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> lost Arctic civilization {{of the alien}} Dyzan. Pym goes on to become Jules Verne's Captain Nemo, eventually sinking the RMS Titanic. This story also uses elements of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's 1871 novel Vril.|$|E
5|$|The {{names that}} {{eventually}} prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> moons independently {{at the same}} time as Galileo: he named them at the suggestion of Johannes Kepler after lovers of the god Zeus (the Greek equivalent of Jupiter): Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, in his Mundus Jovialis, published in 1614.|$|E

5|$|The surname Golding {{is synonymous}} {{with a variety of}} hop known as Goldings and, {{although}} it is not certain <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> hop, it has been accredited to John Golding (who died some time before 1811), the great nephew of Thomas and the owner of Ditton Court, or to his son John (who died at Ditton Place in 1851).|$|E

5|$|After {{its last}} {{performance}} at the Gaiety in 1872, Thespis appears to have remained unperformed until 1953, although an attempted reconstruction from the 1940s has been discovered. Tillett and Spencer, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> ballet music, identified twenty separate reconstructions of Thespis between 1953 and 2002. About half of these use music adapted from Sullivan's other works; the others use new music {{for all but the}} surviving songs, or, in a few cases, re-compose those as well. No version has become predominant in recent productions.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Jonathan Carnahan {{presents}} his sister, Evelyn, a Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, with {{an intricate}} box and map, {{which leads to}} Hamunaptra.

Rick makes a deal with Evelyn to lead them there if they release him from prison.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, {{the center}} of European chess life moved from the Southern European {{countries}} to France. The two most important French masters were François-André Danican Philidor, a musician by profession, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> importance of pawns for chess strategy, and later Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais, who won a famous series of matches with the Irish master Alexander McDonnell in 1834. Centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in big European cities like Café de la Régence in Paris and Simpson's Divan in London.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century it was {{successively}} {{the home}} of the notable scientists Dr William Budd FRS, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> origins of typhoid, and Professor John Beddoe FRS, the social anthropologist who wrote The Races of Man. In the 1890s the house became a school preparing young gentlemen for colonial civil service examinations and for the army and navy. The school closed in 1915 and the house became {{the home of}} The Red Maids' School, which was evacuated from Westbury while their buildings were used as a Red Cross Hospital during the Great War.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} published {{discovery of}} a moon other than the Earth's was by Galileo Galilei, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. Over the following three centuries only a few more moons were discovered. Missions to other planets in the 1970s, most notably the Voyager 1 and 2 missions, saw a surge {{in the number of}} moons detected, and observations since the year 2000, using mostly large, ground-based optical telescopes, have discovered many more, all of which are irregular.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hospital}} in Ashford is William Harvey Hospital, in nearby Willesborough. It {{is named after}} William Harvey, the doctor <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> blood circulatory system. The hospital was built because the government decided the old hospital would be too small for demand as Ashford grew, and looked for a 30-acre site that could have a hospital built on a budget of £7–8million. Work started on building the {{hospital in}} 1973 and it was commissioned in 1977, opening in 1979.|$|E

5|$|On August 16, 1896, an American {{prospector}} named George Carmack, his Tagish wife Kate Carmack (Shaaw Tláa), {{her brother}} Skookum Jim (Keish), and their nephew Dawson Charlie (K̲áa Goox̱) were travelling {{south of the}} Klondike River. Following a suggestion from Robert Henderson, a Canadian prospector, they began looking for gold on Bonanza Creek, then called Rabbit Creek, one of the Klondike's tributaries. It is not clear <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> gold: George Carmack or Skookum Jim, but the group agreed to let George Carmack appear as the official discoverer because they feared that mining authorities would be reluctant to recognize a claim made by an Indigenous Person.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of the area that is now the site of Cooper were the Caddo Indians, who settled large portions of eastern Texas as early as 800 AD. The Caddo were highly advanced, living in large wooden structures, and were skilled farmers. The first European to visit the area was French explorer François Hervey, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> area around 1750. However, a few decades later, some of the Indians caught European diseases and along with attacks from neighboring Indian tribes, forced the Caddo {{out of the area}} around Cooper. Around 1820, Delaware, Quapaw, and Seminole tribes settled in the area. In 1836, the Republic of Texas officially recognized the region around Cooper as part of Red River County. In 1840, Lamar County was formed, absorbing the Cooper area. However, just six years later, the region was designated as part of the newly formed Hopkins County.|$|E

5|$|The {{police officer}} <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> wreck {{initially}} suspected {{that only the}} semi had gone off the road. After further investigation, he found the van and called for emergency services, whose arrival was delayed by freezing rain. The rear wall and {{a large portion of}} the right-hand side of the van, including three rows of seats, had been torn away, ejecting several occupants. Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition, and two in stable. The fourth was released shortly after the accident. The driver of the truck was not injured.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army {{contracted}} the botanist and bioethicist Arthur Galston, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> defoliants later used in Agent Orange, and his employer University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana {{to study the}} effects of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops. Galston, then {{a graduate student at the}} University of Illinois, in his research and 1943 Ph.D. dissertation focused on finding a chemical means to make soybeans flower and fruit earlier. He discovered both that 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida. As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during Operation Downfall if the war had continued.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday 30 September, {{the body}} of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was {{discovered}} at about 1am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying {{in a pool of}} blood with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed just minutes before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, <b>who</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>the</b> body. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the others on the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road, and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design. Most experts, however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with at least two of the earlier ones, as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night.|$|E
