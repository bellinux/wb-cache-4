5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it is not a genetic ability and thus is very rare, the Rinnegan has been {{regarded}} as a legend with only the Sage of Six Paths known to acquire it. However, the reincarnations of Hagoromo's sons, Indra and Asura, can potentially access Rinnegan by having the genes of both reincarnations, as in the case of Madara (Indra's reincarnation), who obtained the DNA of Hashirama (Asura's reincarnation), although he only awoke the Rinnegan near the end of his natural lifespan. This is considered a <b>wrongful</b> <b>act</b> by Hagoromo as he attempted to leave a message in the form of a stone tablet for Indra's descendants to reconsider the act. The Rinnegan is shown to be transplantable, as Madara was able to implant his Rinnegan into the young Nagato, and Obito takes up Madara's left Rinnegan to use it in conjunction with his Sharingan. After meeting with Hagoromo, Sasuke, who is the current reincarnation of Indra, awakens a Rinnegan in his left eye, which has an additional six tomoe on top of the ripple pattern, making it closer to the Rinne Sharingan in appearance. His Rinnegan allows him to perform , which can shift himself, others, and objects a set distance away from his original location. He can increase the range of this technique by instantaneously changing place with a remote space. Due to its speed, this technique has proven to be especially useful for launching surprise attacks against enemies within its range. While there is no prerequisite for using the technique, it does have a recharging period after each use. Once fully mastered it can even cross dimensions but requires a large amount of chakra and drains his dōjutsu of its power for an extended period of time.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the European Journal of International Law, Vahagn Avedian, leaving aside the limitations of the UN Genocide Convention, emphasizes the applicability of international laws that prevailed at the time and remain in force up to the present, e.g. the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, more specifically the Martens Clause, pertaining to the protection of civilian population, but also existing international laws on unlawful confiscation, etc. Thus, the actions of the Turkish governments (the Ottoman, the insurgent nationalist movement as well as the succeeding republic), should be viewed from the perspective of Internationally <b>Wrongful</b> <b>Acts.</b> Avedian argues that: [...] the Republic not only failed to stop doing the <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts</b> of its predecessor, but it also continued the very internationally <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts</b> committed by the Young Turk government. Thus, the insurgent National Movement, which later became the Republic, made itself responsible for not only its own <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts,</b> but also those of its predecessor, including the act of genocide committed in 1915-1916.|$|R

The general rule {{is that there is}} no conversion until some act is done which is a denial or violation of the plaintiff's dominion over or rights in the property. To constitute a conversion of a chattel, there must be an unauthorized assumption of the right to possession or ownership. The act must have the essence of a tort.|$|E
25|$|The {{employer}} {{shall be}} jointly liable to make compensation for any injury which the employee has wrongfully caused {{to the rights}} of another in the performance of his duties. However, the employer is not liable for the injury if he has exercised reasonable care in the selection of the employee, and in the supervision of the performance of his duties, or if the injury would have been occasioned notwithstanding the exercise of such reasonable care. If compensation cannot be obtained according to the provision of the preceding sentence, the court may, on the application of the injured person, take the financial conditions of the employer and the injured person into consideration, and order the employer to compensate for a part or the whole of the injury. The employer who has made compensation as specified in the preceding sentence may claim for reimbursement against the employee committed the <b>wrongful</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E

A person who has wrongfully caused the death of another shall also be bound to make compensation for the injury to any person incurring the medical expenses, increasing the need in living, or incurring the funeral expenses. If the deceased was statutorily bound to furnish maintenance to a third party, the tortfeasor shall also make compensation to such third party for any injury arising therefrom.

40|$|By {{studying}} the continuity between the Ottoman Empire and its succeeding Turkish Republic, this article aims to address one crucial {{aspect of the}} denial of the Armenian genocide by the Turkish state, namely the issue of state responsibility. There are psychological barriers in Turkey which have largely suppressed the memories of possible wrongdoings during World War I and the ensuing ‘Independence War’. However, the barrier that is created by the issue of state responsibility is identified here as the fundamental obstacle for genocide recognition by the Turkish state. This article aims to apply some of the existing legal principles and theories of international law {{in order to test}} their applicability to the two Turkish states and the issue of internationally <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts</b> committed during World War I and the ensuing years. In addition to the Turkish Republic bearing the identity of the Ottoman Empire, this article suggests that the Republic not only failed to stop doing the <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts</b> of its predecessor, but it also continued the very internationally <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts</b> committed by the Young Turk government. Thus, the insurgent National Movement, which later became the Republic, made itself responsible for not only its own <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts</b> but also those of its predecessor, including the act of genocide committed in 1915 – 1916. The issue of possible liability has ever since the creation of the Republic formed the denialist policy which is Turkey’s to this day...|$|R
25|$|Once it is {{established}} that the sufficient relationship of employer and employee exists, {{it is necessary that}} any tort be committed in the course of employment. As with distinguishing an employer and employee relationship, there is no one test which adequately establishes which acts employers are vicariously liable for. Such determinations rest upon precedent, and the facts of each individual case. A preferred test of the courts was formulated by John William Salmond, some 100 years ago, which states that an employer will be held liable for either a <b>wrongful</b> <b>act</b> they have authorised, or a wrongful and unauthorised mode of an act that was authorised. The rationale for this is policy based; if an employer could simply issue detailed and long prohibitions on what an employee was not to do, they could never be found vicariously liable for the wrongdoings of their employees. However, a distinction can be drawn between acts which are prohibited, and acts which take employees out of the course of their employment. An illustration of the test is provided by two contrasting cases, Limpus v London General Omnibus Company and Beard v London General Omnibus Company, both involving road collisions. In the former, a driver pulled in front of another rival omnibus, in order to obstruct it. Despite express prohibitions from the employer, they were found liable; this was merely an unauthorised mode of the employee carrying out his duties (driving), not an entirely new activity. By contrast, in the latter case, London General Omnibus Company were not liable where a conductor (employed to collect fares on board the bus) negligently chose to drive the vehicle instead; this was completely outside of his duties.|$|E

Associated Newspapers claimed they had emails proving the link, and wanted {{to rely on a}} defence of fair comment and justification; Green asserted that the emails were fakes. At the time, the law on injunctions was governed by two cases; Bonnard v Perryman and Cream Holdings Ltd v Banerjee and the Liverpool Post and Echo Ltd. Bonnard established that [...] "The right of free speech is one which it is for the public interest that individuals should posses, and indeed, that they should exercise without impediment, so long as no <b>wrongful</b> <b>act</b> is done … Until it is clear that an alleged libel is untrue, {{it is not clear that}} any right at all has been infringed; and the importance of leaving free speech unfettered is a strong reason in cases of libel for dealing most cautiously and warily with the granting of interim injunctions", telling courts that injunctions in libel cases should only be granted if there is [...] "a real prospect of success" [...] at trial.|$|E

40|$|What {{happens when}} {{employees}} within the police-force make mistakes in their line of duty? This essay {{set out to}} investigate the relationship between labour law sanctions and the criminal law punishments for <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts</b> for government employees. This relationship is also set in the perspective of how acts or statements of xenophobia are handled within the Swedish police-force. Further, the essay aims to examine the principle of {{ne bis in idem}} in relation to labour law sanctions and criminal law punishment for <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts,</b> and if these two should be considered in line with this principle. Regarding the relationship between labour law sanctions and criminal law punishment for government employees, the determination for which system to use in any given situation is not fully stipulated. One key aspect is whether the act is carried out in exercise of public authority. By examining cases regarding xenophobia within the Swedish police-force one conclusion that the author has come to is that xenophobia more often is considered an insult (regulated in BrB 5 : 3) rather than <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts</b> in the line of duty. However, acts or statements of xenophobia are considered wrong and far away from the expected behavior of members of the Swedish police-force. By making an analogy with Swedish tax law an argument can be made that the relationship between labour law sanctions and criminal law punishment for <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts</b> is worth examining, and might not fully be in line with the principle of ne bis in idem. ...|$|R

40|$|The International Law Commission's {{decision}} to maintain Articles 40 and 41 {{is based on}} the conviction that serious breaches of peremptory norms entail specific legal consequences within the field of state responsibility. Among these consequences, it is possible to distinguish between (i) specific obligations binding on other states, (ii) specific rights of other states and (iii) specific obligations of the responsible state. This article critically assesses whether international law recognizes specific consequences falling within the third of these categories. It discusses six prominent candidates suggested in international practice, literature, and the work of the ILC - such as the obligations to provide assurances of repetition, to pay punitive or exemplary damages or to prosecute individual perpetrators of serious <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts.</b> The article concludes that none of these candidates qualifies as a specific consequence of serious breaches of peremptory norms — partly because the alleged specific obligation has not been recognized in international law, and partly because it equally applies to internationally <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts</b> that do not constitute serious breaches in the sense of Article 40. It follows that international law at present does not impose specific obligations on states responsible for serious breaches of peremptory norms. This in turn raises doubts as to the viability of the distinction between serious breaches and ordinary <b>wrongful</b> <b>acts...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{adjectival}} {{form of the}} noun hubris is [...] "hubristic". Hubris {{is usually}} perceived as a characteristic of an individual rather than a group, although the group the offender belongs to may suffer collateral consequences from the <b>wrongful</b> <b>act.</b> Hubris often indicates a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one's own competence, accomplishments or capabilities. Contrary to common expectations, hubris is not necessarily associated with high self-esteem but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem, and a gap between inflated self perception and a more modest reality.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} an actus reus to be {{committed}} there has {{to have been an}} act. Various common law jurisdictions define act differently but generally, an act is a [...] "bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary." [...] In Robinson v. California, , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a California law making it illegal to be a drug addict was unconstitutional because the mere status of being a drug addict was not an act and thus not criminal. Commentator Dennis Baker asserts: [...] "Although lawyers find the expression actus reus convenient, it is misleading in one respect. It means not just the criminal act but all the external elements of an offence. Ordinarily, there is a criminal act, which is what makes the term actus reus generally acceptable. But there are crimes without an act, and therefore without an actus reus in the obvious meaning of that term. The expression “conduct” is more satisfactory, because wider; it covers not only an act but an omission, and (by a stretch) a bodily position. The conduct must sometimes take place in legally relevant circumstances. The relevant circumstances might include consent in the case of rape. The act of human sexual intercourse becomes a <b>wrongful</b> <b>act</b> if it is committed in circumstances where one party does not consent and/or one or more parties concerned are below the age of consent. Other crimes require the act to produce a legally forbidden consequence. Such crimes are called result crimes. ... All that can truly be said, without exception, is that a crime requires some external state of affairs that can be categorized as criminal. What goes on inside a person’s head is never enough in itself to constitute a crime, even though it might be proved by a confession that is fully believed to be genuine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vicarious {{liability}} {{refers to}} the idea of an employer being liable for torts committed by their employees, generally for policy reasons, and to ensure that victims have a means of recovery. The word [...] "vicarious" [...] derives from the Latin for 'change' or 'alternation' and the old Latin for the doctrine is respondeat superior. To establish vicarious liability, the courts must find first that there exists a relationship of employee and employer. The torts of independent contractors generally do not impose vicarious liability on employers; however, Honeywill and Stein Ltd v Larkin Brothers Ltd demonstrates this principle does not apply where particularly hazardous activities are contracted for, or a non-delegable duty is owed. Secondly, the tort must have been committed 'in the course of employment'; or while an employee is going about the business of their employer. A preferred test of the courts for connecting torts to the course of employment was formulated by John William Salmond, which states that an employer will be held liable for either a <b>wrongful</b> <b>act</b> they have authorised, or a wrongful and unauthorised mode of an act that was authorised. Where in Limpus v London General Omnibus Company an omnibus driver chose to disobey strict instructions from his employer, to obstruct a rival company, they were still liable, as he was merely engaging in his duties in an unauthorised way. However, in the contrasting case of Beard v London General Omnibus Company, there was no liability where a conductor drove an omnibus negligently, as it was no part of his duties. Under the test, employers were generally not held liable for intentional torts of their employees. Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd established a newer test, stating that employers would be liable for torts which were closely connected to the duties of an employee.|$|E
