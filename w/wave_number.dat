If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time.

(See, for example, the Nobel lectures of Wien, Planck and Millikan.) Instead, there was a widespread belief that energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbed or emitted radiation. Attitudes changed over time. In part, the change can be traced to experiments such as Compton scattering, where it was much more difficult not to ascribe quantization to light itself to explain the observed results.|$|E

25|$|In {{the table}} below, several flow {{quantities}} and parameters according to Airy wave theory are given. The given quantities {{are for a}} bit more general situation as for the solution given above. Firstly, the waves may propagate in an arbitrary horizontal direction in the x=(x,y) plane. The wavenumber vector is k, and is perpendicular to the cams of the wave crests. Secondly, allowance is made for a mean flow velocity U, in the horizontal direction and uniform over (independent of) depth z. This introduces a Doppler shift in the dispersion relations. At an Earth-fixed location, the observed angular frequency (or absolute angular frequency) is ω. On the other hand, in a frame of reference moving with the mean velocity U (so the mean velocity as observed from this reference frame is zero), the angular frequency is different. It is called the intrinsic angular frequency (or relative angular frequency), denoted as σ. So in pure wave motion, with U=0, both frequencies ω and σ are equal. The <b>wave</b> <b>number</b> k (and wavelength λ) are independent of the frame of reference, and have no Doppler shift (for monochromatic waves).|$|E

40|$|A single-wave-number {{representation}} of a nonlinear energy spectrum, i. e., a stretching-energy spectrum, is found in elastic-wave turbulence governed by the Föppl–von Kármán (FvK) equation. The representation enables energy decomposition analysis in the wave-number space and analytical expressions of detailed energy budgets in the nonlinear interactions. We numerically solved the FvK equation and observed the following facts. Kinetic energy and bending energy are comparable with each other at large <b>wave</b> <b>numbers</b> as the weak turbulence theory suggests. On the other hand, stretching energy {{is larger than the}} bending energy at small <b>wave</b> <b>numbers,</b> i. e., the nonlinearity is relatively strong.

We obtained reliable magnetic power spectra {{in the high}} <b>wave</b> <b>numbers</b> range, up to k = 4. 6 Mm− 1, which corresponds to a spatial scale l = 1. 4 Mm. We find that the occurrence of the spectral discontinuity at high <b>wave</b> <b>numbers,</b> k ≥ 3 Mm− 1, largely depends on the spatial resolution of the data and it appears at progressively higher <b>wave</b> <b>numbers</b> as {{the resolution of the}} data improves. The spectral discontinuity in the raw spectra is located at <b>wave</b> <b>numbers</b> about 3 times smaller than <b>wave</b> <b>numbers,</b> corresponding to the resolution of the data, and about 1. 5 – 2. 0 times smaller {{in the case of the}} noise- and-resolution corrected spectra. The magnetic power spectra for active and quiet regions are different: active-region power spectra are described as ∼ k− 1. 7, while in a quiet region the spectrum behaves as ∼ k− 1. 3. We suggest that the difference can be due to small-scale dynamo action in the quiet-Sun photosphere.
