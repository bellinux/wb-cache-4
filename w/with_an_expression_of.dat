25|$|Individual laments {{lamenting the}} fate of the {{particular}} individual who utters them. They are by far {{the most common type of}} psalm. They typically open with an invocation of Yahweh, followed by the lament itself and pleas for help, and often ending <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> confidence. A subset is the psalm of confidence, in which the psalmist expresses confidence that God will deliver him from evils and enemies.|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was taken}} from a shoot by fashion {{photographer}} Mario Testino, in which Madonna modelled Versace clothes for their upcoming Fall/Winter 1995 campaign. Subsequently, other images taken from the shoot appeared in fashion magazines, such as Vanity Fair and Vogue Italia. The packaging included with the release showed Madonna looking [...] "deliciously cosmopolitan" [...] as she wore a tight-fit white cocktail attire, while the back cover artwork is predominantly more playful. The front cover artwork presented Madonna leaning against a wall <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> [...] "romantic loss or absorption." [...] Designed as the Madonna album which would appeal to a larger audience in contrast to her previous records, Bedtime Stories and [...] Erotica, the booklet featured red roses inside and a golden yellow flower on the back cover. According to The Guardian writer Caroline Sullivan, the fact that Madonna removed her nose ring for the cover shot indicated she [...] "wants the album to be taken on its own merits." [...] In 2013, the artwork was dubbed {{as one of the}} [...] "20 Most Fashionable Album Covers Ever" [...] by the Dutch edition of Elle magazine. The title of the album derives from her 1990 song of the same name since it had received little attention during the release of its original album, I'm Breathless.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{other types of}} {{extensions}} of the above computations which are possible. [...] They started <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the primed image coordinates and derived 3D coordinates in the unprimed system. [...] It is also possible to start with unprimed image coordinates and obtain primed 3D coordinates, which finally can be transformed into unprimed 3D coordinates. [...] Again, in the ideal case the result should be equal to the above expressions, but in practice they may deviate.|$|E

2500|$|The 170-ton statue is {{composed}} of 28blocks of white Georgia marble (Georgia Marble Company) and rises [...] from the floor, including the [...] seated figure (with armchair and footrest) upon an [...] high pedestal. The figure of Lincoln gazes directly ahead and slightly down <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> gravity and solemnity. His frock coat is unbuttoned, and a large United States flag is draped over the chair back and sides. French paid special attention to Lincoln's expressive hands, which rest on the enormous arms of a circular, ceremonial chair, the fronts of which bear fasces, emblems of authority from Roman antiquity. French used casts of his own fingers to achieve the correct placement.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the evenings}} {{of the three}} festivals (shalosh regalim) the old London {{tradition}} has preserved, from at least the early 18th century, three characteristic melodies, probably brought from north Germany or Bohemia. That for the Passover illustrates the old custom according to which the precentor solemnly dwells on the last creed, that on {{the resurrection of the}} dead (in this case to a [...] "representative" [...] theme common to Passover and to Purim), and is answered by the choristers <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> confident assurance. The choral response here given received its final shaping from David Mombach. The [...] "Yigdal" [...] for Shavu`oth is of a solemn tone, thus strikingly contrasting with those for the other festivals.|$|E

Salleh decided to convene a meeting of all 20 judges from the Supreme and High Courts in the capital of Kuala Lumpur. At the meeting, they agreed not to publicly reply to Mahathir's criticisms. Instead, they wrote a confidential letter to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) and the Malay rulers, expressing their grievances. The proposed letter, which was unanimously approved, was written by Salleh Abas. The letter stated the judges' disappointment [...] "with the various comments and accusations made by the Honourable Prime Minister against the Judiciary," [...] but did not demand specific action be taken — instead, it ended <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> [...] "hope that all those unfounded accusations will be stopped".|$|E
