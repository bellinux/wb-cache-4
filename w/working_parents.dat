25|$|The first pre-schools were {{established}} in the 1820s by a private initiative intended to instruct the children of working families, where both parents worked outside the home.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{workplace}} policies that can alleviate {{the burden of}} work–family balance for many middle-class families. Some options in family-friendly workplaces include providing paid leave or options for reduced hours. Workplaces are realizing that employees with well balanced family and work lives are actually valuable to firms: workplace childcare assistance can increase productivity and morale among employees, as well as lessen turnover, accidents, and absenteeism. Childcare options for <b>working</b> <b>parents</b> can be key in workplace satisfaction. Workplace supports such as personal time off, paid leave, on-site or nearby childcare, financial assistance for childcare, and other family-friendly policies are Western European workplace norms that could solve the work–family balance problem in the United States.|$|E
25|$|As prime minister, David Cameron {{wanted to}} put family policy {{at the heart of}} the Conservative Party {{claiming}} British politics in the past had got it wrong. He stated families should be the most important thing in the country's life, believing social responsibility and a strong family was key to an individuals success, and by extent becoming less reliant on the state. Both Cameron and Theresa May have aimed at helping families achieve a work-home balance and have previously proposed to offer all parents 12 months parental leave, to be shared by mother and father as they choose. Other policies have included doubling the free hours of childcare for <b>working</b> <b>parents</b> of three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 30 hours a week during term-time, and fund 15 hours a week of free childcare for all disadvantaged two-year-olds, worth £2,500 a year per child.

David Cameron in a speech mentioned businesses will have to help cut the costs imposed on society and families through the decisions businesses make, by becoming more socially responsible which would in turn reduce the need for state control to solve the problem.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} and to understand midwives’ and child health care nurses’ experiences of <b>working</b> with <b>parent</b> education groups through their descriptions of the role and what they find rewarding and challenging in that work. Data were collected through three open-ended questions from a web survey: “How do you refer to your role when <b>working</b> in <b>parent</b> education?” “What is the biggest challenge or difficulty for you when <b>working</b> in <b>parent</b> education?” and “What is most rewarding when <b>working</b> in <b>parent</b> education?” The answers were analysed by using qualitative content analysis and correlation analysis. The results show that the midwives and child health care nurses either included or excluded the group when describing their role as leaders and their influence on parents. The same applies to what they found rewarding and what was difficult and challenging for them in working with the groups. Primarily, the leaders who excluded the group expressed a lack of competence on a professional level in managing groups and using the right teaching methods to process the knowledge content. One important question to deal with is how to best support midwives and nurses in child health care to be prepared for <b>working</b> with <b>parent</b> education groups. One obvious thing is to provide specialized training in an educational sense. An important aspect could also be providing supervision, individually or in groups.

500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all <b>working</b> <b>parents.</b> He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E

25|$|Parental {{views are}} perhaps the most {{essential}} factor in determining the socialization process which shapes new members of society.

2500|$|The anti-coca {{policies}} {{imposed in}} 1995 have had {{adverse effects on}} Peruvian’s household economies. [...] Many families dependent on coca farming {{have been forced to}} send their children to work as eradication of crops has decreased their household income. [...] In states where coca is grown, child labour increased by 18% in 1997 and 40% in 2000. Work hours and domestic work increased as well, with girls taking on 28% more domestic work with boys doing 13% more. [...] Wage work for adults also increased since 1995. [...] As such, it can be inferred that the increase in child labour since eradication policies have come into effect is caused by children filling in for <b>working</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|E
