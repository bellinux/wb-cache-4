5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
25|$|This is Richard's CD. My only {{knowledge}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{studio was}} how {{he seemed to have}} wanted this for a long time. You're in a position to have somebody do something that they really want to do, and it was not something that would hurt me or damage me—why not? All the dreams you show up in are not your own.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the outcome, Rosolie {{explained}} that the anaconda [...] " [...] my arm into a position where her force was fully on my exposed arm. I started to feel the blood drain out of my hand, and I felt the bone flex. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where I {{felt like it was}} going to snap, I had to tap out." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> {{was joking}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> said that," [...] Butler said. [...] "I started dreaming <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> college. It shows you {{anything}} can happen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hours ago. I was {{too excited}} <b>to</b> sleep <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> bed, and yet I feel so well. Philip, where's Wall Street? Won't {{you take me}} there?" ...|$|R
5000|$|After singing Alicia Keys’ [...] "Fallin’" [...] for {{her sisters}} at age 11, her family {{realized}} {{her ability to}} sing.

500|$|Faulks {{stated that}} Devil May Care {{would be his}} only Bond book, saying: [...] "One tribute, one centenary, one book", adding [...] "My {{contract}} did offer me a second go, but definitely not... 'Once funny, twice silly, three times a slap', as the nanny saying goes. But I {{think it would be}} a good gig for someone to do." [...] He saw his novel as a continuation of the Fleming books, saying [...] "I tried to put the films out of mind", adding that [...] "I prepared in a rather pedantic way by reading all of the books in chronological order and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end I wrote mine." ...|$|E
2500|$|About the goal, Maradona said, [...] "I {{made the}} play {{to give it}} to Valdano, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area they {{surrounded}} me and I had no space. Therefore, I had to continue the play and finish it myself." [...] He later complimented the fair play of the English team, saying, [...] "I don't think I could have done it against any other team because they all used to knock you down; they are probably the noblest in the world".|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Ramsay was in Iceland's Westman Islands {{filming a}} puffin hunting segment {{when he lost}} his footing and fell during a descent off an [...] cliff, landing in the icy water below. He said, [...] "I thought I was a goner." [...] He reached {{the surface of the}} water by {{removing}} his heavy boots and waterproof clothing. His film crew, who rescued Ramsay by throwing him a rope, reported that he was submerged for at least 45 seconds. During the ordeal, he remembers how he felt: [...] "I was panicking and my lungs were filling with water. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top after getting my boots off, I was dazed and my head was totally massive." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{settled a}} hundred guineas {{on the old}} man <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Dublin, and made him an annuity which enabled him to pass his old days in comfort.|$|R
60|$|I {{was dead}} tired, {{as you may}} fancy; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> sleep, which was not till after {{a great deal of}} tossing, I slept like a log of wood.|$|R
6000|$|... "I started off, Mr. Holmes, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{that address}} {{it was a}} manufactory of {{artificial}} knee-caps, {{and no one in}} it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross." ...|$|R
2500|$|During the 1924 {{election}} campaign, Reeves {{was asked}} to {{speak on behalf of}} both the Liberal and Labour Party candidates. [...] She choose to support Labour: [...] "The Liberal audiences were nice narrow decent people. They sat upright in rows and clapped their cotton gloves... But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Labour meetings in the slums, among the costers and the railway men and the women in tenth hand velvet hats – when I saw their pinched grey-and-yellow faces in those steamy halls, I knew all of a sudden that they were my people". [...] She soon {{became a member of the}} party and supported her husband as the Labour Party candidate for Holland-with-Boston in Lincolnshire. [...] The seat had gone to the Liberals in a by election earlier that year and Rivers failed to win it back. Amber attempted to get her theories on currency, later brought together in her book The Nationalisation of Banking, adopted by the Labour Party, and she and Rivers became responsible for a party publication called Womens Leader. Amber remained active in the Fabian Society, and by this time many Fabians agreed that there was a need to work through the parliamentary Labour Party. She stood twice as a candidate for Hendon, in 1931 and 1935 ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{needless to}} {{trespass}} further on Lord Loring's time. I thanked him, {{and returned to}} Penrose. He was sleeping <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cave I found Bill {{backed up}} {{against the side of}} it, {{breathing}} hard, and the boy threatening to smash him with a rock half as big as a cocoanut.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{ran across}} the field but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> it, it was obvious no-one could have got out alive. It was just hopeless. Bodies and {{wreckage}} were scattered everywhere; flames were still pouring from the wreckage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh dear yes. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> England the old humbug was out grouse-shooting. It {{was what}} you call in America a {{gigantic}} fraud. My mother had got nervous. My three weeks at Newport seemed a happy dream.” ...|$|R

60|$|Nor was {{the night}} blacker than his face, and he took no heed of me as I ran after him, {{thinking}} selfishly of the sweetmeats he had promised to bring me--but I thought no more of them <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door of the Red Room.|$|E
6000|$|... "The blues--the blues!" [...] screamed the girl. [...] "They {{had all but}} {{overtaken}} me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{short cut}} through the wood.

60|$|He {{lifted the}} latch, and I entered; but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parlour where Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed.

6000|$|... "Oh, dear, yes. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> England, {{he was out}} grouse shooting. It {{was what}} you call in America a {{gigantic}} fraud. My mother had got nervous. My three weeks at Newport seemed like a happy dream." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the fact}} of the matter is, I went back to the tables that night and lost a goodish bit of what I'd won. And, somehow or another, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> America, the stuff seemed to slip away." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Cairo, <b>I</b> took {{a taxi to}} {{the address}} at which I {{had been told to}} report. [...] "Ah," [...] said the villanous-looking Egyptian who drove me, when he heard the address. [...] "You want Secret Service." ...|$|R

6000|$|I was sleepy and tired, so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel I hurriedly paid it {{the fifty}} cents it demanded (with {{approximate}} lagniappe, I assure you).

60|$|The dog didn't seem to {{be quite}} 'imself next day, {{and he was so}} fierce in the yard that my missis was afraid to go near 'im.

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{place where}} it should come in, {{if it did not}} come in I did not care, but I had it marked in the paper.

60|$|I {{went down}} the stairs, working up my temper all the way. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parlor I was in a fine frenzy {{concealed}} beneath a veneer of frigid courtesy.
