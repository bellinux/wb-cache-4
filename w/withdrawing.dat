As expected, the primary and secondary dendrite arm spacings (PDAS and SDAS) decrease {{with the increase of}} <b>withdraw</b> rate. The highest volume fraction of eutectic γ/γ′is observed at the 100 μm•s- 1 <b>withdraw</b> rate. The volume fraction of eutectic γ/γ′does {{not appear to be a}} strong function of the <b>withdraw</b> rate. With increasing <b>withdraw</b> rate, interface morphologies change in the sequence of planar, cellular, and dendrite. There is a general refinement of the microstructure as the <b>withdraw</b> rate increases.
