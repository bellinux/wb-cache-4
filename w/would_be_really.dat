500|$|... "Signs and Wonders" [...] {{was written}} by The X-Files staff writer Jeffrey Bell. Bell had long desired to write a [...] "down-and-dirty" [...] horror story for the series. In addition, he had informally studied the {{practice}} of snake handling, concluding that [...] "anything involving snakes would be scary and I saw the church stuff as something that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> fascinating." [...] However, unlike most stories featuring the radical religious, {{the theme of the}} episode was that in certain circumstances, [...] "intolerance can be good", according to executive producer Frank Spotnitz.|$|E

"Raining Blood", {{along with}} Reign in Bloods opening track [...] "Angel of Death", {{is an almost}} {{permanent}} addition to Slayer's live set-list, and was Hanneman and King's favorite track to play live. At {{the end of the}} Still Reigning DVD, there is a finale with the band covered in fake blood during the performance of [...] "Raining Blood". When asked which song holds best, both Slayer guitarists replied [...] "Raining Blood". Hanneman admitted that he [...] "still love playing that song live. You'd think we'd be tired of it – I mean, I'd love to know how many times we've played it live. That <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> interesting."

500|$|... "Paranoid Android" [...] was {{recorded}} in actress Jane Seymour's 15thcentury mansion {{near the village of}} St Catherine, near Bath, Somerset. The first edit was over 14minutes long and included a long organ interlude performed by Jonny Greenwood. Radiohead played this extended version during a tour with Alanis Morissette in September 1996. [...] "When we started playing it live, it was completely hilarious," [...] recalled O'Brien. [...] "There was a rave down section and a Hammond organ outro, and we'd be pissing ourselves while we played. We'd bring out the glockenspiel and it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really,</b> really funny." [...] Before the song's first live performance, Yorke told audiences that [...] "f you can have sex to this one, you're fucking weird." [...] He also sarcastically referred to the version of the song played during the tour as [...] "a Pink Floyd cover".|$|E
500|$|Jimmy {{is based}} {{on one of his}} cousins, who was rather {{feminine}} and {{spent most of his time}} playing with girls rather than with boys. Jonny and Plank are inspired by one of Antonucci's childhood friends, a loner who spent most of his time outside with his blanket. He stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, and that he [...] "thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own" [...] and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do. Some wanted Plank to be able to talk, smile and blink as if he was alive, but Antonucci insisted that it should be treated as a piece of wood, brought to life by Jonny's imagination.|$|E
500|$|Mason {{has said}} {{that there have been}} a few hints about Chris's {{sexuality}} along the way and in August 2010, Chris finally revealed that he is gay to his girlfriend, Summer.

Mason said [...] "It's hard for Chris because he has a girlfriend who he's been with for some time. To try and tell someone in this situation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> difficult". Summer initially takes the news well and plays it down, but when fellow student Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) discovers that one of her classmates is gay, she goes out of her way to find out who it is and expose them. Mason said that she does not realise that [...] "what she sees as a game is someone else's life".|$|E

In {{the early years of}} her marriage to fellow actor Adam Smethurst the couple struggled financially, and with the added expense of the birth of their daughter, Ayola had been on the verge of giving up her acting career to begin a business franchise. [...] On joining the cast of Holby City, she disclosed: [...] "I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting. I've loved that one month it's Sahara in Morocco and the next I'm doing a stage play, then it's a six-part telly thing.

500|$|Dogmeat was {{inspired}} by the unnamed dog of Max Rockatansky (Mad Max) from the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2. His initial name had been [...] "Dogshit" [...] and his ultimate name was derived from the opening scene of the 1975 post-apocalyptic film A Boy and His Dog, in which the main character Vic calls his dog Blood [...] "dog meat". According to Fallout producer, lead programmer and designer Tim Cain, [...] "Leonard Boyarsky, the [...] art director ... had that movie running continuously in his office, and I think he remarked on several occasions that having a dog in the game <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> cool. [...] why we wanted a dog in the first place." [...] Fallout programmer and designer Jesse Heinig was credited by Cain as probably [...] "one person to thank for Dogmeat." [...] Heinig himself said: [...] "My understanding is that [...] Scott Bennie settled on the name 'Dogmeat' for the character, and it's likely that he did pick that from the story in question." ...|$|E

Every time we get the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E

She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin.

500|$|The group {{wrote and}} {{performed}} children's music {{that was different}} from {{what had been done}} previously; as Cook stated, [...] "we didn't just go down the route of what people think is kids' music". [...] They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio; while some of their recordings were orchestral, others had a more live feel. The group was aware that their songs were often children's first exposure to music. Guitar Magazine speculated that since Cook {{was one of the first}} guitarists children were exposed to, he may be the most influential guitarist in the world. [...] Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see, and said, [...] "I always think that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on that would be great. I think it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> nice if in 15years I read that somebody got into guitar playing because of [...] Wiggles". [...] In 2013, after Cook retired from touring with the group and became their touring manager, he reported that newer bands like Regular John approached him and said that The Wiggles were the first band [...] "they got into".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} idea for Dragon Quest {{came during the}} development of the NES port of Portopia. Horii and Nakamura came across the RPG Wizardry at a Macworld Conference & Expo. While it had some influence on the NES Portopias dungeon crawl segments, Horii liked the game's depth and visuals. He wanted to create a game similar to Wizardry, to expose the mainly Western-exclusive RPG genre to Japan and to expand the genre past computer enthusiasts. Horii also cited Ultima as an inspiration for Dragon Quests gameplay, specifically the first-person random battles in Wizardry and the overhead perspective of Ultima. While the RPG genre was predominantly Western and limited to PCs, Japanese gamers enjoyed home-grown games such as The Black Onyx and the Dragon Slayer series alongside Western RPG ports. However, while Horii and Nakamura enjoyed the dungeon crawling and statistical nature of Wizardry, they realized most people would not. This had not originally been a concern, but the success of Super Mario Bros. greatly increased the potential audience of any new Famicom/NES game. To create Dragon Quest, the gameplay needed to be simplified. According to Horii: [...] "There was no keyboard, and the system was much simpler, using just a [...] controller. But I still thought that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> exciting for the player to play as their alter ego in the game. I personally was playing Wizardry and Ultima at the time, and I really enjoyed seeing my own self in the game." ...|$|E

[...] Tim Minear explained {{some of the ideas}} behind the aborted series: [...] "The show was basically going to be Faith meets Kung Fu.

[...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|With [...] "The Truth About Heaven", {{the group}} were {{initially}} unsure {{of how to}} go into the first verse.
