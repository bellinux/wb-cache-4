[...] I figure I have a month to work the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to,</b> I'll be all right." [...] Clancy's comeback appeared to be on track in early November, as he was a close second among Miami receivers with 21 catches for 289 yards.

The Pistons won only 40games and missed the 1993 NBA Playoffs entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography As Bad As I Wanna Be, he confessed having thought about suicide and described that night as an epiphany: [...] "I decided that instead [...] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go... So I just said, 'I'm going to live my life the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> live it and be happy doing it.' At that moment I tamed [...] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn't want to be." [...] The book was later adapted for a TV movie Bad As I Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story. Although he had three years and $11.8million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E
