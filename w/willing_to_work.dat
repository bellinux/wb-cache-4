According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with him after his two previous flops. He also believed that audience might expect more screen-time from a better-known actor. Several other Bengali film and television actors, such as Indraneil Sengupta and Kharaj Mukherjee, were cast in supporting roles.|$|E

When jobs were available in surrounding farms and communities, those <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> beyond their regular CPS jobs could earn extra spending money. The federal government spent $1.3 million on the CPS program. The men performed $6 million of unpaid labor in return.|$|E

5|$|Selendis is the {{executor}} of the Protoss military {{following the}} reunification of the race. The character is introduced in the novel Twilight and in the Wings of Liberty campaign, where she is played by Cree Summer. Selendis is fiercely loyal to her race's ideals and completely dedicated to her responsibilities. A protégée of Artanis, she considers the dark templar {{to be a threat}} to her heritage but is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> beside them. Selendis is particularly eager to reclaim Aiur from the Zerg. Shortly after Artanis cleanses Shakuras of Zerg, Selendis takes part in an expedition to rescue three stranded heroes from Aiur; however, the mission was sabotaged by Ulrezaj, who kills two of the trapped warriors. During this time, Selendis became aware of other Protoss survivors stranded on Aiur, but as it was not believed possible to save them, their existence is kept secret. Later, Selendis commands the defenses of the dark templar archives on Ehlna against attack by Zerg and Ulrezaj, resulting in Ulrezaj's defeat.|$|E
5|$|The MAW {{has been}} criticised by workers' and welfare groups for making FDWs second-class citizens. The {{statutory}} minimum wage {{does not apply to}} them; although the MAW is HK$3,920, a local worker working a 48-hour week would earn HK$6,240 if paid at the minimum hourly wage of HK$30 (as of 30 March 2015). The International Domestic Workers Federation has complained that the MAW rose by only 3.9 percent (or HK$150) from 1998 to 2012, failing to keep pace with Hong Kong's median monthly income (which rose over 15 percent during the same period). Since Hong Kong is a benchmark market for Asian migrant workers, there is pressure to keep wages low. Wages were also held in check by competition from Indonesian workers, who began arriving in large numbers during the 1990s. Since then, workers from other Asian countries (such as Bangladesh and Nepal) may be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for less than the MAW.|$|E
5|$|Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei {{began as}} a trilogy of science fantasy books written by Japanese author Aya Nishitani. Published by Tokuma Shoten, the novels were a major success in Japan. The novels were first adapted into an {{original}} video animation (OVA), which retold {{the events of the}} first novel. Following the completion of the OVA in 1987, Tokuma Shoten decided to expand the series into video games. The license to develop a game based on Nishitani's work was simultaneously acquired by two companies; Atlus and Telenet Japan. The two companies were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on the same project, but wanted to differentiate their products. As the Famicom was noted for action-based titles and PCs for traditional role-playing games, the two companies decided to respectively play against platform expectations. Two different game projects were created with Tokuma Shoten's supervision under the Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei title; Atlus created a traditional role-playing game which was published by Namco, while Atlus and Telenet collaborated on an action role-playing game which would be published by Telenet. The two versions were developed concurrently, although the version by Telenet was the first to be completed.|$|E

5|$|The first Mother was {{released}} for the NES in 1989. Its sequel, Mother 2, or EarthBound, was developed {{over five years}} by Ape (later Creatures) and HAL, and published through Nintendo. The game was written and designed by Japanese author, musician, and advertiser Shigesato Itoi, and produced by Satoru Iwata, who became Nintendo's president and CEO. Mother 2 was made with a development team {{different from that of}} the original game, and most of its members were unmarried and <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> all night on the project. Mother 2 development took much longer than planned and came under repeated threat of cancellation. Itoi has said that the project's dire straits were resolved when Iwata joined the team. Ape's programming team had more members than HAL on the project. The HAL team (led by lead programmer Iwata) worked on the game programming, while the Ape team (led by lead programmer Kouji Malta) worked on specific data, such as the text and maps. They spent biweekly retreats together at the HAL office in view of Mount Fuji.|$|E
