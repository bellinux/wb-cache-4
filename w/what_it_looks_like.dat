In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Rarely, parasites can cause abscesses; this is more common in the developing world. Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> and is confirmed by cutting it open. Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear. In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection.|$|E

He added, [...] "But she doesn't always play a baritone sax because the animators don't know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> so it changes shape and color from show to show." [...] One of the hallmarks of the show's opening sequence is a brief solo Lisa plays on her saxophone after being thrown out of music class.

If you can sit through The Hurt Locker without your heart nearly pounding through your chest, you must be made of granite." [...] Entertainment Weeklys film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film the rare [...] "A" [...] rating, calling it, [...] "an intense, action-driven war pic, a muscular, efficient standout that simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within as well as <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> on the ground.

[...] Despite this statement, on Saturday, April 25, 2015, Bush criticized President Barack Obama {{at a meeting of the}} Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Bush criticized Obama's handling of Iran, specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: [...] "You think the Middle East is chaotic now?

[...] Robert John Young, Professor of Wildlife Conservation at the University of Salford, criticized Rio 2016 for failing to capitalize on environmental protection by [...] "inventing" [...] mascots, rather than using actual animal species.

500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> or what it can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt).

500|$|However, the {{commonly}} reported {{statement that the}} action scenes are continuous shots is not entirely true. [...] Visual effects supervisor Frazer Churchill explains that the effects team had to [...] "combine several takes to create impossibly long shots", where their job was to [...] "create {{the illusion of a}} continuous camera move." [...] Once the team was able to create a [...] "seamless blend", they would {{move on to the next}} shot. [...] These techniques were important for three continuous shots: the coffee shop explosion in the opening shot, the car ambush, and the battlefield scene. [...] The coffee shop scene was composed of [...] "two different takes shot over two consecutive days"; the car ambush was shot in [...] "six sections and at four different locations over one week and required five seamless digital transitions"; and the battlefield scene [...] "was captured in five separate takes over two locations". Churchill and the Double Negative team created over 160 of these types of effects for the film. [...] In an interview with Variety, Cuarón acknowledged this nature of the [...] "single-shot" [...] action sequences: [...] "Maybe I'm spilling a big secret, but sometimes it's more than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like.</b> The important thing is how you blend everything and how you keep the perception of a fluid choreography through all of these different pieces." ...|$|E

2500|$|Miller also {{researched}} how troublesome {{children were}} treated at the Tavistock Clinic, where imitation {{is often used}} during therapy; [...] "there are ways in which a skilful therapist will gently mock a child out of a tantrum by giving an amusing imitation of the tantrum immediately after it's happened. The child then has a mirror held up to it and is capable of seeing <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> to others." [...] In his review of the adaptation for the Financial Times, Chris Dunkley referred to this issue, calling Cleese's Petruchio [...] "an eccentrically pragmatic social worker using the wayward client's own doubtful habits to calm her down." [...] Actress Sarah Badel had a similar conception of the psychology behind the production. She constructed an [...] "imaginary biography" [...] for Katherina, arguing [...] "She's a woman of such passion [...] a woman of such enormous capacity for love {{that the only way}} she could be happy is to find a man of equal capacity. Therefore she's mad for lack of love [...] he feigns madness, she is teetering on the edge of it. Petruchio is the only man who shows her what she's like." [...] In this reading of the play, the production was at least partially based on Miller's own 1972 Chichester Festival stage production starring Joan Plowright and Anthony Hopkins.|$|E
