25|$|Sqn Ldr F.W.H.Lervill (another CLW director) had clear {{ideas on}} {{training}} aircraft and the Curlew {{was intended to}} place the pupil at the front to familiarise him or her with the sensation of flying alone.

25|$|Preparing the Vampire for {{take-off}} {{would only}} require pilots to perform six vital actions: setting the trim to neutral, opening {{the high and}} low-pressure fuel cocks, activating the booster pump, setting the flaps, and retracting the air brakes. If laden with external fuel tanks or bombs, pilots would have to retract the undercarriage quite quickly upon leaving the ground, else increasing airflow as the aircraft picked up speed would prevent the undercarriage doors from closing. Landing procedure was similarly free of complexity: disengaging the <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes,</b> lowering the undercarriage, setting the flaps to fully down, and effecting the air brakes. Typically, power-on landings were conducted due to the slow response of the engine to throttle changes, while the <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes</b> had to be applied carefully {{in order to avoid}} locking the wheels; there was no anti-lock braking system present.|$|E
25|$|American auto {{companies}} in the 1920s expected they would soon sell six million cars a year, but {{did not do so}} until 1955. Numerous companies disappeared. Between 1922 and 1925, the number of U.S. passenger car builders decreased from 175 to 70. H. A. Tarantous, managing editor of MoToR Member Society of Automotive Engineers, in a New York Times article from 1925, suggested many were unable to raise production and cope with falling prices (due to assembly line production), especially for low-priced cars. The new pyroxylin-based paints, eight cylinder engine, four <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes,</b> and balloon tires as the biggest trends for 1925.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} takes 40 {{hours to}} assemble {{from the factory}} kit. Original factory options included a cockpit fairing, <b>wheels</b> <b>brakes,</b> <b>wheel</b> pants, rotor <b>brake</b> and a main rotor pre-rotator, although the installation {{of any of these}} options will raise the empty weight above US FAR 103 limits for ultralight vehicles.|$|R
25|$|Among 787 flight systems, a key {{change from}} {{traditional}} airliners is the electrical architecture. The architecture is bleedless and replaces bleed air and hydraulic power sources with electrically powered compressors and pumps, while completely eliminating pneumatics and hydraulics from some subsystems, e.g., engine starters or brakes. Boeing says this system extracts 35 percent less {{power from the}} engines, allowing increased thrust and improved fuel economy. The total available on-board electrical power is 1.45 megawatts, which is five times the power available on conventional pneumatic airliners; the most notable electrically powered systems include engine start, cabin pressurization, horizontal stabilizer trim, and <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes.</b> Wing ice protection is another new system; it uses electro-thermal heater mats on the wing slats instead of traditional hot bleed air. An active gust alleviation system, similar to the system used on the B-2 bomber, improves ride quality during turbulence.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} engine nacelles incorporated {{thrust reversers}} {{taken from the}} 727 outboard nacelles. They proved to be relatively ineffective and tended to lift the aircraft up off the runway when deployed. This reduced the downforce on the main wheels thereby reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes.</b> In 1968, an improvement to the thrust reversal system was introduced. A 48-inch tailpipe extension was added and new, target-style, thrust reversers were incorporated. The thrust reverser doors were set 35 degrees away from the vertical to allow the exhaust to be deflected inboard and over the wings and outboard and under the wings. The improvement became standard on all aircraft after March 1969, and a retrofit was provided for active aircraft. Boeing fixed the drag issue by introducing new longer nacelle/wing fairings, and improved the airflow over the flaps and slats. The production line also introduced an improvement to the flap system, allowing increased use during takeoff and landing. All these changes gave the aircraft a boost to payload and range, and improved short-field performance. In May 1971, after aircraft #135, all improvements, including more powerful engines and a greater fuel capacity, were incorporated into the 737-200, giving it a 15% increase in payload and range over the original -200s. This became known as the 737-200 Advanced, which became the production standard in June 1971.|$|E
25|$|The F28 {{was similar}} in design to the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven and Douglas DC-9, {{as it had}} a T-tail and engines mounted {{at the rear of}} the fuselage. The {{aircraft}} had wings with a slight crescent angle of sweep with ailerons at the tip, simple flaps, and five-section liftdumper only operated after landing to dump the lift. These were employed rather than reverse thrust as the designers felt that doing so not only reduced weight, but maintenance also. Having no reversers also meant that on unpaved airstrips there was less chance of the engines ingesting debris. The leading edge was fixed (although one experimental model had leading edge slats and these were offered as an option) and was anti-iced by bleed air from the engines. The tail cone could split and be hydraulically opened to the sides to act as a variable air brake â€“ also used on the contemporaneous Blackburn Buccaneer. This design was also used on the HS-146, which became the BAe-146. The design is unique in that it not only slows the aircraft down rapidly, it can aid in rapid descents from economic cruising altitudes and also allowed the engines to be set at higher RPM which helped eliminate 'lag time'. This means the engines respond faster if needed for sudden speed increases or go-arounds on the approach to landing. The Fellowship had a retractable tricycle landing gear which used large low pressure tyres enabling the use of unpaved airstrips. Large <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes</b> also helped in shortening the landing run.|$|E

500|$|The Victor had fully {{duplicated}} powered controls; many of {{the flight}} controls and flight surfaces were designed with redundancies. Pilot control movements were transmitted via a low-friction mechanical system. This setup was developed to provide, amongst other capabilities, a level of artificial feel to the pilot. Eight separated hydraulic circuits were present on the aircraft, which comprised the alighting gear, flaps, nose flaps, air brakes, bomb doors, <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes,</b> nose-wheel steering, and the ram-air turbine scoops. An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2, electrical reliability being noticeably improved.|$|E
500|$|The crew {{realised}} {{that the}} aircraft would {{not last long}} enough to enable a landing back on 28L, and declared a Mayday. Davis cleared the aircraft to land on runway 05R, which was [...] long. He also instructed two other aircraft to perform a go-around, as runway 05R crossed runway 28R, which they were due to land on and Davis {{did not know whether}} Flight 712 would be able to stop before reaching that runway. The crew accepted Davis's offer of runway 05R, even though it was much shorter and not equipped with ILS. Taylor was able to safely land the aircraft on 05R, using <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes</b> and reversing the outboard engines' thrust to halt the aircraft. [...] The aircraft touched down about [...] beyond the threshold and stopped in [...] [...] Taylor asked Davis for permission to evacuate, but the cabin crew were already opening the emergency doors. The flight crew started the fire drill, but the port wing exploded before this could be completed. As a result, the fire shut off handles were not pulled, and the booster pumps and electrical supply were left switched on. Due to the short period of time between the Mayday being declared at 15:29 and the aircraft landing at 15:31, {{there was no time for}} the emergency services to lay a carpet of foam, which was standard practice at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} the Short Tucano, the EMB-312S is an uprated, licence-produced trainer version built at Short Brothers of Belfast in Northern Ireland [...] for the Royal Air Force and {{licensed}} for export. The type features a more powerful Honeywell 820kW (1,100 shp) allied signal TPE331-12B engine with four-blade, variable-pitch propeller, custom avionics, structural strengthening expanding fatigue life to 12,000hr, two-piece canopy for better bird strike proofing, pressurized cabin, a ventral airbrake, aerodynamic changes to the wing, better <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes,</b> and an optional armament capability.|$|E
25|$|On any {{bike with}} only rear <b>wheel</b> <b>braking,</b> the maximum {{deceleration}} is {{significantly lower than}} on a bike equipped with a front brake. As a vehicle brakes, weight can be transferred towards the front wheel {{and away from the}} rear, decreasing the amount of grip the rear wheel has. Transferring the rider's weight back increases rear <b>wheel</b> <b>braking</b> efficiency, but a front wheel fitted with an ordinary brake might provide 70% or more of the braking power when braking hard.|$|R

25|$|Track {{bicycles}} do {{not have}} brakes, because all riders ride {{in the same direction}} around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear <b>wheel</b> <b>brake,</b> but not as effective as a front <b>wheel</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{upper wing}} was {{well above the}} {{fuselage}}, braced to it by two pairs of V-form struts on either side; two single struts from the same points on the upper fuselage braced each lower wing. [...] The pilot sat below the wing leading edge and the observer, equipped with a Lewis gun, sat well aft. [...] The split-axle undercarriage allowed torpedo dropping from under the aircraft and was fitted with <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes</b> as its shipborne role required, together with an arrestor hook and tailwheel. [...] The Buzzard's underslung radiator was positioned between the forward undercarriage legs.|$|E
2500|$|The first design {{from the}} Detroit-based Stinson Aircraft Syndicate was the Stinson SB-1 Detroiter, a four-seat cabin biplane with novel {{features}} such as cabin heating, individual <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes</b> and electric starter for the nose-mounted 220hp (164kW) Wright J-5 Whirlwind engine. The Harley Davidson brakes were demonstrated on a snowy maiden flight requiring wheel chains {{to be added to}} prevent skidding. This [...] aircraft was soon developed into the six-seat Stinson SM-1D Detroiter, a braced high-wing monoplane version which made its first flight on 25 January 1926. The aircraft was soon a success and it enabled Stinson to get $150,000 in public capital to incorporate the Stinson Aircraft Corporation on 4 May 1926.|$|E
2500|$|On August 19, 2015 {{the team}} {{announced}} that they had completed their first successful test flight of the replica aircraft. Its handling characteristics were [...] "as expected" [...] by the team, and it achieved a maximum altitude of 100 feet (30 meters) AGL at a maximum speed of 110 knots (200km/h). On landing though the plane [...] "floated much more than anticipated" [...] and landed significantly farther down the runway than intended. Because of this the <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes</b> needed {{to be applied to}} keep from overrunning the end of the runway. Subsequently the right brake failed, sending the aircraft into the muddy soil adjacent to the runway, tipping it up in its nose and generating a prop and spinner strike. In October it made a successful flight.|$|E

2500|$|All metal with fabric covering, the G.4/31 {{was a large}} single-engined single-bay biplane, with unswept, unequal-span {{wings of}} marked stagger. [...] Both wings carried ailerons and the upper planes had leading edge slots; both wings were cut back to the rear spar at the centre section for visibility. [...] A pair of struts braced the two lower wing spars to the upper fuselage, from where another pair braced the upper rear spars; a {{separate}} pair of struts linked the forward spars of the upper wings to the forward fuselage. [...] There was a split axle undercarriage, necessary for torpedo launching, [...] with its main legs connected to the front spar below the fuselage struts and braced for and aft to the lower fuselage. [...] Main <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes</b> were fitted.|$|E
2500|$|In road vehicles, {{the parking}} brake, also called hand brake, {{emergency}} brake, [...] or e-brake, {{is used to}} keep the vehicle stationary {{and in many cases}} also perform an emergency stop. Parking brakes on older vehicles often consist of a cable connected to two <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes</b> at one end and the other end to a pulling mechanism which is operated with the driver's hand or foot. The mechanism may be a hand-operated lever, at floor level beside the driver, or a straight pull handle located near the steering column, or a (foot-operated) pedal located beside the drivers leg. In most automobiles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking. Some automobiles have the parking brake operate on the front wheels, for example most Citroens manufactured since the end of World War II.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were given}} marks for four tasks: speed over {{two sets of}} five laps, slow speed flying and {{take off and landing}} distances. Only the Wee Bee and the Brownie, both Cherub engined, had the reliability to complete the speed tests, in which the Wee Bee achieved 70.1mph (112.8km/h), about 5mph faster than the Bristol. [...] It flew at just under 40mph (64km/h) and took off to clear a 6ft (1.83 m) barrier with a run of 705ft (215 m). [...] Given the Wee Bee's clean aerodynamics it was not surprising to find it took to greatest distance to pull up at landing; <b>wheel</b> <b>brakes</b> were not fitted. [...] Despite the long landing, the Wee Bee ended the competition well ahead in marks of the Brownie, its nearest rival, winning the Air Ministry first prize of Â£2,000.|$|E
