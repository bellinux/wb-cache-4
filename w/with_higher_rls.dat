40|$|In {{the field}} of {{immobilization}} of actinides in phosphate-based ceramics, several thorium and uranium doped britholite samples were submitted to leaching tests. The normalized dissolution rates determined for several pH values, temperatures and acidic media from the calcium release range from 4. 7 × 10 − 2 g m− 2 d− 1 to 21. 6 g m− 2 d− 1. Their comparison with that determined for phosphorus, thorium and uranium revealed that the dissolution is clearly incongruent for all the conditions examined. Whatever the leaching solution considered, calcium and phosphorus elements were always released <b>with</b> <b>higher</b> <b>RL</b> values than the other elements (Nd, Th, U). Simultaneously, thorium was found to quickly precipitate as alteration product, leading to diffusion phenomena for uranium. For all the media considered, the uranium release is {{higher than that of}} thorium, probably due to its oxidation from tetravalent oxidation state to uranyl. Moreover, the evaluation of the partial order related to proton concentration and the apparent energy of activation suggest that the reaction of dissolution is probably controlled by surface chemical reactions occurring at the solid/liquid interface. Finally, comparative leaching tests performed in sulphuric acid solutions revealed a significant influence of such media on the chemical durability of the leached pellets, leading to higher normalized dissolution rates for all the elements considered. On the basis of the results of chemical speciation, this difference was mainly explained in the light of higher complexion constants by sulfate ions compared to nitrate, chloride and phosphate...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{inoculum}} (rumen liquor - RL vs faeces - FA) from cow or buffalo {{with respect}} to feed evaluation using in vitro gas systems was estimated in a trial using 8 substrates. The substrate influenced significantly all fermentation characteristics; with each inoculum the substrates were ranked according the same trends for organic matter digestibility (dOM) and cumulative gas volume per gram of OM incubated (OMCV). The animal species affected dOM and OMCV which were significantly higher in buffalo and cow, respectively. Buffalo showed significantly higher values of acetic, propionic, butyric acids and total VFA, while isobutyric, isovaleric and valeric acids were higher in cow. The inocula influenced the fermentation characteristics in both species: while in cow all parameters, except OMCV, were <b>higher</b> <b>with</b> FA than <b>RL,</b> in buffalo dOM, OMCV, acetic and total VFAs were <b>higher</b> <b>with</b> <b>RL.</b> The results confirmed the lower cellulolytic activity of FA micropopulation than RL one.

40|$|In {{context of}} {{conservation}} agriculture, various soil properties modifications including phosphorus (P) stratification along soil profile induced by no-till practice (NT) might affect crop root development. This study aimed to investigate tillage and P fertilization effects on root distribution and morphology {{of corn and}} soybean. A field corn-soybean rotation experiment established in 1992 at l’Acadie is a split-plot design (4 replicates) with tillage (moldboard plough (MP) and NT) and P fertilization (0 (0 P), 17. 5 (0. 5 P) and 35 (1 P) kg P·ha- 1 every two years) as main and sub-plot factors. Soils and corn roots were sampled in 2014 at silking stage by collecting soil cores to 60 -cm depth (0 - 5, 5 - 10, and every 10 cm) at 5, 15 and 25 cm perpendicularly to the row. Soybean roots were sampled in 2015 at flowering stage. Root length (RL) was determined with WinRHIZO. Corn root length density (RLD) was higher in MP (1. 48 cm·cm- 3) than in NT (1. 28 cm·cm- 3). 0 P and 0. 5 P treatments (1. 29 and 1. 23 cm·cm- 3, respectively) significantly reduced RLD compared to 1 P (1. 62 cm·cm- 3). Corn roots mostly accumulated at 0 - 5 and 5 - 10 cm. Tillage and P fertilization {{had no effect on}} corn root vertical distribution. However, tillage had significant effects on soybean root vertical partition. Soybean in NT had a RLD of 1. 95 cm·cm- 3 on average; and roots mostly accumulated at 0 - 10 cm with 44 % of total RL. MP had lower RLD (1. 55 cm·cm- 3), <b>with</b> the <b>highest</b> <b>RL</b> proportion (36 %) at 10 - 20 cm. Additionally, soybean had relatively higher RLDs in 0 P and 0. 5 P than 1 P. Compared to corn, the higher proportion of soybean roots in top layers in NT might indicate a higher sensibility of soybean roots to the soil P stratification. While the reduction of corn roots in NT could be more related to a higher weed competition...|$|R

30|$|Recently, SSF {{has built}} up {{reliability}} in many industries and has evolved as an interesting substitute to SLF (Singhania et al. 2009). Severe foaming problems usually result from the production of biosurfactants in SLF and therefore, researches have suggested their production in SSF. Of these biosurfactants, RLs {{have been the most}} attractive for their production in SSF in recent years. The present work aimed at the optimization of the fermentation conditions for RL production in SSF. Twelve different solid substrates or combinations of solid substrates were screened for the production of RLs by the hyperproducing mutant 15 GR using GMSM as the impregnating solution. Selection of an appropriate substrate is an important feature of SSF since it acts as both a source of nutrients and a physical support (Pandey 2003). As shown in the results, the <b>highest</b> <b>RL</b> level was obtained with the mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal. Sugarcane bagasse, a porous residue obtained from cane stalks after the juice extraction from sugarcane (Soccol et al. 2010) consists chiefly of cellulose and hemicelluloses, lignin, nitrogenous compounds, and ash (Abdullah et al. 2006). Sunflower seed meal is obtained by grinding sunflower seeds which are rich in lipids, carbohydrates and proteins (Alberton et al. 2010). The <b>high</b> <b>RL</b> levels obtained using this mixture {{may be due to the}} fact that oils usually stimulate RL production, as reported in previous SLF studies (Benincasa and Accorsini 2008; Costa et al. 2006; Trummler et al. 2003). Another explanation may be that the mixture of substrates resulted in a substrate bed with properties superior to single substrates. Using sunflower seed meal alone caused the solid substrate to compact considerably probably due to its high lipid content. Sugarcane bagasse acts as a bulking agent, improving the substrate bed properties (Alberton et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|Superparamagnetic {{carbon-based}} nanostructures {{are presented}} as contrast agents (CAs) for advanced imaging applications such as cellular and molecular imaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Gadolinium-loaded, ultra-short single-walled carbon nanotubes (gadonanotubes; GNTs) are shown to have extremely <b>high</b> <b>rl</b> relaxivities (contrast enhancement efficacy), especially at low-magnetic field strengths. The inherent lipophilicity of GNTs provides them the ability to image cells at low magnetic field strength. A carboxylated dextran-coated GNT (GadoDex) has been synthesized and proposed as a new biocompatible high-performance MRI CA. The rl relaxivity is ca. 20 times greater than for other paramagnetic Gd-based CAs. This enhanced relaxivity for GadoDex {{is due to the}} synergistic effects of an increased molecular tumbling time ('tR) and a faster proton exchange rate ('tm). GNTs also exhibit very large transverse relaxivities (r 2) at high magnetic fields ~ 3 T). The dependence of the transverse relaxation rates (especially R 2 *) of labeled cells on GNT concentration offers the possibility to quantify cell population in vivo using R 2 * mapping.

30|$|Since {{major changes}} {{have been made in}} the {{fermentation}} conditions for RL production, the time course profile was repeated, using the optimized conditions reached (a 50 : 50 mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal, an impregnating solution of 20  ml containing 5 %(v/v) glycerol, inoculum size 1 %v/v, pH 8 and incubation temperature of 30  °C). Again, maximum RL production was obtained after 10  days of incubation, however, the RL level this time was about 1.5 fold higher than results obtained in the previous time course study, reaching 46.85  g/l-IS. The obtained value was also about 5.5 folds higher than that obtained using SLF carried out in this study. Moreover, this RL level was obtained in a shorter time than most studies reported so far. In 2008, a maximum RL production of 46  g/l-IS (172  g/kg-IDS) by P. aeruginosa UFPEDA 614 in SSF using a 50 : 50 mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal with 37.5  ml of impregnating solution containing 10 % v/v glycerol after 12  days was reported (Camilios-Neto et al. 2008). Although our RL yield is comparable with this value when expressed in terms of g/l-IS, our yield expressed in terms of g/kg of solid substrate showed lower values. This may be explained by the smaller volume of impregnating solution used in our study. Moreover, in 2011, the <b>highest</b> <b>RL</b> production of 45  g/l-IS was obtained by the same strain after 12  days of SSF using sugarcane bagasse and corn bran (1 : 1), and an impregnating solution of 35  ml containing 6 % (v/v) of each of glycerol and soybean oil (Camilios-Neto et al. 2011). Therefore, in our study, the mutant 15 GR yielded comparable RL concentrations that were reached in less time and using lower concentrations of carbon source than both these studies. Moreover, although maximum RL concentrations were obtained after 10 days of incubation, <b>high</b> <b>RL</b> levels were already achieved (41.87  g/l-IS (83.74  g/kg-IDS)) by the mutant 15 GR after only 6 days of incubation, unlike Camilios-Neto et al. (2008), whose RL yields reached only about 24  g/l-IS (89  g/kg-IDS) after 6 days of incubation. In addition, in 2017, maximum RL yields of 18.7  g/l was obtained using glycerol as carbon source and rapeseed/wheat bran as matrix (Wu et al. 2017). Our study hence presents an appropriate basis for subsequent studies on RL production using SSF. In conclusion, these results showed that the application of BBD and RSM were successful in enhancing the RL production under SSF by 67 % and a maximum RL concentration of 46.85  g/l-IS was obtained in the present study using a mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal after only 10  days of incubation. Optimum fermentation conditions were found to be an inoculum size of 1 %v/v, a temperature of 30  °C and a pH of 8. These results suggest that SSF may possibly be a feasible substitute for SLF to produce RLs since our maximum yield was comparable with values that have been obtained in SLF: 23.6  g/l (Noh et al. 2014), 32  g/l (Matsufuji et al. 1997), 36.7  g/l (Muller et al. 2011), and 46  g/l (Linhardt et al. 1989). These findings imply that RL production by P. aeruginosa 15 GR in static tray bioreactors may be successful (Durand 2003). Additional concern to the application of SSF for RL production is hence justified for enhancing RL levels in laboratory-scale work even further and for moving up to pilot scale.|$|R
