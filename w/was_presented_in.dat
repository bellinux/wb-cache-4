5|$|A play, The Automaton Chess Player, <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> New York City in 1845. The advertising, {{as well as}} {{an article}} that {{appeared}} in The Illustrated London News, claimed that the play featured Kempelen's Turk, but it was in fact a copy of the Turk created by J. Walker, who had earlier presented the Walker Chess-player.|$|E
5|$|After this {{construction}} was complete, {{there were still}} more calls to further develop the site, and especially to provide facilities for education about the wars. A $62million proposal <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members, and ran into significant funding problems when the Federal Government decided not to provide funding.|$|E

Bedell said that it was unbelievable for the United States to settle disputes with war, and he said that an Iraq war would be similar to the Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|Bayreuth lifted its {{monopoly}} on Parsifal on 1 January 1914 in the Teatro Comunale di Bologna in Bologna with Giuseppe Borgatti. Some opera houses began their performances at midnight between 31 December 1913 and 1 January. The first authorized performance was staged at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona: it began at 10:30pm Barcelona time, {{which was an}} hour behind Bayreuth. Such was the demand for Parsifal that it <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> more than 50 European opera houses between 1 January and 1 August 1914.|$|E
5|$|Buckner had a keen {{interest}} in politics and friends had been urging him to run for governor since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate these terms, he instructed a friend to withdraw his name from consideration if it <b>was</b> <b>presented.</b> <b>In</b> 1868, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention that nominated Horatio Seymour for president. Though Buckner had favored George H. Pendleton, he loyally supported the party's nominee throughout the campaign.|$|E

5|$|In 1858, the {{government}} lifted the licensing {{restrictions on the}} number of performers, and Offenbach was able to present more ambitious works. His first full-length operetta, Orphée aux enfers ("Orpheus in the Underworld"), <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> October 1858. Offenbach, as usual, spent freely on the production, with scenery by Gustave Doré, lavish costumes, a cast of twenty principals, and a large chorus and orchestra.|$|E

5|$|In London, {{figure skating}} <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's special figures, and mixed pairs. The special figures contest was won by Russian Nikolai Panin, who gave his country its first ever Olympic gold medal. He remains the event's sole winner, {{as it was}} {{subsequently}} dropped from the program. Once a demonstration event at Grenoble 1968, ice dancing has been an official medal-awarding Olympic figure skating event since it was introduced in 1976.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, {{approaches}} to Handel in German and English-speaking countries diverged further. In Leipzig in 1856, the musicologist Friedrich Chrysander and the literary historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus founded the Deutsche Händel-Gesellschaft {{with the aim}} of publishing authentic editions of all Handel's works. At the same time, performances in Britain and the United States moved away from Handel's performance practice with increasingly grandiose renditions. Messiah <b>was</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> New York in 1853 with a chorus of 300 and in Boston in 1865 with more than 600.|$|E

5|$|The company's {{traditional}} {{preference for}} the Italian repertoire was partly redressed during the decade: productions include WNO's first staging of a Richard Strauss opera, Elektra, in 1978.
