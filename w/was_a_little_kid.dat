500|$|Illmatic {{contains}} discerning {{treatment of}} its subject matter: gang rivalries, desolation, and {{the ravages of}} urban poverty. Nas, who was twenty years old when the album was released, focuses on depicting his own experiences, creating highly detailed first-person narratives that deconstruct the troubled life of an inner city teenager. One writer describes {{the theme of the}} album as a “tory of a gifted writer born into squalor, trying to claw {{his way out of the}} trap. It's somewhere between The Basketball Diaries and Native Son….” The narratives featured in Illmatic originate from Nas's own experiences as an adolescent growing up in Queensbridge, as the lyrics allude to the housing projects located in the Long Island City-section of Queens, New York. Nas said in an interview in 2001: “When I made Illmatic I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> in Queensbridge trapped in the ghetto. My soul was trapped in Queensbridge projects.” In a 2012 interview, he explained his inspiration for exploring this subject matter: ...|$|E
500|$|Mulan {{served as}} Wen's first voice-acting role. In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me. I loved using my imagination. I felt like I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written to humanize Sawyer {{and set up}} the love {{triangle}} between him, Kate and Jack. Kate was meant to look at Sawyer in a new way, and, according to Lindelof, think, [...] "wow, this guy is not just a belligerent." [...] The episode also shows the moral ambiguity of some characters by revealing more of their personalities, with the ones introduced as protagonists doing things that are generally not viewed as protagonist-like– an example being Jack beating Sawyer and eventually asking Sayid to torture him; and an antagonistic character, Sawyer, proving not to be solely antagonist-like– an example being his backstory and flashback, which show that he is not exclusively evil. Lindelof explained that he wanted Sawyer to [...] "come out of his shell a little, and say to the audience, 'you're supposed to like this guy'", further explaining, [...] "the root of him being an asshole is that these horrible things happened to him when he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid,</b> and he's really really angry." ...|$|E
500|$|After Thomas G. W. Settle's record {{flight in}} the Piccards Century of Progress, the balloon was again {{returned}} to the Piccards, who decided to fly it to the stratosphere on their own. Jean would concentrate on the science, while Jeannette would pilot the balloon. DeVorkin wrote that, [...] "Energetic and forceful, {{she seemed to have}} a better chance of obtaining a pilot's license than Jean, who was preoccupied with restoring the gondola and balloon and convincing scientists to provide instruments to fly". She studied at Ford Airport in Dearborn, Michigan under Edward J. Hill, a balloonist and Gordon Bennett Cup winner, who agreed to serve as flight director for the Piccards' planned stratospheric flight. Henry Ford offered the use of his hangar and brought Orville Wright (with his brother Wilbur, inventor of the airplane and first human to fly a heavier-than-air powered aircraft) to observe a flight of Jeannette's in 1933. Her son Don was a crew member that day and shook hands with Wright, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>kid</b> and he [...] attention to me." [...] On June 16, 1934, Jeannette flew her first solo flight. Later that year, the National Aeronautic Association made her the first woman licensed balloon pilot in the U.S. Auguste wrote to Jean in June 1934, [...] "Hopefully you will make your flight ahead of other competitors. It would be nice, if the name of Piccard through Jeannette, would once more be placed on the record list of the F.A.I." ...|$|E

Her father was in advertising and her mother was a nurse. She was the youngest of three children, including a brother, Martin Briggs (keyboardist for 1960s Boston band The Remains), and a sister, Jann Smith.

In this study, I am interested in analyzing the development of the main character from a weak person to a tough person. In the analysis, I use literary approach consisting of the theories of characterization and conflict. From the analysis, I find out that the main character's previous experience makes her become a weak person. In solving her problem, the main character faces several conflicts, both external conflict and internal conflict, which eventually help her to develop from a weak person into a tough person. Her internal conflict can be seen when the main character, Pilar gets confused whether she is willing to take risk or not. Also, her external conflict can be shown when Pilar defends her decision to serve God together with her childhood friend to the padre. After going through these conflicts, Pilar has changed from a weak person into a tough person.
