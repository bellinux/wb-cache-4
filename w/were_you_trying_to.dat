6000|$|Nick {{went out}} of the house and stayed away for two or three hours, quite ready to regard the place as quieter and safer without him. He haunted the abbey as usual and sat a long time in its {{simplifying}} stillness, turning over many things. He came back again at the luncheon-hour, through the garden, and heard, somewhat to his surprise and greatly to his relief, that his host had composed himself promptly enough after their agitating interview. Mrs. Lendon talked at luncheon much as if she expected her brother to be, as she said, really quite fit again. She asked Nick no awkward question; which was uncommonly good of her, he thought, considering that she might have said, [...] "What in the world <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get out of him?" [...] She only reported to our young man that the invalid had every hope of a short interview about half-past seven, a very short one: this gentle emphasis was Mrs. Lendon's single tribute to the critical spirit. Nick divined that Mr. Carteret's desire for further explanations was really strong and had been capable of sustaining him through a bad morning, capable even of helping him--it would have been a secret and wonderful momentary conquest of weakness--to pass it off for a good one. He wished he might make a sketch of him, from the life, as he had seen him after breakfast; he had a conviction he could make a strong one, which would be a precious memento. But he shrank from proposing this--the dear man might think it unparliamentary. The doctor had called while Nick was out, and he came again at five o'clock without that inmate's seeing him. The latter was busy in his room at that hour: he wrote a short letter which took him a long time. But apparently there had been no veto on a resumption of talk, for at half-past seven his friend sent for him. The nurse at the door said, [...] "Only a moment, I hope, sir?" [...] but took him in and then withdrew.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Half of pregnancies in the United States are {{unintended}}. We {{examine a}} novel {{risk factor for}} unintended pregnancies, impulsivity. We hypothesize that women with higher nonplanning impulsivity {{will be more likely}} to have an unplanned pregnancy. Methods: The parent study was a prospective cohort study of 125 pregnant women examining the association between impulsivity and weight gain during pregnancy. At an in-person study visit, women completed self-report measures via a secure web form. The 15 -item Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS- 15) measures impulsivity using subjective statements about the respondent’s behavior with 4 response options: rarely/never, occasionally, often, and almost always/always. Three subscales with 5 questions each measure attention, motor, and nonplanning impulsivity. We categorized women as being less impulsive (subscale score of 5 - 10) versus more impulsive (11 - 20). We chose this cutoff as a score of 10 indicates responses of “never/rarely” or “occasionally”, representing lower impulsivity. Pregnancy intention was measured by asking women “When you got pregnant, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get pregnant?” (yes or no). Results: 34 % reported that the current pregnancy was unplanned. 10 % of women had high motor impulsivity, 21 % high attention impulsivity, and 32 % high nonplanning impulsivity. Women who were aged 18 - 24, obese, less educated, not married, of a lower socioeconomic status, and multigravid were more likely to have higher nonplanning impulsivity. 51 % with high nonplanning impulsivity reported unplanned pregnancy compared to 25 % (low nonplanning impulsivity). Women with high nonplanning impulsivity had 3. 53 times the odds of unplanned pregnancy compared to women with low nonplanning impulsivity (adjusted for other 2 subscales and confounders; 95 % CI: 1. 23 - 10. 14). Neither motor nor attention impulsivity was associated with pregnancy intention. Conclusions: Women with higher levels of nonplanning impulsivity are at higher risk of having unplanned pregnancies. The 5 -item nonplanning subscale of the BIS- 15 may help to identify women with high nonplanning impulsivity clinically; women could complete this brief measure prior to office visits, and these scores could direct contraception counseling. Contraception that requires little maintenance and no decision-making at the time of sexual encounters, such as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), may potentially lower unplanned pregnancy rates among more impulsive women. Further research should focus on creating a framework to identify these women, implementing a screening tool in the clinical setting, and to explore whether increasing LARC use in this population can lower unplanned pregnancy rates...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on {{problems}} of the sexting {{as a form of}} cyber-bullying in adolescent children. The sexting is a new phenomenon that arose from two English words "sex" and "text". This is about sending nude photos by a mobile phone or via an internet. The Czech street work association defines sexting as: "electronic dissemination of text messages, your own photos or your own videos with sexual content, occurs in the environment of virtual electronic media the internet in particular. Between platforms that allow the dissemination of these materials include nowadays in particular social networks-Facebook, Myspace, Libimseti. cz or digital photo storage Rajce. cz. " (43) Mostly girls or boys to take and send a photo or video to an opposite sex, to get their attention. However, do not realize that photographs can be send on and stop it can be very difficult. These children eventually adolescents become victims of cyber-bullying which is defined by Price and Dalgleish as: "the collective designation forms of bulling through electronic media such as the internet and mobile phones, which are used to aggressive and international damage to the users of media. As well as traditional bullying and cyberbullying involves recurring behavior and disparity of power between the aggressor and the victim. " (15, s. 20). Also in the Bachelor thesis I limit the teen age as: "Teenage period includes the age between the 11 th and the 15 th year, therefore, compulsory school attendance on the second level. It {{is often referred to as}} puberty or pubescence. " (33, s. 27). This work is divided into a theoretical part and a research part. The main aim of the practical part the most it is to determine whether it met the teenage children of the sexting, which was a form of cyber-bullying. A further aim is also to find out in which age groups, adolescents, is the most sexing appears. The practical part is processed by a method of quantitative research. Those that meet the parameters were included in the draw. After that I called the order in selected schools. In the case of a refusal, I continued further in the draw until I received the required number of schools, which then conducted data collection using printed questionnaires in classrooms on the 2 nd level of primary schools. Finally, there were selected 9 elementary schools in the district České Budějovice. The primary schools were divided into 3 groups based on where they were located: City, town, village. The questionnaire was fulfilled by 685 respondents. The evaluation of results was done in the STATA software 12. Method of verification of hypotheses ran in a Chi-trimester test of a good match. H 1 : Teenagers are confronted also with sexting, which is a form of a Cyber -bullying related and there was focused research questions No. 5 : Have you ever taken a photo or a record yourself partially or completely undressed? 9. Have you ever taken a photo or record someone partially or totally stripped (naked) ? 11. Have someone send you a material, where he (she) is partially or completely stripped? 13. <b>Were</b> <b>you</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> embarrass someone by this kind of material? Have you share photos or videos of your friends where they were partially undressed sometimes? This hypothesis has been confirmed. H 2 : Teenagers, who sexting are aware of a less risk than children who do not sexting. For this hypothesis include the question No. 18. Are you aware of the risk, what brings the sending of photos or videos over the internet? I rejected this hypothesis right at the beginning, since the research has shown that the children do not practise sexting such an extent to determine the statistical significance of these two variables. H 3 : Pupils of the 9 th classes are practising sexting more that pupils of the 6 th classes. The research questions related to the H 3 were: the 2 nd: Do you visit the 6 th, the 7 th, the 8 th, the 9 th class? This hypothesis has been confirmed...|$|E
