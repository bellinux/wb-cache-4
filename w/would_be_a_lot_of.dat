[...] According to Brice Ezell of PopMatters, [...] "for whatever reason [...] never gets off of the ground." [...] Lydia Jenkin of New Zealand Herald opined that the song <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sexier without the overpowering bass pulses in its production and [...] "some odd lyrics".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the setting, {{part of the original}} concept for the show was that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> advanced technology similar to that seen in Star Trek, but it would be constantly malfunctioning. The automatic doors at Applied Cryogenics resemble those in however, they malfunction when Fry remarks on this similarity. In another twist, the two policemen who try to arrest Fry at the head museum use weapons which are visually similar to lightsabers used in the Star Wars film series; however, they are functionally more similar to nightsticks. The interaction between the characters was not overlooked. The relationship formed between Fry and Bender in this episode has been compared to the relationship between Will Robinson and the robot in Lost in Space.|$|E
500|$|For Pink Friday, Minaj created another alter ego: Roman Zolanski, [...] "a demon inside her", Minaj's [...] "twin brother" [...] whose {{character}} she assumes {{when she}} is angry. Roman {{has been compared to}} Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady, and on [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] Minaj and Eminem collaborate as their alter egos. On her next album, she said that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Roman: [...] "And if you're not familiar with Roman, then you will be familiar with him very soon. He's the boy that lives inside of me. He's a lunatic and he's gay and he'll be on there a lot." [...] Roman has a mother, Martha Zolanski, who appeared on [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] with a British accent and singing on [...] "Roman Holiday" [...] for the first time. Martha appeared in the [...] "Moment 4 Life" [...] video as Minaj's apparent fairy godmother. Although Minaj was rapping in songs such as [...] "All I Do Is Win (Remix)", she promised to introduce Nicki, Roman and Onika on her first album.|$|E

500|$|Aden and Belle are {{involved}} in a storyline where the school's formal is set on fire. Belle becomes trapped and her injuries have [...] "consequences that change their relationship" [...] forever. Lasance had previously been in caught up in a real house fire; he said the director of the episode [...] "milked" [...] the fictional situation to make it seem more dramatic than a real fire. He also stated that in the months following there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> [...] "tense moments" [...] between the pair. Aden and Belle can acknowledge what they have found in each other - so [...] "it would be hard to split them up". After the attack and fire, Belle refuses to leave the hospital, even with Aden supporting her, because it is the only place she [...] "feels secure". Belle is prescribed with painkillers to help combat her anxiety disorder. However she becomes addicted to them. Tovey said she does not want Aden to know because of the [...] "shame" [...] and she doesn't want him to know she has failed. She further explained that [...] "addicts withdraw from those around them - which is exactly what she is doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Before 20th Century Fox gave Alien vs. Predator the greenlight, Aliens writer/{{director}} James Cameron {{had been}} working on a story for a fifth Alien film. Alien director Ridley Scott had talked with Cameron, stating [...] "I think it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun, {{but the most important thing}} is to get the story right." [...] In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's film Prometheus (2012). On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator, Cameron believed the film would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise" [...] and ceased work on his story, [...] "To me, that was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf. It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." [...] After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, Cameron remarked that [...] "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." [...] Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, [...] "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step." [...] Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to Aliens.|$|E

6000|$|He {{sat with}} {{compressed}} lips. The {{idea of going}} for news straight to the shop lacked charm. His notion was that Verloc’s shop might have been turned already into a police trap. They will be bound to make some arrests, he thought, with something resembling virtuous indignation, for the even tenor of his revolutionary life was menaced by no fault of his. And yet unless he went there he ran the risk of remaining in ignorance of what {{perhaps it would be}} very material for him to know. Then he reflected that, if the man in the park had been so very much blown to pieces as the evening papers said, he could not have been identified. And if so, the police could have no special reason for watching Verloc’s shop more closely than any other place known to be frequented by marked anarchists—no more reason, in fact, than for watching the doors of the Silenus.

Before we board the train I will get you all to go and sit at the windows at the other side. If you will bring your friends up I will introduce them to their messmates on the trip. As soon as we have all entered, we shall be at the window saying good-by to our friends, and no one will catch sight of you.

When we did I heard them saying to each other, 'Well, I thought we would come down overboard, in a lump--sticks and all--blame me if I didn't.' 'That's what I was thinking to myself,' would answer wearily another battered and bandaged scarecrow. And, mind, these were men without the drilled-in habit of obedience. To an onlooker they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> profane scallywags without a redeeming point. What made them do it--what made them obey me when I, thinking consciously how fine it was, made them drop the bunt of the foresail twice {{to try and do}} it better? What? They had no professional reputation--no examples, no praise. It wasn't a sense of duty; they all knew well enough how to shirk, and laze, and dodge--when they had a mind to it--and mostly they had. Was it the two pounds ten a month that sent them there? They didn't think their pay half good enough. No; it was something in them, something inborn and subtle and everlasting. I don't say positively that the crew of a French or German merchantman wouldn't have done it, but I doubt whether it would have been done in the same way. There was a completeness in it, something solid like a principle, and masterful like an instinct--a disclosure of something secret--of that hidden something, that gift, of good or evil that makes racial difference, that shapes the fate of nations.|$|E
