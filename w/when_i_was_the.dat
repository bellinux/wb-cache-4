500|$|In 1999, William Broyles, Jr. {{turned down}} the chance to write the script, but decided to sign on [...] "when I found out I could have an {{extensive}} amount of creative control". Fox projected the release date for July 2001, while Broyles sent the studio an outline and a chronicle of the fictional planet [...] "Aschlar". Entitled The Visitor and billed as [...] "episode one in the Chronicles of Aschlar", Broyles' script {{caught the attention of}} director Tim Burton, who was hired in February 2000. [...] "I wasn't interested in doing a remake or a sequel of the original Planet of the Apes film," [...] Burton said later. [...] "But I was intrigued by the idea of revisiting that world. Like a lot of people, I was affected by the original film. I wanted to do a 're-imagining'." [...] Richard D. Zanuck signed on as producer in March. [...] "This is a very emotional film for me. I greenlighted the original Apes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> head of Fox in 1967." ...|$|E
500|$|On his approach, Cohen {{said that}} he refused to {{consider}} making the film PG-13: [...] "The first thing I said was, 'If you want me, I'm making an R-rated movie. I don't {{want to deal with}} sex and make it, like, for 13-year-olds.' The film took 23 days to shoot. Discussing its micro-budget, Lopez stated: [...] "You know what, we put all four million dollars in front of the camera! We all shared one trailer, we had no craft service, it wasn't that type of luxury movie set, let's say." [...] She also found that the limited budget and filming period was [...] "super intense", saying: [...] "I never had done a film like that in my career. That {{was the first time we}} did that, but it was very liberating as an artist because it made me realize I can make whatever movie I want like this." [...] On filming sex scenes, Guzman said [...] "that was the time in the film <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most uncomfortable. We had to choreograph every piece... It was the most unsexy-really-sexy scene that you'll see on screen." [...] Filming took place throughout fall 2013 in Los Angeles. In December 2013, the film received permit to shoot in Placerita Canyon, Newhall. Some of the remaining scenes were also filmed in April 2014.|$|E
