[...] "You will have to begin this morning by putting up with no other company at breakfast than mine. My sister is in her own room, nursing that essentially feminine malady, a slight headache; and her old governess, Mrs. Vesey, is charitably attending on her with restorative tea. My uncle, Mr. Fairlie, never joins us at any of our meals: he is an invalid, and keeps bachelor state in his own apartments. There is nobody else in the house but me. Two young ladies have been staying here, but they went away yesterday, in despair; and no wonder. All through their visit (in consequence of Mr. Fairlie's invalid condition) we produced no such convenience in the house as a flirtable, danceable, small-talkable creature of the male sex; and the consequence was, we did nothing but quarrel, especially at dinner-time. How can you expect four women to dine together alone every day, and not quarrel? We are such fools, we can't entertain each other at table. You see I don't think much of my own sex, Mr. Hartright--which will you have, tea or coffee?--no woman does think much of her own sex, although few of them confess it as freely as I do. Dear me, you look puzzled. Why? Are you wondering what you will have for breakfast? or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my careless way of talking? In the first case, I advise you, as a friend, to have nothing to do with that cold ham at your elbow, and to wait till the omelette comes in. In the second case, I will give you some tea to compose your spirits, and do all a woman can (which is very little, by-the-bye) to hold my tongue." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nobody {{made any}} {{observation}} on his conduct, out of respect, probably, to Colonel Everard, who bit his lip, but continued silent; aware that censure might extract some escapade more unequivocally {{characteristic of a}} cavalier, from his refractory companion. As silence seemed awkward, and the others made no advances to break it, beyond the ordinary salutation, Colonel Everard at length said, [...] "I presume, gentlemen, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> somewhat <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my arrival here, and thus intruding myself into your meeting?" ...|$|R

"I daresay <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my {{knowing this}} young gentleman," [...] he said, turning to Colonel Cochrane, [...] "but he did my father, the admiral, a great service. He {{and three other}} lads, under his leadership, {{captured}} four {{of the most notorious}} burglars in London, when they were engaged in robbing my father's house. It was a most gallant affair, I can assure you; and the four burglars swung for it, a couple of months later. I have one of the lads as a midshipman, on board my ship; and I offered a berth to Repton but, very wisely, he decided to remain on shore, where his prospects were good." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Chief of British Military {{intelligence}} at the War Office Major General George Macdonogh {{was quoted}} as saying in his lecture in 1919 at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich: You will no doubt remember the great campaign of Lord Allenby in Palestine and perhaps <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> the daring of his actions. Someone who is looking from the side lines, lacking knowledge about the situation, is likely to think that Allenby took unwarranted risks. That is not true. For Allenby knew with certainty from his intelligence (in Palestine) of all the preparations and all the movements of his enemy. All the cards of his enemy were revealed to him, and so he could play his hand with complete confidence. Under these conditions, victory was certain before he began.|$|R
6000|$|... 33. I do {{not doubt}} but that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my saying the arts can {{in their second}} {{function}} only be directed to the perfecting of ethical state, it being our usual impression that they are often destructive of morality. But {{it is impossible to}} direct fine art to an immoral end, except by giving it characters unconnected with its fineness, or by addressing it to persons who cannot perceive it to be fine. Whosoever recognises it is exalted by it. On the other hand, it has been commonly thought that art was a most fitting means for the enforcement of religious doctrines and emotions; whereas there is, as I must presently try to show you, room for grave doubt whether it has not in this function hitherto done evil rather than good.|$|R

Your father and several others {{of us have been}} allies for some time in some very important matters connected with finance. For the last few months, however, we have all felt a sort of vague uneasiness one with the other. Apparently we were all still pulling the same way, yet I think that each one of us had the feeling that there was something wrong. We all began to distrust one another. To come to an end quickly, I hope I do not offend you, Miss Duge, when I say that it is my belief that your father has been and is trying to deceive us for his own benefit." ...|$|R

"I {{dare say}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> this sudden move, {{but you know}} that two {{attempts}} were made upon my life last night, and I have no doubt that these would be repeated, and perhaps with greater success, had I stayed there. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> present yesterday, with two of your men, when we discovered that large portions of the stores were mere dummies filled with earth. Whether or not the governor was a party to the fraud I cannot say, but this morning he had all the storekeepers who were arrested shot, and Colonel Mendez, who was present at the investigation, was murdered during the night. It is evident, therefore, that many people are interested in preventing the discovery we made from getting known. Of course, the soldiers who assisted would be aware of it, but they would not venture to speak, and it is only I and your men and my servant who have still to be silenced.|$|R

I dare say that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my being abroad with my daughter so late, but I believe now that it was a preconcerted plot. It was but ten days before I left London, three weeks since, that I hired a new man. He had papers which showed that he came from Chelmsford, was an honest fellow, and accustomed to the care of horses. I doubt not his credentials were stolen. However, I engaged him, seeing that he appeared just the man I wanted. We journeyed down to Norwich without adventure. There I settled my business with some traders whom I supply with goods, and then journeyed back, stopping always at towns and always before nightfall, as I had a considerable amount of money in my saddle-bags.|$|R
6000|$|... 70. Now {{for direct}} {{confirmation}} of this, I {{want you to}} think over the relation of expression to character in two great masters of the absolute art of language, Virgil and Pope. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> perhaps <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> the last name; and indeed you have in English much higher grasp and melody of language from more passionate minds, but you have nothing else, in its range, so perfect. I name, therefore, these two men, because they are the two most accomplished Artists, merely as such, whom I know in literature; and because I think <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> afterwards interested in investigating how the infinite grace {{in the words of the}} one, and the severity in those of the other, and the precision in those of both, arise wholly out of the moral elements of their minds:--out of the deep tenderness in Virgil which enabled him to write the stories of Nisus and Lausus; and the serene and just benevolence which placed Pope, in his theology, two centuries in advance of his time, and enabled him to sum the law of noble life in two lines which, so far as I know, are the most complete, the most concise, and the most lofty expression of moral temper existing in English words:-- ...|$|R

Tostig, <b>you</b> know, <b>is</b> rash and impetuous. I love him well, but am not blind to his faults; and I fear {{that the people of}} Northumbria have some just cause for complaint against him. He is constantly away from his earldom. He was absent for months when he went to Rome, and he spends a great part of his time either at the court here or with the king at his hunting-lodges. The Northumbrians are a proud people, and it is small wonder that they object to be governed by an absent earl. Tostig is furious at what he terms the insolence of the Northumbrians, and I would fain avoid all questions of dispute with him. It is not improbable that the king and his councillors may be called upon to hear the complaints of the Northumbrians, and to decide between them and Tostig. This will be bitter enough for my brother. He may return at any moment, and I greatly wish to avoid all argument with him before the matter is discussed in council." ...|$|R

"If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> {{not having}} heard from me {{the moment you}} got back, {{attribute}} my silence, in great part--if not altogether--to my own total ignorance of the legal necessity for making another will. Not half an hour since, I was enlightened {{for the first time}} (under circumstances which I will mention when me meet) by my old friend, Mr. Clare. Family anxieties {{have had something to do}} with my silence as well. My wife's confinement is close at hand; and, besides this serious anxiety, my second daughter is just engaged to be married. Until I saw Mr. Clare to-day, these matters so filled my mind that I never thought of writing to you during the one short month which is all that has passed since I got news of your return. Now I know that my will must be made again, I write instantly. For God's sake, come on the day when you receive this--come and relieve me from the dreadful thought that my two darling girls are at this moment unprovided for.

6000|$|... 53. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> perhaps <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my placing in your {{educational}} series, {{as a type}} {{of original}} Italian sculpture, the pulpit by Niccola Pisano in the Duomo of Siena. I would rather, had it been possible, have given the pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in the Duomo of Pisa; but that pulpit is dispersed in fragments through the upper galleries of the Duomo, and the cloister of the Campo Santo; and the casts of its fragments now put together at Kensington are too coarse to be of use to you. You may partly judge, however, of the method of their execution by the eagle's head, which I have sketched from the marble in the Campo Santo (Edu., No. 113), and the lioness with her cubs (Edu., No. 103, more carefully studied at Siena); and I will get you other illustrations in due time. Meanwhile, I want you to compare the main purpose of the Cathedral of Pisa, and its associated Bell Tower, Baptistery, and Holy Field, with the main purpose of the principal building lately raised for the people of London. In these days, we indeed desire no cathedrals; but we have constructed an enormous and costly edifice, which, in claiming educational influence over the whole London populace, and middle class, is verily the Metropolitan cathedral of this century,--the Crystal Palace.|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Dorian Gray, [...] "there {{is nothing}} fearful about it. It {{is one of}} the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or {{faithful}} wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean--middle-class virtue, and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she played--the night you saw her--she acted badly because she had known the reality of love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died. She passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the martyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I <b>was</b> saying, <b>you</b> must not think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment--about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six--you would have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except sentimentalists. And <b>you</b> <b>are</b> awfully unjust, Basil. You come down here to console me. That <b>is</b> charming of <b>you.</b> You find me consoled, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered--I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from the proper artistic point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase. Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp, there is much to be got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my talking to you like this. You have not realised how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I <b>am</b> different, but <b>you</b> must not like me less. I <b>am</b> changed, but <b>you</b> must always <b>be</b> my friend. Of course I am very fond of Harry. But I know that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> better than he <b>is.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> not stronger--you are too much afraid of life--but <b>you</b> <b>are</b> better. And how happy we used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, and don't quarrel with me. I am what I am. There is nothing more to be said." ...|$|R
