50|$|In 1857 native pine {{was used}} to build a tiny, {{primitive}} church, the Moss Hill Methodist Church in Holmes Valley. Hand-planed tongue-and-groove planks were laid down, and <b>wooden</b> <b>nails</b> and square pegs were used in its construction. The pulpit furniture and pews were hand-hewn.|$|R
50|$|The method {{using for}} this fish trap is {{filtration}} where fishes are considered as suspended solids, rectangular knitted sheets {{acts as a}} filter, large <b>wooden</b> <b>nails</b> as a rigid support for entire system. This method for fishing is only applicable for rivers which are free from derbies and other suspended objects.|$|R
5000|$|The ship's {{construction}} and configuration {{has been presented}} using contemporary records from 1774 and 1776 and examination of {{the lower part of}} the ship's hull in situ. [...] According to the records of the time, it was a ship of some 470 tons. [...] The craft was about 121 feet (documents of March 1764) or 127.5 feet (archaeological measurement) long. The oak frame was held together with both iron and <b>wooden</b> <b>nails.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bogoda Wooden Bridge {{was built}} in the 16th century during the Dambadeniya era. This {{is said to be the}} oldest {{surviving}} wooden bridge in Sri Lanka. The bridge is situated at 7 km west of Badulla. All parts of this bridge were constructed from wood, including the use of <b>wooden</b> <b>nails</b> as fixing material. The roof tiles show the influence of Kingdom of Kandy. The bridge was built across the Gallanda Oya, which linked Badulla and Kandy on an ancient route.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the house}} had been built thus far, the roof was formed of no more than four or five logs on which a thatching of grass was to be laid later, and the ends, in {{what might be called the}} [...] "peak of the roof," [...] were open to the weather. Then it was that roughly hewn planks, or logs split into three or four strips, called puncheons, were pegged with <b>wooden</b> <b>nails</b> on the sides, or ends, where doors or windows were to be made.|$|R
50|$|Savka House is {{a museum}} of Ukrainian rural life, located 10 km from Kiev at Novye Petrovtsy village. The museum {{features}} an old Ukrainian house made of clay covered with straw. Highlights of Savka House include numerous ancient household items: tiny glass bottles, ancient shoes with <b>wooden</b> <b>nails</b> which “cost like a cow”, various pots, wooden wheels, a large wooden bowl for making bread. In the yard {{there is a real}} smithy, a boots workshop, a pottery, three old bee hives, a kitchen garden and an old well.|$|R
50|$|Nazi Germany invaded and {{occupied}} Norway in 1940. After capturing Trondheim {{early on in}} the Norwegian Campaign, the Germans quickly established a submarine base, exploiting the natural protection provided by the fjord. At this time, Munkholmen was fitted with anti-aircraft weaponry. A large portion of the fort was retrofitted to hold ammunition, and the flooring planks were <b>nailed</b> in with <b>wooden</b> <b>nails</b> to prevent explosions caused by soldiers' boots striking metal nails. The German occupying forces remained in Norway {{until the end of the}} war in Europe in May 1945. Remnants of the installation still exist in the upper levels of the fort.|$|R
5000|$|Ezekiel Halsted, {{a wealthy}} {{landowner}} originally from Long Island, purchased the property from Timothy Knapp’s sons in 1746. He expanded the house, adding a second floor using [...] "post-and-beam" [...] construction with a sloping roof {{in the back}} containing a dining room and kitchen, which gave the house the distinctive saltbox architecture. Beams are hand-hewn, and some retain their original bark. [...] The house has cellar walls reinforced with lime made from crushed oyster shells, 12-inch <b>wooden</b> <b>nails</b> holding floorboards together and a massive center chimney reinforced with mud mortar. The Halsted family {{lived in the house}} for the next 157 years.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, the {{condemned}} were spreadeagled and broken on a saltire, a cross {{consisting of two}} <b>wooden</b> beams <b>nailed</b> in an [...] "X" [...] shape, after which the victim's mangled body might be displayed on the wheel.|$|R
30|$|Cherry (Prunus avium) and plum (Prunus domestica) {{have similar}} {{properties}} and are discussed together. They were appreciated {{because of their}} high resistance against abrasion, high strength, good vibration damping and comparable low sliding friction (Fig.  5). They were often used for small parts of machines such as axis, cogwheels and spokes. Furthermore it was utilized for outlets of vessels and furniture as table toppers. In folkloristic literature, cherry was mentioned to be used additionally for furniture as beds and chairs [15] {{as well as for}} rakes [20], mortars [23] and skids [24]. Plum was found in literature as spinning wheels [21], <b>wooden</b> <b>nails</b> of wains [25] and presses [26].|$|R
50|$|The boat or canoe without {{outriggers}} {{is called}} a bangka (vanca) or baroto (also baloto) and may be dug out from solid tree trunk or made of planks secured with <b>wooden</b> <b>nails.</b> People familiar with terminology relating to the proa may recognize this as the vaka. The boat itself may be classified by passenger capacity as isahan ("for one person") or duwahan ("for two persons"), but the paraw usually has capacity {{for more than two}} people, leading to its use in ferrying small groups of passengers and goods between islands. The narrow cross-section of the boat made it sleek, cutting across water without a lot of drag.|$|R

5|$|On several occasions, the M3 {{was mounted}} on PT boats to {{increase}} their firepower. One of these boats was John F. Kennedy's PT-109. The gun with its wheels removed was mounted on <b>wooden</b> planks <b>nailed</b> to the deck.|$|R
5000|$|Carr {{relocated}} to Melbourne and released two more solo albums, Tales of Ordinary Madness in 1991 and <b>Wooden</b> <b>Nails</b> in 1992 before joining country-rock band Big Whiskey. He wrote {{the bulk of}} their debut album which was released in 1994, then left the band to concentrate on his new project, the [...] "Traveling Wilburys"-styled acoustic outfit Hillbilly Moon, formed with Wells and Top-40 recording artist Paul Norton. The trio were augmented by Norton's wife, singer Wendy Stapleton and Wells' writing partner DeSoto, as well as former Divinyls and Concrete Blonde bassist Tim Millikan. Their first album, Volume One was released in December 1994, debuting at Melbourne's Continental Club to a sold-out house.|$|R
5000|$|In 1820 Friedrich Harkort {{founded a}} {{consortium}} {{with the aim}} of building a wagonway from the Schlebusch Coal Region (Kohlerevier Schlebusch) to Haspe. The Schlesbusch-Harkort Coal Railway (Schlebusch-Harkorter Kohlenbahn), with a length of one Prussian mile, was largely completed by 1828 and was the first railway to operate over such a distance. The haulage of coal on this narrow gauge railway was carried out by horses. On 1 April 1876, steam locomotives took over the work. The railway is now closed and has been dismantled, although parts of the line may still be seen. The tracks and wagons were later used in a roughly similar way {{in the construction of the}} Deilthal Railway. With the laying of iron rails from Essen by the Deilthal Railway Company, founded in 1828, the first proper railway line was built on German soil. According to one description, the tracks of this line consisted of oak sleepers one which so-called Straßbäume (wooden rails), each 3.30 metres long, were laid in pairs and fixed with <b>wooden</b> <b>nails.</b> Iron rails, 40 millimetres thick, were fastened onto the Straßbäumen, again with <b>wooden</b> <b>nails.</b> The track gauge was initially just 82 cm. The line was one Prussian mile or 7½ kilometres long. On 20 September 1831, the Deilthal Railway was ceremonially opened by Prince William, a son of the Prussian king, Frederick William II, and was to be called from then on the Prince William Railway Company (PWE). Until 1844 it was operated as a wagonway for the transportation of coal, but as early as 1833 passenger wagons were available [...] "for enjoyment". In 1847, the railway was converted to standard gauge and was worked between Steele South and Vohwinkel as a steam-driven railway with the name Steele-Vohwinkel Railway (Steele-Vohwinkler Eisenbahn). The trackbed is used today by S-Bahn line no. 9.|$|R
5000|$|The walkway {{is made of}} <b>wooden</b> boards, <b>nailed</b> {{together}} and installed {{on a series of}} iron pegs driven into the sheer mountain cliff thousands of metres above the ground. Some sections of the walkway are only 30 cm wide. [...] Some sections are cut into the cliff rock.|$|R
50|$|The jail {{is built}} of large squared logs joined by half notched corners. It {{measures}} 20 x 20 ft with a front gabled roof. The interior {{is divided into}} two rooms with an interlocking log wall. A full raised foundation of fieldstone supports the structure. The interior of the cell features continuous boards, turned at right angles to the logs and secured in place with 2.5 in <b>wooden</b> <b>nails</b> to prevent prisoners from sawing their way out. Likewise, the ceiling is formed by closely spaced 10 x 10 in logs and the floor is plank over similarly spaced 10 x 6 in logs. The small square windows originally featured meshed iron bars. The original door was made of three solid layers of 1.5 in plank boards laid at angles to one another.|$|R
5000|$|Pai (पाई) {{sometimes}} Pahi(पाही) is a fish trap {{constructed by}} using Thakal daantha(थाकलकॊ डाॅठ) and Beshram(बेश्रम)/byaye(व्याय)/ajambari(अजम्बरी) thoroughly knitting with rope to make large rectangular sheets {{suitable for the}} filtration of water which is mainly famous in Tharu, Kumal [...] and Majhi communities of western Nepal. Knitted sheets of their desired length and width are fixed in river of sharp current {{with the help of}} strong and large <b>wooden</b> <b>nails</b> (Kila). This fish trap was very efficient and logical tool for the ancient indigenous peoples which helped them to become successful. Today, these ancient techniques are becoming a good source of income for the people there.This fish trap looks like Greek symbol pi(Π). Indigenous peoples from near around villages of banghushree are still adopting this technique for fishing in West Rapti River.|$|R
50|$|It {{is used as}} a lever {{either to}} force apart two objects or to remove nails. Crowbars are {{commonly}} used to open <b>nailed</b> <b>wooden</b> crates, remove <b>nails,</b> or pry apart boards. Crowbars can be used as any of the three lever classes but the curved end is usually used as a first-class lever, and the flat end as a second class lever. In mining, crowbars are used to break and remove rock, but not as much in modern mining.|$|R
25|$|In spring, {{our women}} {{harvested}} the supple, young shoots to make baskets. Our men fashioned the wood into pipe stems, emergency snowshoes, snares, <b>wooden</b> <b>nails,</b> whistles for the children, beading looms, and frames for stretching hides. Rotted willow wood {{was used to}} smoke hides. Green willow branches were burned to smoke meat. We twisted the inner bark fibers into temporary rope, twine and fish nets. We weather proofed rawhide by wrapping it in willow bark. We used willow branches as lathing for our houses. Our men scraped off the inner cambium layer and added other ingredients, such as bearberry, to make a smoking mixture, ‘Kinnikinick’. We repaired our carts, made a shelter when we were caught in a storm, burned for fuel and had {{a variety of other}} practical uses for the wood of the willow.|$|R

50|$|The functionalist {{period of}} the 1930s also {{influenced}} {{the style of the}} landshövdingehus. The façades were cleansed of decoration and the <b>wooden</b> panelling was <b>nailed</b> vertically. Usually the brick ground floor was plastered smooth.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Ducal Palace in Sabbioneta, {{commissioned}} by Vespasiano Gonzaga {{in the end}} of 16 th century, keeps four precious wooden ceilings inside. Rough <b>wooden</b> planks <b>nailed</b> to a skeleton structure creates the support for fine wood decorative elements. The requirement of a conservation work has prompted a diagnosis phase about the ceilings as a whole. This was carried out by closed up observations, drilling tests and laboratory analysis...|$|R
5000|$|But {{in order}} {{just to make}} a start, Harkort then {{proposed}} a [...] "stripped down" [...] version. He founded the Deil Valley Railway Company, the first German railway joint stock company in 1828 with his brother, the industrialist Ludwig Mohl, Peter Nikolaus Caspar Egen, Dr. Voss (a physician and miner from Steele, now part of Essen) and Reichmann and Meyberg (merchants from Langenberg).In 1830 and 1831 the Deil Valley Railway was built up the Deilbach valley from Hinsbeck, a suburb of Kupferdreh (now part of Essen), to Nierenhof near Langenberg (now part of Velbert). This line was already called a [...] "railway" [...] because it had iron wheels on iron rails. It was built on oak sleepers, on which two 3.30 m long planks called Straßbäume, ("street trees") were secured with <b>wooden</b> <b>nails.</b> The Straßbäume were covered with a running surface of 40 mm thick iron, known, using British terminology as a plateway. The line ran for a Prussian mile (7,532 meters), and its gauge was [...] narrow-gauge.|$|R
5000|$|Police {{claimed that}} “at least five woman police constables were molested by mob." [...] Also, the injured policemen said the protestors beat them with hockey stick, iron rod, stones, <b>wooden</b> mace with <b>nails</b> and metal rod.|$|R
5000|$|The area became home {{to dozens}} of prospectors during the [...] "Porcupine Gold Rush", who {{explored}} the areas around Porcupine Lake and the Frederick House River. Most settlers grouped around Porcupine Lake and the Dome, which is situated one mile from the lake. Four miles down the road, around the McIntyre Mine, the hamlet of Schumacher was established. Timmins apparently got {{its name from the}} <b>wooden</b> sign <b>nailed</b> to a tree, demarcating Noah Timmins's purchase.|$|R
50|$|The {{nail gun}} was {{designed}} by Morris Pynoos, a civil engineer by training, {{for his work on}} Howard Hughes' Hughes H-4 Hercules (known as the Spruce Goose). The <b>wooden</b> fuselage was <b>nailed</b> together and glued, and then the nails were removed.|$|R
60|$|The tug-of-war {{was held}} late one {{afternoon}} in the gymnasium. A line was drawn {{on the floor and}} the long rope laid across this. On either side <b>wooden</b> cleats were <b>nailed</b> down, so that the contestants might brace their feet.|$|R
50|$|The {{house itself}} has a main section with wings {{to the north}} and east. A fieldstone {{foundation}} has cobblestone facing, protruding mortar V-joints and sandstone quoinss. Atop it rest stacks of one-inch-thick (2.5-cm) vertical <b>wooden</b> planks <b>nailed</b> together creating load-bearing walls. Plaster was applied to the interior surface; the exterior is faced in clapboard. The two-story, three-bay main block is topped with a gabled roof, shingled in cedar, from which a brick chimney protrudes at the south (front) end.|$|R
50|$|A <b>nailed</b> <b>wooden</b> box is {{constructed}} {{of pieces of}} lumber (sometimes with reinforcing battens, cleats, etc.) attached by nails or other suitable fasteners. It usually completely encloses the contents. A box usually has a bottom and four side panels and often has an attachable top.|$|R
50|$|In 1780, Storgatan was paved and in 1782 {{the houses}} along it {{received}} house numbers, {{since it was}} decided that all houses and farms in Umeå should be numbered. The number had to be painted on a <b>wooden</b> board and <b>nailed</b> above the main entrances.|$|R
60|$|Sue {{had thrown}} an {{appealing}} look at Squire Boatfield, {{when she saw}} that dismal cortège. Her husband, her prince! the descendant of the Bourbons, the regenerator of France lying there--unrecognizable, horrible and loathsome--in a rough <b>wooden</b> coffin hastily <b>nailed</b> together by a village carpenter.|$|R
50|$|The main {{auditorium}} can hold 300 plus 180 in a gallery. <b>Wooden</b> panelling <b>nailed</b> {{directly to the}} brickwork and acoustic plaster was used to give the hall excellent acoustic qualities, considered the best hall in London for chamber music. This made it very suitable {{for the performance of}} music and there have been regular recordings and concerts there. The ceiling of the auditorium was glazed and this made it very light and airy for the time. It opened in 1929 and has continued in use since.|$|R
50|$|Tetsu {{leaves a}} voice mail informing Mikio that Hagane {{is pleased with}} the date and hopes that he will someday date with her again, but finds that Mikio already {{resigned}} from his job. As Mikio walks through the street, he is targeted by <b>wooden</b> <b>nails</b> shot by Hagane, but he manages to retaliate and beats her up, although he backs down when his arm is stabbed by spikes protruding from Hagane's sack. Escaping from the scene, Mikio avoids a following Tetsu and takes a walk outside his house that night. He sees Hagane walking limply until she collapses; he uses this opportunity to throw her off a cliff. However, she appears unharmed and chases him to a warehouse, which Mikio locks up. Using her newly opened hands, Hagane {{opens the door and}} cries as Mikio hugs her. She then opens up her sack and allows Mikio to see her inside until a chomping sound is heard. Mikio manages to break free, terrified with his face covered in bite marks as Hagane approaches him. She proceeds to slowly eat him up in a way reminiscent of an intercouse. Tetsu eventually discovers her and burns Mikio's belongings. The next day, Hagane continues her sewing activity and walks through a forest happily.|$|R
50|$|The bridge has slanted front supports, {{allowing}} {{the roof to}} extend further than the sides. The shingles on the roof are laid {{in a way to}} allow water to run off without leaking through the small gaps between panels. The sides of the bridge are <b>wooden</b> planks <b>nailed</b> vertically with a small gap between the roof and the top of the side walls. The bridge is normally painted red and is visible from both lanes of Interstate 70, which runs less than 1000 ft south of the bridge.|$|R
