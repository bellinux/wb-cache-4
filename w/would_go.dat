5|$|The 1926 coup was a {{major event}} in interwar Lithuania; the {{dictatorship}} <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on for 14years.

Encyclopædia Britannica, however, describes the regime as authoritarian and nationalistic rather than fascist. The coup's apologists have described it as a corrective to an extreme form of parliamentarianism, justifiable in light of Lithuania's political immaturity.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale <b>would</b> <b>go</b> towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money <b>would</b> <b>go</b> directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
