40|$|A failed <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> {{belonging}} to an aircraft {{was sent to}} the laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that the <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> failed in progressive manner wherein a number of cracks had initiated all along the circumference of the nut at the fillet of the flange. Fractographic features indicated that the reason for the progressive failure was hydrogen embrittlement and it appears most probable that the <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> would have picked up hydrogen during cadmium plating. In general, the microstructure of the nut material was found to be satisfactory and the composition was found to conform to the specification. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this repor...|$|R

50|$|Loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> {{indicators}} are small pointed tags, usually made of fluorescent orange or yellow plastic, which are {{fixed to the}} lug <b>nuts</b> of the <b>wheels</b> of large vehicles. The tag rotates with the nut, and if the nut becomes loose, {{the point of the}} tag shifts noticeably out of alignment with the other tags. If too many lug nuts are loosened, the wheel can detach from the wheel stud; loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> indicators allow identification of loose nuts before this can occur.|$|R

50|$|A lug <b>nut</b> or <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> is a fastener, {{specifically}} a nut, used {{to secure}} a wheel on a vehicle. Typically, lug nuts are found on automobiles, trucks (lorries), and other large vehicles using rubber tires.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} allow early {{detection}} of loose lug nuts, some large vehicles are fitted with loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> indicators. The indicator spins with the nut, {{so that it can}} be detected with a visual inspection.|$|R

He has also presented a number of current affairs programmes for the station, such as Seven Days, <b>Wheel</b> <b>Nuts,</b> Sunday Live election programming and the channel's coverage of The State Opening of the Scottish Parliament.

5000|$|A {{peanut butter}} wrench, {{also known as}} a crank bolt spanner or a crank spanner, is a {{single-ended}} box wrench or ring spanner used in cycling to tighten older 14 mm and 15 mm crank bolts, or the <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> (track nuts) on hubs with solid axles commonly found on track bicycles, particularly the 15 mm wrench made by Campagnolo. This is the only one-piece wrench {{that can be used to}} tighten or loosen the bolt or nut which holds the crank to a square-taper bottom bracket spindle (although a thin-walled 15 mm socket and handle will also serve), whereas any wrench/spanner of the correct size will tighten or loosen <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Piquet {{went on to}} {{take his}} second {{consecutive}} win in his Williams-Honda, after team-mate Nigel Mansell lost a <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> with six laps remaining. Senna finished second in his Lotus-Honda but 37 seconds behind Piquet, while Alain Prost took third in his McLaren-TAG.|$|R

His current classic car collection comprises a Triumph TR2, MGB-GT, Wolseley 1500 and a Jaguar XJ6 (his everyday car). He is a contributor to Practical Classics magazine.|$|R

50|$|For 1972, new wheels {{featuring}} smaller hubcaps with exposed <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> {{like those}} on the 2000 GTV were fitted. At the same time, the GT 1600 Junior was introduced alongside the GT 1300 Junior. The GT 1300 Junior was discontinued for the right hand drive UK market but continued to be available in other right hand drive markets.|$|R

50|$|Loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> {{indicators}} or Lug nut {{indicators are}} used both by auto mechanics and drivers to identify lug nuts which require tightening, {{as well as}} by accident investigators to detect faults after accidents. Although not compulsory in most jurisdictions, road safety bodies recommend their use, especially on large or heavy vehicles such as buses, coaches, large vans, and trucks.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{long after}} the {{standard}} Slash 4x4 was announced, a race-ready [...] "Platinum Edition" [...] was also announced. Much like the Revo Platinum Edition, it lacks a pre-painted body, but includes most of Traxxas' available accessories as stock equipment. New features include big-bore aluminum shocks, a center differential, aluminum hubs and axle carriers, blue anodized aluminum <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts,</b> front and rear sway bars, and racing compound tires.|$|R
25|$|At the Grand Prix on 14 July, the {{pressures}} on Hill as national favourite and son of a famous father (Graham Hill) were not inconsiderable, but he responded well, setting pole. Unfortunately he muffed the start and later spun out of contention when a front <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> became loose, and his teammate Jacques Villeneuve {{went on to win}} at a fraction over 124mph, from Berger's Benetton and the McLaren of Häkkinen.|$|R
50|$|At the , Vettel was {{appointed}} {{as a director}} of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association. He took his second consecutive pole position in Australia, ahead of teammate Mark Webber, but spun off when leading the race, due to a loose <b>wheel</b> <b>nut.</b> In Malaysia, he took his first win of the 2010 season with Webber coming in second place, having passed both him and Nico Rosberg at turn one.|$|R
50|$|He {{continued}} at Le Mans with the Porsche 935, nearly winning the 24 hours of Le Mans with Dick Barbour and actor Paul Newman as co-drivers in 1979 in a Porsche 935, {{only to be}} set back by a 23-minute-long pit stop caused by a stuck <b>wheel</b> <b>nut.</b> The team would not have come so far, if Stommelen had not been constantly seconds faster than his team mates each lap.|$|R
50|$|On lap 26, Mansell's {{lead was}} 18.8 seconds over Senna, {{but he was}} {{beginning}} to experience cramps in his right leg. A stop for tyres on lap 34 took 18 seconds when the right rear <b>wheel</b> <b>nut</b> refused to seat properly. Holding the brakes on much longer than normal made the Englishman's cramp even worse. Prost, now in second, was struggling with brake and gearbox problems as he stopped for tyres.|$|R
50|$|On 31 January 2013, Force India {{confirmed}} di Resta would {{race for}} the team for a third consecutive season in 2013. After qualifying outside the top ten in Australia, di Resta managed to battle through into the points, finishing just behind his teammate, Adrian Sutil in eighth place. In Malaysia, however di Resta retired after his car's <b>wheel</b> <b>nuts</b> kept jamming, and the team was ultimately forced to retire both cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{start of}} the 2010 season was rather slow, {{and in the first}} three races, Schumacher managed only 6th in Bahrain, 10th in Australia, and retired in Malaysia because of a lost <b>wheel</b> <b>nut,</b> whilst Schumacher's {{teammate}} and fellow-countryman Nico Rosberg had a bit more success with the car, finishing 5th in Malaysia and in Australia and scoring the first podium for Mercedes Grand Prix with a 3rd place in Malaysia.|$|R
