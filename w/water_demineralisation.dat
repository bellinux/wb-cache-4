40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>demineralisation</b> is {{a process}} {{for the removal of}} mineral salts present in water, so the water {{produced}} has a high purity. Basically the process is like what is done in water softening through ion exchange process. One chemical parameters in water quality requirements is the number of element content of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + in the presence of water commonly called water hardness conducted by ion exchange. Ion exchanger has a limited capacity in ion exchange capability called exchange capacity. Because of this, ion exchangers or resin eventually becomes saturated. Keywords: water demineralization, hardness, content of Ca and M...|$|E

Recent years have seen station reliability begin to reflect the aged condition of the plant. In the last two years contracts have been entered into that require the power station to be capable of operation at the original design output until the year 2029. Given the requirement to operate for close to a further 20 years and the plant performance at the time, it was clear to station management that a change of direction was required. It was at this point that the Senior Management Team (SMT) decided to embrace a formal asset management (AM) system in order to achieve its business goals. Gladstone Power Station has been divided into smaller more manageable asset areas. Each asset area has been analysed by the AM work group to identify which areas to begin the task of reviewing and building asset strategies for. The <b>water</b> <b>demineralisation</b> (demin) plant, part of the chemical asset area, was identified as one of the plants requiring review and development of its asset strategy. Development of the demin plant asset management strategy forms the basis of this dissertation...|$|E
