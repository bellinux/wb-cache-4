5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E

25|$|Ronnie Burnet was Yorkshire's new {{captain in}} 1958. Not an {{accomplished}} player, {{though he had}} previously captained the club's Second XI, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> manager and a firm disciplinarian who could get {{the best out of}} what was to be a new team in which Trueman was, apart from Brian Close and Vic Wilson, the most experienced player. Burnet made his mark in 1958 with the sacking of Wardle for disciplinary reasons. Yorkshire finished 11th in the County Championship after losing 24 full days to the weather. Regular team members now included Burnet, Close, Trueman, Illingworth, Vic Wilson, Padgett, Ken Taylor, Stott, Jimmy Binks, Brian Bolus, Phil Sharpe and Don Wilson which meant that the great Yorkshire team of the 1960s was taking shape. Trueman played in 30 first-class matches in 1958, taking 106 wickets at a very low 13.33 with best figures of 6–23, one of six 5-wicket hauls. He held 22 catches in the season and it was about this time that he began to prove himself a more reliable batsman, eventually being able to rise from number 11 to about 8 or 9 in batting orders. He scored 453 runs in 1958 with 3 half-centuries and a highest score of 61.|$|E

25|$|The MCC chose {{a number}} of all-rounders for their team, but none of real quality. The balding and bespectacled Paul Gibb had a sensational tour of South Africa before in 1938–39, when he hit 473 runs (59.12) and two centuries, but in Australia {{was found to have}} a {{weakness}} against leg-spin and failed. He was chosen for the First Test ahead of Godfrey Evans because of his batting ability, but Evans proved to be a decent batsman, a perky, attacking player who tried to take a run off every ball, but in the Fourth Test he went for a record 95 minutes before scoring while Compton made a century at the other end. At 28 Jack Ikin was one of the younger English players on the tour and apart from five first class matches in 1938 and 1939 he was a post-war player. Not noted for his footwork or strokeplay he was a gritty left-hander who was picked even though he only made one century for Lancashire in 1946. He was popular in Australia as he was a Tobruk Rat who had fought alongside the Australian 9th Division in North Africa. Norman Yardley was a sensible player who liked to play his strokes on the leg-side and though he never made a Test century <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> in a crisis. James Langridge, Peter Smith and Bill Voce were bowlers who regularly made runs and even centuries for their counties, but Doug Wright's only hundred had become before the war and afterwards was relegated {{to the bottom of the}} batting order. Alec Bedser was a tailender who was capable of hitting a few runs on occasion and Dick Pollard's lack of batting ability was cited as one of the reasons why he was not picked for a Test in the series.|$|E

Troubled by the mixed reception that Murrell had, she expressed the view that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man.</b> She also commented that Murrell's power to control mechanical objects had remained within the family, characterising them as [...] "natural mechanics".|$|E

500|$|While held at Utah State Industrial School in Ogden, Gardner {{was visited}} by Jack Statt, {{a man who}} was living with his brother Randy. According to Gardner, Statt met Randy at a bus stop and paid him $25 for oral sex. When {{released}} from the school in 1975, Gardner stayed with Statt. Although social workers noted the men in the household were dressed like women, Statt officially became a foster parent to Gardner and his brother. Gardner said that Statt performed sex acts on them and explained, [...] "I thought life like that was normal." [...] Gardner stated in a psychological evaluation that he worked as a prostitute while living with Statt, who psychologists say fit the pedophile profile. Gardner said his time in foster care was the most stable period of his life [...] "Jack <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> and he tried to help us out." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul and Naomi {{eventually}} {{embarked on}} a relationship, but faced problems early on when she interfered in his family business by contacting his estranged daughter Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond). Paul confronted Naomi in public, but with Sheila supporting her, Naomi refused to apologise and threatened to quit her job and their relationship. Paul later apologised to Naomi, as he bonded with Amy. O'Reilly believed Paul and Naomi's relationship would [...] "stand the test of time" [...] and joked that their pairing {{would be part of}} Neighbours history. Paul and Naomi's romance was tested when Naomi learned of Paul's involvement in her brother's crime, and when Paul questioned whether she was still in love with Toadie, following an accident that was her fault. Naomi told him that she admired Toadie as he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> something that Paul was not. Paul promised to be a better man and later proposed to Naomi.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E

Underwood's voice spans from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country noted that the lyrics of the song push [...] "the {{normally}} plucky country superstar to the edge of evil. It's as far as she can go without falling off the cliff of believability." [...] Dukes also described the song as a [...] "mini-movie", in which Underwood sings: [...] "And the preacher said he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> / And his brother said he was a good friend / But the women in the two black veils didn't bother to cry / Bye, bye / Yeah they took turns laying a rose down / Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground / He's {{not the only one who}} had a secret to hide / Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye."

500|$|By {{the time}} El Greco arrived in Rome, Michelangelo and Raphael were dead, but their example {{continued}} to be paramount, and somewhat overwhelming for young painters. El Greco was determined {{to make his own}} mark in Rome defending his personal artistic views, ideas and style. He singled out Correggio and Parmigianino for particular praise, but he did not hesitate to dismiss Michelangelo's Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel; he extended an offer to Pope Pius V to paint over the whole work in accord with the new and stricter Catholic thinking. When he was later asked what he thought about Michelangelo, El Greco replied that [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> but {{he did not know how}} to paint". And thus we are confronted by a paradox: El Greco is said to have reacted most strongly or even condemned Michelangelo, but he had found it impossible to withstand his influence. Michelangelo's influence can be seen in later El Greco works such as the Allegory of the Holy League. By painting portraits of Michelangelo, Titian, Clovio and, presumably, Raphael in one of his works (The Purification of the Temple), El Greco not only expressed his gratitude but also advanced the claim to rival these masters. As his own commentaries indicate, El Greco viewed Titian, Michelangelo and Raphael as models to emulate. In his 17th century Chronicles, Giulio Mancini included El Greco among the painters who had initiated, in various ways, a re-evaluation of Michelangelo's teachings.|$|E

2500|$|El Greco {{regarded}} {{color as}} the most important and the most ungovernable element of painting ("I hold the imitation of color to be the greatest difficulty of art."—Notes of the painter in one of his commentaries). He declared that color had primacy over drawing; thus his opinion on Michelangelo was that [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> but {{he did not know how}} to paint". Francisco Pacheco, a painter and theoretician who visited El Greco in 1611, was startled by the painter's technique: [...] "If I say that Domenico Greco sets his hand to his canvases many and many times over, that he worked upon them again and again, but to leave the colors crude and unblent in great blots as a boastful display of his dexterity?" [...] Pacheco asserts that [...] "El Greco believed in constant repainting and retouching in order to make the broad masses tell flat as in nature".|$|E

It's not my idea of what the show should be. It's embarrassing to me if I am not the star of it and in the way I feel it should be. This year should be more important to it, not less important to it... I might as well work less hard in all of them." [...] Johnny Byrne said that Freiberger <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> and good producer, but not good for Space: 1999.

[...] However, shortly thereafter, the bank at Gore failed. The cattle herd was taken by creditors and those who had mortgaged their allotments lost their land. In the post War War I depression of the early 1920s, many sound banks and businesses failed, and the circumstances appear to have been beyond Kellogg's diligence. George Smith, fifth son of Redbird Smith, recalled, [...] "C.P. was awful smart. You couldn't get ahead of him. The white people was scared of him all the time, watching what he was doing with the Keetoowahs. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> but the white people were against him, and we had some bad luck." [...] After the collapse of the Lolomi Plan, some Keetoowahs believed that Cornelius cheated them and he was dismissed as spokesman for the Ketoowah Society [...] In 1925, Cornelius was raised as a chief of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, and continued to reside in Gore, Oklahoma, and play a role with his sister in national Indian affairs.|$|E

[...] He had no more than got the words out of his mouth before he yelled, [...] "My God, I am shot." [...] I heard this cry and looked around, Buffalo Chips was falling over into the hole where the Indians were hiding.
