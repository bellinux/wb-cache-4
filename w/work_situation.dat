500|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. [...] In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) resolves a conflict between Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), and then discovers a file of other unresolved complaints between staff members and he determines to resolve them. [...] But Michael's attempts actually unearth old tensions and create new ones between the office employees. [...] Meanwhile, an unkind comment from Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) about being transferred causes Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) to seriously rethink his <b>work</b> <b>situation.</b>|$|E
500|$|Martin {{tells the}} others he was incarcerated for insider trading, {{and that he}} enjoyed certain perks of prison, {{including}} outside time and art classes. Pam comments that prison sounds better than their current <b>work</b> <b>situation.</b> Attempting to convince his employees that the office is better than prison, Michael sends everyone to [...] "outside time" [...] in the bitter cold. He then calls a meeting in which he adopts the persona of [...] "Prison Mike." [...] Martin comments that Michael's performance did not remind him {{of his time in}} prison. This further infuriates Michael, who then locks all of the staff inside the conference room. In order to have his co-workers released, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Michael the staff is simply teasing him. After letting the agitated workers go, a relieved Michael relents, but Martin chooses to quit.|$|E

2500|$|The {{plans of}} a center-right regime in 1925 to {{increase}} the penalties of Paragraph 175 came closer to fruition; but they, too, failed. In addition to paragraph 296 (which corresponded to the old paragraph 175), their proposed reform draft provided for a paragraph 297 to be included. The plan was that so-called [...] "qualified cases" [...] such as homosexual prostitution, sex with young men {{under the age of}} 21, and sexual coercion of a man in a service or <b>work</b> <b>situation</b> would be classified as [...] "severe cases", reclassified as felonies (Verbrechen) rather than misdemeanors (Vergehen). This act would have pertained not only to homosexual intercourse but also to other homosexual acts such as, for example, mutual masturbation.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{researchers}} {{throughout the}} last several decades have argued that the social sciences would benefit from a taxonomy of situations. A number of efforts to develop such a system exist, but none has been readily embraced. This study examines the feasibility of adapting the nature and structure of the Linnaean Taxonomy of organisms to the study of situations by categorizing types of <b>work</b> <b>situations</b> {{on the basis of the}} dimensions that define them. Results derived from multiple independent samples converge on the idea that four types of <b>work</b> <b>situations</b> (i. e., bureaucratic, prosaic, incubative, and strategic) can be classified by their standing on two orthogonal dimensions (i. e., formality-informality and maintenance-development). This structure is not only intended to serve as a consistent way for organizational scientists to conceptualize <b>work</b> <b>situations,</b> but is also designed to serve as the foundation for a larger taxonomy that can be developed and utilized by researchers across diverse fields to better understand situations in general. ...|$|R

40|$|The Functional Analysis of a Gene Sequence Process (FAoGS) is {{a process}} which {{requires}} molecular bench scientists to predict the function of a selected gene sequence. In order to predict a gene function, scientists conduct multiple and complex dry laboratory procedures. The focus {{of this paper is}} to explain the adaptation of two models; a Viable System Model (VSM) and Integrated Information Behaviour Model (IBM) for diagnosing the viability of multiple bioinformatics work procedures embedded in recursive <b>work</b> <b>situations.</b> Undertaking experimental <b>work</b> procedures in this kind of environment require scientists to access, use and integrate variety of biological data from heterogeneous information sources. This paper explains how the use of VSM and IBM support the modelling of dry bioinformatics work procedures in multiple-recursive embedded experimental <b>work</b> <b>situations.</b> This model allows systems analyst to identify the operational or autonomous work procedures at different recursion levels of <b>work</b> <b>situations.</b> The results or this analysis will allow systems analyst to understand and establish the existence of cohesive and adaptive mechanisms during FAoGS process in order to suggest appropriate design of Integrated Information Repository (IIR) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAs the {{industrial}} world grows more complex, virtual environments {{have proven to be}} interesting tools to train workers to procedures and <b>work</b> <b>situations.</b> To ensure learning and motivation, a pedagogical control of these environments is needed. However, existing systems either do not provide control over running simulations, limit user agency, need the authors to specify a priori all possible scenarios, or allow for incoherent behaviours from the simulated technical system or the virtual characters. We propose in this paper a model for a dynamic and indirect control of the events of a virtual environment. Our model aims to ensure the control, coherence, and emergence of situations, in virtual environments designed for training in highly complex <b>work</b> <b>situations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of dispositions and <b>work</b> <b>situations</b> on job satisfaction, and the mediating role of perceptions of <b>work</b> <b>situations</b> on the relationship between dispositions and job satisfaction. Identifying the antecedents of job satisfaction is important both theoretically and practically, as job satisfaction is closely related to other organizational variables such as job performance, organizational citizenship behavior, absenteeism and turnover. Most of the extant studies on the antecedents of job satisfaction have focused on populations in economically developed countries. However, there are cultural and language differences between these countries and China, and it is unclear if findings in other countries can be generalized to the Chinese population. Furthermore, there are few comprehensive studies investigating a range of both situational and dispositional variables. The main contribution {{of the current study}} is to incorporate major dispositional and situational variables and investigate the mediating role of perceived <b>work</b> <b>situations</b> on the disposition and job satisfaction relationship in China. A cross-sectional research design was used in the study. The sample was taken from employees in industrial and commercial organizations in China’s northeast. All the measures were well-established, widely used multi-item measures developed in English-speaking countries. Confirmatory factor analysis and Cronbach’s alpha demonstrated that the measures were of good validity and reliability and could be used for Chinese populations. Regression analysis found that of the ten situational variables, seven had a statistically significant relationship with job satisfaction: distributive justice, supervisor support, role conflict, autonomy, routinization, role ambiguity, and promotional chances. Of the seven situational variables, distributive justice had the largest effect on job satisfaction, followed by supervisor support, role conflict, autonomy, routinization, role ambiguity, and promotional chances. Three situational variables were not significantly related to job satisfaction: work overload, co-worker support, and pay level. The relationship between job satisfaction and positive affectivity and conscientiousness were partially mediated by perception of <b>work</b> <b>situations,</b> while the relationships between job satisfaction and negative affectivity and neuroticism were completely mediated by perception of <b>work</b> <b>situations.</b> Of the dispositional variables, positive affectivity had the strongest total effect on job satisfaction, much of it mediated by perceived <b>work</b> <b>situations.</b> The findings of this research support the theory that job satisfaction has both a dispositional source and situational source. Disposition has an influence on job satisfaction both directly and indirectly through <b>work</b> <b>situations.</b> The research findings also suggest that most of the findings on the antecedents of job satisfaction reported in research undertaken in economically developed countries can be generalized to China. However, the finding of a non-significant relationship between work overload, co-worker support and job satisfaction could be country-specific. In a transitional country such as China, work overload may be linked to secure jobs, and as a result people may be not unhappy to work intensively for long hours. In terms of practical implications, {{the findings of this study}} provide managers in industrial and commercial enterprises with guidelines in establishing conditions for the creation and maintenance of high levels of employee’s job satisfaction...|$|R
