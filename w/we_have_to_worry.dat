Here, we tried to find the acausal phenomena using standard resistive RMHD numerical simulations in the suggested situation of the acausal phenomena. The calculation results showed that even in such situations no acausal effect happens.

30|$|At the {{database}} level, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about how fast we load data into the DB {{and how fast}} we pull data out. The raw data as {{it comes from the}} source lends itself to large tables with millions of records and thousands of fields. Key to high performance is the ability to partition the tables in a meaningful manner. The irony {{is that there is no}} clear definition for what would be a meaningful manner. What we can say in general, is that larger number of tables allows for more parallel loads of tables into the DB. Also, smaller table sizes mean faster query and report generation. Too many tables, on the other hand, may slow down the queries and reports if they happen to scan large number of tables. A DB designer would like to store homogenous data (data commonly requested in a given report or query) in the same table; this design improves the data locality structure and leads to faster access of data, although it puts more burden on the parser and loader. In a relatively small DB system, this is easily done by investigating the semantics of the data. In systems like the one described in this example, this task is next to impossible.|$|E
40|$|How can {{performance}} assessments {{be used as}} part {{of regular}} instruction? Will this raise student performance on external achievement measures? What aspects of examinee performance improve on the assessment exercises? rguments favoring the use A of performance assessments make two related but distinct claims. Performance assessments are ex-pected, first, to provide better mea-surement and, second, to improve teaching and learning. Although any measuring device is corruptible, per-formance measures have the poten-tial for increased validity because the performance tasks are themselves demonstrations of important learn-ing goals rather than indirect in-dicators of achievement (Resnick & Resnick, 1992). According to Fred-eriksen and Collins (19891, Wiggins (19891, and others, performance as-sessments should enhance the valid-ity of measurement by representing {{the full range of}} desired learning out-comes, by preserving the complexity of disciplinary knowledge domains and skills, by representing the con-texts in which knowledge must ulti-mately be applied, and by adapting the modes of assessment to enable students to show what they know. The more assessments embody au-thentic criterion performances, the less <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about drawing inferences from test results to re-mote constructs. The expected positive effects of performance assessments on teach-ing and learning follow from their substantive validity, If assessments capture learning expectations fully, then when teachers provide coaching and practice to improve scores, they will directly improve student learn-ing without corrupting the meaning of the indicator.

40|$|Fluoride {{toxicity}} and bioaccumulation tests (short- and long-term) {{were performed}} on the non-indigenous freshwater mollusc Dreissena polymorpha at two different temperatures: 17 ± 0. 5 °C and 22 ± 0. 5 °C. Concentrations that {{did not result in}} toxicity in short-term experiments (96 h) induced effects over a longer period (17 weeks), especially at the warmest temperature, highlighting the role of this parameter. Fluoride bioaccumulation increased linearly with increasing concentration and temperature, reaching 4202 μg F-/g dry weight in soft tissues only after 48 hours of exposure at 22 °C at a concentration of 640 mg F-/L. Comparing tolerance to fluoride and bioaccumulation values of this species with those of other freshwater invertebrates, D. polymorpha resulted to be much more resistant and revealed its capacity to accumulate a great quantity of this xenobiotic. Our results demonstrated that fluoride accumulation in the soft tissue of this animal was much higher (up to 1409. 6 μg F-/g dry weight) than in its shell (up to 706. 4 μg F-/g dry weight). If we consider this datum and the fact that D. polymorpha is widespread in many aquatic ecosystems around the world, representing a food source for many birds and other vertebrates, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about the possibility that it can represent a serious danger in view of fluoride biomagnification in the aquatic environment...|$|E
40|$|Lithium ion {{battery is}} the most {{promising}} candidate to power electrical vehicles at a feasible cost due to its high energy density. In addition to developing high capacity cathode and anode materials, the battery fabrication process is also very important to control the total volume and weight of a battery. 1 With thick electrodes, less current collectors and separator are needed. Meanwhile <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about possible problems arising from the mechanical properties, power density, long-term cycling and so on. During our investigation on high loading NCM cathode (NCM, LiNi 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 O 2), we also realized that, as the lithium ion transportation medium, the electrolyte also played critical roles in maintaining the battery’s long-term capacity, and power density at relatively high current rate. 2 Figure 1 shows the rate test results in a conventional electrolyte (1 M LiPF 6 in 1 : 2 EC/DEC) and a high voltage (HV) electrolyte for an NCM electrode of 120 µm thick with a loading around 5 mAh/cm 2. After the cell was charged at C/ 10 to 4. 3 V, corresponding to a current density about 0. 51 mA/cm 2, the discharge capacities with the HV electrolyte were dramatically increased {{in the range from}} 1 C to 5 C relative to those with the conventional electrolyte. Considering 2 C is the rate to be applied when high power is needed, we believe electrolyte will become an important factor for the design of high power batteries...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion that}} we are {{becoming}} more competitive and individualistic is diffused in today Sweden, argued {{to be a positive}} or negative outcome of the social, political and economical changes of the last decades. So is also in the construction sector. The call for competitive building outcomes has driven many technical innovations while the lack of cooperation is claimed to be the principal cause of non-sustainable development. Hence the dichotomy must be verified and our understanding of it must become sharper. Challenged by the climate change societies may compete about sustainable results, but competing to be sustainable has a twofold outcome. We may compete in order to reach high performance measurable solutions in one building and we may compete to spread good enough sustainable integrated solutions throughout the environment. The both seem to be necessary, the first attracting the traditional innovation paradigm, measured in quantities, while the second risks staying in the shadow of technological progress. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about this and develop new integrated theories. Emerging patterns of competitive cooperation are observed in evolving projects for sustainable buildings in a local Swedish reality, within a study (Demo- 04) focused on giving guidelines for the implementation of sustainable building goals. A stakeholder participatory approach reinforces the need of {{a better understanding of the}} integrated sector-specific innovations as they all affect the design and construction processes. They are questioning the way people make decisions in everyday work and address a corporate integrated and shared responsibility. Innovations in building can be inconsistent with the concepts of sustainability when isolated from shared and clear sustainability goals. Still sustainable innovations emerge within a framework of coordinated design between stakeholders and new profiles of action in projects. Transparency is the common denominator of both cooperative and competitive behaviours and guarantees the possibility of resilience of the chosen social and technological paths...|$|E
