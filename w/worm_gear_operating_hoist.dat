In order to substitute for the bronze, {{a new kind of}} antifriction composite material of polymer-matrix, ZW- 1 material has been successfully developed.

In order to bring the excellent properties of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 material into play and substitute for bronze, the test for anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of ZW- 1 material under static load has been made. A simple test-bed is designed. The test has been carried out under static load. The test of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> with ZW- 1 and nylon materials, different teeth numbers、tooth width and tooth forms is made. The test findings show that in the test conditions the invalidation of ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is radial fracture in gear rim. Applying stress transmission theory and micrographic analysis, fracture mechanism of ZW- 1 material is found out, namely degumming on the interface between fiber and polymer. Anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> of ZW- 1 material is twenty three times as much as that of bronze worm gear(Q/ZB 125 - 73). Archimedes <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> has the same anti-fracture capacity as arc tooth <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> of ZW- 1 material. Macrographic analysis shows that load concentration and contact stress concentration of bolt hole caused by bending bolt are significant factors which affect invalidation of <b>worm</b> <b>gear.</b> The test result shows an important fact that overlapping coefficient of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 material <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is much higher than that of calculating in theory, for small modulo of elasticity has a good effect upon the <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> <b>gear...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental method for determining the efficiency of <b>worm</b> <b>gears.</b> Research into <b>worm</b> <b>gears</b> is primarily aimed at increasing the load carrying capacity, prolongation of life cycle and/or achieving higher efficiency, which can result in a reduction in exploitation costs. A larger share of sliding movement with respect to sliding-rolling movement of gearing contributes to the quiet operation but, on the other hand, causes a significant power loss. Very often, the load limit is not put by the load carrying capacity of gearing but by the ability to carry away the heat caused by friction. In order to design a worm gearbox that would be closer to the optimal solution from the temperature point of view (the heat), it is necessary to determine the operation losses. Besides the geometry of gearing, which influences the efficiency by forming conditions required for the creation of hydrodynamic lubrication, the applied lubricant also plays a significant role. In the research presented in this paper, mineral and synthetic oils were used for the combination of materials CuSn 12 / 16 MnCr 5 used for <b>gears</b> <b>operating</b> at variable output load and two different rotational speeds...|$|R
