The man forces David to arrange a meeting at the Church between him <b>and</b> <b>Sam.</b> They meet, <b>and</b> it is revealed the man is William Cain, the man who murdered <b>Sam's</b> parents <b>and</b> who Sam—in revenge—killed as he was trying to escape. William also escaped from Hell and offered to kill <b>Sam</b> <b>and</b> Hanna so that David could claim the inheritance, because their parent's will left everything to <b>Sam,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sam's</b> <b>will</b> left everything to Hanna. Before Will can kill Sam, the final Reaper—the Changer—arrives and attacks both of them and kills William, but not before he tells Sam that David hired him to kill him. Now in its natural form the Changer nearly kills Sam before being killed by Mally and Oz, who have returned. Oz confesses that Sam didn't escape by accident and was in fact broken out by Oz, who is a Guardian Angel. He offers to take Sam down to Mexico, but Sam stays to confront his brother. David admits not only to having <b>Will</b> kill <b>Sam</b> <b>and</b> Hanna but also having their parents murdered by Will because he was jealous of both his parents' treatment of Sam as well as the inheritance money. Following their argument, Sam is shot by David. In a brief struggle Sam gains the upper hand and spares his brother, only to be shot in the back as he is leaving. As the police arrive to arrest David, Sam has the opportunity to fire back at David; however, he instead spends his final moments staring at a picture of him and Hanna happily together. For this act Sam gains redemption for his previous sin. After he dies, he awakens in heaven with Hanna, where they spend the rest of eternity happily ever after.|$|R
