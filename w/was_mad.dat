25|$|Boléro became Ravel's {{most famous}} composition, {{much to the}} {{surprise}} of the composer, who had predicted that most orchestras would refuse to play it. It is usually played as a purely orchestral work, only rarely being staged as a ballet. According to a possibly apocryphal story from the premiere performance, a woman was heard shouting that Ravel <b>was</b> <b>mad.</b> When told about this, Ravel is said to have remarked that she had understood the piece.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 1818 {{a retired}} officer on half-pay, Lieutenant Davies, {{who had a}} {{grievance}} about his application from the War Office for a pension and was also mad, shot Palmerston as he walked up the stairs of the War Office. However, the bullet only grazed his back and the wound was slight. After Palmerston learned that Davies <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> he paid for his legal defence at the trial (Davies was sent to Bedlam).|$|E

25|$|At the Chantilly Conference (27 December 1914) French {{agreed with}} Joffre that the British Cabinet <b>was</b> <b>mad.</b> They {{discussed}} {{the relative merits}} of shrapnel and high-explosive shell, and events on the Eastern Front. Joffre told Sir John of his plans for twin offensives at Arras and Rheims in 1915, the former offensive to be assisted by the BEF, and then a further thrust towards the Rhine from Verdun and Nancy. He agreed that the British could take over line up to the coast but only as further reinforcements arrived, which would not be until much later in 1915.|$|E
25|$|As {{the player}} explores, it becomes {{apparent}} {{the area is}} haunted by {{the spirits of the}} people who vanished in 1947, amongst others (including a Roundhead soldier who died in the original inn during the English Civil War, Timothy, Polly, Nigel and Pete). The player learns George Crabtree, the owner of the hotel in 1947, was suspected of murdering the others and then fleeing. However, Crabtree had learned of an evil in the hotel and was planning to imprison it by using twelve symbols to recite an incantation. Each symbol was on a piece of vellum, which he distributed amongst the staff and guests, most of whom thought he <b>was</b> <b>mad.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1811, King George III <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> and, {{although}} still King in name, his heir-apparent and eldest son George was Prince Regent. On 6 November 1817 the Prince Regent's only daughter, Princess Charlotte, wife of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (later King Leopold I of the Belgians), died in childbirth. Princess Charlotte was second in line to the throne: had she outlived her father and grandfather, she would have become Queen. With her death, the King was left with twelve children and no legitimate grandchildren. The Prince Regent was estranged from his wife, who was forty-nine years-old, thus there was little likelihood {{that he would have}} any further legitimate children. To secure the line of succession, Prince William, Duke of Clarence, and the other sons of George III sought quick marriages with the intent of producing offspring who could inherit the throne. William already had ten children by the popular actress Dorothea Jordan, but, being illegitimate, they were debarred from the succession.|$|E

500|$|The group's {{solution}} was to fly {{back and forth between}} Dublin and their concert destinations for about ten days to finish recording and mixing at night and during their off-days. Clayton called the process [...] "about the craziest thing you could do to yourself", while Mullen said of it, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> but it <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> good, as opposed to mad bad." [...] McGuinness later said the band had nearly wrecked themselves in the process. The group simultaneously used three separate rooms at Windmill Lane to mix, overdub, and edit. Adams said the hectic approach meant [...] "there was never anybody sitting around waiting or doing nothing". Flood called the period one of [...] "absolute lunacy". Eschewing console automation, the engineers adopted a [...] "live performance" [...] attitude to mixing, based on past experiences with Lanois. The band and production crew sat in on the mixing and offered encouragement, creating, as Adams put it, [...] "a kind of cheerleader thing. It all induces a nervous energy in you and creates a lot of pressure, and gives the whole thing a performance feel." [...] Recording concluded on 14 May 1993.|$|E
500|$|Texans {{knew of the}} {{oil that}} lay beneath {{the ground in the}} state for decades, but this was often seen more as a problem than a benefit because it {{hindered}} the digging of water wells. Rancher William Thomas Waggoner (1852–1934), who later became an influential oil businessman in Fort Worth, struck oil while drilling for water in 1902. He was quoted as having said, [...] "I wanted water, and they got me oil. I tell you I <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> mad clean through. We needed water for ourselves and for our cattle to drink." ...|$|E

500|$|U2 {{recorded}} {{their next}} album, Zooropa, from February to May 1993 during an extended break between {{the third and}} fourth legs of the tour. The album was intended as a companion EP to Achtung Baby, but soon expanded into a full LP. Recording could not be completed before the tour restarted, and for the first month of the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg, the band flew home after shows, recording until the early morning and working on their off-days, before travelling to their next destination. Clayton called the process [...] "about the craziest thing you could do to yourself", while Mullen said of it, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> but it <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> good, as opposed to mad bad." [...] McGuinness later said the band had nearly wrecked themselves in the process. The album was released on 5 July 1993. Influenced by the tour's themes of technology and mass media, Zooropa was an even greater departure in style from their earlier recordings than Achtung Baby was, incorporating further dance music influences and electronic effects into their sound. A number of songs from the album were incorporated into the subsequent [...] "Zooropa" [...] and [...] "Zoomerang" [...] legs, most frequently [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)". For the [...] "Zoomerang" [...] leg, [...] "Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car" [...] and [...] "Lemon" [...] were added to the encore and [...] "Dirty Day" [...] to the main set.|$|E
500|$|Contrary to the accusations, {{the band}} have always denied {{the notion that}} they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video. Steve Harris has since commented that, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>mad.</b> They {{completely}} got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists." [...] Harris has also stated that [...] "The Number of the Beast" [...] song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching , and also influenced by Robert Burns' Tam o' Shanter. Furthermore, the band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born again Christian since 1999.|$|E
500|$|Hunter {{reports that}} Samuel Johnson visited Smart during the latter's confinement, {{and it was}} Johnson that, [...] "on the first {{approaches}} of Mr Smart's malady, wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned." [...] However, {{at no time did}} Smart ever believe himself to be insane; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed, although not as significantly, to the Universal Visiter. In joking about writing for the Universal Visiter, Johnson claimed: [...] "for poor Smart, while he <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write... I hoped his wits would return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in 'the Universal Visitor' no longer." ...|$|E

500|$|Smart {{was left}} alone, {{except for his}} cat Jeoffrey and the {{occasional}} gawker. It is very possible that he felt [...] "homeless" [...] during this time and surely {{felt that he was}} in a [...] "limbo... between public and private space". In London, only a few of his works were still being published. However, not everyone viewed Smart's [...] "madness" [...] as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, many times. A century later, Robert Browning later remarked that A Song to David was great because Smart <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats. It is no wonder that a few of his loyal friends did come to Mr. Potter's and freed him.|$|E
500|$|On April 24, 1815, Peale, still a minor at age 19, married Eliza Greatrake {{without his}} father's consent. [...] Almost immediately, it became evident she had mental problems. Although Eliza bore Peale a child {{within the first}} year of the {{marriage}} (a daughter, Anna), she thereafter left him, returning to live with her mother, who had her committed to Pennsylvania Hospital as a [...] "lunatic". [...] The Peale family began a lengthy effort to show that Eliza Peale <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> when she married Franklin, a ground for annulment. [...] With aid from the testimony of Captain Allen McLane, they were successful, and the annulment was granted on March 22, 1820. Franklin Peale was required to post assets as security for the support of his former wife; his sister Sophy lent him some of her stock in the museum for that purpose.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, their {{military}} term over, Pascu and Fundal returned to Mediaş, where Pascu {{was discovered by}} Romanian Radio's Radio Vacanţa station. [...] He was invited to perform at the station's youth concerts, where he met and befriended Teo Peter, bass player for Compact, and music promoter Andrei Partoş. During 1982, Pascu also played Cenaclul Flacăra concerts, and was billed for the UTC's Scînteia Tineretului shows. He later described his mentoring by rock singers Cristi Minculescu, Liviu Tudan, Adi Ordean and Vladi Cnejevici as his [...] "third real school". In 1980, Pascu also discovered and became influenced by reggae music. He {{was introduced to the}} reggae style by The Police and its reggae fusion sessions, then became a fan of reggae numbers played by African diaspora students in Romanian universities. Twenty years later, Pascu told reporters: [...] "Between 1980 and 1985, I <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> about Bob Marley." ...|$|E

500|$|The plateau was undefended {{save for}} Vergor's camp, as Vaudreuil had ordered {{one of the}} French regiments to {{relocate}} {{to the east of}} the city not long before the landing.

[...] An officer who would normally have patrolled the cliffs regularly through the night was unable to {{on the night of the}} 12th because one of his horses had been stolen and his two others were lame. The first notice of the landing came from a runner who had fled from Vergor's camp, but one of Montcalm's aides felt the man <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> and sent him away, then went back to bed. Saunders had staged a diversionary action off Montmorency, firing on the shore emplacements through the night and loading boats with troops, many of them taken from field hospitals; this preoccupied Montcalm.|$|E
500|$|In the 18th century, as Blaydes continued, {{the word}} changed from possessed by god to {{inspired}} to falsely inspired. The {{result of this}} change was that British society viewed enthusiasm as the enemy to both reason and social order. Thus, [...] "Smart, the hack-writer, {{would not have been}} greeted by a hostile audience, but Smart, the enthusiast, would have been condemned immediately. The result would be obvious: his past work, previously lauded, would be ignored, and his future work would receive immediate condemnation. such was the history of Smart's contemporary reputation." [...] In determining if Smart was really mad or not, Blaydes concluded, [...] "in Smart's day, any sign of enthusiasm would have been cause for the judgment of madness [...] Two accounts of Smart and the nature of his madness have been preserved for us. Each permits some doubt that the poet <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> and could be regarded so in any age." ...|$|E

He was a good man, and I <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E
