25|$|The {{situation}} has been controversial, {{particularly in the}} case of children. In the United States, many physicians <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> explore and exhaust all non-blood alternatives in the treatment of children at the request of their legal guardians.

25|$|According to scholar Page Fortna, {{there is}} strong {{evidence}} {{that the presence of}} peacekeepers significantly reduces the risk of renewed warfare; more peacekeeping troops leads to fewer battlefield deaths; and more peacekeeping troops leads to fewer civilian deaths.

25|$|Coercive {{citation}} is {{a practice}} {{in which an}} editor forces an author to add extraneous citations to an article before the journal <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> publish it, in order to inflate the journal's impact factor. A survey published in 2012 indicates that coercive citation has been experienced by one in five researchers working in economics, sociology, psychology, and multiple business disciplines, and it {{is more common in}} business and in journals with a lower impact factor. However, cases of coercive citation have occasionally been reported for other scientific disciplines.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015, {{a federal}} judge ruled null and void a {{decision}} to grant him a permanent visa as this would conflict with Brazilian law, and ordered his deportation. The judge stressed that the deportation {{should not be confused}} with extradition, as it does not require that Battisti be surrendered to Italy, but rather to the country from which he entered Brazil, or any other country that <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> receive him. On 14 September 2015, the Regional Federal Court of San Paolo declared the expulsion illegal and canceled the order of deportation.|$|E

25|$|The {{automorphism}} j of a {{model of}} this kind {{is closely related to}} certain natural operations in NFU.

Jaquino asks Marzelline when she <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> marry him, {{but she says}} that she will never marry him now that she has fallen in love with Fidelio, unaware that Fidelio is {{actually}} Leonore in disguise (Jetzt, Schätzchen, jetzt sind wir allein—"Now, darling, now we are alone"). Jaquino leaves, and Marzelline expresses her desire to become Fidelio's wife (O wär ich schon mit dir vereint—"If only I were already united with thee"). Rocco enters, looking for Fidelio, who then enters carrying a heavy load of newly-repaired chains. Rocco compliments Fidelio, and misinterprets her modest reply as hidden attraction to his daughter. Marzelline, Fidelio, Rocco, and Jaquino sing a quartet about the love Marzelline has for Fidelio (Mir ist so wunderbar—"A wondrous feeling fills me", also known as the Canon Quartet).|$|E

2500|$|Isaiah is {{apparently}} informing King Hezekiah {{that if he}} <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> observe the Sabbath year that coming fall (701 BCE) and the Jubilee year in the year after (700 BCE)—although he calls neither year by either name in the original language—and then wait to resume planting and harvesting until the year after that (699 BCE), then God will act against Sennacherib's siege of Jerusalem (see 2 Kings 19:32–37). There is no other occasion in the Hebrew calendar when two years of scheduled non-planting occur back-to-back. Hezekiah apparently agrees, as the siege is diverted. Since the date of Sennacherib's invasion of Judah and siege against Jerusalem is known to archaeologists as {{the spring and summer}} of 701 BCE, this is evidence that the dates the Rabbinate considers to be the Sabbath years and Jubilee years are incorrect: the last Jubilee would have been 2001 (because there was no year [...] "0" [...] between 1 BCE and 1 CE, and the most recent Sabbath year therefore began on Rosh Hashanah in September 2014.|$|E
