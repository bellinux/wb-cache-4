50|$|Contrary to M. aurita, T. tricolor {{uses the}} {{insertion}} of the flexor pollicis brevis to alter disk shape and adhere to a smooth surface, rather than detach from it. In addition to that, the bat uses suction, rather than <b>wet</b> <b>adhesion</b> (via sweat-lubricated disks) as the major mechanism for clinging. When unable to create a seal for suction, <b>wet</b> <b>adhesion</b> is in fact used, but only produces a very weak adhesion. Furthermore, {{in contrast to the}} sucker-footed bat, Spix’s disk-winged bat only roosts head-up, but can cling to a smooth surface at any angle, whereas the former can only attach head-up. As such, it is of note that M. aurita can concurrently make contact with both its adhesive organ and thumb claw, whereas T. tricolor cannot. This {{may be due to the}} difference in morphological features between the bats due to the varied muscular insertions and the different functions they bring about.|$|E

50|$|Electronic {{functionality}} and printability {{can interfere}} with each other, mandating careful optimization. For example, a higher molecular weight in polymers enhances conductivity, but diminishes solubility. For printing, viscosity, surface tension and solid content must be tightly controlled. Cross-layer interactions such as <b>wetting,</b> <b>adhesion,</b> and solubility as well as post-deposition drying procedures affect the outcome. Additives often used in conventional printing inks are unavailable, because they often defeat electronic functionality.|$|R
50|$|The bat {{is named}} for the {{presence}} of small cups on its wrists and ankles. They roost inside the rolled leaves of the traveller's tree, using their suckers to attach themselves to the smooth surface. Despite the name, it is now known that the bats do not use suction to attach themselves to roost sites, but instead use a form of <b>wet</b> <b>adhesion</b> by secreting a body fluid at their pads.|$|E
50|$|Practical {{underwater}} adhesion is {{an engineering}} challenge since current technology {{is unable to}} stick surface strongly underwater because of barriers such as hydration layers and contaminants on surfaces. However, marine mussels can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater {{under the harsh conditions}} of the ocean. They use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the inter-tidal zones of wave-swept beaches, preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents. Mussel foot proteins attach the filaments to rocks, boats and practically any surface in nature including other mussels. These proteins contain a mix of amino acid residues which has been adapted specifically for adhesive purposes. Researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara borrowed and simplified chemistries that the mussel foot uses to overcome this engineering challenge of <b>wet</b> <b>adhesion</b> to create copolyampholytes, and one-component adhesive systems with potential for employment in nanofabrication protocols.|$|E
5000|$|A leaf beetle has an {{incredible}} ability {{to adhere to}} dry surfaces by using numerous capillary bridges between the tiny hair-like setae on its feet. Vogel and Steen [...] noted this and designed and constructed a switchable <b>wet</b> <b>adhesion</b> mechanism that mimics this ability. They used standard photolithography techniques to fabricate a switchable adhesion gripper that used a pump driven by electro-osmosis to create many capillary bridges that would hold on to just about any surface. The leaf beetle can also reverse this effect by trapping air bubbles between its setae to walk on wet surfaces or under water. This effect was demonstrated by Hosoda and Gorb [...] when they constructed a biomimetic surface that could adhere objects to surfaces under water. Using this technology could help to create autonomous robots that {{would be able to}} explore treacherous terrain that is otherwise too dangerous to explore.|$|E

50|$|One {{consequence}} of the incorporation of an elastic recoil mechanism to the tongue projection mechanism is relative thermal insensitivity of tongue projection relative to tongue retraction, which is powered by muscle contraction alone, and is heavily thermally sensitive. While other ectothermic animals become sluggish as their body temperatures decline, due {{to a reduction in}} the contractile velocity of their muscles, chameleons are able to project their tongues at high performance even at low body temperatures. The thermal sensitivity of tongue retraction in chameleons, however, is not a problem, as chameleons have a very effective mechanism of holding onto their prey once the tongue has come into contact with it, including surface phenomena, such as <b>wet</b> <b>adhesion</b> and interlocking, and suction. The thermal insensitivity of tongue projection thus enables chameleons to feed effectively on cold mornings prior to being able to behaviorally elevate their body temperatures through thermoregulation, when other sympatric lizards species are still inactive, likely temporarily expanding their thermal niche as a result.|$|E
5000|$|The smooth {{adhesive}} pads have shown convergent evolution between amphibians (geckos and frogs), arthropods and mammals (possum). [...] The mechanisms involved even {{appear to be}} similar. [...] This could indicate that this method of locomotion has found its optimal form in many species of animals. Hairy attachment systems of the gekkonid lizards and spiders do not produce fluids, these organisms rely on van der Waals interactions for the generation of strong attractive forces. Tree frog toe-pads are made of columnar epithelial cells that are separated from {{each other at the}} apices. Pores for mucous glands open into the channels that are between the cells which create a toe pad epithelium that has an array of flat topped cells with mucous filled grooves between them. The purpose of having cells separated at the tip is to allow the toe to conform to the structure it will adhere to. The hexagonal design around the outside of the cells (similar to the crickets) is likely to allow for the mucous to spread evenly over the cell. Smooth {{adhesive pads}} are found in arboreal possums, which are marsupials that glide between trees. [...] The possum is also capable of using smooth adhesive pads to climb vertically, making use of large toe pads. The pads consist of an epidermal layer of stratified squamous epithelium with the outer most layer's cells being flattened. The pad has alternating ridges and grooves with sweat glands emptying into the grooves providing fluid for <b>wet</b> <b>adhesion.</b> Bats have also evolved adhesive pads separately. Some bats make use of an adhesive appendage, while others have suctioning adhesive organs.|$|E

40|$|Addition of micro- and/or {{nanoscale}} textures to surfaces can enable engineering of a {{wide range}} of properties. Passive surfaces (using fixed microstructures) can manipulate cell adhesion, liquid drag, and thermal and electrical contact resistance. Active surfaces (using shape-changing microstructures) can enable modulation of liquid <b>wetting,</b> <b>adhesion,</b> and optical properties. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to fabricate the mechanically and environmentally robust microstructures and microactuators in large arrays. This thesis presents new fabrication methods for microstructured polymer and nanocomposite surfaces. Two approaches are pursued: capillary driven infiltration of fabricated carbon nanotube (CNT) microstructures and replica molding (REM) of master templates in liquid crystal networks (LCNs). First, it is demonstrated that CNT-polymer microstructures can function as robust large-area master molds. The fabricated microstructures include pins, tubes, re-entrant microwells, bent pillars, and high-aspect-ratio honeycombs (thickness of 400 nm, aspect ratio 50 : 1). All are used as master structures for replica molding. A 25 -fold replication sequence is shown with no physical degradation of the master or the replicas. Further, the increased stiffness and toughness of CNT-SU- 8 microstructures is quantified. Second, active surfaces were created by capillary infiltration of paraffin into CNT forests. Large stroke sheet actuators, exhibiting up to 20 % thermal strain at 175 °C are shown. Third, thermally and optically active LCN microstructure replicas were created. Their generated strains were measured to be 6 % and 0. 25 %, respectively. In situ monitoring of the LCN phase and order was also performed. Although having low strains, optically active microstructures are attractive for future work because they can be actuated individually and remotely. These scalable methods of fabricating microstructured surfaces, both with robust mechanical properties and active geometries, indicate promise for enhancement of liquid <b>wetting,</b> <b>adhesion,</b> optical properties, and thermal conductivity of surfaces and interfaces. However, further increases in the thermally and optically generated strains are needed to make useful active surfaces. This could be accomplished by either material reformulation, improvements in material processing, or strain amplification via design of microstructure geometry...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{chemical}} composition and molecular structure of polymeric surfaces {{are important in}} understanding <b>wetting,</b> <b>adhesion,</b> and friction.

The SFG spectral features for isotactic and syndiotactic PMMA surfaces are similar, and the dominant peak in the spectra corresponds to the ester-methyl groups. The SFG spectra for solid and melt states are very similar for both syndiotactic and isotactic PMMA. In comparison, the MD simulation results show that both the ester-methyl and the α-methyl groups of syndiotactic-PMMA are ordered and tilted toward the surface normal. For the isotactic-PMMA, the α-methyl groups are less ordered compared to their ester-methyl groups. The backbone methylene groups have a broad angular distribution and are disordered...|$|R

The structure and dynamics of nanoscopically confined films, fluids confined in carbon nanotubes, self assembled monolayers and mesoscale simulations of a variety of complex fluid systems using dissipative particle dynamics, are covered in this review. Molecular simulations have significantly enhanced our understanding of confined fluid behaviour and self assembled monolayers, aiding in the interpretation of experimental findings on these systems. The science of these systems influences our evaluation of interfacial processes such as freezing, adsorption, <b>wetting,</b> <b>adhesion,</b> friction and lubrication, impacting a wide range of technologies ranging from fluid separations, sensors, microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices to nanofluidic systems. The last part of the review concerns the study of mesoscale systems, where length and time scales of the processes are typically greater than those sampled in conventional molecular simulations (1 – 10 nm, 1 – 10 ns).
