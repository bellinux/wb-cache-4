5|$|In 1844, the Scottish {{publisher}} Robert Chambers anonymously {{published an}} extremely controversial but widely read book entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for {{the origins of}} the Solar System and of life on Earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals, with current animals branching off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant, but its implication that humans <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. The high profile of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Dennis Wise, ex-Chelsea and England player, became caretaker, and {{subsequently}} permanent player-manager, of the club. In {{his first season}} in charge Wise led the club to the first FA Cup Final in their history. When Millwall took to the field at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff they <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> second team from outside the top flight {{to play in the}} Cup final since 1982, and were the first team from outside the Premier League to reach the final since the foundation of the top tier in 1992. The club was missing 16 players from their squad due to suspension or injury. They played the Cup final on 22 May 2004, losing 3–0 to Manchester United. As United had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League, Millwall were assured of playing in the UEFA Cup. Midfielder Curtis Weston, substituted for Wise with one minute of normal time remaining, became the youngest Cup final player in history at 17 years 119 days, beating the 125-year-old record of James F. M. Prinsep. In the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, Millwall lost 4–2 on aggregate in the first round proper to Hungarian champions Ferencváros, with Wise scoring both Millwall's goals.|$|E

25|$|According to Abd Allah ibn Abbas and others, al-Fātiḥah is a Meccan sura; while {{according}} to others it is a Medinan sura.

25|$|Football is {{the most}} popular sport in Haiti with {{hundreds}} of small football clubs competing at the local level. Basketball is growing in popularity. Stade Sylvio Cator is the multi-purpose stadium in Port-au-Prince, where it is currently used mostly for association football matches that fits a capacity of 10,000 people. In 1974, the Haiti national football team <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> second Caribbean team to make the World Cup (after Cuba's entry in 1938). They lost in the opening qualifying stages against three of the pre-tournament favorites; Italy, Poland, and Argentina. The national team won the 2007 Caribbean Nations Cup.|$|E
25|$|With {{the conquest}} of Italy, {{prepared}} viae were extended from Rome and its vicinity to outlying municipalities, sometimes overlying earlier roads. Building viae was a military responsibility and thus came {{under the jurisdiction of}} a consul. The process had a military name, viam munire, as though the via were a fortification. Municipalities, however, were responsible for their own roads, which the Romans called viae vicinales. The beauty and grandeur of the roads might tempt us to believe that any Roman citizen could use them for free, but this was not the case. Tolls abounded, especially at bridges. Often they were collected at the city gate. Freight costs were made heavier still by import and export taxes. These <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> charges for using the roads. Costs of services on the journey went up from there.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the shift}} in market {{strategy}} for VAM's Hornet-based compacts for 1975 that included advancements in the American base model and American Rally was {{the introduction of the}} new American ECD or Edición Cantos Dorados (Golden Edges Edition). It represented {{for the first time a}} VAM four-door compact was not an economy base model. The American ECD was VAM's first regular production luxury compact, before it <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> two-door hardtop 1963 and 1965 Rambler American Hardtop (Rambler American 440H in US and Canada) limited editions. The ECD was restricted to the four-door sedan while the 1975 American Rally took the role as the high trim two-door sedan. The station wagon remained a single-edition model. The American ECD was equivalent in the US as the 1975 four-door Hornet DL model.|$|E

25|$|Osterman {{became the}} first UT {{freshman}} to be named Big 12 Conference Pitcher of the Week, for the week of February 19, in which she threw two no-hitters. The first, a 3–0 win over the Utah Utes on February 13 and then a 4–0 win over the Texas State Bobcats on February 15. They <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> third and fourth no-hitters by a UT freshman, and Osterman became only the second Longhorn pitcher to accomplish the feat, along with Natalie King in 2001. She also threw the first perfect game in UT history {{in a game against}} Stephen F. Austin State Lumberjacks on February 26. She proceeded to throw two more in her freshman season to match and set two all-time NCAA Freshman Class records for season no-hitters (5) and perfect games (3), the latter record has since been surpassed.|$|E
25|$|She was {{selected}} to run both individually and in the relay at the 1969 European Athletics Championships. In the 400m final she edged compatriot Colette Besson at the line by two hundredths to win {{the gold medal in}} a world record time of 51.77 seconds. This knocked two tenths off Shin Geum-Dan near-seven-year-old record. The time was the championship record for five years, after which it was broken by Finland's Riitta Salin, and remained the French record for the 400m for much longer and was only improved upon in 1987 by Marie-José Pérec. Duclos broke another world record at the European Championships, teaming up with Barnadette Martin, Eliane Jacq and rival Besson in the 4×400 metres relay to run a time of 3:30.8 minutes. However, the team recorded the same time as Britain's women's team and despite sharing the world record, <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> silver medallists at the competition. For these feats she was chosen as that year's L'Équipe Champion of Champions, becoming only the second female winner of the award after Marielle Goitschel.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourth day}} saw the turnaround. V.V.S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid batted the entire day, never {{offering}} a chance, {{and ran the}} Australian fielders ragged as Waugh called on nine different bowlers to try to break the partnership. Laxman and Dravid added 335 runs, taking India to 589/4 and a commanding lead in the game. In the process, Laxman set a new individual high score record for India, surpassing Sunil Gavaskar's 236. Laxman was finally dismissed the next day on 281. Dravid made 180, and India declared on day 5 at 657/7, setting Australia an almost impossible target of 384 runs. Australia did not immediately crumble under the reversed pressure; at tea, they were 161/3 for their final innings, and a draw looked the most likely result. Then, the Australians lost 5 wickets for 8 in a span of 31 balls, with Harbhajan taking the first two wickets in the same over and Tendulkar taking the other three. Australia fell for 212 all out, with Harbhajan leading the bowling attack with 6–73. India had {{come back from the}} dead and recorded a stunning 171-run victory to level the series 1–1. They <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> third team in history to win a Test match after following on.|$|E
