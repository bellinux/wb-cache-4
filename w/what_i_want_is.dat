500|$|For the crew's space suits, Scott was {{inspired}} to include spherical glass helmets after reading a story in Steve Jobs' biography about building an office out of Gorilla Glass. Scott said, [...] "If I'm in 2083 and I'm going into space, why would I design a helmet that has blind spots. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> something where I have 360 [...] Glass, by then, will be light and you won't be able to break it with a bullet." [...] The interior of the prop helmets had nine functioning video screens, internal lighting, an air supply provided by two fans, and battery packs concealed within a backpack. The helmet's exterior featured a functional light source and high definition video cameras with a transmitter and recorder. For the suit itself, Scott wanted to avoid the unwieldy NASA-style suit. His frequent collaborator, Janty Yates, used medical research concepts relating to skin replacement treatments and materials to develop a garment that would be believable, flexible and comfortable. The outfit comprised a neoprene suit worn under an outer space suit, a base to which the helmet could be attached, and a backpack.|$|E
2500|$|During a 2011 {{interview}} with London Evening Standard, Monáe {{said that she}} [...] "only dates androids", a reference to her musical alter-ego found in many of her songs. She also said, [...] "I speak about androids because I think the android represents the new 'Other'. You can compare it to being a lesbian or being a gay man or being a black woman... <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> for people who feel oppressed or feel like the 'Other' {{to connect with the}} music and to feel like, 'She represents who I am.'" [...] She added that she would talk about her sexual orientation [...] "in due time". In 2013, Monáe stated that she wants both men and women to [...] "still be attracted to [...] " [...] and expressed support for the LGBTQ community.|$|E

2500|$|Boros {{preferred}} {{to refer to}} himself an advocate of base running: [...] "I've always been a strong advocate of base running, not necessarily base stealing, but base running. Because ultimately, you win because you score more runs, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> to be 90-feet smarter and 90-feet more aggressive than the other team." [...] Always {{a student of the}} game, Boros' attitude toward the stolen base had changed by 1986. In an interview that year, Boros said: [...] "The science against stealing has evolved radically in {{the last four or five}} years. That has made it tougher than ever to steal. Pitchers have quicker deliveries, step off and quick pitch, hold the ball. Catchers pitch out much more often. Now you've got pitching coaches with stopwatches timing pitchers' deliveries, while other coaches are timing catchers' throws to second base." ...|$|E
