40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{membrane}} <b>water</b> <b>deaerator</b> program was to develop data on a breadboard hollow fiber membrane unit that removes both dissolved and evolved gas from a water transfer system in order to: (1) assure a hard fill of the EVLSS expendable water tank; (2) prevent flow blockage by gas bubbles in circulating systems; and (3) prevent pump cavitation...|$|E
40|$|Amultifaceted {{approach}} to condenser design was applied tothe Gilroy Foods Cogeneration Plant {{in order to}} optimize oxygen control. This unique design incorporated the following components: • A vacuum deaerator to remove noncondensible gases from the makeup <b>water.</b> The <b>deaerator</b> {{is connected to the}} con-denser through steam piping and a return line to the hotwell • A segregated condensate reheat hotwell to further deaerate the water from both the condenser and the vacuum deaera-tor. Steam injected into the hotwell reheats the condensate and acts to scrub out any reabsorbed gases; • An enhanced venting system ensuring that whatever noncon-densible gases are released will be removed and which maintains a low air partial pressure within the condenser...|$|R
25|$|The {{short-term}} ECCS subsystem {{consists of}} two groups of six accumulator tanks, containing water blanketed with nitrogen under pressure of 10MPa, connected by fast-acting valves to the reactor. Each group can supply 50% of the maximum coolant flow to the damaged half of the reactor. The third group {{is a set of}} electrical pumps drawing <b>water</b> from the <b>deaerators.</b> The short-term pumps can be powered by the spindown of the main turbogenerators.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In sugar factory, {{the exhaust}} {{condensate}} from process house {{taken to the}} boiler feedwater tank (storage tank) then by transfer pump it pumps to deaerator. After deaeration, through boiler feed pump, pumps to boiler. But in modified system, the exhaust condensate from process house to direct deaerator eliminating the feed water tank and transfer pump which saves water flashing, vapour loss and also saves energy of pump operation. By implementing the new method by eliminating the feedwater water tank and feedwater transfer pump, the exhaust steam saved up-to 2. 057 MT/hr, as well as <b>deaerator</b> <b>water</b> temperature will be increased up to 106 to 107 oC and save the water flashing, vapour loss and also saves energy of pump operation and finally boiler efficiency increased about 3. 98 %...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present works {{discuss the}} {{comparison}} between the analytical and experimental performance curve of the high pressure boiler feed pump - a multistage centrifugal pump. The hydraulic loss model stated by J. F. Gulich is widely used for the analytical performance prediction of the single stage centrifugal pumps. In the present work, this methodology is implemented for the analytical performance prediction of the 10 -stage industrial centrifugal pump. The given pump is installed as HPBFP (High Pressure Boiler Feed Pump) to carry <b>water</b> from the <b>deaerator</b> to boiler. The H-Q (Head versus Discharge) analytical performance characteristics curve of the pump is compared with the experimental performance characteristics curve. The deviation between the analytical and experimental curve is between 2 - 13 % for the discussed range of discharge. This deviation {{is due to the}} assumption of the single dimensional geometry of the different components of the centrifugal pump...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model suitable for predicting the transient behaviour ofdeaerator plant/Es presented. The model {{is based on}} energy and mass balance equations applied to the deaerator, storage tank and feed p t m p suction pipe. The model parameters are based entirely on the physical characteristics of the plant, and hence the model can be easily adapted to plants of diflerent size. A comparison with data collected from a deaerator plant operating on a 500 MW unit indicates that the model gives good transient responses {{and can be used}} to predict accurately the onset of cavitation in the feed pump.
