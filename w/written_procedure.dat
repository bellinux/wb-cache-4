Most importantly, it recognized that ASF was not able to reach its Full Operational Capability (FOC) by 2010, a goal that was set in previous Roadmaps and key documents. Therefore, the experts set the new date for the FOC to 2015. Furthermore, in the policy document it is observed that the ASF still lacked the ability to manage complex peacekeeping operations as specified in the ASF Roadmap II. Similarly, the AU experts ascertain that the RECs/RMs did not reach the full capacity to deploy a mission headquarters for Scenario 4 involving AU/regional forces. Other problems were seen in a low level of awareness and commitment among the different stakeholders as well as a lack of institutional capacity and effective coordination between the AU and RECs/RMs. Additionally, there was a slow development of the civil component in comparison with the other components. Concerning the political process, the Roadmap mentions that there was at the time no <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> governing AU political decision making and subsequent Mission planning. Therefore, the experts stressed the need for the finalization and adoption of a comprehensive Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) {{on the use of the}} ASF for AU mandated missions in order to clarify the relationship between the AU, RECs/RMs and member states.|$|E

PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and sixty French ICUs were presented the questionnaire in September 2007. RESULTS: Surveys were received from 228 (60. 6 %) ICUs. Midazolam was used in more than 50 % of the patients in 79. 2 % of the ICUs and propofol in 22. 2 % of the ICUs. Sufentanil was {{the most frequently used}} morphinic. A sedation-scale was used in 68. 8 % of the units (80. 3 % Ramsay score). Sedation was assessed at least every 4 hours in 61 % of ICUs. A pain-scale was used in 88. 9 % of the ICUs, but only 12. 5 % in the non-communicant patients. A <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> was used in 29. 4 % of the units only. In multivariate analysis, use in the ICU of a <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> for the early management of patients with septic shock and/or intensive insulin therapy was the single variable significantly associated with presence of a <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> for sedation and analgesia (respectively OR 4. 37; p< 0. 0001 and OR 5. 64; p= 0. 032). CONCLUSION: Although more than two-third of the responding ICUs reported the use of sedation-and-pain-scales, frequency of assessment was low, and objective assessment of pain in the non-communicating patients was extremely uncommon. Similarly, the use of <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> was low.

30|$|The {{presence}} of a <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> {{does not mean that}} physicians will follow it. We found that the {{presence of}} a <b>written</b> <b>procedure</b> on sedation management did not reduce the practice variation. One of the underlying reasons might be the lack of knowledge of the <b>written</b> <b>procedure.</b> Indeed, we found that among ICUs self-reporting a protocol for sedation management, approximately 20 % of the physicians were unaware of it. Hence, the presence of written procedures does not mean that there is an ICU culture promoting the benefits of written procedures to reduce practice variation within participating ICUs. Sinuff et al. showed in a multicenter qualitative study that the {{presence of a}} culture of guidelines within the ICU is key to facilitate clinicians’ adherence to guidelines [19]. Another explanation may be that written procedures apply poorly to complex situations and are rapidly judged useless when addressing complex issues.|$|E
