25|$|I {{am proud}} of what I did and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E
500|$|Mays {{said that}} she [...] "had fun singing," [...] but found the {{experience}} [...] "terrifying," [...] as she had never given a musical performance on camera before. She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: [...] "I was so nervous that day. I had to keep eating bread and toast because my stomach was so sick. But {{it was an interesting}} experience. It was definitely a challenge for me. Of course if they ask me to do it again, I <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> But I’m not going to go begging them for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Al Jean {{noted in}} an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly that it was easy to cast Lynch, since [...] "she can do edge, sweetness, and a mix of both". He further noted that the crew was happy when she agreed to take the role, and that he was [...] "embarrassed [...] didn’t ask her before she was so successful because she’s funny in everything she does." [...] Lynch recorded her scenes together with cast member Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer. In an interview with the website Hollywood Outbreak, she commented that [...] "It was pretty amazing to {{every once in a while}} look up at his face and go 'Oh my God, it's that guy that does that voice.'" [...] Lynch added that she [...] "had the best time. I <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> and again. This is kind of very much a milestone in my career. I will point to this as a big deal." [...] In an interview with Fox All Access, Lynch revealed that she is a longtime fan: [...] "Indeed I am a fan of The Simpsons. I started watching twenty years ago. I remember the first season. I remember clearly moments from the episodes and I thought it was revolutionary, the comedy of it. I really loved it." ...|$|E

50|$|In January 2008, Saint {{announced}} her retirement from the adult industry.

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1991, McCall signed for Scottish club Rangers for £1.2 million. Rangers had just won their third {{successive}} Scottish Premier Division title. Under newly appointed manager Walter Smith, McCall ended up playing in the final six of the club's nine successive Scottish league titles. In his first season at Ibrox, Rangers won the league and cup double, before they achieved greater success in 1992–93, winning both cups 2–1 against Aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of Aberdeen in the league. McCall also enjoyed European success that season when the Glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in the UEFA Champions League 1992–93 final, coming second in the semi-final group stage to eventual winners Olympique de Marseille. Citing the reason for their success as the spirit which Smith instilled in the team, McCall later said: [...] "It was an incredible season. We won the domestic Treble, we went 44 games unbeaten {{and we did not}} lose a single game in Europe. And, though we said we <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> next year, we all knew it was unrepeatable." [...] In 1993–94, Rangers added another Scottish League Cup title along with the league championship, but lost 1–0 in the final of the Scottish Cup to Dundee United, surprisingly being denied a second successive treble. The following season saw Rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of Motherwell, but they failed to reach the final of either of the domestic cups. Although their winning margin was reduced to four points, from city rivals Celtic, in 1995–96, Rangers' points tally of 87 was a record-high total. McCall played in his fourth Scottish Cup final as Rangers defeated Hearts 5–1. His Rangers side again pushed Celtic into second place in 1996–97 and defeated Hearts 4–3 in the Scottish League Cup. But with the club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in 1997–98 they had to settle for the runners-up position, with Celtic winning the league by two points {{on the final day of}} the season. McCall was substituted in the Scottish Cup final defeat to Hearts as Rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in McCall's time at the club.|$|E
2500|$|Lavelle {{acknowledged}} {{that he had made}} what he termed [...] "a very liberal interpretation" [...] of the Rules of Engagement in ordering his pilots to strike threats in North Vietnam. One of the committee members asked if Lavelle <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "Absolutely", Lavelle replied. [...] "The strikes were specifically directed at air-defense targets, where the buildup had increased in preparation for the invasion." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the guilty}} verdict David Tomkins told the Seven Network that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> if {{confronted with the}} same situation. He {{said it was the}} third time in two years that his home had been broken into, and that he only wanted to detain Boland, {{according}} to an AAP report. [...] "My proud home keeps getting broken into and robbed," [...] said Tomkins. [...] "All I did was detain one of the criminals for the police." ...|$|E
6000|$|My lady bust into {{a fit of}} laffin, peel upon peel, {{as if it was}} {{the best}} joak in the world. De l'Orge giggled and grin'd too.

60|$|Jabez kissed her, but was silent. To him, it {{had been}} a great trial to rebel. He knew that he was right, and <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> if necessary; but it was a terrible thing to him to have openly {{withstood}} the father to whom he had, from childhood, rendered almost implicit obedience.|$|R
50|$|In {{a notorious}} episode of pranksterism, Comstock once printed {{an issue of}} The News Leader using ink admixed with the juice of the ramp, the storied wild onion that abounds {{in the state in}} the spring. The {{intolerable}} stench at the local post office prompted the postmaster to extract a promise that he <b>would</b> never <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
2500|$|After the match, Suárez said, [...] "I {{made the}} save of the tournament." [...] He {{said he had}} no alternative, was acting out of instinct, and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> if it helped his team win. Ghana head coach Milovan Rajevac said the play was an [...] "injustice" [...] and Suárez was {{labelled}} a villain and a cheat. Others viewed him as a hero. Due to the automatic suspension that accompanies a red card, Suárez sacrificed himself in the semi-final for the unlikely chance the penalty would be missed, and his team would later win.|$|E
2500|$|James Bevel, {{speaking}} at a mass meeting, deplored her actions because [...] "Then [...] don't talk about the registration." [...] But, {{when asked about the}} incident by Jet magazine, Bevel said, [...] "Not everybody who registers is nonviolent; not everybody who registers is supposed to be nonviolent." [...] The incident between Clark and Cooper was a media sensation, putting the campaign {{on the front page of}} The New York Times. When asked if she <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> Cooper told Jet, [...] "I try to be nonviolent, but I just can't say I wouldn't do the same thing all over again if they treat me brutish like they did this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|An inquest {{was opened}} at Brandon Hill near Croydon on 16 July 1928 and after {{identification}} of the four passengers was adjourned. The inquest resumed on 30 July 1928 and it was explained to the inquest by an employee of Imperial Airways {{that it was not}} unusual for passengers to be taken on test flight and those on board had permission. The coroner questioned the wisdom of allowing passengers on what could be a dangerous test flight and was told all the passengers had signed indemnity documents. The employee in charge of the two girls on the flight said they had asked her for permission and it was allowed {{as long as it was}} not for more than 15 minutes. An engineering superintendent said employees were keen to take [...] "Joy Rides" [...] but agreed that it was sometimes [...] "a bother". The passenger who survived the accident told the inquest that staff thought of it as a privilege to go on a joy ride and he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Daren Lane left Riverside Park, {{and walked}} in the meadows until {{he came to a}} boulder under a huge {{chestnut}} tree. Here he sat down. He could not walk far these days. Many a time in the Indian summers long past he had gathered chestnuts there with Dal, with Mel Iden, with Helen. He <b>would</b> never <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
50|$|Asked if I <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all <b>again,</b> I {{used to give}} an unequivocal {{reply that}} of course I would. But now I don't know if I would.

40|$|Although {{the postwar}} {{conflict}} in Iraq has {{slipped off the}} front pages, the crisis continues. People are still being killed, the new Iraqi government {{is reported to be}} increasingly authoritarian, and all the evidence suggests that the war has heightened rather than reduced the threat of terrorism. Yet the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, says he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all <b>again...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The South African {{tour was}} {{cancelled}} {{and as the}} cricketers needed practice against a top team before going to Australia, and to fill MCC coffers, a Rest of the World XI under Gary Sobers was organised from overseas cricketers playing for English counties. Cowdrey was still easing himself back into cricket when the First 'Test' was played {{and he was not}} selected, but played in the other four and made 1 and 64 in the Second, 0 and 71 in the Third, 1 and 0 in the Fourth and 73 and 31 in the Fifth, a total of 241 runs (30.13). England lost the series 4–1, but three of their defeats were close and they were playing {{the best team in the}} world. These were counted as Tests at the time, but the ICC subsequently disallowed them. This meant that Cowdrey passed Wally Hammond's record of 7,249 Test runs when he made 71 at Trent Bridge to become the most prolific Test batsmen, and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> in Australia.|$|E
60|$|Lavinia spoke not, but {{shook her}} little sister till the hat flew off her head, and she had only breath enough left to declare with unquenched ardour that she <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> the very next chance she got.|$|E

60|$|THE PRINCESS. Oh, {{something}} she did. I am {{sure she had}} never <b>done</b> <b>it</b> before; and I know she <b>would</b> never have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> she was so truly contrite and nice about it.|$|R

5000|$|Nkala {{stated that}} he regretted his {{involvement}} in the Gukurahundi and that he <b>would</b> never <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> He described his involvement as [...] "eternal hell" [...] and publicly blamed Mugabe for ordering it. At the Imbovane YaMhlabezulu meeting held in Bulawayo on 26 February 1998, Nkala, who was a guest speaker alongside Joseph Msika (National Chairman of ZANU-PF), repeatedly denied involvement in the Gukurahundi genocide.|$|R

I have many a time had to stand godfather to your literary foundlings. You have never yet exercised the contrary privilege.

6000|$|... "Oh, yes!" [...] {{returned}} Mr. Skimpole, smiling. [...] "Though I forgot {{how much}} it was and when it was. Jarndyce <b>would</b> readily <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> but I have the epicure-like feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help, that I would rather," [...] {{and he looked at}} Richard and me, [...] "develop generosity in a new soil and in a new form of flower." ...|$|R
60|$|Still {{he was not}} sorry. No. He had {{hated the}} man too much, and had been bent, too desperately and too long, on setting himself free. If the thing could have come over <b>again,</b> he <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> His {{malignant}} and revengeful passions were not so easily laid. There was no more penitence or remorse within him now than there had been while the deed was brewing.|$|R
5000|$|Days later Launay {{was told}} PiL {{wanted him to}} mix a new song they had worked on. He {{was asked by the}} Townhouse manager whether he had done a mix before.

6000|$|Marjorie's {{feelings}} {{for the rest}} of the day are only to be accounted for on the supposition that she was overwrought. She had a preposterous reaction. She had done this thing with her eyes open after days of deliberation, and now she felt as though she was caught in a trap. The clearest thing in her mind was that Mr. Magnet had taken hold of her and kissed her, kissed her on the lips, and that presently he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> And also she was asking herself with futile reiteration why she had got into debt at Oxbridge? Why she had got into debt? For such silly little things too! ...|$|E
60|$|Who will {{wonder that}} Barbara had a headache, or that Barbara's mother was {{disposed}} to be cross, {{or that she}} slightly underrated Astley's, and thought the clown was older than they had taken him to be last night?

He had already had a misgiving that the inconstant actors in that dazzling vision had been {{doing the same thing}} the night before last, and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> that night, and the next, and for weeks and months to come, though he would not be there.
