Smith said that he and Corcoran then went to Monte Carlo's, a nightclub in Handsworth, and that when they left some time later, Corcoran was confronted by a man he described as a Teddy Boy, with whom she had argued at the Kerryman. Smith said that the man became aggressive, so he asked Corcoran if she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Claiming that she told him she did not, he said he then left her.|$|E
5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates {{wanted to bring}} the Convention's business {{to an end and}} return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E

5|$|After the Liberation of Paris in August 1944, the French {{scientists}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Auger {{had already}} returned to London {{to join the}} French Scientific Mission in April 1944. Halban returned {{on a visit to}} London and Paris in November 1944, where he saw Frédéric Joliot-Curie {{for the first time since}} leaving France. While he maintained that he did not divulge any nuclear secrets to his previous boss (although he had discussed patent rights), Halban was not allowed to work or to leave North America for a year, although he left the Montreal Laboratory in April 1945. In 1946 he settled in England. B. W. Sargent then became Head of the nuclear physics division. Cockcroft arranged for Goldschmidt, Guéron and Kowarski to remain until June 1945, later extended until the end of 1945. Goldschmidt was willing to stay longer, and Cockcroft wanted to keep him, but Groves insisted that he should go, and, in the interest of Allied harmony, he did. All the French scientists had left by January 1946.|$|E
25|$|During a {{visit to}} Bulgaria, Gordon and Gessi become {{involved}} in an incident when a Bulgarian couple told them that their 17-year-old daughter had been abducted into the harem of an Ottoman pasha, {{and asked them to}} free their daughter. Popular legend has it that Gordon and Gessi broke into the pasha's palace at night to rescue the girl, but the truth is less dramatic. Gordon and Gessi demanded that Ahmed Pasha allow them to meet the girl alone, had their request granted after much arm-twisting and then met the girl who ultimately revealed she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Gordon and Gessi threatened to go to the British and Italian press if she was not released at once, a threat that proved sufficient to win the girl her freedom.|$|E

Lunt, a suspected CIA agent), servicing a large and growing prisoner population of American common criminals including marijuana smugglers and hijackers, repatriating fugitive Americans who had hijacked US planes to Cuba and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> to face justice, and processing thousands of Cuban political prisoners released and allowed to leave Cuba if they could find a country that would take them.|$|E

25|$|Xun Xu {{served as}} the Supervisor of the Palace Writers {{for a long time}} and had access to state secrets. After he was reassigned to be the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, he felt {{dissatisfied}} and unhappy. When someone congratulated on his new appointment, he expressed his anger over losing his previous appointment. When he was serving as the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, he evaluated his subordinates based on their performance and dismissed those who failed to live up to his expectations. Emperor Wu once told Xun Xu that he hoped that Xun Xu would learn from Xun Yu and Xun You by promoting deserving officials and dismissing corrupt officials. A few months after Xun Xu assumed his new appointment, his mother died so he resigned and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> for filial mourning. However, Emperor Wu denied him permission and sent Zhou Hui (周恢) to announce an imperial edict ordering him to return to his job.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the idea}} for a bill of rights had been {{suggested}} {{at the end of the}} constitutional convention, the delegates <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and thought the proposal unnecessary. The omission of a bill of rights became the main argument of the anti-federalists against the constitution. Though no state conditioned ratification of the constitution on a bill of rights, several states came close, and the issue almost prevented the constitution from being ratified. Some anti-federalists continued to contest this after the constitution was ratified and threatened the entire nation with another, more partisan, constitutional convention. Madison objected to a specific bill of rights for several reasons: he thought it was unnecessary, since it purported to protect against powers that the federal government had not been granted; he also considered the enumeration of some rights might be taken to imply the absence of other rights; and that at the state level, bills of rights had proven to be useless paper barriers against government powers.|$|E
25|$|Although an {{excellent}} student, Toole curtailed his stage work {{when he entered}} high school (Alcée Fortier High), to concentrate on his academic work. He wrote for the school newspaper Silver and Blue, worked on the yearbook The Tarpon, and won several essay contests on subjects such as the Louisiana Purchase and the American Merchant Marine. He took up debating, a skill his father had used to win the state debate championship {{when he was in}} high school. Toole spoke at gatherings of civic organizations such as Kiwanis and Rotary Clubs. Toole's father bought him an Oldsmobile, in which Toole was delivering newspapers at the age of 13, even though the legal driving age was 15. In high school, Toole {{spent a lot of time}} at the home of classmate Larry McGee, and dated McGee's sister, Jane. Jane later said that Toole never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and would purposely spend almost all of his free time at the McGees'. With the McGees, Toole would engage in mischievous pranks and go on double dates with Larry and his girlfriend, Buzz. The couples often spent their free time at the local pool, or cruising around in Toole's car.|$|E

500|$|Ultima Underworld II was {{developed}} in nine months. It was originally slated for a February 1993 release, but the date was later moved up to December 1992. The game underwent {{two and a half}} months of playtesting by Origin and Looking Glass employees, and by remote testing firms. According to Church, the testing phase took more time than expected because of complaints from playtesters and the presence of numerous bugs. Church went to Origin's headquarters in Texas during the final stages of development. The team [...] "tried desperately to make Christmas", and the game was completed around December 18. Church compiled the final version on his laptop in Spector's office. However, the game was held back for further playtesting even though it could have shipped on schedule. Church later commented, [...] "here was one bug we couldn't reproduce, and everyone really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> for Christmas. We ended up taking a few days off, checking it a few more days and using that version anyway." [...] The delay caused the game to miss the holiday season. It was shipped in January 1993.|$|E
500|$|Morale on the {{battlefield}} was poor. JNA commanders resorted to firing on their own positions to motivate their men to fight. When the commander of a JNA unit at Vukovar demanded to know {{who was willing to}} fight and who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> the unit split in two; one conscript, unable to decide which side to take, shot himself on the spot. A JNA officer who served at Vukovar later described how his men refused to obey orders on several occasions, [...] "abandoning combat vehicles, discarding weapons, gathering on some flat ground, sitting and singing Give Peace a Chance by John Lennon." [...] In late October, an entire infantry battalion from Novi Sad in Serbia abandoned an attack on Borovo Naselje and fled. Another group of reservists threw away their weapons and went back to Serbia on foot across a nearby bridge. A tank driver, Vladimir Živković, drove his vehicle from the front line at Vukovar to the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade, where he parked on the steps in front of the building. He was arrested and declared insane by the authorities. His treatment enraged his colleagues, who protested by taking over a local radio station at gunpoint and issuing a declaration that [...] "we are not traitors, but {{we do not want to}} be aggressors." ...|$|E

500|$|In a war {{council on}} December 27, Washington learned {{that all of}} the British and Hessian forces had {{withdrawn}} as far north as Princeton, something Cadwalader had learned when his militia company crossed the river that morning. [...] In his letter Cadwalader proposed that the British could be driven entirely from the area, magnifying the victory. [...] After much debate, the council decided on action, and planned a third crossing for December 29. [...] On December 28 it snowed, but the weather cleared that night and it became bitter cold. [...] As this effort involved most of the army, eight crossing points were used. [...] At some of them the ice had frozen two to three inches (4 to 7cm) thick, and was capable of supporting soldiers, who crossed the ice on foot. [...] At other crossings the conditions were so bad that the attempts were abandoned for the day. [...] It was New Years Eve before the army and all of its baggage was back in New Jersey. [...] This was somewhat fortunate, as the enlistment period of John Glover's regiment (along with a significant number of others) was expiring {{at the end of the}} year, and many of these men, including most of Glover's, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> where a lucrative privateering trade awaited them.

500|$|The {{conditions}} of Lamb's release were {{that he must}} spend a year living with the Barker family on their 200-acre (0.80sqkm; 0.31sqmi) farm, under the doctor's observation. The former inmate {{proved to be an}} industrious labourer, helping to fence the property and becoming one of the farm's best workers. Barker and his wife came to trust Lamb so closely that they allowed him to babysit their three-year-old daughter, who became very attached to the young man. During his time living and working on the farm, Lamb read a number of books on psychiatry, including The Mask of Sanity by Hervey M. Cleckley, which affected him particularly. He told the doctor that he had come to terms with his condition as a psychopath and that he wished to go overseas and do something purposeful with his life. At the same time, he considered a career in the military, which Barker supported. [...] "He wanted that kind of life," [...] Barker later told the Globe and Mail. [...] "He really seemed to need the esprit de corps of an army organisation." [...] When Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on 6 October 1973, starting the Yom Kippur War, Lamb thought he had found his calling—using money he had saved from his labourer's salary and gifts from his grandmother, he bought State of Israel Bonds and, with Barker's encouragement, travelled to Israel to volunteer for the Israel Defense Forces. However, after hitch-hiking to the Israeli lines, Lamb became disillusioned by conversations he had with the soldiers there, many of whom were loath to fight and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> He applied anyway, but was turned down because of his psychiatric history. He resolved to instead tour the world, and to that end left Israel days after arriving, intending to travel to Australia.|$|E
500|$|His tragic efforts, however, were {{consistently}} ridiculed by contemporaries: when Cibber {{in the role}} of Richard III made love to Lady Anne, the Grub Street Journal wrote, [...] "he looks like a pickpocket, with his shrugs and grimaces, that has more a design on her purse than her heart". Cibber was on the stage in every year but two (1727 and 1731) between his debut in 1690 and his retirement in 1732, playing more than 100 parts in all in nearly 3,000 documented performances. After he had sold his interest in Drury Lane in 1733 and was a wealthy man in his sixties, he returned to the stage occasionally to play the classic fop parts of Restoration comedy for which audiences appreciated him. His Lord Foppington in Vanbrugh's The Relapse, Sir Courtly Nice in John Crowne's Sir Courtly Nice, and Sir Fopling Flutter in George Etherege's Man of Mode were legendary. Critic John Hill in his 1775 work The actor, or, A treatise on the art of playing, described Cibber as [...] "the best Lord Foppington who ever appeared, was in real life (with all due respect be it spoken by one who loves him) something of the coxcomb". These were the kind of comic parts where Cibber's affectation and mannerism were desirable. In 1738–39, he played Shallow in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 2 to critical acclaim, but his Richard III (in his own version of the play) was not well received. In the middle of the play, he whispered to fellow actor Benjamin Victor that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> perhaps realising he was too old for the part and its physical demands. Cibber also essayed tragic parts in plays by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Dryden and others, but with less success. By the end of his acting career, audiences were being entranced by the innovatively naturalistic acting of the rising star David Garrick, who made his London debut in the title part in a production of Cibber's adaptation of Richard III in 1741. He returned to the stage for a final time in 1745 as Cardinal Pandulph in his play Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John.|$|E

As the album neared completion, Stefani regained her confidence and booked another session with The Neptunes. Stefani flew to New York City to meet up with Williams, and after finishing two songs within a week, Stefani ended the session early and prepared to return home. A few minutes later, Williams called her back into the studio to write another song. Stefani said, [...] "I was tired.
