The increase in maximum weight of VH-UYY was only granted after all appropriate calculations had been performed to ensure the aircraft was safe at the increased weight.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe under-matching <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> is {{commonly}} used in engineering practice and the postweld heat treatment (PWHT) is the common method to reduce the residual stress in the <b>welded</b> <b>joint,</b> while the research on the under-matching <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> after PWHT is few.

The discussion {{of the influence of}} PWHT on the residual stress in the under-matching <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> is based on the experimental verification.

Considering the rupture of the <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> in the steel structure, it is difficult to obtain the structural reliability containing brittle failure by general reliability analysis. In order to perform the reliability analysis including the <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> rupture, these failure modes of the structure were classified to the mutually exclusive events by COF and the <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> performance. The <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> strength was predicted by Bayesâ€™ theorem, using the beam strength as a prior distribution and the experiment's results of <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> strength. As a result, the ratio of failure probability with the <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> rupture became about 3 % of the total failure probability.

MIG welding process was run to joint two plate of mild steel.

The signals of AE were recorded using physical acoustic instrumentation. For all five positions on defected and non-defected <b>welding</b> <b>joint,</b> the value, of hits, counts, peak amplitude, RMS, and rise time were recorded and analysed were using Matlab. The result showed almost all parameters values for defected <b>welding</b> <b>joint</b> were higher compared to the non-defected <b>welding</b> <b>joint.</b> The results also show all parameters value highest at third position for both experiments due to weight of load.

25|$|The Dutch {{aircraft}} designer Frederick Koolhoven joined Armstrong Whitworth in 1914. He {{designed a}} series of aircraft that had his initials in their designation. The F.K.3 followed the basic layout of the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c, which Armstrong Whitworth were building for the Royal Flying Corps. It was designed as an improvement, with a simplified structure that was easier to build. The prototype, first flown by Norman Spratt was powered by a 70hp (52kW) air-cooled Renault 70 hp V-8. This aircraft differed from the B.E.2 in eliminating <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> and complex metal components in the structure, and having greater dihedral on the upper wing.

2500|$|Stainless steel {{can pose}} special {{corrosion}} challenges, since its passivating behavior {{relies on the}} presence of a major alloying component (chromium, at least 11.5%). Because of the elevated temperatures of welding and heat treatment, chromium carbides can form in the grain boundaries of stainless alloys. This chemical reaction robs the material of chromium in the zone near the grain boundary, making those areas much less resistant to corrosion. This creates a galvanic couple with the well-protected alloy nearby, which leads to [...] "weld decay" [...] (corrosion of the grain boundaries in the heat affected zones) in highly corrosive environments.

The specimens for creep testing were taken from single-V weld pads fabricated by a shielded metal arc-welding process using 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel (for similar-joint) and INCONEL 182 (for dissimilar-joint) electrodes. The weld pads were subsequently given a postweld hear treatment (PWHT) of 973 K for I hour.
