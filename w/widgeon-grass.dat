5000|$|Lesser scaup forage {{mainly by}} {{sifting through the}} bottom mud, usually after diving and {{swimming}} underwater, occasionally by dabbling without diving. They mainly eat mollusks such as mussels and clams, as well as seeds {{and other parts of}} aquatic plants like sedges and bulrushes (Cyperaceae), [...] "pondweeds", <b>widgeon-grass</b> (Ruppia cirrhosa), wild celery (Vallisneria americana) or wild rice (Zizania). In winter, but less so in summer, other aquatic animals—crustacean, insect and their larvae and small fishes—form an important part of their diet. It has been reported that both the lesser and the greater scaup have shifted their traditional migration routes {{to take advantage of the}} presence of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in Lake Erie, which was accidentally introduced in the 1980s and has multiplied enormously. This may pose a risk to these birds because zebra mussels are efficient filter feeders and so accumulate environmental contaminants rapidly.|$|E
