5|$|For William Huskisson's funeral on Friday 24September, {{almost every}} {{business}} in Liverpool was closed. Huskisson {{had been a}} popular figure in Liverpool, and the authorities expected {{large numbers of people}} wishing to attend. In an effort to control numbers it was announced that anyone wishing to join the cortège submit a <b>written</b> <b>request</b> in writing to the Town Hall. This proved impractical, and the authorities put up posters around the town advising that anyone in mourning dress would be allowed to join the procession. Colour coded tickets were issued to those wishing to attend the burial, with each colour representing a different section of the cemetery, in an effort to control crowd numbers at the burial service; a total of 3,000 tickets were issued.|$|E
5|$|From 1950 to 1952, {{there were}} a series of {{disputes}} between EES director Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson over the station's finances and Rosselot's hand in founding Scientific Associates. When {{it was founded in}} October 1951, Rosselot was president and CEO of Scientific Associates; at issue was the potential conflict of interest with his role at Georgia Tech, and what, if any, role Georgia Tech should have in technology transfer to the marketplace. Emerson later instituted a policy requiring EES employees wishing to work with Scientific Associates to make a <b>written</b> <b>request</b> to the president of Georgia Tech. However, Rosselot's participation in Scientific Associates' founding and early operations ensured the eventual success of Scientific Atlanta and facilitated subsequent technology transfer by Georgia Tech's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center.|$|E
5|$|According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a backdoor {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, <b>written</b> <b>request</b> was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E
30|$|The {{choice of}} {{replication}} model impacts {{the ability of}} the data store to scale read and <b>write</b> <b>requests.</b> Master–slave replication is generally useful for scaling read requests because it allows the many slaves to accept read requests – examples are BerkeleyDB and MongoDB. However, some data stores such as HBase do not permit read requests on the slave nodes. In this case, replication is used solely for failover and disaster recovery. In addition, master–slave data stores do not scale <b>write</b> <b>requests</b> because the master is the only node that processes <b>write</b> <b>requests.</b> An interesting exception is the Neo 4 J database, which is able to handle <b>write</b> <b>requests</b> on the slave nodes also. In this case, <b>write</b> <b>requests</b> are synchronously propagated from slaves to master and therefore are slower than <b>write</b> <b>requests</b> to master. Finally, multi-master and masterless replication systems are usually capable of scaling read and <b>write</b> <b>requests</b> because all nodes can handle both requests.|$|R

5|$|To {{qualify for}} {{recognition}} by the American Kennel Club, a national breed club must first be established and a <b>written</b> <b>request</b> needs {{to be sent to}} the AKC along with a breed standard. This enables qualification for the Foundation Stock Service. The next step is to qualify to compete in the Miscellaneous Class. This requires a minimum of one hundred active members in the national breed club, along with a minimum of three to four hundred dogs in the United States with a three generation pedigree (all dogs in those pedigrees must be of the same breed). In addition, they must be geographically spread across twenty states or more, and finally the clubs by-laws and constitution must be reviewed as well as breed observations made by AKC staff. There is a typical stay of between one and three years in the Miscellaneous Class before full recognition is granted. During this time, the breed club must be seen to be active and hold seminars, matches as well as local and national speciality shows. The Kennel Club (UK) does not have a miscellaneous class or foundation stock service, instead it requires British bred dog and three generation pedigrees of them, along with details from the country of origin including the breed standard. This allows listing on the Imported Breeds Register, with full recognition granted at the discretion of the Kennel Club Review Committee.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis for}} such a request came from a long-standing {{understanding}} between the CIA and the FBI {{that they would not}} reveal each other’s informants. This effort by the White House and the CIA succeeded in delaying the interviews of both Ogarrio and Dahlberg for a little more than one week, at which point Gray and his senior FBI staff, including Mark Felt, Charlie Bates, and Bob Kunkel, decided that, due the increasing importance of these individuals in the investigation, they needed a <b>written</b> <b>request</b> from the CIA not to interview them, which would have to state in greater detail the reasons for not interviewing these individuals. Once the decision was made, Gray called Vernon Walters and demanded that <b>written</b> <b>request</b> the next morning, or he would order the interviews to go forth.|$|E

50|$|Looking at {{the case}} for {{processor}} transactions, when the block is in the Invalid (I) state, either the cache block was never fetched from the memory or it was invalidated. When there is a processor read (PrRd), the state changes from invalid (I) to shared (S), thereby generating a bus read (BusRd). At the same time, {{if it is a}} processor <b>write</b> <b>request</b> (PrWr), then the state of the block changes to modified (M) along with a snooped <b>write</b> <b>request</b> (BusRdX).|$|R
30|$|We {{evaluated}} IOPS {{by using}} the Linux tool iostat which can monitor the number of <b>write</b> <b>requests</b> issued to the specified device per second. Through the comparison of the three methods, Fig.  5 shows that the Piggybacking method had the lowest <b>write</b> <b>requests</b> per second, because it needs not to store the commit point, which could incur additional IO and then increase the disk overhead. The ASYNC method had {{the highest number of}} <b>write</b> <b>requests,</b> because the single thread flushed the commit point every 10  ms, which caused more requests than SYNC persisted the committed LSN to local disk only after the group of transactional log entries committed. The curves of all the methods had the decreasing trends with the increase in connections, we note that the commit_interval described in Sect.  4.3 would be larger as the number of clients increased.|$|R

Accompanying the letter was a <b>written</b> <b>request</b> from Judith Corley, Obama's personal counsel, requesting a waiver of the department's policy of issuing only computer-generated certificates. Corley stated that granting the waiver would relieve the department {{of the burden of}} repeated inquiries into the President's birth records.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the IWC meets annually, {{usually in}} May or June. Meetings are {{composed}} of one voting representative (called a Commissioner) from each state party who may be accompanied by experts and advisors. They are generally extremely divisive — demonstrating a complete split on all major issues between the pro-whaling nations and their supporters and the anti-whaling nations. The IWC's Rules of Procedure allow non-parties and intergovernmental organisations to attend the meetings and to be represented by observers if they have submitted a <b>written</b> <b>request</b> to the Secretary thirty days before the meeting or if they have attended previous meetings. Non-governmental organisations that maintain offices {{in more than three}} countries may also attend the annual meetings of the IWC.|$|E
25|$|Madigan {{stated the}} {{impeachment}} committee would consider the pending criminal charges {{as well as}} review other possible wrongdoing during Blagojevich's term such as abuse of power, taking action without legal authority, ignoring state laws, and defying lawful requests for information from the General Assembly. Currie further stated that among the controversial actions under review by the committee would be the Blagojevich administration's purchase of a flu vaccine that was never distributed and his unilateral decision to send a $1 million grant {{to a private school}} that was damaged when the historic Pilgrim Baptist Church was destroyed by fire. She also warned that the panel's interest in investigating alleged criminal activities surrounding Blagojevich might be affected by how much cooperation was forthcoming from federal investigators, which was supported by a formal <b>written</b> <b>request</b> to Prosecutor Fitzgerald. On December 30, Fitzgerald filed a motion to allow the impeachment committee to hear the conversations recorded by wiretap during his federal investigation.|$|E

The set of nodes that have a copy of the object, called replica nodes, constitute the replica set of the object. Read requests of a node are serviced from the closest replica node. <b>Write</b> <b>requests</b> of a node are propagated to all the replicas of the object using a minimum cost Steiner tree that includes the writer and all replica nodes. The cost associated with a replica set equals the cost of servicing all the read and <b>write</b> <b>requests,</b> plus the storage cost at all the replica nodes. We are interested in finding a replica set with minimum cost, i. e. a Steiner-optimal replica set...|$|R
25|$|In 2013, the USDA issued new {{restrictions}} to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks {{to a maximum}} of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D. In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day.

25|$|Lin also seriously {{attempted}} {{to withdraw from}} the nomination, but was not able to do so because Mao had made Lin's appointment a decision of the Central Committee, so rejecting the position would violate Party procedure and would risk ending Lin's political career. Lin was not present at the conference where it was decided to name him vice chairman. After Lin was named, he met with Mao and begged him personally not to name him to the position, but Mao criticized him, comparing Lin to the Ming emperor Shizong, who devoted so much of his time to the search for longevity medicines that he neglected his government responsibilities. In 1966 all other candidates for the position were removed, and Lin accepted the position as sole Vice-Chairman, replacing Liu Shaoqi as Mao's unofficial successor. After his appointment, Lin again {{attempted to}} submit a formal <b>written</b> <b>request</b> to Mao, asking Mao to rescind Lin's appointment to the position of vice-chairman, but Mao again rejected this request. When Lin received the rejection letter, he was so angry that he tore the letter up and threw it in the garbage.|$|E
500|$|The 2005 final was {{the sixth}} time Liverpool {{had reached the}} final and it was their first {{appearance}} since the 1985 European Cup Final, when they lost 1–0 to Juventus and were subsequently banned from European competition for an indefinite period due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. They had previously won the European Cup on four occasions in 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1984. The match was Milan's tenth appearance in the final. They had won on six occasions (1963, 1969, 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003), and lost three times (1958, 1993, 1995). In total the teams had participated in 14 finals between them. Prior to the game, Milan were assured of entering the Champions League the following season after finishing second in Serie A. Liverpool meanwhile had failed to finish in the top four in the Premier League, and had to win the final to enter the competition the following season. Even if they did win the match, they were not assured of a place after UEFA failed to confirm whether they would allow Liverpool to defend the championship. The Football Association supported Liverpool, stating, [...] "We have already submitted a <b>written</b> <b>request</b> to have an additional place, should they win the Champions League".

500|$|In his new role, Gollob {{worked with}} General der Flieger Josef Kammhuber, {{responsible}} for {{fighting against the}} enemy four-engined bombers, and SS-Obergruppenführer Hans Kammler, responsible for air armament and manufacturing of the Me262. Gollob's objective was to deploy and arm the Me262 as a defensive weapon against the Allied air offensive. Hitler's decision to use the Me262 in a fighter bomber role had not been revised. Gollob gathered data and hoped to meet Hitler {{to convince him that}} the Me262 was better suited as a fighter aircraft and not as a fighter bomber, but this meeting never occurred. On 7 April 1945, frustrated over the lack of progress made, Gollob submitted his <b>written</b> <b>request</b> to be released from office as General der Jagerflieger, but the request was not approved by Göring. Gollob left Berlin on 10 April 1945 after his staff had left for southern Germany. At that time he needed urgent hospitalization to treat his appendicitis. Gollob underwent surgery by Prof. Dr. [...] at a hospital in Igls, in the present-day a borough of Innsbruck, eight days after his departure from Berlin. On 24 April, he was transferred to the Luftwaffe hospital at Kitzbühel, which {{was in the middle of}} the so called Alpine Fortress. At Kitzbühel, he met with the last Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, Field Marshal Greim and the female pilot Hanna Reitsch. Greim was convalescing from an injury sustained during a flight by Reitsch into the encircled city of Berlin on 26 April. At Kitzbühel, Gollob was taken prisoner of war by elements of the 36th Infantry Division of the United States Army under the command of General John E. Dahlquist. Shortly after, he was transferred into the custody of the US 42nd Infantry Division commanded by Major General Harry J. Collins.|$|E
