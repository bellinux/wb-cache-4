500|$|On {{collaborating with}} Ludacris, Cruz said, [...] "With Ludacris, {{pretty much every}} track he's ever {{featured}} on sounds amazing. I gave him a quick call {{and asked him if}} he could get on the record, and he recorded it and sent it over. As I expected, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> needed to change. It sounded perfect. He put my name in there, which is great – so people know to pronounce it now properly, hopefully." [...] The version featuring Ludacris was originally released digitally as the b-side to [...] "No Other One" [...] in November 2009, before in the United States in February 2010.|$|E
500|$|The Samoan {{team was}} not feeling downhearted after the game, and even embraced and sang to the {{audience}} as the game finished. Salapu declared that he enjoyed the game. [...] "I wasn't embarrassed because we all learned something from it. If we had all our players maybe {{it would have been}} only five or six goals, because I was without my best defenders and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> could do." [...] Tony Langkilde also defended the goalkeeper, saying that he [...] "kept the score down with a magnificent display". He also added that [...] "now we are recognised by FIFA, it has really helped spark an interest in football on the islands". Samoan manager Tunoa Lui commented that football was being played in the Samoan elementary and high schools and [...] "in five years we will be competitive." ...|$|E
500|$|Irvine {{scored the}} first {{points for the}} Jaguar team in the race, having failed to score up to that point. He {{described}} the race {{as one of the}} hardest in his Formula One career as his drink bottle did not function correctly along with suffering a blistered foot. He also said that the team's issues were not fully rectified and it would take [...] "six months or so to solve... hopefully we can do it quicker." [...] Salo said that his hands were bruised during the race as his car had no power steering equipped. Michael Schumacher admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having led the majority of the race until his lap 56 retirement. He stated: [...] "The exhaust was too hot and that was why the rest went wrong. It basically cooked the suspension. I felt a few laps before that something was wrong but there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> could do about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977." [...] In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, [...] "I thought so, but there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> could do about it and I eventually gave in to it.... control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife.... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E
500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. I realized it was a fumble and did the wrong thing. I realized I was wrong but there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> could do about it." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{successful}} on track, the Mercedes team {{got into}} a discussion with Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone over the TV coverage time their drivers received during the Grand Prix. Over the ninety-minute race, Mercedes cars were visible for only six minutes, leading to their non-executive chairman Niki Lauda saying: [...] "I was watching TV all day long, and funny enough I saw Saubers {{and a lot of}} Honda cars, but I don't know why [...] Somebody must do the filming here. I have to ask what's wrong with him. I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for me out there this afternoon because a combination of circumstances meant I had to just sit back and was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, but there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> could do." ...|$|E

The last person I remember speaking to was Jackie Weaver, who reassured me that if it were our time to go, then God’s will would be fulfilled. As my trapped co-workers lost consciousness one by one, the room grew still and I continued to sit and wait, unable to do much else.

2500|$|Moskvin {{lived in}} Nizhny Novgorod, the fifth {{largest city in}} Russia. Moskvin said he began {{wandering}} through cemeteries with friends when still a schoolboy. In particular, they visited the Krasnaya Etna Cemetery located in the Leninsky district of Nizhny Novgorod. In an article written shortly before his arrest, Moskvin explained {{his interest in the}} dead, attributing it to a childhood incident during which he witnessed a funeral procession for an eleven-year-old girl. Moskvin alleged that the participants forced him to kiss the dead girl's face, writing that [...] "an adult pushed my face down to the waxy forehead of the girl in an embroidered cap, and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> could do but kiss her as ordered." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{works that}} Warhol {{submitted}} to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay. In Popism, furthermore, the artist recalls {{a conversation with the}} film maker Emile de Antonio about the difficulty Warhol had being accepted socially by the then-more-famous (but closeted) gay artists Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. De Antonio explained that Warhol was [...] "too swish and that upsets them." [...] In response to this, Warhol writes, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> could say to that. It was all too true. So I decided I just wasn't going to care, because those were all the things that I didn't want to change anyway, that I didn't think I 'should' want to change... Other people could change their attitudes but not me". In exploring Warhol's biography, many turn to this period—the late 1950s and early 1960s—as a key moment in the development of his persona. Some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like [...] "Um, no" [...] and [...] "Um, yes", and often allowing others to speak for him)—and even the evolution of his pop style—can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.|$|E

2500|$|The tour's {{rendition}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] was considered [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] and [...] "what everyone was talking about", becoming its most controversial performance. During the act, Jackson [...] "plucks a male fan {{out of the}} crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him." [...] The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then I stood up and he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> could do, so I said to myself I would never let that happen again." [...] Jackson's performance of [...] "What About" [...] is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse.

2500|$|Lifeson {{was born}} as Alexandar Zivojinovich (Aleksandar Živojinović in Serbian) in Fernie, British Columbia, to Serbian immigrants, Nenad and Melanija Živojinović, {{and raised in}} Toronto, Ontario. His stage name of [...] "Lifeson" [...] is a semi-literal {{translation}} of the surname Živojinović, which means [...] "son of life" [...] in Serbian. His first exposure to formal music training {{came in the form}} of the viola, which he renounced for the guitar at the age of 12. His first guitar was a Christmas gift from his father, a six-string Kent classical acoustic which was later upgraded to an electric Japanese model. During his adolescent years, he was influenced primarily by Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Steve Hackett, and Allan Holdsworth; he explained in 2011 that [...] "Clapton's solos seemed a little easier and more approachable. I remember sitting at my record player and moving the needle back and forth to get the solo in 'Spoonful.' But there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>I</b> could do with Hendrix." [...] In 1963 Lifeson met future Rush drummer John Rutsey in school. Both interested in music, they decided to form a band. Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons. This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.|$|E
