5|$|Wrigley Field is {{featured}} in two interwoven and consecutive scenes. In the first scene, Rooney {{is looking for}} Ferris at a pizza joint while the voice of Harry Caray announces the action of a ballgame that is being shown on TV. From the play-by-play descriptions, the uniforms, and the player numbers, this game {{has been identified as}} the June 5, 1985, game between the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs. The batter rips a foul ball into the left field stands, and as Rooney looks away from the TV briefly, the TV cameras show a close up of Ferris a moment after catching it. The scene in the pizza joint continues as Rooney tries to banter about the game <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> behind the counter.|$|E
25|$|The single's {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Herb Ritts. The music video features two parts which frequently interchange back and forth throughout the song. The {{first part of the}} video shows Lopez having a small party in her home with guests including Ja Rule and Ashanti. This part of the video is {{from the point of view}} of the guy who is being mentioned in the song. His face is not seen, and Lopez addresses the camera throughout this section of the video. This section begins <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> knocking on the door, Lopez inviting him in, and then eventually showing him the door when she sees him attempting to look/flirt with other women at the party. As he leaves, she goes on entertaining the other guests. The second part of the video involves scenes with Lopez, Ja Rule and Cadillac tah in a white room, Ja Rule in a recording studio in Lopez's home, Lopez sitting in a chair singing bits of the song, and Lopez and Ja Rule singing the parts of the final verse against a gold backdrop.|$|E
25|$|Masude quickly {{climbed the}} Nikkatsu ranks {{to become a}} top director. The {{financial}} success of his star-studded action films, beginning with Yujiro Ishihara in Rusty Knife, ensured that studio heads would continue to assign him top stars and action films. He continued to write for his own films but mostly due to time constraints {{as he would have}} preferred to hire other writers, which did after he left the studio. The films were made quickly and largely without studio supervision. In one example, Ishihara began drawing huge audiences <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Guy</b> Who Started a Storm which was released during the 1957 New Years season. Theatre owners were displeased that there were no further Ishihara films scheduled before Golden Week of the following year. The studio then order Masuda to make a film with Ishihara in 10 days. Producer Takiko Mizunoe brought him a script by Shintarō Ishihara. Masuda found it much too long to be completed in the given time, rewrote it and then completed the film within 12 or 13 days.|$|E

500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work <b>with.</b> <b>The</b> <b>guy</b> was like putty in my hands.

[...] Digital Spys Lewis Corner said that the song [...] "continues the trend as a black-eyed rock ballad of towering string sections and lyrics of despair and heartbreak." [...] Billboard magazine's Christa Titus wrote that Lee's voice was [...] "powerful and flexible as ever" [...] in [...] "the deep croons that introduce 'Lost in Paradise'." [...] A more mixed review for the song was given by Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe who wrote that the slow tempo of the song provided by piano and strings made it a drag where [...] "the band itself gets very little breathing room." ...|$|E

Langford of AfterElton said that Hollyoaks {{had no interest in}} Rae as a character, and no desire to [...] "make her a real fleshed out person". He added that Rae had no common sense because [...] "no woman would regularly leave her man alone {{for long periods of time}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> she knows he had an affair with."

Love also said, [...] "It was all about the expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light... I was trying to heal." [...] In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was [...] "posing in a lot of ways" [...] with the album: [...] "It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I'd done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I'd grown out of it by the time I was seventeen." [...] In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been [...] "consciously self-conscious" [...] when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Although ostensibly over-seeing the {{animated}} Turtles projects through Mirage, Laird had minimal hands-on {{involvement in the}} development of the original animated series, and even less with [...] series. One of the unique products of this series, female turtle Venus, is notorious for becoming one of the additions to the franchise that Laird most despises. However, he took a more active role in the next TMNT animated venture, acting as [...] "a consultant, and... working <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> I consider the head writer, Lloyd Goldfine." [...] In this role, he says [...] "rom the get-go I've been looking at everything, from day one. Story premises, outlines, the full scripts and the sketching and designing of characters and settings. I've been doing a little drawing myself. Lots of suggestions. I've seen a few of the episodes, and it's neat to see a lot of the stuff I've worked on." [...] While final preparations were underway, he relaunched the official comics canon of the franchise with [...] "Volume Four" [...] (the third published by Mirage Studios), with artwork supplied by fellow TMNT writer, friend, and Rat King creator Jim Lawson. When the new series proved a success, Laird relaunched Tales of the TMNT to accompany the fourth volume.|$|E
2500|$|The {{creator and}} {{caretaker}} of the engine. Dustin Hoffman was {{considered for the}} role. About the character, Harris said, [...] "He's so built up, who this guy is, and then there's this big thing open, and he's just this old guy making dinner with his robe on, but director Bong really {{wanted him to be}} matter-of-fact and very mundane, and simple, and kind of freaky that way." [...] also added that the character is [...] "probably a coagulation of various folks". The role of Wilford was the last to be cast, and it was friend and fellow filmmaker Park Chan-Wook who suggested Harris for the role. Bong stated that Wilford needed to be played by someone with [...] "tremendous presence and performance from the first moment that he appeared in order to convince the audience", adding that [...] " [...] turned Wilford into a lively and ironic character with added appeal." [...] On taking the role of Wilford, Harris mentioned, [...] "When I was sent this script, I was told director Bong is a Korean director, and that he'd made some other films, but I had never seen any of them [...] I thought they were wonderfully accomplished films, which really made me want to work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy.</b> I'm a big fan of his." [...] Harris was very praiseworthy of Bong, especially his tendency of editing the piece whilst shooting. Since the film's release, Bong has revealed background information about the character, such as Wilford being bisexual, [...] "He slept with Claude, the Egg-Head, Mason, and the pregnant teacher. Yet, his the One is the Engine." [...] Tyler John Williams portrays a young Wilford.|$|E
