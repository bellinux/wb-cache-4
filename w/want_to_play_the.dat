5|$|Charles Onyett of IGN {{found the}} {{gameplay}} enjoyable and {{enough to be}} appreciated by any genre fan. Yet he stated that if players were not Dragon Ball fans, then they will not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game. Robert Thompson of Nintendojo felt that the game would satisfy fans of both the series and the genre, but he would complain about the ki and Sparking Combo attacks being repetitive, and the story shifting control of the characters, stating it could make unfamiliar gamers disoriented. Ryan Olsen of Kombo.com praised the battle system, calling it more engaging than the ones found in the average RPG. Still he would call the game a cut and dry RPG, calling the Active Guard system the only exotic aspect of the game. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report called the game vanilla with an interesting twists, stating that the fans should be the ones playing the game. He also drew comparisons of the Active Guard system to the Timed Hit system from Super Mario RPG, and Rage Gage to the Limit Break from Final Fantasy. Brittany Vincent of RPGFan would call side quests like Krillin's return home an added treat to the long story. She pointed out the game's difficulty being frustrating, stating that the game will cause players to revert to the start screen many times, yet is still beatable.|$|E

500|$|Jackie Chan {{contacted}} Benny Chan {{shortly after}} the release of New Police Story to discuss plans for a new action film. Chan stated that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> typical nice guy role that has been the staple of his previous films. Eventually, Benny Chan and scriptwriter Alan Yuen came up with a daring idea: Chan will play Thongs, a petty criminal who has fallen out with his family over his gambling habit. Benny Chan had originally intended for Jackie to play a full-fledged villain, who [...] "hits women and burns people with cigarettes". However, the script was toned down to appease the Chinese censors, who found the character to be too evil. Nevertheless, for only the third time in his acting career, Chan plays a character who is sentenced to prison.|$|E

500|$|In late 2011, Bieber {{confirmed}} to radio network Capital FM {{that he was}} recording material for his third studio album, which was originally going {{to be released in}} early 2012. He later spoke to MTV News and revealed that Believe would surprise people in different ways, since it musically is a departure from his previous works. [...] "Boyfriend" [...] was written by Bieber, Michael Posner, Mason D. Levy and Mat Musto. During an interview with radio DJ Bootleg Kev, Posner revealed that he was impressed with Bieber's work ethic, and further commented, [...] "he's super talented. At first I didn't know what to expect because he's super young, but dude can write." [...] Posner said that people would [...] "flip" [...] over the beat and that radio stations would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> song. Levy also commented on the track, and described it as [...] "definitely edgier, it's more grown-up, it's more developed and it's sexier." [...] Prior to the song's release, it had been previewed by several industry insiders, including radio host Mick Lee of WZFT, who said that the song was [...] "so much different than his previous music.|$|E
500|$|Critics had {{polarized}} {{opinions on}} the production of [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl". Spence D. of IGN Music wrote that [...] "strings create a mournfully thoughtful tone" [...] on the ballad. Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy commended [...] "the pleasant mix of cascading piano and tender strings", but criticized the drum sounds for their hollowness. He nevertheless added that the drums do not prevent the song from being [...] "a classy, well-constructed pop ballad". Nissim concluded that although [...] "the emotion-filled vocals offer yet more proof that [...] {{is one of the}} finest pop singers of her generation", [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] is not as catchy as her best work. Darryl Sterdan of Jam! called it a [...] "grand-piano ballad" [...] that may stand out from pop songs on a regular studio album, but seems monotonous on I Am... Sasha Fierce as it is on a disc that contains ballads only. Negative reviews came from The A.V. Club Michaelangelo Matos, who felt that [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] sounded [...] "unfinished", and Paste magazine's Jessica Suarez, who said Beyoncé's [...] "commanding voice sounds unusually thin" [...] on the ballad. She was unconvinced by the lyrics, noting that the line, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> broken-hearted girl", [...] "rings false". Ben Westhoff of Las Vegas Weekly wrote that it was difficult to guess what inspired the development of the breakup ballad as Beyoncé married Jay-Z a few months before the album's release.|$|E
500|$|The Mellotron {{became a}} key {{instrument}} in progressive rock. King Crimson bought two Mellotrons when forming in 1969. They {{were aware of}} Pinder's contributions to the Moody Blues and didn't want to sound similar, but concluded {{there was no other}} way of generating the orchestral sound. The instrument was originally played by Ian McDonald, and subsequently by Robert Fripp on McDonald's departure. Later member David Cross recalled he didn't particularly <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> Mellotron, but felt that it was simply what he needed to do as a member of the band. Tony Banks bought a Mellotron from Fripp in 1971, which he claimed was previously used by King Crimson, to use with Genesis. He decided to approach the instrument in a different way to a typical orchestra, using block chords, and later stated that he used it in the same manner as a synth pad on later albums. His unaccompanied introduction to [...] "Watcher of the Skies" [...] on the album Foxtrot (1972), played on a Mk II with combined strings and brass, became significant enough that Streetly Electronics provided a [...] "Watcher Mix" [...] sound with the M4000. Banks claims to still have a Mellotron in storage, but doesn't feel inclined to use it as he generally prefers to use up-to-date technology. Barclay James Harvest's Woolly Wolstenholme bought an M300 primarily to use for string sounds, and continued to play the instrument live into the 2000s as part of a reformed band.|$|E

2500|$|The {{omission}} of commonly played {{songs such as}} [...] "Run to the Hills" [...] and [...] "The Trooper" [...] from the 2010 setlist led to some criticism, with the Calgary Herald suggesting that [...] "...striking a more even balance between that new material and the unsinkable, ironclad battleships of yesteryear, would have made an incredibly satisfying show that much greater".

2500|$|Much of {{the success}} of rock in Australia is {{attributed}} to the non-commercial Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio station Triple J, which focuses heavily on Australian alternative music, and has done so since its formation as 2JJ in 1975. Throughout the station's history, they have helped jump start the careers of numerous bands, through programs such as Unearthed, the Australian Music program Home & Hosed and the Hottest 100. The Big Day Out festival has showcased Australian and international acts, with line-ups spanning multiple genres, with an alternative focus. It has become highly popular amongst musicians; Foo Fighters lead singer Dave Grohl said [...] "We play the Big Day Out because it's the best tour in the world.

2500|$|After her {{retirement}} from films, Vyjayanthimala was offered many roles by big banners opposite leading actors of that time. But she refused all those offers {{as she does}} not want to make a comeback. In 1968, she was signed opposite Raj Kapoor in Mahesh Kaul's Sapno Ka Saudagar, she refused the role which went to the debutante Hema Malini, who become one of the biggest actress in Bollywood later. However, in 1975, Vyjayanthimala was almost signed in Gulzar's Aandhi with Sanjeev Kumar but she backed out from the project as the role resembled Indira Gandhi's personal life. Perhaps the most famous role that Vyjayanthimala ever turned down was the 1975 crime-drama film Deewar. Inspired by the 1961 film Ganga Jumna, a Vyjayanthimala starrer, the film was directed by Yash Chopra and features Amitabh Bachchan and Shashi Kapoor in the lead roles. She turned down the role of a mother for the lead actors, which later went to Nirupa Roy, who attained popularity through success of the film and was later cast in similar roles. Following that, she refused the multi-starrer 1981 blockbuster film Kranti, opposite Dilip Kumar, with Manoj Kumar, Shashi Kapoor, Hema Malini, Shatrughan Sinha, Parveen Babi and Sarika as the ensemble cast, which was directed and produced by Manoj Kumar himself. Apart from Hindi films, she refused the 1989 Tamil film Mappillai, starring Rajinikanth. As said by Rajinikanth who played the lead role, [...] "actor Vyjayanthimala was first offered the role of mother-in-law in Mappillai which was a pivotal role, but she refused the film even though the producer of the film Chiranjeevi came forward to give her huge salary, she said that she does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> role of antagonist opposite me and will never agree to be part of fighting scene against me".

In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic {{basketball}} team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the Orlando Sentinel published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning. 82% answered [...] "no". O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill. He said the team [...] "just didn't respect [...]" [...] Another question in the poll asked, [...] "Is Shaq worth $115million?" [...] in reference to the amount of the Magic's offer. 91.3% of the response was [...] "no". O'Neal's Olympic teammates rode him hard over the poll. He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry. O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to [...] "feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond." [...] O'Neal also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him. On the team's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, it was announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, $121million contract. He insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money. [...] "I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money", O'Neal said after the signing. [...] "I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok", he added, referring to a couple of his product endorsements. The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season. O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games. In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict.
