50|$|MMS or Mojave Martian Simulant was {{developed}} in 2007 to address some issues with JSC MARS-1. While the JSC MARS-1 does simulate some Martian regolith properties well, it does not do well with others, including its hygroscopic qualities—it has undergone weathering that attracts water, making it more clay-like. MMS, however, is hygroscopically inert due to minimal weathering {{and the way it}} is crushed, which allows it to better simulate that feature of Martian regolith, among others. MMS can be found naturally as whole rocks in a volcanic formation near the town of Boron, California, in the western Mojave desert. The darker color basalt rocks can be crushed or sorted without creating <b>weathering</b> <b>marks</b> on them. After crushing, basalt sands can be processed and graded into particular sizes, MMS Coarse and MMS Fine. MMS Dust is smaller basalt particles which matches to the particle size distribution of Martian dust. A separate volcanic event created red-colored cinder which is mined and crushed to create MMS Cinder.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{usefulness of}} taphonomical research for studies of Pleistocene mammal remains is detailed. The required taphonomical research involves two stages. The {{first one is}} the biostratinomical stage, which concerns the time between {{the death of the}} organism and its burial; for this time-span, the spatial distribution of the remnants is analysed, as well as the <b>weathering</b> <b>marks,</b> the activity of predators (i. e. gnawing and digestion), the influence of temperature, intentional human activity, rodent marks (i. e. gnawing), and trampling. in the second one is the diagenetic stage, which deals with the time-span from the burial of the remnants to their discovery; for this time-span, the influence of physical and chemical processes (including diagenetic alterations of the deposit, the influence of water, and plant-root marks) are considered. The application of taphonomical analysis provides the possibility of reconstructing the environmental conditions under which the skeleton or bone complex was preserved, as well as the depositional history of the bones (postconsumption remnants, flood remains, accumulation of bones by predators). This opens new possibilities for the study of Pleistocene bones in Poland...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. Fresh and {{weathered}} biotites {{have been}} studied using M 6 ssbauer, chemical, and X-ray analytical techniques. In the M 6 ssbauer spectra the complete interference ofboth low-spin ferric lines {{by one of the}} high-spin ferrous lines and the existence of high-spin ferric iron in the weathered biotite has been demonstrated. In view of this interference, which appears to be common, allowances must be made in spectral interpretation if chemical analysis reveals ferric iron to be present in detectable amounts. Hypothetical extension of the weathering trends observed suggests hat high-spin ferric iron is the only stable iron species in the end product. During <b>weathering</b> <b>marked</b> loss of ferrous iron cccurs, whereas the ferric iron content remains approximately constant. As a result of the instability of ferrous iron in the weathering environment there is a significant rearrangement of he octahedral layer. DURING a general geochemical study of the breakdown of the Carnmenellis Granite (Cornwall) from a deep weathering profile, the first observable change was considerable iron staining. In slightly more altered material physical disintegration of biotite occurred. Since this process appeared to be important biotites were separated from various rock-breakdown stages and analysed by chemical and X-ray techniques. Th...|$|R

40|$|The study {{presents}} {{the structure of}} weather types {{for the city of}} Sosnowiec during the period 1999 - 2013. The analysis was carried out on the basis of daily thermal data (the average daily air temperature, the minimum and maximum daily air temperature), cloudiness and precipitation. The data was obtained from a meteorological station belonging to the Department of Climatology at the Faculty of Earth Sciences at the University of Silesia. Weather types were established according to weather type classification after Woś (2010). 48 weather types were specified {{on the basis of a}} combination of 3 selected meteorological elements (temperature, cloudiness, precipitation). The number of days in the year and the frequency of particular thermal weather types, weather subtype, weather classes and weather types were characterized, and the changeability of weather types was analyzed. Furthermore, sequences of days with specific weather types were described. The analysis conducted has lead to the conclusion that, during the research period, the weather structure for the city of Sosnowiec was characterized by a great number of weather types observed, with relatively low frequency of occurrence. Weather throughout the year was dominated by warm weather types (3 [...] , 2 [...] , 2 [...] ), with <b>weather</b> <b>marked</b> as 310 – very warm, moderately cloudy, without precipitation (12. 9 %) recorded as the most frequent, followed by 221 – moderately warm, very cloudy, with precipitation (11. 6 %), and 210 – moderately warm, moderately cloudy, without precipitation (11. 4 %) as the least frequent one. A diversification in the number of particular classification units in consecutive years of the examined 15 -year period does not display significant variability.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} sedimentological and geochemical changes that {{occurred}} during the last 2200 years in the meromictic Lake Lucerne (Switzerland), one of the largest freshwater lakes of Central Europe. The stable isotope composition (delta C- 13 and delta O- 18 values) of bulk carbonates is compared to changes in grain-size distribution (clay and silt fraction), natural trace element input (titanium and thorium concentrations), and organic material abundance (C-org, nitrogen and phosphorus) and composition (C/N ratios and hydrogen and oxygen indexes). A drop in carbonate accumulation and in the delta O- 18 values of sediments between ca. AD 500 and 700 followed a large and consistent rise in chemical <b>weathering,</b> <b>marked</b> by increases in the silicate-clay fraction and in crustal element concentrations. During the following millennium, there was a long-term decreasing trend in the lithogenic trace element input and in the phosphorus loading, suggesting decreasing terrigeneous input from runoff water. The major sedimentological change over the studied period occurred after ca. AD 1800 with {{a significant increase in the}} erosion-driven silt-fraction and in the sedimentation rate. During the last century, human-induced increase in nutrient input to the lake highly enhanced the accumulation of organic matter in sediment. Changes in nutrients and oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion of Lake Lucerne during the eutrophication period (i. e., the last 40 years) highly modified the geochemical fluxes compared to the relatively stable oligotrophic conditions that prevailed during the previous 2000 years. Before the 19 th century, climate driven meromixis had a limited impact on the organic matter flux to the sediments, but the accumulation of carbonate considerably decreased during periods of lower mechanical erosion rates and high chemical weathering rates.
