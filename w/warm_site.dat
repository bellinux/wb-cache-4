Skeletochronological methods were used to assess the bone growth rates Of individuals from three populations at different geographic and temporal scales: two populations from Chubut (warm site; 1941 and 2010) and one population from Rio Negro (cold site; 1997 - 1998). Populations displayed similar bone arrangement and the growth patterns fit a von Bertalanffy curve. Three populations attained reproductive size at a minimum age of 3 yr, but at the cold site two specimens were shown to mature in 4 yr. We found no differences in juvenile growth rates in body size or bone zone width between juveniles of 1 to 3 yr of age from the 1941 <b>warm</b> <b>site</b> and the 2010 <b>warm</b> <b>site.</b> However, these traits appeared to be higher at these two warm sites than at the cold site, which is consistent with the climatic differences among the three localities.

40|$|The {{allocation}} {{pattern of}} leaf nitrogen throughout a crop canopy can theoretically affect crop photosynthetic performance and radiation use efficiency (RUE). No {{information is available}} on the existence of leaf nitrogen gradients in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) canopies, nor on how these gradients might impact on RUE. Peanut crops (cv. Tifton- 8) were grown in warm and cool environments, and the canopy profiles of leaf area index, light interception, specific leaf weight (SLW), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) and specific leaf nitrogen (SLN) were examined at 73 and 112 days after planting. Crop RUE was also measured during this period. There was a marked decline in SLN from the top {{to the base of the}} canopy in both environments. The gradient in SLN occurred due to changes in SLW and LNC in the warm environment, but only due to changes in SLW in the cool environment. The gradient appeared to be largely controlled by the light environment within the canopy, as evidenced by the commonality (across environments) of the relationship between SLN and cumulative light interception throughout the canopy. Radiation use efficiency was 33 % higher in the crop grown in the warm compared to the cool environment, suggesting that cool temperatures can limit RUE in peanut. For the crop at the <b>warm</b> <b>site,</b> RUE was 32 % higher than the theoretical RUE assuming a uniform SLN distribution in the canopy.

30|$|Responsiveness of {{provenance}} loadings to bioclimatic parameters also {{varied with}} test site. Separation of provenance loadings on the PC 1 axis was {{significantly correlated with}} bioclimatic parameters at 4 of the 7 sites: Manistique, Pine River, Turkey Point, and Ganaraska. Of these 4 sites, temperature-related bioclimatic parameters had the strongest correlation with the PC 1 provenance loadings, while a precipitation-related bioclimatic parameter was significant at Ganaraska. Furthermore, Turkey Point had the most bioclimatic parameters correlated with the PC 1 provenance loadings. All test sites, except for Orono, had significant correlations among the PC 2 provenance loadings. Both Wabeno and Turkey Point had the most bioclimatic parameters associated with the PC 2 provenance loadings. Overall, to some degree, bioclimatic parameters {{were significantly associated with}} provenance loadings and hence differences in radial growth responses at most of the test sites, except for Orono. Of these 6 test sites, 5 were primarily affected by temperature-related bioclimatic parameters while Ganaraska was driven more by a precipitation-related bioclimatic parameter. This result conforms with the general understanding that temperature is the most important driver of adaptive genetic variation in growth, shoot phenology, survival, and frost hardiness of conifers (Gray et al. 2016). Our results also suggest that at the Orono test site, differences in radial growth were likely not affected by bioclimatic parameters of the provenances, and based on dendroclimatic analysis of the year scores, the provenances had similar responses to climatic conditions. Most dendrochronological studies of genetic variation in tree species have examined multiple provenances at a single test site (e.g., Eillman et al. 2014), but our study is one of only a few that have examined radial growth sensitivity of multiple provenances established at multiple test sites. A combination of both site and provenance related sensitivities of radial growth to climate were reported for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm.) in western Canada, with provenances with warm climates grown at warm sites responding mainly to summer dryness, while provenances from cold climates planted at <b>warm</b> <b>site</b> were generally responsive to temperature (McLane et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{concentrations}} {{of greenhouse gases}} are projected to elevate global surface air temperatures by 1. 5 to 4. 5 ?C {{by the end of}} the century, and magnify the intensity and variability of seasonal precipitation distribution. The mid-latitude savannas of North America are predicted to experience substantial modification in precipitation regimes, with a shift towards drier summers and wetter spring and fall seasons. Despite these predictions, little is known concerning the effects of these global climate change drivers or their potential interactive effects on the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) biogeochemical cycles. In the post oak savanna region, I examined the effects of warming and rainfall manipulation on: (1) seasonal variation in root biomass and root C and N pool sizes, (2) soil organic C (SOC) and soil total N (STN), and (3) rates of N-mineralization, nitrification, and N-losses via leaching in soil subjected to experimental warming and rainfall manipulation. Research was conducted between August 2008 and April 2010 at the Texas Warming and Rainfall Manipulation (<b>WaRM)</b> <b>Site</b> in east-central Texas. Treatments included plots comprised of Juniperus virginiana and Schizachyrium scoparium monocultures and a J. virginiana + S. scoparium combination in native soil. Warming alone and rainfall redistribution alone seldom affected the response variables in this study. Species composition and time appeared to be the most consistently important main effects; however, warming and rainfall redistribution interacted with other experimental variables to influence root biomass and soil nutrient pools. N-mineralization rates were dominated by a 3 -way interaction of species x rainfall x time and a warming x species composition interaction, and SOC and STN results were dominated by rainfall x species, highlighting the complexity of global change impacts. The combined results of this study suggest that soils beneath J. virginiana and S. scoparium growing alone or together behaved as carbon sinks during years 6 and 7 of this climate change experiment. These changes in root dynamics, soil C and N, and rates of soil N-transformations in response to global change drivers may have important implications for ecosystem dynamics in the oak savanna region of North America...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The {{effects of}} aspect, canopy, elevation, and season both singly and in {{combination}} on soil temperatures at 50 cm depths were evaluated. The {{objectives of the}} study were (i) to develop a standard procedure for obtaining soil temperature data adequate to classify soils at the family and great group levels, (ii) to evaluate the effects which elevation, canopy, aspect, and season singly and in combination have on soil temperature, (iii) to evaluate the durability and consistency of selected instruments, and (iv) to test whether the months used by the Soil Survey Staff (1975) for calculating mean summer and winter temperatures are appropriate for this locality. Monitoring sites were established at seven elevations spanning soil temperature regimes from mesic to cryic. At each elevation, sites were located on both northerly and southerly aspects, and within each aspect under full forest canopy and in an opening or clearcut. Temperatures were read monthly using four different instruments. Marys Peak, in the Oregon Coast Range, was chosen as the general location for the study. A number of methods were used in analysis of the data. Graphs showing various temperature interactions among the main site factors were developed. The Sips statistical package (Rowe and Brenne, 1981) was used to develop analysis of variance tables for seasons as defined by Soil Taxonomy as well as an alternative set of seasons, which were based on the observation in the data that maximum summer and minimum winter temperatures lag behind the periods as defined in Soil Taxonomy. Analysis of variance tables were constructed for these seasons both with and without data from 610 meters, to evaluate data from an unusually <b>warm</b> <b>site</b> at this level. This statistical package was also used to develop a regression model utilizing Soil Taxonomy seasons without data from 610 meters. Using Soil Survey Staff's (1975) seasons but excluding data from 610 meters, elevation by canopy, aspect by canopy, elevation by season, canopy by season, and aspect by season were statistically significant at the. 05 level. This was mostly attributed to the insulation effect provided by the closed canopy resulting in reduced direct solar radiation reaching the soil surface. There was evidence of possible iso-temperature regimes occurring under closed canopy conditions at all elevations on both aspects if seasons were defined according to Soil Survey Staff (1975) guidelines. However, if seasons are defined to truly represent the three consecutive coldest and warmest months, then only two sites remained iso. A regression model with an R² value of. 98 was developed for the Marys Peak area. Variables included aspect, canopy, elevation, season, and two-way interactions; elevation by canopy, elevation by season, aspect by canopy, and canopy by season.

Based on the well-known temperature response of respiration in plant tissue and microbes, R (s) is often assumed to increase in a warmer climate. Yet, we assume that substrate availability (labile C input) is the dominant influence on R (s) rather than temperature. We present an analysis of NPP components and concurrent R (s) in temperate deciduous forests across an elevational gradient in Switzerland corresponding to a 6 K difference in mean annual temperature and a considerable difference in the length of the growing season (174 vs. 262 days). The sum of the short-lived NPP fractions ("canopy leaf litter," "understory litter," and "fine root litter") did not differ across this thermal gradient (+ 6 % from cold to <b>warm</b> <b>sites,</b> n. s.), irrespective of the fact that estimated annual forest wood production was more than twice as high at low compared to high elevations (largely explained by the length of the growing season).

Annual soil CO(2) release thus largely reflected the input of labile C and not temperature, despite the fact that R (s) showed the well-known short-term temperature response within each site.

40|$|Nitrogen oxides (NO x  = NO + NO 2) {{emissions}} from nitrate (NO 3 −) photolysis in snow affect the oxidising {{capacity of the}} lower troposphere especially in remote regions of the high latitudes with low pollution levels. The porous structure of snowpack allows the exchange of gases with the atmosphere driven by physicochemical processes, and hence, snow can act as both source and sink of atmospheric chemical trace gases. Current models are limited by poor process understanding and often require tuning parameters, for example the recently developed air-snow exchange model by Bock et al. (2016) requires an unrealistically large growth rate of snow grains to explain the NO 3 − peak in surface snow at Dome C in the summer. Here, two multi-phase physical models were developed from first principles constrained by observed atmospheric nitrate, HNO 3, to describe the air-snow interaction of nitrate. Similar {{to most of the}} previous approaches, the first model assumes that below a threshold temperature, T o, the air-snow grain interface is pure ice and above T o, a disordered interface (DI) emerges assumed to be covering the entire grain surface. The second model assumes that Air-Ice interactions dominate over the entire temperature range below melting and that only above the eutectic temperature, liquid is present in the form of micropockets in grooves. The models are validated with available year-round observations of nitrate in snow and air at a cold site on the Antarctica Plateau (Dome C, 75 ° 06 ′ S, 123 ° 33 ′ E, 3233  m a. s. l.) and at a relatively <b>warm</b> <b>site</b> on the Antarctica coast (Halley, 75 ° 35 ′ S, 26 ° 39 ′ E, 35  m a. s. l). The first model agrees reasonably well with observations at Dome C (C v (RMSE)  =  1. 34), but performs poorly at Halley (C v (RMSE)  =  89. 28) while the second model reproduces with good agreement observations at both sites without any tuning (C v (RMSE)  =  0. 84 at both sites). It is therefore suggested that air-snow interactions of nitrate in the winter are determined by non-equilibrium surface adsorption and co-condensation on ice coupled with solid-state diffusion inside the grain, similar to Bock et al. (2016). In summer, however, the air-snow exchange of nitrate is mainly driven by solvation into liquid micropockets following Henry’s law with contributions to total NO 3 − concentrations of 75  % and 80  % at Dome C and Halley respectively. It is also found that liquid volume of the snow grain and air-micropocket partitioning of HNO 3 are sensitive to total solute concentration and pH. In conclusion, the second model can be used to predict nitrate concentration in surface snow over the entire range of environ- mental conditions typical for Antarctica and forms a basis for parameterisations in regional or global atmospheric chemistry models...|$|E

Across sampled ranges of soil texture, soil pH, and precipitation, it appears that temperature affects leaf nitrogen for A. saccharum near its northern range limit (R 2 = 0. 64), whereas {{there was no significant}} leaf N ~ temperature relationship for A. balsamea. Higher A. saccharum leaf N at <b>warm</b> <b>sites</b> was associated with increased survival and growth.

The vines are choice plantings for growers due to their hardy vine stalks and resistance to the cold winter frost that is commonplace in Eastern Washington. Washington Cabernet Sauvignon is characterized by its fruitiness and easy drinking styles that are not overly tannic. Recent Washington American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) that have seen some success with their Cabernet Sauvignons include Red Mountain, Walla Walla Valley {{and parts of the}} Yakima Valley AVA near the Tri-Cities region.|$|R
