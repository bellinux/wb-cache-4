60|$|He was gone, and Averil, though rather frightened, {{gave him}} {{infinite}} credit for keeping his temper; and perhaps he deserved it, considering the annoyance {{and the nature}} of the provocation; but she did not reflect how much might have been prevented by more forethought and less pre-occupation. She said not a word, but quietly returned to her copying; and when Henry came with paper and poker to remove the damage, she only shoved back her chair, and sat <b>waiting,</b> <b>pen</b> in hand, resigned and ironical.|$|E

60|$|As a {{good thing}} when {{it is to be}} done cannot be done too quickly, Laura was anxious that Pen's {{marriage}} intentions should be put into execution as speedily as possible, and pressed on his arrangements with rather a feverish anxiety. Why could she not <b>wait?</b> <b>Pen</b> could afford to do so with perfect equanimity, but Laura would hear of no delay. She wrote to Pen: she implored Pen: she used every means to urge expedition. It seemed as if she could have no rest until Arthur's happiness was complete.|$|R

60|$|The {{situation}} was, however, delightful: it was charming to sit {{and look}} at Sylvia, her portfolio in her lap, pen in hand, and her blue eyes turned toward me, anxiously {{waiting for me to}} speak; it was so enchanting that my mind could with difficulty be kept to the work in hand. But it would not do to keep Sylvia <b>waiting.</b> Her <b>pen</b> began to tap impatiently upon the paper, and I went on. We had written a page or two when she interrupted me.|$|R
40|$|The Antiproton Generation and Storage Facility (AGSF) creates copious {{quantities}} of antiprotons, for bottling and transportation to remote cancer therapy centers. The # 12;first {{step in the}} generation and storage process is to accelerate an intense proton beam down the Main Linac for injection into the Main Ring, which is a Rapid Cycling Synchrotron that accelerates the protons to high energy. The beam is then extracted from the ring into a transfer line and into a Proton Target. Immediately downstream of the target is an Antiproton Collector that captures some of the antiprotons and focuses them into a beam that is transported sequentially into two antiproton rings. The Precooler ring rapidly manipulates antiproton bunches from short and broad (in momentum) to long and thin. It then performs some preliminary beam cooling, in the {{fraction of a second}} before the next proton bunch is extracted from the Main Ring. Pre-cooled antiprotons are passed on to the Accumulator ring before the next antiprotons arrive from the target. The Accumulator ring cools the antiprotons, compressing them into a dense state that is convenient for mass storage over many hours. Occasionally the Accumulator ring decelerates a large number of antiprotons, injecting them into a Deceleration Linac that passes them into a <b>waiting</b> <b>Penning</b> trap...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to directly compare Salmonella isolation rates from pig slaughtered after ~ 4 hours holding on slatted or solid concrete floors. Seven truckloads (replicates) of market swine (~ 120 kg) from a fully integrated farrow-to-slaughter operation were studied. At unloading, groups of pigs (15 - 30) were sorted to 1) no-hold (20 - 45 minutes <b>waiting),</b> 2) <b>pens</b> with solid concrete floors (~ 4 hours), 3) slatted concrete floors (~ 4 hours). Postmortem samples were cultured for Salmonella. Those pigs held in pens with slatted floors (63. 6 %) had significantly (P < 0. 05) less Salmonella in their ceca than those held on solid floors (72. 7 %) ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have seen}} her reading other books {{early in the day}} but never without a guilty look on her face, for she thought reading was scarce respectable until night had come. She spends the forenoon in what she calls doing nothing, which may consist in {{stitching}} so hard that you would swear she was an over-worked seamstress at it for her life, or you will find her on a table with nails in her mouth, and anon she has to be chased from the garret (she has suddenly decided to change her curtains), or she is under the bed searching for band-boxes and asking sternly where we have put that bonnet. On the whole she is behaving in a most exemplary way to-day (not once have we caught her trying {{to go out into the}} washing-house), and we compliment her at dinner-time, partly because she deserves it, and partly to make her think herself so good that she will eat something, just to maintain her new character. I question whether one hour of all her life was given to thoughts of food; in her great days to eat seemed to her to be waste of time, and afterwards she only ate to boast of it, as something she had done to please us. She seldom remembered whether she had dined, but always presumed she had, and while she was telling me in all good faith what the meal consisted of, it might be brought in. When in London I had to hear daily what she was eating, and perhaps she had refused all dishes until they produced the pen and ink. These were flourished before her, and then she would say with a sigh, ‘Tell him I am to eat an egg.’ But they were not so easily deceived; they <b>waited,</b> <b>pen</b> in hand, until the egg was eaten.|$|R
5000|$|In 1879, she {{published}} {{her first}} novel, Won by <b>Waiting,</b> under the <b>pen</b> name of [...] "Edna Lyall" [...] (apparently derived from transposing letters from Ada Ellen Bayly). The book {{was not a}} success. Success came with We Two, based {{on the life of}} Charles Bradlaugh, a social reformer and advocate of free thought. Her historical novel In the Golden Days was the last book read to John Ruskin on his deathbed; while Hope the Hermit was a best-seller set in the Lake District which was later an inspiration for Hugh Walpole's Rogue Herries.|$|R
30|$|As {{part of the}} 2015 {{investigation}} Farmwatch {{captured the}} hideous suffering of calves in an abattoir. It was first shown on Sunday, a New Zealand current affairs programme, on November 29, 2015. More footage was shown in a video released by Farmwatch after the show. It included scenes of cows being separated from their calves; calves and cows mishandled on the farm; calves in <b>pens</b> <b>waiting</b> hours in the heat for pick up; calves being thrown on trucks; and at the abattoir where they were kicked, beaten, and hurled on concrete floors. (Farmwatch, 2015). This footage can be viewed here: [URL] The footage went viral on news sites and social media. SAFE placed a graphic campaign in The UK Guardian with {{an image of a}} dead bobby calf in a glass of milk stained with blood. It contained the message that New Zealand dairy was “contaminated with cruelty”. It ran once in the hard copy and online for two weeks.|$|R
6000|$|I {{wanted a}} change. I wanted variety of some kind. It came. Mr. Goodman went {{away for a}} week and left me the post of chief editor. It {{destroyed}} me. The first day, I wrote my [...] "leader" [...] in the forenoon. The second day, I had no subject and put it off till the afternoon. The third day I put it off till evening, and then copied an elaborate editorial out of the [...] "American Cyclopedia," [...] that steadfast friend of the editor, all over this land. The fourth day I [...] "fooled around" [...] till midnight, and then fell back on the Cyclopedia again. The fifth day I cudgeled my brain till midnight, and then kept the press <b>waiting</b> while I <b>penned</b> some bitter personalities on six different people. The sixth day I labored in anguish till far into the night and brought forth--nothing. The paper went to press without an editorial. The seventh day I resigned. On the eighth, Mr. Goodman returned and found six duels on his hands--my personalities had borne fruit.|$|R
6000|$|I am {{very unhappy}} and humiliated at not having succeeded in again putting {{my hand on}} you, and the fear that you may {{possibly}} have departed altogether is a fearful aggravation of my misery. Therefore I am verily stricken--so stricken as to be incapable of holding a pen and to be reduced to this ugly--by which I mean this thoroughly beautiful--substitute. If I <b>wait</b> for a <b>pen,</b> God knows when or where I shall overtake you. Accordingly, in my effort to catch up, I let Remington shamelessly loose. I lash his sides--I damn his eyes. Be found by him, my dear man, somehow or somewhere--before the burden of my shame crushes me to the earth and I sink beneath it into a frequently desired grave. The worst of it all is that I saw E. Fawcett yesterday {{and he told me}} he really believed you had gone. I hammer away, but I don't in the least know where to send this. Fawcett gave me a sort of a tip--at which I think I shall clutch. A day or two after I last saw you I went out of town till the following Monday, and then, coming back, had but the Tuesday here, crammed with a frenzy and fury of conflicting duties. On Wednesday I was obliged to dash away again--to go down to Rye, where domestic complications of the gravest order held me fast the rest of the week, or at least till the Saturday, when I rushed up to town only in time to rush off again and spend, at Cobham, two days with the Godkins, to whose ensconcement there it had been, for a long time before, one of the features of a devouring activity that I had responsibly helped to contribute. But now that I am at home again till, as soon as possible, I succeed in breaking away {{for the rest of the}} summer, I have lost you beyond recall, and my affliction is deep and true. But we know what it is better to have done even as an accompaniment of losing than never to have done at all. And I didn't do nothing at all--on the contrary, I did that: that which is better. This is but a flurried and feverish word--hurried off in the hope of keeping your inevitable hating me from becoming a settled habit. I follow you with much sympathy, and with still more interest, attention and hope. I follow you, in short, with a great many sentiments. May the great globe whirl round before long some such holiday for you as will convert--for me--the pursuit I so inadequately allude to into something in the nature of an encounter. Only write to me. Do write to me. I mean when you begin to see your way. I know you will have lots to do first--and I am very patient, as befits one who is so constantly yours, ...|$|R
