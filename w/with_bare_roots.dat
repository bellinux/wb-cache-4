The average figures for the height, the thickness of the root neck and the volume of the root system showed almost identical development of <b>bare</b> <b>root</b> and containerized seedlings in the forest cover, even though the figures of individual seedlings were highly variable. When reviewing the development of the root system, I found unacceptable deformation of the main taproot at 25 % containerized seedlings and 20 % <b>bare</b> <b>root</b> seedlings. The remaining seedlings were without deformation or with acceptable deformation of the taproot (wavy taproot, unbalanced taproot with the axis in the above-ground part, an outgrowth).

For <b>bare</b> <b>root</b> transplants, crown diameters were between 3. 0 and 5. 0 mm (class 1); 5. 1 and 8. 0 mm (class 2) and greater than 8. 1 mm (class 3).
