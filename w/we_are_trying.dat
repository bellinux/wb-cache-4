5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E

500|$|Upon the album's {{release in}} January 1970, Malcolm Jones {{was shocked by}} the {{substandard}} musicianship on the Gilmour and Waters-produced songs: [...] "I felt angry. It's like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind". Gilmour said: [...] "Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to show what Syd was really like. But perhaps <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to punish him". Waters was more positive: [...] "Syd is a genius".|$|R

30|$|When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to {{implement}} the action plans at different river sites, we have faced some conflicts with the larger community who live around those rivers. One of the incidents <b>was</b> when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> posting some notices that prevent the disposing of wastes into the buffered zones of rivers. The community assumed <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to destruct their residence. Because of this the representatives or focal persons of some sectors have gone away fearing for their personal security (Interview: 03 / 05 / 2017).|$|R
500|$|After the {{advertising}} run critiquing Time magazine in USA Today had completed, the Church of Scientology mounted a $3 million public relations campaign about Scientology in USA Today, in June 1991. The Church of Scientology placed a 48-page advertising supplement in 1.8million copies of USA Today. In {{a statement to}} the St. Petersburg Times, Scientology spokesman Richard Haworth explained [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to do is put the actual facts of Dianetics and Scientology out there".|$|E
500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] {{is based}} on Peter Buck's mandolin-playing. Buck said, [...] "The verses {{are the kinds of}} things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't really say {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to get away from those kind of songs, but like I said before, those are some good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E
500|$|Speaking to The Times in 1958, Cartier {{explained}} that television was still developing as a medium, and {{that part of}} his work was to help create the next generation of those who would produce television drama. [...] "The BBC is producing producers as well as plays. They are feeling their way towards what television drama will one day be, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to create a generation of writers who study the medium." [...] His 1994 obituary in the same newspaper judged that he had been successful in creating a lasting influence on later producers, describing his 1962 production of the opera Carmen as [...] "an example and inspiration to a younger generation of television producers".|$|E

500|$|The {{programme}} {{received some}} criticism in Norfolk for its inaccurate depiction of local accents. Local journalist and broadcaster Keith Skipper told the Eastern Daily Press: [...] "If {{they are going}} to set these dramas in a specific location with locals and extras surely they should get the accent right otherwise it is self defeating." [...] An ITV spokesman told the paper: [...] "We hired a professional dialect coach to help the actors achieve their Norfolk accent. The Norfolk accent is different in one area of Norfolk to another. What <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to achieve is something that resembles a Norfolk accent that cannot be pinned down." [...] However, he failed to identify any area of Norfolk in which the accent contains a Mummerset [...] "r".|$|E
500|$|Other {{companies}} {{have also been}} affected. For example, the private Sterling Airlines declared bankruptcy on 29 October 2008. The national airline Icelandair has noticed a significant slump in domestic demand for flights. However, the airline states that year-on-year international demand is up from last year. Guðjón Arngrímsson, {{a spokesman for the}} airline, said [...] "we're getting decent traffic from other markets... <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to let the weak [...] help us." [...] He has also stated {{that it is impossible to}} predict whether the company will be profitable this year. Morgunblaðið, an Icelandic newspaper, is cutting some jobs and merging parts of its operations with the media corporation 365. The newspaper 24 stundir has ceased publication due to the crisis, resulting in the loss of 20 jobs.|$|E
500|$|Pranks {{at the two}} {{institutions}} {{are seen as a}} way to relax from the stress of the notoriously rigorous academics of each. [...] Both Caltech and MIT have a set of pranking ethics, stating that pranks should be reversible and not cause permanent damage, and emphasize creativity and originality. [...] In recent years, pranking has been officially encouraged by Tom Mannion, Caltech's Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs and Campus Life. [...] "The grand old days of pranking have gone away at Caltech, and that's what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to bring back," [...] reported The Boston Globe, which noted that [...] "security has orders not to intervene in a prank unless officers get Mannion's approval beforehand." [...] However, hacks at MIT are generally more secretive and often do not involve identifying the hackers.|$|E

500|$|Western analysts {{generally}} see the Eurasian Economic Union {{as a way}} {{to reunite}} many of the former Soviet republics. For example, Washington Post author Abigail Hauslohner wrote the treaty was intended [...] "to further bolster 's ties to former Soviet republics." [...] The United States expressed its opposition to the Eurasian Union, claiming it is [...] "an attempt" [...] to re-establish a USSR-type union among the former Soviet republics. In December 2012, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed [...] "It's not going to be called that [...] It's going to be called customs union, it will be called the Eurasian Union and all of that, but let's make no mistake about it. We know what the goal is and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to figure out effective ways to slow down or prevent it".|$|E
500|$|Before {{leaving town}} after Congress adjourned in March 1865, Stevens privately urged Lincoln {{to press the}} South hard militarily, though the war was ending. [...] Lincoln replied, [...] "Stevens, {{this is a pretty}} big hog <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to catch and to hold when we catch him. [...] We must take care that he does not slip away from us." [...] Never to see Lincoln again, Stevens left with [...] "a homely metaphor but no real {{certainty}} of having left as much as a thumbprint on Lincoln's policy.” On the evening of April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. [...] Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln's funeral train stopped in Lancaster; he was said to be ill. Trefousse speculated he may avoided the rites for other reasons. [...] According to Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, Stevens stood at a railroad bridge and lifted his hat.|$|E
500|$|In envisaging how the mind's {{interior}} {{would be}} depicted, the filmmakers {{concentrated on the}} word electrochemical; Ralph Eggleston, the film's production designer, explained, [...] "It meant thinking of things as energy or energy-based, excitable." [...] Each emotion has a glowing, [...] "effervescent quality" [...] to them (particularly Joy), which was difficult to animate {{as it could be}} viewed as distracting. [...] "The characters are created with this energy because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to represent what emotions would look like. They are made up of particles that actually move. Instead of being skin and solid, it is a massive collection of energy," [...] Docter remarked. The team worked for eight months on Joy's [...] "sparkly" [...] aura, but was prepared to delete it, as it would affect the film's budget. However, Lasseter requested that it be applied for each emotion. [...] "You could hear the core technical staff just hitting the ground, the budget falling through the roof," [...] recalled Eggleston.|$|E

500|$|Corresponding {{with general}} {{developments}} within feminism, and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement {{began in the}} 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s. Jeremy Strick, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, described the feminist art movement as [...] "the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period", and Peggy Phelan says that it [...] "brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing {{over the past four}} decades". Feminist artist Judy Chicago, who created The Dinner Party, a set of vulva-themed ceramic plates in the 1970s, said in 2009 to ARTnews, [...] "There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male Eurocentric narrative. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to change the future: to get girls and boys to realize that women's art is not an exception—it's a normal part of art history." [...] A feminist approach to the visual arts has most recently developed through Cyberfeminism and the posthuman turn, giving voice to the ways [...] "contemporary female artists are dealing with gender, social media and the notion of embodiment".|$|E
500|$|By April 2000, Columbia dropped Doctor Strange, {{which then}} had Michael France {{attached}} {{to write a}} script and interest from Chuck Russell and Stephen Norrington to direct. By June 2001, Dimension Films acquired the film rights, with Goyer back on board as writer and director. Goyer hinted scheduling conflicts might ensue with a film adaptation of Murder Mysteries, and promised not to be highly dependent on computer-generated imagery. However, by August 2001, Miramax acquired the film rights from Dimension, and by March 2002, Goyer {{had dropped out of}} the project. A 2005 release date was announced the next March, while in June 2004, a script still had yet to be written. Marvel Studios CEO Avi Arad stated, [...] "We are nowhere with that. That's a tough one to write, but we are working on it. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to find the real Jerry Garcia of the writing community." [...] In April 2005, Paramount Pictures acquired Doctor Strange from Miramax, as part of Marvel Studios' attempt to independently produce their own films. At the time, the film was projected to have a budget of no more than $165 million.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} that became Ibuki has been originally {{conceived as a}} ninja boy before the gender was swapped, and the male version's design might have been re-used for Ibuki's sparring partner Yūta Homura. Super Street Fighter IV main battle planner said Ibuki is an [...] "orthodox ninja at first glance, but her character {{is one of a}} normal girl, so <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to bring out her feminine side in her lines and dialogue as well as in her proportions." [...] The game's director said she was probably the most difficult character to make while trying to best show [...] "her charm, even behind the mask," [...] as [...] "Ibuki is cute even at a first glance, so that might be what you focus on, but we've also put a lot of effort into her motions and her design." [...] Ibuki's English voice actress Kat Steel, hired for her knowledge of the character displayed during the audition, wrote it [...] "was a treat because her character is sassy, mischievous, and oh so girlish!" [...] For Street Fighter X Tekken, Capcom abortively planned to give Ibuki some attacks featuring Don.|$|E

500|$|In September 1939, Britain {{entered the}} Second World War, which lasted until 1945. During the war, many of London's {{children}} were evacuated {{to avoid the}} frequent aerial bombing. The suggestion by senior politician Lord Hailsham that the two princesses should be evacuated to Canada was rejected by Elizabeth's mother, who declared, [...] "The children won't go without me. I won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave." [...] Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret stayed at Balmoral Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk. From February to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived {{for most of the}} next five years. At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments. In 1940, the 14-year-old Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who had been evacuated from the cities. She stated: [...] "We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant sailors, soldiers and airmen, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying,</b> too, to bear our share of the danger and sadness of war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well." ...|$|E
500|$|When the Cuban {{government}} blocked {{access to}} Sánchez's blog from the island, it also blocked {{access to the}} DesdeCuba website, where these other blogs were housed. The other bloggers faced the same challenges Sánchez had in maintaining their blogs, and also needed to find ways around the censorship—either relying on friends with access inside Cuba from their government offices, using complex and time-consuming workarounds to find 'back doors' into their blogs, or reaching out to friends and strangers abroad who volunteered to help, [...] and who posted email blog entries they {{would never be able}} to see. [...] With their blogs targeted to Cuban readers on the island, the discouragement was compounded by knowing that even if they could post, their readers could not read the posts. This limitation was circumvented by making copies of the blogs on CDs, either from computers on the island with access to the website, or sent from friends abroad. [...] Although this method of disseminating the blogs was slow and delayed, and readers could not comment directly on the website, it was quite effective and continues to this day [...] Sanchéz said to a known Venezuelan blogger that visited her in Havana: [...] "In any case <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to educate others so blogging would become in Cuba a permanent feature, a means of democratizing citizen expression, as in the free world." ...|$|E
500|$|Pavelić and his {{followers}} intended to create an [...] "ethnically pure" [...] Croatia through the mass murder and deportation of Serbs, Jews and other non-Croats. Only about {{fifty percent of the}} NDH's 6.2 million inhabitants were Croat. Nearly two million Serbs, about one-third of the NDH's total population, now found themselves within the borders of the newly formed state. In addition, Serb-majority areas covered between 60 and 70 percent of the NDH's total landmass. [...] "The Croatian state cannot exist if 1.8 million Serbs are living in it and if we have a powerful Serbian state at our backs," [...] Croatia's future Foreign Minister Mladen Lorković explained. [...] "Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to make the Serbs disappear from our regions." [...] Dido Kvaternik, a senior Ustaše official, was entrusted with [...] "cleansing" [...] Bjelovar and its surroundings. The younger Kvaternik recalled: [...] "When we triumphantly returned home from abroad and when Pavelić decided that I should take over the implementation of the measures against Serbs and Jews, I obeyed immediately and without hesitation because I knew that this question had to be resolved {{for the future of the}} Croatian people and state, and that someone had to make the sacrifice so that these odious but necessary measures could be carried out." [...] Pavelić's orders for the extermination of non-Croats in and around Bjelovar were likely delivered orally to ensure that no written evidence remained.|$|E
