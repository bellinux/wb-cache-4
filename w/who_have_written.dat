25|$|The {{state of}} the {{military}} medical corps before Augustus is unclear. Corpsmen certainly existed {{at least for the}} administration of first aid and were enlisted soldiers rather than civilians. The commander of the legion was held responsible for removing the wounded from the field and insuring that they got sufficient care and time to recover. He could quarter troops in private domiciles if he thought necessary. Authors <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> of Roman military activities before Augustus, such as Livy, mention that wounded troops retired to population centers to recover.|$|E

25|$|Several centuries {{after its}} founding, the Great Mosque of Kairouan {{is the subject}} of {{numerous}} descriptions by Arab historians and geographers in the Middle Ages.

25|$|A {{great deal}} of {{uncertainty}} surrounds {{the actual number of}} Mexican casualties from the incident. According to John Robert Carter of the 25th Infantry Regiment (which replaced the 35th Infantry in Nogales), the US believed that as many as 125 persons were killed and 300 wounded. However, the official report by the Mexican government lists the dead at 15, with special attention given to the actions of Francisco Gallegos, Andres Ceceña and the fallen mayor Felix B. Peñaloza (the latter of whom has been consistently ignored by the few US observers <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> about the battle). Although the actual number of casualties between the wildly varying figures given by the US and Mexican governments is uncertain, the Sonoran dead included three-year-old Julia Medina, 17-year-old María Esquivel and María Leal, shot while hanging clothes near the border.|$|E

R.
