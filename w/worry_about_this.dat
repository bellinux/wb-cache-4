500|$|Some {{media have}} been {{critical}} of the adult-oriented material created by fans. In some cases, these videos may appear in Internet searches that children may perform while looking for online copies of the program or while searching for images of characters from the show, forcing parents to have to discuss pornography and sex with their children. One parody series, drawn by animator Max Gilardi in the style of John Kricfalusi, places the characters in explicit adult situations and was described by the web site io9 as [...] "disgusting ... and most certainly NSFW". A segment on The Howard Stern Show in July 2012 weighed on the pornographic aspect of the brony fandom, often referred to as [...] "clop". Slates Amanda Marcotte opined that the transformation of the pony characters into teenage girls for the [...] feature film was a move to satisfy the adult fans who [...] "have expressed a strong interest in seeing the Ponies in sexy, humanized forms". In one case, a brony who claimed to be engaged to Twilight Sparkle wrote to a fan artist who drew the character in erotic situations, demanding that he cease such work; the letter was highlighted by several media outlets as evidence of the ridiculous nature of the fandom and the Internet as a whole. The fandom acknowledges that such material is generated by a subset of the group, but considers it [...] "an unavoidable part of any online fandom", as described by TV Guides Sadie Gennis, and not <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> facet. A study performed by graduate students from the University of Connecticut found that [...] "a particularly extreme subset" [...] of the brony fandom shows characteristics of hegemonic masculinity, where male members strive to keep their majority in the numbers by purposely excluding and alienating females.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the game}} {{designer}} of a Final Fantasy game, Ito tries {{to balance the}} story and event scenes with the gameplay. When he begins his work on a title, he does not consider the story at hand but rather adapts his game system to it {{as closely as possible}} over the time. He thinks that it is his job to smoothly implement a game so the people in charge of the stories do not have to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> aspect. He also believes that the most important factor of the Final Fantasy series is the player's feeling of accomplishment after beating the game and seeing [...] "The End" [...] on the screen. Professional sports were the primary inspiration behind Ito's battle systems. The monsters in Final Fantasy IV and the Gambit system in Final Fantasy XII resemble aspects of the NFL in that their actions are based on the most likely outcome of a specific situation. The Active Time Battle system was similarly inspired by Formula One, as Ito had the idea to give characters different speed values after seeing a race in which the cars passed each other. These values would then become the basis for the battle system and dictate when it will be a character's turn.|$|E

5000|$|... 11% of all exports go to Russia, {{making it}} the second biggest trading partner in terms of exports after China (14%). However, 33% of all of Kazakh imports come from Russia. When Russia was {{affected}} by the 2014 fall of oil prices, oil became cheaper to import from Russia and as a result, the Kazakh economy suffered. Kazakhstan responded with the depreciation of the tenge by looking into the non-oil economic sector. For example, aiding car manufacturers because or farmers for having sustained losses due to the imports of cheaper Russian goods. Kazakhstan is also vulnerable to social unrest, particularly in regions like Mangyshlak and Atyrau which depend on oil. Clashes between oil workers in western Kazakhstan and riot police in 2011 left several dead, and the Kazakh government continues to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> issue.|$|E

5000|$|Libraries were {{introduced}} to MCP systems in the early 1980s having been developed by Roy Guck and others at Burroughs. They are very much like C. A. R. Hoare's monitors and provide the opportunity for controlled mutual exclusion and synchronization between client processes, using MCP EVENTs and the Dahm locking technique. Libraries offer procedural entry-points to the client, which are checked for a compatible interface (all parameters and return types of imported procedures checked) before the client {{is linked to the}} library. The library and its client may be written in different languages. The advantage is that all synchronization is provided in the library and client code does not need to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> level of programming at all. This results in robust code since clients can't undermine the synchronization code in the library. (Some would call this a 'Trusted Computing Initiative'.) ...|$|E

Or maybe I get less picky.” He tells Reuben everything, about how they met, how they first went out for a drink, and how {{he fell in love with}} her right away. He asks Reuben if {{something}} like this had ever happened to him before. He mentions once but nothing ever came of it and before he has a chance to tell Phil of the details, Phil receives a call from his mother informing him that Johnny has died.|$|E

50|$|In {{their second}} study, Savitsky and Gilovich {{focused on the}} {{connection}} between the illusion of transparency and the exacerbation of speech anxiety. Participants in this study were divided into three groups: control, reassured, and informed. All were given a topic and had five minutes to prepare a speech in front of a crowd, after which they rated themselves on anxiety, speech quality, and appearance, and observers also rated them on anxiety levels and speech quality. The control group were given no other advance instructions. The reassured and informed groups were both told in advance that it is normal to feel anxiety about giving a speech. The reassured group were told that research indicates they should not <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> The informed group were told about the illusion of transparency and that research indicates that emotions are usually not as evident to others as people believe they are. The informed group rated themselves higher in every respect and were also rated higher by the observers. The informed group, understanding that the audience {{would not be able to}} perceive their nervousness, had less stress and their speech tended to be better.|$|E
5000|$|Some critics {{addressed}} skepticism {{prior to}} viewing the episode. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said [...] "It's common to dread a spinoff; some succeed, but plenty disappoint. There {{is absolutely no}} need to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> prequel to the Breaking Bad canon. Better Call Saul traces in loving, if corrosive, detail how Jimmy McGill, a debt-ridden, ambulance-chasing loser, {{changed his name to}} Saul Goodman and became a drug-lord consigliere. Better Call Saul is better than good: It’s delightful — in a brutal, darkly comic way, of course." [...] Chris Jancelewicz of The Huffington Post gave the episode a highly favorable review despite his initial skepticism, saying: [...] "It is so good, right from the get-go, that I almost feel ashamed for ever doubting creator/writer Vince Gilligan, his writers, and lead actor Bob Odenkirk (Saul). Better Call Saul is a return to the tried-and-true New Mexico environment, the sweeping shots of wide-sky desert mixed with strip-mall extravagance, the lushness juxtaposed with the dark comedy, which, as it was with Breaking Bad, both jarring and hilarious at the same time. You'll find yourself laughing in spite of yourself." ...|$|E
