However, an IPS with <b>withdrawable</b> share capital is not allowed to carry on a banking business, presumably because a <b>withdrawable</b> share capital would make it impractical to ensure capital adequacy requirements are continuously met.|$|E
50|$|Under the 100% reserve system, demand {{deposits}} of checking deposits, being {{the equivalent of}} cash, would be <b>withdrawable</b> or transferrable without any restrictions whatever. The cash would belong to the depositor, {{and ought to be}} ready at his beck and call. But savings or time deposits would, as at present, normally be covered only fractionally by cash reserves. They represent time loans to the banks and therefore should be <b>withdrawable</b> only upon adequate notice. Their character as loans is often overlooked.|$|E

50|$|The term “time deposits” is {{a misnomer}} - {{even more so}} than the term “demand deposits”. Demand deposits, when {{provided}} with 100% cash reserves, become, as we have seen, true deposits of physical money <b>withdrawable</b> on demand. But time deposits (i.e. the bank’s liability) cannot under any circumstances be true deposits of physical money. The actual “deposit” is a loan to the bank, drawing interest, and therefore not appropriately available as money to the depositor.|$|E
50|$|The Society is {{incorporated}} as an industrial and provident society, a legal structure {{similar to a}} building society or credit union. Its membership is almost entirely composed of UK individuals (some 9,000 in 2012), who invest <b>withdrawable</b> share capital (£28.2 million in 2011), {{which is used to}} provide credit facilities to organisations engaged in fair trade. The society had 34 staff (2012), mostly in the UK, with established regional offices around the world.|$|E
50|$|The 2014 Act {{consolidated}} previous {{legislation and}} modernised its language. Its enactment {{coincided with a}} number of reforms to the law applying to societies which were implemented by secondary legislation. They included the application of insolvency rescue procedures such as administration and creditors' voluntary arrangements, to societies by The Industrial and Provident Societies and Credit Unions (Arrangements, Reconstructions and Administration) Order 2014 SI 2014/229; increased Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) powers of investigation and inspection of societies under the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit Unions (Investigations) Regulations 2014 SI 2014/574 and an increase in the holding limit for <b>withdrawable</b> shares in societies from £20,000 to £100,000 in s. 24 of the Act.|$|E
50|$|Changes to the {{registration}} system under the Financial Services Act 2012 which splits the Financial Services Authority into the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) took effect on 1 April 2013. The registration function for societies {{was transferred to}} the FCA while the prudential regulation of credit unions {{was transferred to the}} PRA. In September 2013, the English and Scottish Law Commissions published a draft consolidation bill and related documents for consultation. Earlier that year, the UK Treasury, which is the department responsible for legislation for societies, published a series of proposals to increase the holding limit for <b>withdrawable</b> share capital in societies to at least £31,000, to apply insolvency rescue procedures to societies, and to change the rules applicable to their registers of members. Draft regulations linked to that consultation were also available, having been circulated to a small number of people. Those drafts and other materials, including a private member's bill to liberalise the use of share capital by societies presented to the UK House of Lords were explained and brought together online.|$|E
5000|$|For {{international}} stocks, CREST holds {{a pool of}} them in a local depository, such as Clearstream for German {{stocks and}} CDS for Canadian stocks. CREST then issues a CDI to each holder of the security, which can then be transferred in CREST just like a UK equity. This is similar to the depositary receipts issued in other countries. However restrictions apply to CDIs. Many are not <b>withdrawable</b> or depositable into/out of CREST. This is because a CDI is an electronic reflection of the underlying security held in the domestic (country of origin) market. The security provided by CDI are [...] "International Securities" [...] in Deed Poll which includes security through equity shares,eurobonds, domestic bonds and depository receipts. International Securities must be eligible to be held within or through a CSD, which includes Euroclear, DTC, SIS SegaIntersettle (the Swiss clearing system) and any other national or international central securities depositories from time to time specified in the CREST International Manual. The economic rights are not affected by the use of the CDIs.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{a company}} limited by guarantee, an IPS {{generally}} has a share capital. However, in a not-for-profit IPS the share capital {{may be limited}} to a nominal amount. Both types of IPS have a share capital, but it is usually not made up of equity shares like those in a company limited by shares, which appreciate or fall in value {{with the success of}} the enterprise that issues them. Rather they are par-value shares, which can only be redeemed (if at all) at face value. The profits and losses of an IPS are thus the common property of the members. The share typically acts as a [...] "membership ticket", and voting is on a [...] "one member one vote" [...] basis. The maximum individual <b>withdrawable</b> shareholding is currently set at £100,000 (although other IPSs may hold more shares than this). The Legislative Reform Order (Industrial & Provident Societies and Credit Unions) Order 2011 removed the limit for non-withdrawable shares. Since 2006, the FSA has been willing, in principle, to permit societies to have non-user investor members providing certain conditions are met and this, in combination with the removal of the £100,000 holding limit for non-withdrawable shares, may open up wider possibilities for co-operatives to raise finance from investors while maintaining user control.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} sealed bidding {{in which}} bidders may submit {{two or more}} bids and after the bids are opened may, perhaps at a cost, withdraw bids that are more aggressive than {{would be necessary to}} win. Such withdrawal strategies are sometimes followed, but currently are surreptitious. However, legitimization of them would create potentially useful market mechanisms of potential interest to government agencies. These market mechanisms are also of theoretical interest since they are intermediate between first-price and second-price auctions. This paper presents models of such auctions. Both decision-theoretic models (applicable to surreptitious use of withdrawal strategies) and game theoretic models appropriate for openly <b>withdrawable</b> bid situations are developed. We describe a particular auction in which a winning bid was withdrawn and fit one of our decision theoretic models to data from it. negotiations, bidding...|$|E
30|$|The {{disbursement}} of SSS payouts is fuss-free for recipients, as the Singapore {{government has}} been giving out ad hoc or regular cash transfers to Singaporeans since (at least) 2008, and thus has efficient systems in place {{that can be used}} to disburse new types of cash transfers. The government credits the payouts to bank accounts that most Singaporeans have already registered with the government. Those who do not have a registered bank account will receive a cheque that is mailed to their registered residential address. If the cheque is not encashed or banked in within 6  months, the government will credit the payouts into the individuals’ defined contribution accounts, which are <b>withdrawable</b> within a year. The set-up for determining eligibility and disbursing payouts suggests that Singaporeans who are eligible for the SSS payouts will almost certainly receive their payouts.|$|E

30|$|Sustainability {{assessment}} of forest biomass use {{should be based}} firstly on {{the evaluation of the}} carrying capacity (CC) of the forest ecosystem, to ensure renewability of the system itself through time [12]. CC of a system is considered as the limit of exploitation of a resource that does not affect the functions of the system itself. Due to spatial variability of forest features, site-specific aspects affecting sustainability of resource use (e.g., the local accessibility of raw materials and the distance from the processing plant to the delivery point) have to be considered. In the literature, evaluation of biomass availability is commonly {{recognized as one of the}} first steps to plan the installation of combustion plants [51 – 54], but usually, there is a lack of comprehensive {{assessment of}} CC, which should entail site-specific environmental, operational, and technical issues that may limit the amount of biomass that can be sustainably harvested. Therefore, the best practices in the stage of forestry operation should be to follow sustainable forestry criteria (e.g., selective cutting instead of clear-cutting) and to define the maximum amount of <b>withdrawable</b> biomass according to the site-specific carrying capacity of the forest ecosystem.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{downhole}} {{heat exchangers}} (DHE) in {{the exploitation of}} geothermal resources is characterized by an absence of mass withdrawal from the aquifer. Although this peculiarity reduces installation costs it also imposes limits on the heat ¯ow <b>withdrawable</b> (generally less than 100 kW), and, therefore, {{on the use of}} DHEs in small applications such as greenhouses, small buildings or thermal baths. For this reason DHEs are mainly used in super®cial geothermal aquifers (up to 30 mdepth), usually with liquid-phase water at temperatures greater than 60 °C. A study has been made of the influence of the position of the casing slotted section within an aquifer on the heat withdrawal rates using DHEs. This study numerically simulates an aquifer using the finite-element method to determine the heat flow that can be withdrawn by the DHE when the slotted section position is varied within a geothermal aquifer. The simulations carried out also enable us to determine the influence of the main characteristics of the aquifer and the extraction plant on the design of the tube casing slotted section. On the basis of the numerical results obtained, a particular configuration of slotted section is proposed where this is subdivided into different sections, one placed in {{the lower part of the}} aquifer and the other in the upper part. The results obtained have shown that this configuration optimizes the heat flow drawn by the DHE from the geothermal aquifer. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In its {{deployment}} as {{a pebble}} bed reactor (PBR) critical facility from 1992 to 1996, the PROTEUS facility was designated as HTR-PROTEUS. This experimental program was performed {{as part of}} an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Coordinated Research Project (CRP) on the Validation of Safety Related Physics Calculations for Low Enriched HTGRs. Within this project, critical experiments were conducted for graphite moderated LEU systems to determine core reactivity, flux and power profiles, reaction-rate ratios, the worth of control rods, both in-core and reflector based, the worth of burnable poisons, kinetic parameters, and the effects of moisture ingress on these parameters. Four benchmark experiments were evaluated in this report: Cores 1, 1 A, 2, and 3. These core configurations represent the hexagonal close packing (HCP) configurations of the HTR-PROTEUS experiment with a moderator-to-fuel pebble ratio of 1 : 2. Core 1 represents the only configuration utilizing ZEBRA control rods. Cores 1 A, 2, and 3 use <b>withdrawable,</b> hollow, stainless steel control rods. Cores 1 and 1 A are similar except for the use of different control rods; Core 1 A also has one less layer of pebbles (21 layers instead of 22). Core 2 retains the first 16 layers of pebbles from Cores 1 and 1 A and has 16 layers of moderator pebbles stacked above the fueled layers. Core 3 retains the first 17 layers of pebbles but has polyethylene rods inserted between pebbles to simulate water ingress. The additional partial pebble layer (layer 18) for Core 3 was not included as it was used for core operations and not the reported critical configuration. Cores 1, 1 A, 2, and 3 were determined to be acceptable benchmark experiments...|$|E

In recent times, Unmanned Vehicle System (UAV) equipped with cameras are more and more involved in aerial survey and reconnaissance missions, and they are behaving in a very cost-effective way in the direction of 3 D documentation and preliminary damage assessment. More and more UAV equipment with low-cost sensors must become, in the future, suitable in every situation of documentation, but above all in damages and uncertainty frameworks. Rapidity in acquisition times and low-cost sensors are challenging marks, and they could be taken into consideration maybe with time spending processing.

40|$|This paper {{draws upon}} the {{concepts}} of organizational legitimacy, political economy of accounting and agency theory, and subsequently combines these with stakeholder analysis, {{in an attempt to}} analyse the attitudes towards their perceived social responsibility {{on the part of the}} executives of a small sample of large, UK companies. In the conceptual model developed, organizational legitimacy is perceived as a way of examining corporate behaviour, whereby a business is visualized as operating under a mandate from society, <b>withdrawable</b> were the organization be seen not to be doing the things society expects of it. There is, however, an alternative political economy of accounting view, suggesting corporate behaviour might be perceived as more proactive, with company directors attempting to ‘set the agenda’, such as to manipulate societal opinion towards a favourable view of corporate activity. Agency theory is then utilized in an attempt to establish the connection between organizations and the various interest groups with whom they interact, whilst, finally,stakeholder analysis is resorted to as a way of establishing the relevant societal interest groups to which businesses might either be considered ‘accountable’, or alternatively whose views they might wish to ‘manipulate’ favourably regarding their (i. e. corporate) actions. The underpinning theory, as delineated, is then examined for validity via interviews with executives representing eight prominent UK companies in four business sectors. The model outlined enables the nature of perceived accountability/influence by the company to be linked to perceived/manipulated stakeholder expectations of the company, with the tentative conclusion being reached that support can be found for both organizational legitimacy and political economy of accounting perspectives, although which predominates is impossible to determine...|$|E
