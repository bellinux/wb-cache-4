How do these firms manage differing new product development strategies to facilitate collaboration with suppliers and customers? This paper examines {{the effects of}} modularization in black-box design and subsequent impacts on supplier-buyer partnerships by evaluating the opportunity for modularization at four different levels: component, module, subsystem, and system. The scope of modularization sensitivity is assessed {{in terms of the}} product's architecture, interface compatibility effects, component customization, value inputs, and supplier-buyer interdependence. An example of windshield <b>wipers</b> <b>controller</b> for Chrysler Jeeps illustrates that, higher opportunities for modularization in black-box design can be attained through a more collaborative form of supplier-buyer partnerships.

40|$|Modularization {{refers to}} the {{opportunity}} for mixing-and-matching of components in a modular product design in which the standard interfaces between components are specified {{to allow for a}} range of variation in components to be substituted in a product architecture. It is through mixing-and-matching of these components, and how these components interface with one another, that new systems are created. Consequently, the degree of modularization inherent in a system is highly dependent upon the components and the interface constraints shared among the components, modules, and sub-systems. In this paper, a mathematical model is derived for analyzing the degree of modularization in a given product architecture by taking into consideration the number of components, number of interfaces, the composition of new-to-the-firm (NTF) components, and substitutability of components. An analysis of Chrysler windshield <b>wipers</b> <b>controller</b> suggests that two product architectures may share similar interface constraints, but the opportunity for modularization of one module is significant higher than the other due to th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract No. 165 Modularity is a {{new product}} {{development}} strategy in which interfaces shared among components in a given product architecture become specified and standardized to allow for greater substitutability of components across product families. This paper introduces a mathematical model, termed modularization function, for analyzing the degree of modularity in a given product architecture by {{taking into account the}} following variables: number of components, number of interfaces, and substitutability factor of a given product architecture. It is assumed that the degree of modularity in a given product architecture is constraint by the composition of its components (number of standard and new-to-the-firm components), interfaces shared among the components, and degree of substitutability. The application of the modularization function is illustrated with two distinct sets of product architectures: Chrysler Jeeps windshield <b>wipers</b> <b>controllers</b> and transmission systems of Schindler elevators. The analysis of the Chrysler case shows that the silent-relay architecture achieved higher opportunities for modularization than the solid-state architecture due to the higher substitutability level and lower new-to-firm component composition. In the Schindler case, on the other hand, the comparative analysis of two different transmission subsystems captures the sensitivity and dynamics of product architecture modularity created by three types of components (standard, neutral, and unique) and two types of interfaces (fundamental and optional). Some managerial implications for both case studies are also discussed based on the application of modularization function. 1 1...|$|R
40|$|Modularity {{refers to}} the scheme by which {{interfaces}} share among components in a given product architecture are specified and standardized to allow for greater reusability and commonality sharing of components among product families. One {{of the characteristics of}} modular products is the standard interfaces shared among components, sub-systems, and systems. When interfaces shared among the components or modules within a system become standardized, outsourcing decisions can be made accordingly with respect to a firmâ€™s long-term strategic planning of its new product development, manufacturing, and supply chain management activities. Interface management of product architectures defines and selects suppliers with whom the components are outsourced from, and how a firm should organize its knowledge stock, investment, and resource allocation issues. However, delegating complete design and manufacturing responsibility to suppliers with first generation product architectures without well-defined system specifications leads to poor performance of the overall system. The case of a modular windshield <b>wipers</b> <b>controller</b> outsourced by Chrysler Jeeps shows that the extent to successful outsourcing is dependent upon the degree of supplier-buyer cooperation in solving technical problems, especially in designing first generation product architectures, leading to increased inter-firm learning. The case also shows that the failure of one technological solution was the catalyst for increased supplier-buyer interdependence, more interactive problem solving and mutual learning, and hence the subsequent financial benefits gained from the new technological approach.
