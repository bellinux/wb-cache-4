Kawamoto was able to convince Prost that he would work something out on the Honda end of the McLaren-Honda partnership for the 1989 season, but this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E

Although he was running low on ammunition, King launched an immediate counter-attack on the Japanese, which took them by surprise.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{only two}} Catholic churches existed in Moscow: the Saint Louis des Français church for the French {{population}} and the St. Peter and Paul church for the Polish parishioners. As the congregation for the Polish church had increased to around 30,000 members, the existing buildings were too small. Following the submission of a petition to the Governor-General of Moscow, the local council voted for a new church in 1894. Construction of a new church was permitted with several conditions, including two pertinent to the building site: the structure was to be built away from the old city centre, and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> located in the vicinity of any Orthodox sacred sites.|$|E
5|$|By 2002, Caltrans had two {{proposals}} {{for the part}} of the widening project between East Vista Way and Mission Road: building the new highway on top of the old one, or constructing a new roadway to the south of the San Luis Rey River. Concerns arose that the TransNet local sales tax would not be extended by voters, leading to the cancellation of that project. The San Diego Association of Governments included the widening east to Bonsall in the regional plan in 2003, but indicated that the portion from Bonsall to I-15 would be dependent on the availability of funding. Residents of Fallbrook and Bonsall criticized the fact that SR76 {{was one of the few}} TransNet projects that <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completed by the expiration of the tax in 2008. The city of Oceanside proposed plans for grade-separated interchanges with College Boulevard and Melrose Drive in 2004, as part of a proposal to convert the expressway through Oceanside to a freeway.

5|$|Following the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{took the}} field badly needing {{to cut down}} Florida State's lead {{in order to allow}} enough time for a fourth-quarter comeback. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> however, as on the sixth play of the drive, wide {{receiver}} David Clowney fumbled the ball after catching a three-yard pass from Marcus Vick. The ball was successfully recovered by Florida State's Broderick Bunkley, thus giving Florida State another excellent chance to score from deep inside Virginia Tech territory. On the second play after the fumble, quarterback Drew Weatherford connected on a 22-yard strike to Greg Carr to drive inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. A five-yard facemask penalty against Virginia Tech only added to the Hokies' defensive problems, and twoplays later, Weatherford capped the drive with a six-yard touchdown pass to Chris Davis, expanding the Florida State lead to 273 with just 18seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E

Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in {{the final of the}} DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double. Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season. Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milano at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César. Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat, but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.|$|E

CONTRAINDICATIONS • 	 Histoacryl topical skin adhesive <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> {{below the surface of the}} skin, epidermis. The liquid adhesive will react exothermically with tissue; the polymerized adhesive <b>is</b> <b>not</b> absorbed by any tissues and may elicit a foreign body reaction. • 	 The topical skin adhesive <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> any internal organs, blood vessels, nerve tissue, mucosal surfaces or mucocutaneous junctions, areas with dense natural hair, or within the conjunctival sac of the eye. • 	 The topical skin adhesive <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> the surface of the eye. If the eyelids are accidentally bonded closed, release eyelashes with warm water by covering with a wet pad. The adhesive will bond to eye protein and will cause periods of weeping which will help to de bond the adhesive. Keep the eye covered until debonding is complete- usually within 1 to 3 days. Do not force the eye open. 2 • 	 The topical skin adhesive <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> wounds subject to high skin tension, or on areas of increased skin tension such as the elbows, knees, or knuckles.

5|$|Fortunately for Villiers, {{his case}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prosecuted {{with the utmost}} rigour. He was to some degree {{protected}} by the joint efforts of Boringdon's friends and the Whig George Tierney, {{as well as his}} own quick action in surrendering his property through writs of extent; and the delinquency of Joseph Hunt, Treasurer of the Ordnance attracted attention and saved Villiers from the full wrath of the finance committee. Their report on the matter noted that the writ of extent had been to the amount of £264,000, but only £91,000 had been raised from the sale of his property, and about £30,000 from securities and the bond posted for him when he took office. The committee recommended the abolition of the office of Paymaster of Marines and the transfer of its duties to the Treasurer of the Navy, a recommendation which was not immediately acted upon. Villiers was left, in Boringdon's estimation, with a debt of £1,500–2,000, an annual income of £2,000–3,000, and the property in Cranbourne Lodge.|$|E

This was to be only an interim measure, however, since the forces that withdrew to Huế and Chu Lai would then be sea-lifted to Da Nang by the navy. The president then stunned the general by announcing he misinterpreted his previous orders: The old imperial capital of Huế <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> abandoned.
