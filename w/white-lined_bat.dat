50|$|The lesser sac-winged bat {{or lesser}} <b>white-lined</b> <b>bat</b> (Saccopteryx leptura) is a bat {{species of the}} family Emballonuridae from South and Middle America.|$|E
50|$|The lesser <b>white-lined</b> <b>bat</b> is {{indigenous}} to northern South American {{as well as}} parts of Central America. The bat is found in heavily forested areas and typically roosts in trees. The lesser <b>white-lined</b> <b>bat</b> prefers more open areas to roost and while they prefer trees they have also been known to roost inside buildings. They don't {{seem to have a}} preference of tree type but gravitate more towards areas with heavy canopy cover. They don't need to roost near a body or water.|$|E
5000|$|The lesser <b>white-lined</b> <b>bat</b> {{also has}} a {{characteristic}} odiferous gland on the distal portion of its arm. The gland opens up to the dorsal part of the wing. This opening is larger in the males than in the females. [...] This species has sexual dimorphism, the female being larger than the male.|$|E
50|$|Chiroderma - big-eyed <b>bats</b> or <b>white-lined</b> <b>bats</b> - is a genus of leaf-nosed bat {{found in}} Central America, South America and the Lesser Antilles.|$|R

50|$|The <b>white-lined</b> broad-nosed <b>bat,</b> Platyrrhinus lineatus, is a bat {{species from}} South America. It {{is found in}} {{southern}} and eastern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, northern Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, French Guyana and Suriname.|$|R
50|$|Most bats of {{this species}} are located in low {{elevation}} areas but can exist in areas up to 900 meters in elevation. The lesser <b>white-lined</b> <b>bat</b> {{may be found in}} areas with other bat species but they usually don't exist in the same foraging area. R. naso is found to forage above water at low elevations while the S. leptura forages higher around the tree canopy.|$|E
50|$|The lesser <b>white-lined</b> <b>bat</b> {{belongs to}} the genus Saccopteryx and the order Chiroptera. The bat is {{characterized}} by white stripes that run longitudinally down its back starting at the shoulders. Its pelage is typically brown and the bats are roughly 45 millimeters in length. Saccopteryx leptura is similar in appearance to Rhynchonycteris naso. R. naso is slightly larger and has darker fur. Additionally, R. naso has white fur on its antebrachium and the S. leptura does not.|$|E
5000|$|The lesser <b>white-lined</b> <b>bat</b> feeds {{primarily}} on aerial insects {{in the order}} Hymenoptera. This includes flying ants and formicids. The bats forage in areas under tree canopies and use echolocation to hunt the flying insects. The bats don't change their calling frequency or their mouth size when using echolocation while hunting. When roosting, the bats usually form small groups anywhere from 2 to a 9. Additionally, the bats {{are thought to be}} monogamous which is rare for most mammals. [...] Females typically only produce one or two young per year. The young can't fly for about the first 12 days after birth. These young are taken care of by the female for up to 18 months. Female bats in this species are known to defend their foraging areas but not the males.|$|E
50|$|This {{species was}} first {{encountered}} in 1984 in Colombia. Its species name chocoensis {{is derived from}} the region where it was found, the Chocó Department. A morphological study suggested that it may be the most basal (earliest offshoot) of its genus, however, another study using DNA suggested that the Platyrrhinus of the Chocó region diverged from Platyrrhinus of the Amazonian Craton, and that the <b>white-lined</b> broad-nosed <b>bat</b> was more basal.|$|R
40|$|Human speech {{shows an}} unparalleled {{richness}} in geographic variation. However, few {{attempts have been}} made to understand this linguistic diversity from an evolutionary and comparative framework. Here, we a) review extensively what is known about geographic variation of acoustic signals in terrestrial mammals, using common terminology adopted from linguistics to define different forms of variation (i. e. accents and dialects), and b) examine which factors may determine this variation (i. e. genetic, environmental and/or social). Heretofore, terminology has been used inconsistently within and across taxa, and geographic variation among terrestrial mammals has never been defined as in human speech. Our results show that accents, phonologically different varieties, occur widely in terrestrial mammals. Conversely, dialects, lexically and phonologically different varieties, have only been documented thus far in great <b>white-lined</b> <b>bats,</b> red deer, chimpanzees and orangutans. Although relatively rare among terrestrial mammals, dialects are thus not unique to humans. This finding also implies that such species possess the capacity for acoustic learning. Within primates, the two great apes showing dialects are those who also show extensive cultures in the wild, suggesting that, in hominoids, intricacy of acoustic geographic variation is potentially associated with cultural complexity; namely, both have derived from selection increasingly favoring social learning across varied contexts, including the acoustic domain...|$|R
