It studies new language styles and forms that have arisen {{under the influence of}} the Internet and other new media, such as Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging. Since the beginning of human-computer interaction (HCI) leading to computer-mediated communication (CMC) and Internet-mediated communication (IMC), experts have acknowledged that linguistics has a contributing role in it, in terms of web interface and usability. Studying the emerging language on the Internet can help improve conceptual organization, translation and <b>web</b> <b>usability.</b> This study is intended to benefit both linguists and web users.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{determining}} {{of the effect of}} subjective measures of <b>web</b> service <b>usability</b> on its objective measures. Using these results by appropriate design of <b>web</b> system its <b>usability</b> can be improved. A checklist combining the dimensions of <b>web</b> service <b>usability</b> and <b>web</b> service quality is proposed. For determining the subjective measures with the highest and lowest contribution to <b>web</b> service <b>usability</b> the structural equation modeling employed. A case study with 179 students using a student information system was carried out. By exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis the checklist was empirically verified and validated. Structural equation modeling was employed to evaluate the usability of the student information system. Data analysis revealed that the objective measures of <b>web</b> service <b>usability</b> have a strong and positive effect on its subjective measures. The most significant checklist dimensions affecting on <b>web</b> service <b>usability</b> were determined. For example the contribution of assurance was found to be highly influential on <b>web</b> service <b>usability.</b> Also the user navigation within the system can be neglected because of its low impact on <b>web</b> service <b>usability.</b> In contrary to previous studies this case study found a strong similarity between web service quality and <b>web</b> service <b>usability.</b> These results could be used for designing web services with better usability...|$|R
40|$|Many {{perspectives}} of user acceptance of Web sites have been examined, yet information systems research often overlooks the human-computer interaction aspects, {{particularly in the}} area of <b>Web</b> site <b>usability.</b> <b>Web</b> site <b>usability</b> has recently gained greater acceptance in information literature through the development of instruments by Palmer (2002) and Agarwal and Venkatesh (2002). This study conducted a confirmatory factor analysis of both instruments in an attempt to validate the two instruments. Our results found that the Palmer instrument exhibited satisfactory measurement properties, although allowing room for further refinement. The Agarwal and Venkatesh instrument, although useful as a practical metric, displayed poor validity for the underlying constructs that compose <b>Web</b> site <b>usability.</b> Validation of these instruments furthers their scope and potential use by researchers and practitioners in helping them better understand the capabilities of their Web sites, while providing a foundation for further refinement of the <b>Web</b> site <b>usability</b> construct...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>Web</b> site <b>usability</b> is apparent. Previous {{studies have found}} that a usable Web site creates a positive attitude toward online stores, increases stickiness and revisit rates, and eventually stimulates online purchases. A usable Web site also provides benefits to e-business by reducing website development, support, and maintenance costs. The ISO 9241 - 11 standard for usability {{has been one of the}} standards for defining usability in several areas, particularly that of Web sites. This study builds on Quesenbery's reformulation of the ISO 9241 - 11 standards for <b>Web</b> site <b>usability</b> by developing an instrument to measure its dimensions.

40|$|<b>Web</b> site <b>usability</b> is {{concerned}} with how easy and intuitive it is for individuals to learn to use and interact with a Web site. It {{is a measure of}} the quality of a Web siteâ€™s presence, as perceived by users. The <b>usability</b> of <b>Web</b> sites is important, because high usability is associated with a positive attitude toward the Web site and results in higher online transactions. Poorly designed Web sites with low usability, on the other hand, lead to negative financial impacts. Existing approaches to <b>Web</b> site <b>usability</b> include measurement and tracking of parameters, such as response time and task completion time, and software engineering approaches that specify general usability guidelines and common practices during software development. This paper analyzes usability from the point of view of Web site design parameters. An analysis of usability and other design characteristics of 200 Web sites of different kinds revealed that design aspects, such as information content, ease of navigation, download delay, and Web site availability positively influence <b>usability.</b> <b>Web</b> site security and customization were not found to influence usability.

Some broad goals of usability are the presentation of information and choices in a clear and concise way, a lack of ambiguity and the placement of important items in appropriate areas. Another important element of <b>web</b> <b>usability</b> is ensuring that the content works on various devices and browsers. Another concern for usability is ensuring that the website is appropriate for all ages and genders.|$|E

The results indicate that their application can increase <b>Web</b> site <b>usability</b> for such subjects.

40|$|<b>Web</b> site <b>usability</b> is an {{important}} factor when creating and managing web sites, since it essentially determines whether or not the site is usable by its intended audience. As an attempt to simplify the process of achieving high <b>usability</b> for <b>web</b> sites, this thesis has explored the possibility of integrating <b>usability</b> guidelines with <b>web</b> content management systems. The overall aim was to determine if, and how, usability guidelines can be implemented in a web content management system to make it promote and deliver <b>web</b> site <b>usability,</b> and to find solutions that aid web site users in carrying out the basic tasks of finding, reading and understanding information on the web. To estimate the effectiveness of such solutions, the level of human dependency was considered when evaluating the solutions. This thesis has shown {{that it is possible to}} construct such solutions, and has found several for each of the basic user tasks of finding, reading and understanding information. Although some of the found solutions automatically improve a site's usability or actively promote site usability, the majority are still dependent on human efforts in order to promote usability. It was concluded that it is possible to integrate usability guidelines with a web content management system, but that <b>web</b> site <b>usability</b> still largely depends on human effort in order to be effective...|$|R

World Wide Web consists of millions of web sites and web based applications which are deployed and can be visited all over the world without the limitation of time and geographical boundaries. <b>Web</b> site <b>usability,</b> security and reliability consider some of the core aspects in designing of web sites. In this thesis, we explore possible tensions and tradeoffs between usability and security issues in web site design. We discuss <b>web</b> site <b>usability</b> issues in terms of technical and social aspects. We discuss web site security in terms of usability and offer some recommendations for secure website design without compromising the web site performance. We also highlight the importance of ease of navigation and other aspects of user interface design. In order to explore these issues, we have chosen to review the related literature. We have also conducted interviews with professionals who are mainly concerned with <b>web</b> site <b>usability.</b> Two sample interviews are available {{at the end of this}} thesis report. Human factors and usability issues have traditionally played a limited role in security research and secure systems development. System designers have disregarded usability concerns for the reason that they are not acquainted with them or sometimes they do not take into account the importance of the human factors. Addressing issues of usability and human factors could be an important part of way out for todayâ€Ÿs security tribulations.
