Although the doors were damaged, security bollards outside the entrance stopped the car from entering the terminal, where there were 4,000 people, with the potential for many fatalities.|$|E

Sergetov, who has been disillusioned by the Kremlin attack, shares his concerns with General-Colonel Pavel Leonidovich Alekseyev, deputy to the commander of the Kiev Military District. Although Alekseyev refuses to share his full concerns out of a mistrust for politicians, Sergetov volunteers his son Ivan, an Arabic language specialist in the Soviet Army, to Alekseyev's command. Ivan confides that his father was not involved in the bombing to gain Alekseyev's trust.|$|E

500|$|... is {{a former}} ninja of Iwagakure, having {{previously}} left the village after bombing it. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrorist</b> bomber-for-hire before Itachi Uchiha forced him to join Akatsuki. Though he came to embrace the organization, Deidara still holds a grudge against Itachi and all other Uchihas throughout the series, as he feels their Sharingan eyes look down on his artwork. Upon joining the Akatsuki, he is partnered with Sasori, who is subsequently replaced by Tobi after his death. Though he abuses Tobi when he annoys him, Deidara becomes more like a teacher to him, and adopts a genuine care for his well-being. Both of Deidara's hands have mouths on them that, by infusing clay or other fine-grained minerals with chakra, create [...] "sculptures", bombs that explode with varying intensities. Deidara's bombs can take any form he chooses, and {{from the time of}} their creation to their detonation, he can animate and control them remotely. Sasuke Uchiha, Itachi's younger brother, is able to systematically nullify his bombs in combat, and so Deidara transforms himself into a living bomb in a last effort to kill Sasuke and to prove the supremacy of his art, but fails in the attempt. He is later resurrected by Kabuto for the war against the Shinobi Alliance but is defeated by Kankuro. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Katsuhiko Kawamoto. In his cameo appearance in episode 135 of the English adaptation, he is voiced by Quinton Flynn, and in the anime of Shippuden by Roger Craig Smith.|$|E
