5|$|Znám's problem {{concerns}} sets {{of numbers}} such that each number in the set divides but is not equal to the product {{of all the other}} numbers, plus one. Without the inequality requirement, the values in Sylvester's sequence <b>would</b> <b>solve</b> the problem; with that requirement, it has other solutions derived from recurrences similar to the one defining Sylvester's sequence. Solutions to Znám's problem have applications to the classification of surface singularities (Brenton and Hill 1988) and to the theory of nondeterministic finite automata.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and <b>would</b> <b>solve</b> all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 1970, South Vietnamese and U.S. units {{unleashed}} a limited, multi-pronged Cambodian Campaign that Washington hoped <b>would</b> <b>solve</b> three problems: First, {{it would provide}} a shield for the American withdrawal from Vietnam (by destroying the PAVN logistical system and killing enemy troops) in Cambodia; second, it would provide a test for the policy of Vietnamization; third, it {{would serve as a}} signal to Hanoi that Nixon meant business. Despite Nixon's appreciation of Lon Nol's position, the Cambodian leader was not even informed in advance of the decision to send troops into his country. He learned about it only after it had begun from the head of the U.S. mission, who had himself learned about it from a radio broadcast.|$|E
2500|$|Maududi {{believed}} that the Quran was not just religious literature to be [...] "recited, pondered, or investigated for hidden truths" [...] according to Vali Nasr, but a [...] "socio-religious institution", a work to be accepted [...] "at face value" [...] and obeyed. By implementing its prescriptions the ills of societies <b>would</b> <b>solved.</b> [...] It pitted truth and bravery against ignorance, falsehood and evil.|$|R

5|$|The {{economic}} {{condition of}} the country had deteriorated so drastically that recovery to pre-conflict levels was not achieved until 1925. The most acute crisis was in the food supply, already deficient in 1917, though starvation had been avoided in southern Finland. According to the Red and White militants, the Civil War <b>would</b> <b>solve</b> all past problems, but instead the power struggle led to starvation in southern Finland too. Late in 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium: Hoover arranged for food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the Baltic Sea, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, to allow the food in.|$|E
5|$|After Arthur Harris' {{appointment}} as GOC Bomber Command, the situation declined. Harris, since {{his days as}} a group captain at the Air Ministry's strategic planning division, had attacked the use of resources in maritime aviation, suggesting that bombing enemy shipyards and port facilities <b>would</b> <b>solve</b> the threat to trade defence. By November 1942, 259 Hudsons were available, but were shared by other services. The Whitley and Hampden were too vulnerable to operate near enemy coastlines without heavy fighter escort. Beaufort squadrons were sent to the Middle East to operate over the Balkans and North Africa. The highly successful de Havilland Mosquito was sought-after, but priority was given to the other two air commands. By February 1943, GOC Coastal Command John Slessor, had some 850 aircraft. But in respect of quality he was not impressed. Slessor continually wrote to the Air Ministry, complaining that Mosquitoes were being used as reconnaissance machines, while over 200 were being used by the RAF tactical air forces supporting the army, and merchant shipping was suffering high losses in the Atlantic. His successor Sholto Douglas' written records indicate the desire to upgrade, rather than produce new aircraft. By his tenure, January 1944, ten squadrons of Consolidated Liberators, five Vickers Wellingtons squadrons equipped with the Leigh light, and two Handley Page Halifax, Hudson, and Boeing Fortress squadrons were available. Among other technological developments, these long-range aircraft helped defeat the U-boats in May 1943.|$|E

25|$|While {{some public}} health officials, pediatricians, {{and social workers}} wanted to {{eliminate}} midwifery, others did not think this <b>would</b> <b>solve</b> the problem. In the 1910s and 1920s, S. Josephine Baker, director of the New York City Bureau of Child Hygiene, advocated to keep midwives because many immigrants and African-Americans whom midwives have traditionally served could not afford the care of physicians. As such, {{the solution of the}} “midwife problem” was to train, license, and regulate them.|$|E
25|$|Necker {{realised}} {{that the}} country's extremely regressive tax system subjected {{the lower classes}} to a heavy burden, while numerous exemptions existed for the nobility and clergy. He argued that the country could not be taxed higher; that tax exemptions for the nobility and clergy must be reduced; and proposed that borrowing more money <b>would</b> <b>solve</b> the country's fiscal shortages. Necker published a report to support this claim that underestimated the deficit by roughly 36million livres, and proposed restricting {{the power of the}} parlements.|$|E

50|$|The {{solution}} to this problem could be solved by drawing one bar and dividing it into two parts, with the longer part as 70 and the shorter part as 30. By visualizing these two parts, students <b>would</b> simply <b>solve</b> the above word problem by adding both parts together to build a whole bar of 100. Conversely, a student could use whole-part model to solve a subtraction problem such as 100 - 70, by having the longer part be 70 and the whole bar be 100. They <b>would</b> then <b>solve</b> the problem by inferring the shorter part to be 30.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{increasing}} repulsion by the Russian court, King Alexander again tried to approach Austria {{in the autumn}} of 1902. He had taken some earlier steps in January 1902 when he sent his personal secretary to Vienna with the promise that it <b>would</b> <b>solve</b> the question of his successor in agreement with the neighboring monarchy by adopting one of the descendants of female line of Obrenovićs, living in Austria-Hungary. On the other hand, Draga believed that Alexander should adopt her brother Nikodije Lunjevica for the succession.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{geometric}} algebra would be solving the linear equation ax = bc. The ancient Greeks <b>would</b> <b>solve</b> this equation {{by looking at}} it as an equality of areas {{rather than as an}} equality between the ratios a:b and c:x. The Greeks would construct a rectangle with sides of length b and c, then extend a side of the rectangle to length a, and finally they would complete the extended rectangle so as to find the side of the rectangle that is the solution.|$|E
25|$|Woodcock was {{eventually}} transferred to less restrictive institutions, and ultimately {{arrived at the}} Brockville Psychiatric Hospital. Here, staff indulged his passion for trains by taking him to the Smiths Falls Railway Museum, and even took him to see The Silence of the Lambs. During this time, he legally {{changed his name to}} David Michael Krueger and rekindled a relationship with Bruce Hamill, an Ottawa killer who had been released from Oak Ridge and was working as a security guard at the Ottawa courthouse. Krueger convinced Hamill an alien brotherhood <b>would</b> <b>solve</b> his problems if he helped kill another Brockville inmate, Dennis Kerr.|$|E
