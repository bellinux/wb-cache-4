500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The London Free Press listed {{it as one}} of the [...] "best bets" [...] {{to watch}} the evening it originally aired. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the small-town government setting and story lines of the show were working, but felt the writing for the Leslie character has been uneven and that individual situations involving her in [...] "The Reporter" [...] were not funny or effective. Matt Fowler of IGN said the Leslie character was funny, particularly <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> her failure to remove graffiti penises from a city wall. ("To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises.") But Fowler said the Scrabble subplot between Tom and Ron was [...] "silly," [...] and said the Ron character is too one-note and unfunny.|$|E
500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{introduced}} the subplot of restoring the parks department budget through a harvest festival, which {{continued to be}} a major story arc throughout the first seven episodes of the season. It also marked a major development in the romantic subplot between Ann and Chris. Rashida Jones said of her character: [...] "I think women over-correct from their last boyfriends, and Chris is very much the opposite from Mark," [...] a reference to Mark Brendanawicz, a character eliminated the previous season. During one scene at Ann's house, Leslie suggests outlandish and inappropriate ways for Ann to try to seduce Chris into increasing the parks department budget, including wearing a sleeveless tuxedo dress that suddenly bursts open. Amy Poehler said she and Jones improvised much of the scene. Poehler said of the scene, [...] "I think it's really funny how little game (Leslie) has with guys. She's not a fool, it's just not her expertise, so <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> how to be sexy or hot to get someone's attention, it's always really crazy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{fumigated}} herself first so as {{to escape}} infection," [...] said the husband. [...] "You should hear Gerard Maule imitate her <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> the filthy priest." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{a little}} more than a week after Edna's {{adventure}} in the Gardens, and about ten o'clock in the morning, that something happened--something which proved that Mrs. Cliff was entirely right <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> the feeling in her bones. Edna received a letter from Captain Horn, which was dated at Marseilles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor old Prue's {{child was}} all that she had,--and yet she had to hear it crying, and she couldn't help it! Papa, these poor creatures love their {{children}} {{as much as you}} do me. O! do something for them! There's poor Mammy loves her children; I've seen her cry <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> them. And Tom loves his children; and it's dreadful, papa, that such things are happening, all the time!" ...|$|R
60|$|She roused {{herself and}} began to talk. Lister thought it cost her something, but she sketched her working companions with skill and humor. She used their accent and their French-Canadian gestures. Lister laughed and led her on, {{although}} he got a hint of strain. The girl was not happy and he had noted her wistful look <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> England. At length she got up, and stopping at {{the door for a}} moment gave him her hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jeekie," [...] said Alan {{after their}} food {{had been brought}} to them, this time, he observed, by men, for it was now past midday, [...] "you were born in Asiki-land; tell me the truth of this business. What does that woman mean <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> her spirit having been here from the beginning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something like this--you {{were at the}} Hall with Geoffrey {{when the}} townspeople were clamoring about Sir Gilbert's closing the path through the wood, {{and for some reason}} you {{assisted}} them in attacking the barricade. It had been well tarred as a defensive measure, hadn't it? Then you returned, triumphant, black from head to foot, when you thought the guests had gone, and plunged {{into the middle of the}} last of them--Maud always laughs <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> it. Sir Gilbert was somewhere out of sight when you related the rabble's brilliant victory, but he dashed out red in face when he understood and never stopped until he jumped into his motor. I don't think Geoffrey's wife has forgiven you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] and Kicklebury {{had never}} told her! He laughed at her <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> great people: he told her all sorts of ridiculous stories when upon this theme. But, at any rate, the {{acquaintance}} was made: Lady Kicklebury would not leave Lady Knightsbridge; and, even {{in the throes of}} sea-sickness, and the secret recesses of the cabin, WOULD <b>talk</b> to her <b>about</b> the world, Lord Pimlico, and her father, General Guff, late aide-de-camp to the Duke of York.|$|R
5000|$|Tustenuggee, {{translated}} as [...] "Warrior" [...] or [...] "Grand Chief of War," [...] {{was a common}} surname for Seminole warchiefs. Halleck was born in central Florida in the Miccosuke clan. He vehemently opposed the seizure of Indian lands by whites, and even killed his own sister by cutting her throat <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> surrender. He fought at the Battle of Lake Okeechobee on December 25, 1837, and {{took control of the}} Seminole force from their aged warchief Arpeika (also known as [...] "Sam Jones").|$|R
25|$|Durousseau and {{his wife}} moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where they had two daughters. It was during that period that he {{committed}} most of the murders. He struggled to keep jobs and make ends meet, and the couple would often have fights {{over the issue of}} finances. In 1999, the police advised Durousseau's wife on how to file for a restraining order after he allegedly slapped her in the face and grabbed her by the neck. Later, she testified he got violently angry <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> getting a divorce. In September and October 2001, Durousseau spent 48 days in jail for domestic battery.|$|R

40|$|In my thesis, I {{argue that}} Beyoncé {{built up a}} strong image for herself {{throughout}} the years which transmits the messages of feminism and human rights activism. The singer identifies and describes discrimination and takes a nation’s shared pain to offer a deeper understanding and gathers the unheard voices and cries to offer healing and tranquility. I analyzed some of the songs of R&B girl group Destiny's Child. Then I concentrated on the solos career of the singer. I {{took a look at}} the first instances <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> the black woman experience. Lastly, I described her latest album to prove the statement that beyoncé is a feminist. BSc/BAAnglisztik...|$|R
500|$|Hathaway, by contrast, {{actively}} {{sought the}} part, tracing [...] "Hire me" [...] {{in the sand}} of the zen garden on Hacken's desk <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> the project with the executive. While Frankel liked her enough to not require her to audition, {{she knew she was}} not the studio's first choice and had to be patient (other accounts say that she was the only actress considered for the lead). Fox production chief Elizabeth Gabler says the studio did not realize how strong her audience was after the Princess Diaries movies. She took the part to work with Streep, but also due to some personal aspects. <b>She</b> celebrated <b>when</b> <b>she</b> learned she had gotten the part.|$|R

She is a 25-year-old Chief Assistant at C&R International and Jumin's personal assistant.

In February 2011, Donna and Justin married. Justin's cousin, Olivia, was a guest at the wedding, confirming his relation to the Barber/Winters family of The Young and the Restless.

50|$|Ultimately, Liz {{comes to}} realise {{that she needs}} Jenna because she is too self-absorbed to {{complain}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> her problems, whilst Jenna realises that all of her D-list friends are themselves too self-absorbed to pay her any attention. Jack acknowledges then he needs Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) and the other pages because {{he is able to}} blame all of his mistakes on them, while Tracy realises that he was simply annoyed with Grizz and Dot Com for not buying him any presents. During the closing credits, folk singer Steve Earle sings a ballad about the rise of Kenneth Parcell from farm boy to page.|$|E
5000|$|Despite of the {{presence}} of a network of supportive media, Cristina Kirchner rarely makes reference to it, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> [...] "the press" [...] or [...] "the media" [...] in general, she makes reference to the press that is not part of such network. She claims that the media concealed the good news about her government and gave great significance to bad news, in order to decrease the morale of the people. As a result, she made an extensive use of the cadena nacional (initially conceived as an emergency population warning) to announce the news that she considered that did not had a significant news coverage.|$|E
6000|$|Good Mrs. Griggs did {{not leave}} the room until she had {{thoroughly}} explored it, even to shaking out the blue dress and discovering {{it to be a}} tea-gown--wrapper, she called it. But she found nothing to throw any light on the mystery. The fact that the simple name [...] "Alice" [...] was written on the fly-leaves of all the books only deepened it, for it was a name unknown in the Dale family. In this puzzled state she was obliged to depart, nor did she ever find the door unlocked again; and, discovering that people thought <b>she</b> was romancing <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> the mysterious west gable at Golden Milestone, she indignantly held her peace concerning the whole affair.|$|R

This [...] "became the crisis of her life". She later recalled, [...] "I can look back to one period of my life when I {{scarcely}} knew whether the sun rose or the sun set; when for days {{there seemed to be}} no one in the world but myself."

5000|$|Jo Mackiewicz, {{from the}} Composition and Linguistics Department of the University of Minnesota Duluth, has done {{extensive}} research into typeface and has published multiple {{articles on the}} topic. Mackiewicz says that students should: [...] "select typefaces that are appropriate for their technical documents". What Mackiewicz means <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> an [...] "appropriate typeface" [...] is that it contributes to the desired [...] "overall rhetorical effect" [...] and conveys [...] "more specific effects…as intended". In another article, Mackiewicz points out that [...] "typefaces substantially contribute to the visual, {{as opposed to the}} verbal, language of documents". This is important, since it has already been established that professional technical communicators see their role as largely visual as compared to verbal.|$|E

He explains about her six smiles: one smile when something makes her laugh, one for polite laughter, one for <b>when</b> <b>she</b> makes plans, one <b>when</b> <b>she</b> makes fun of herself, one <b>when</b> <b>she's</b> uncomfortable, and one <b>when</b> <b>she's</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> her friends.

At a concert Neal [...] "runs into" [...] the suspect, who Sara is on a date with, undercover. The two men get into a tense back and forth over Sara in which the suspect compares Neal to fireworks that although bright, don't generate enough heat to last.

[...] Neal doesn't hear, but Sara's ex-boyfriend says he can tell that she is lying to him because she can't kiss him [...] "as passionately as she looks at Caffrey."

5000|$|In 1991, veteran Hollywood acting coach Roy London chose her {{to star in}} his directorial debut Diary of a Hitman, {{in which}} she plays a young mother {{determined}} to protect her child from hit man Forest Whitaker. According to Fenn, the turning point in her career was when she met London in 1990. She credits him with instilling confidence and newfound enthusiasm. [...] I was disillusioned with acting after the pilot of Twin Peaks. I'd been doing low-budget films. I didn't want to walk through movies being a pretty ornament. At 25 I didn't know if I had it. I questioned if there was depth, if there was integrity to me. I was longing to go inside, to do deeper work. She learned from her beloved teacher [...] "to find the roles that you're passionate about, that speak to you on some level and which will help you grow on some level," [...] which has then become her line of conduct. [...] "A lot of the sentiment that acting should be about an art form rather than mass entertainment and celebrity {{is at the core}} of Fenn’s attitude to the business," [...] wrote Jessica Sully in Australian magazine Movie. [...] "I try to keep myself centered," [...] Fenn said. [...] "I don't go to parties and all that. I don't think being seen or being in the right place is going to make me a better actress. I care about my work and try to do what's right in my heart." [...] As Mike Bygrave wrote in Sky Magazine: [...] "One of the keys to understanding Fenn is that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> the characters she plays she's really talking about herself." [...] Fenn was eager to play varied parts that could eclipse her sex-symbol image. [...] "People who think they know me would be surprised that my whole life doesn't revolve around sex," [...] she said. After Twin Peaks, Fenn demanded a no-nudity clause in her contracts. She turned to independent films, choosing varied and unusual roles: [...] The world has certain rules - Hollywood has certain rules - but it doesn't mean you have to play by them, and I don't, or I'd be a miserable person.|$|E
