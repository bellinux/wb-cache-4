5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} <b>wanted</b> <b>system.</b> When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them {{before they reach the}} station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters to come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. The law will continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his bounty and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty, the law will assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E

The approach also defines a generic engine of Data Mining algorithms that allows easy enhancement of system capabilities as a new algorithm is implemented. 1 Introduction Most of the KDD systems that have been implemented up to the present moment apply just one particular methodology or implement a particular algorithm (rough sets[9], attribute-induction[5], apriori[1, 2]). When designing this architecture we <b>wanted</b> a <b>system</b> that integrates data mining capabilities within the RDBMS.

40|$|Abstract—Today’s systems {{produce a}} rapidly {{exploding}} amount of data, {{and the data}} further derives more data, forming a complex data propagation network that we call the data’s lineage. There are many reasons that users <b>want</b> <b>systems</b> to forget certain data including its lineage. From a privacy perspective, users who become concerned with new privacy risks of a <b>system</b> often <b>want</b> the <b>system</b> to forget their data and lineage. From a security perspective, if an attacker pollutes an anomaly detector by injecting manually crafted data into the training data set, the detector must forget the injected data to regain security. From a usability perspective, a user can remove noise and incorrect entries so that a recommendation engine gives useful recommendations. Therefore, we envision forgetting systems, capable of forgetting certain data and their lineages, completely and quickly. This paper focuses on making learning systems forget, the process of which we call machine unlearning, or simply un-learning. We present a general, efficient unlearning approach by transforming learning algorithms used by a system into a summation form. To forget a training data sample, our approach simply updates {{a small number of}} summations – asymptotically faster than retraining from scratch. Our approach is general, because the summation form is from the statistical query learning in which many machine learning algorithms can be implemented. Our approach also applies to all stages of machine learning, including feature selection and modeling. Our evaluation, on four diverse learning systems and real-world workloads, shows that our approach is general, effective, fast, and easy to use...|$|R
