2500|$|Moseley's {{trial began}} on June 8, 1964, and was {{presided over by}} Judge J. Irwin Shapiro. Moseley {{initially}} pleaded not guilty, but his attorney later changed his plea to {{not guilty by reason}} of insanity. During his testimony, Moseley described the events on the night he murdered Genovese, along with the two other murders to which he had confessed and numerous other burglaries and rapes. The jury deliberated for seven hours before returning a guilty verdict at around 10:30p.m on June 11. On June 15, Moseley was sentenced to death for the murder of Genovese. When the jury foreman read the sentence, Moseley showed no emotion, while some spectators applauded and cheered. Judge Shapiro added, [...] "I don't believe in capital punishment, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> monster like this, I wouldn't hesitate to pull the switch myself." [...] On June 1, 1967, the New York Court of Appeals found that Moseley should have been able to argue that he was medically insane at the sentencing hearing when the trial court found that he had been legally sane, and the sentence was reduced to lifetime imprisonment.|$|E
