Simpler techniques can be applied that {{are known to be}} adequate for the types of groups <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> be finite simple. In contrast, those who worked on the first generation proof did not know how many sporadic groups there were, and in fact some of the sporadic groups (e.g., the Janko groups) were discovered while proving other cases of the classification theorem. As a result, many of the pieces of the theorem were proved using techniques that were overly general.|$|E

2500|$|In France, intellectuals, {{because they}} had a chance of being {{published}} and could call on their “audience” to purchase their books, were able to express themselves on the subject of captivity. Their message, which naturally was not representative of all prisoners’ experiences, took several forms. Gaston Riou developed European themes in 1928 in his best-known work, Europe, ma patrie. The rapprochement with Germany that he outlined remained solely cultural, indeed superficial. Jacques Rivière, a prisoner since 24 August 1914, took an entirely different approach, developed in L’Allemand: “I must confess frankly: a relationship is described here, rather than an objective, rather than an appearance [...] The subject of my book is Franco-German antagonism”. Rivière developed a theory of economic rapprochement that would find fruition after the next world war: “Forgetfulness will develop, in Germany and here, if <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> organise industrial unity in the Rhine basin, if <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> harmoniously regulate trade there [...] There is all the same, in our current occupation of the Ruhr, with whatever intensity it has borne the Franco-German crisis, the foreshadowing of an equilibrium and a possible harmony between the two countries”.|$|E

2500|$|Searle defines {{intentionality}} as {{the power}} of minds to be about, to represent (see Correspondence theory of truth), or to stand for, things, properties and states of affairs in the world. The nature of intentionality {{is an important part}} of discussions of Searle's [...] "Philosophy of Mind". Searle emphasizes that the word ‘intentionality, (the part of the mind directed to/from/about objects and relations in the world independent of mind) should not be confused with the word ‘intensionality’ (the logical property of some sentences that do not pass the test of 'extensionality'). In Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind (1983), Searle applies certain elements of his account(s) of [...] "illocutionary acts" [...] to the investigation of intentionality. Searle also introduces a technical term the Background, which, according to him, has been the source of much philosophical discussion ("though I have been arguing for this thesis for almost twenty years," [...] Searle writes, [...] "many people whose opinions I respect still disagree with me about it.") Background he calls the set of abilities, capacities, tendencies, and dispositions that humans have and that are not themselves intentional states. Thus, when someone asks us to [...] "cut the cake" [...] <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> use a knife and when someone asks us to [...] "cut the grass" [...] <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> use a lawnmower (and not vice versa), even though the actual request did not include this detail. Searle sometimes supplements his reference to the Background with the concept of the Network, one's network of other beliefs, desires, and other intentional states necessary for any particular intentional state to make sense. Searle argues that the concept of a Background is similar to the concepts provided by several other thinkers, including Wittgenstein's private language argument ("the work of the later Wittgenstein is in large part about the Background") and Pierre Bourdieu's habitus.|$|E

The colour red in Chinese culture {{is considered to}} be the [...] "zenith of the colour representing the sun, fire, royalty and energy." [...] (Cooper, 1990. Pg 70) Cinnabar could also be roasted which produced a liquid form of silver known as quicksilver, which <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> be mercury. This substance was ingested but it could also be combined with sulphur and burned again to return to its natural form of cinnabar. [...] "Cinnabar was the yang to quicksilver's yin" [...] (Cooper, 1990. Pg 70). In China gold was quite rare, so it was usually imported from other surrounding countries. However, cinnabar could be refined in the mountains of Szechuan and Hunan Provinces in central China.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{news outlets}} {{reported}} speculation that Gavin {{could be the}} birth father of Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). Treadwell-Collins' comment that the character would [...] "have a little foot {{in the past and}} a foot in the present" [...] and is [...] "holding the key to many more of the Square's secrets" [...] caused David Brown, writer for Radio Times, to wonder what Gavin's connection to the past would be, saying [...] "it's surely no coincidence that Sharon has recently been searching for her birth dad—a man who <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>to</b> also be called Gavin." [...] Brown said it would [...] "make for some intriguing family dynamics." [...] Inside Soap said that they had a hunch that Kathy's husband Gavin and Sharon's father Gavin could be the same person, making Sharon Kathy's stepdaughter. All About Soap said it [...] "cannot be a coincidence" [...] that Sharon's real father has the same name.|$|E
