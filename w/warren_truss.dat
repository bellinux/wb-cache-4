25|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Paalson's biplane designs, the Type 1 sporting single-seater {{and the six}} passenger Type 2, was a mechanism allowing the alteration of the position and angle of incidence of the upper wing. That apart, they were conventional single-engine aircraft of their time, though the Type 1's <b>Warren</b> <b>truss</b> interplane struttage was uncommon.|$|E
25|$|The VP-1 was {{designed}} specifically to utilize a modified VW Type 1 automotive engine from the VW Beetle. The fuselage is built in a <b>warren</b> <b>truss</b> arrangement where the exterior plywood takes the diagonal stress loads, therefore eliminating the diagonal members to maintain simplicity. The vertical and upright members are staggered to keep the joints as simple as possible. The wing is of a forward and aft blank spar design which uses stack-cut plywood ribs of equal size {{in order to keep}} construction time down. The ailerons are hinged directly behind the aft spar. For simplicity no flaps are provided. The wings and tail surfaces are fabric covered.|$|E
25|$|While the Tasmanian Government {{supported}} the project, believing the Direct Factory Outlet would drive retail trade growth, the Hobart City Council {{and a large}} amount of retail shop owners in the Hobart Central Business District expressed fears of losing business. Concern was also expressed about the big box being built on commonwealth land and therefore escaping the state planning laws. In 2008, plans for the project were submitted to the Federal Government for assessment. Federal Transport Minister <b>Warren</b> <b>Truss</b> gave approval on condition the outlet centre was cut by almost half to , prompting Austexx {{to walk away from the}} proposal. In February 2008, Austexx' chief executive Geoff Porz confirmed the Direct Factory Outlet and Homemaker Hub project was back on, however Austexx went into receivership in 2010, and as of 2014 the site remains undeveloped.|$|E

5000|$|The only similar viaduct in the United Kingdom was the Halesowen Joint Railway's Dowery Dell (Hunnington or Frankley) Viaduct {{demolished}} in 1964. [...] Other apparently similar {{structures were}} usually <b>Warren</b> <b>Trusses,</b> or (as {{in the case}} of Kew Railway Bridge), supported on cast iron cylindrical columns rather than wrought iron piers.|$|R
25|$|Though {{faster and}} more {{advanced}} than the RAF's current front line biplane fighters, {{the design of the}} Hurricane's construction was already considered to be somewhat outdated when introduced to service and resembled those used on the earlier biplanes. Hawker had decided to employ its traditional construction techniques instead of radical measures such as the adoption of a stressed-skin metal exterior. The primary structure comprised a <b>Warren</b> <b>truss</b> box-girder that made use of high-tensile steel longerons and duralumin cross-bracing, which were mechanically fastened instead of welded. Over this, a secondary structure composed of wooden formers and stringers gave the fuselage a rounded external shape, which carried a doped linen covering. The majority of the external surfaces were linen, save for a section between the cockpit and the engine cowling that used lightweight metal panels instead.|$|E
25|$|A federal {{election}} {{to determine the}} members of the 44th Parliament of Australia took place on 7 September 2013. The centre-right Liberal/National Coalition opposition led by then-Opposition leader Tony Abbott of the Liberal Party of Australia and Coalition partner the National Party of Australia, led by <b>Warren</b> <b>Truss,</b> defeated the incumbent centre-left Labor Party government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd by a 17-seat 3.6 percentage point two-party swing. Labor had been in government since the 2007 election. Abbott was sworn in by the Governor-General, Quentin Bryce as Australia's 28th Prime Minister on 18 September 2013 along with the Abbott Ministry and {{the members of the}} House of Representatives. The 44th Parliament of Australia opened on 12 November 2013, which is taken to be the commencement of the term of members of the House of Representatives.

50|$|The Brown truss {{enjoyed a}} brief period of favor in the 1860s, and is known to have been used in four covered bridges in Michigan, the Ada Covered Bridge, the Fallasburg Bridge, Whites Bridge and one other.

Neoclassical elements appear on the bridge piers, abutments, and parapet railings.|$|R

500|$|The Blackledge River Railroad Bridge is a <b>Warren</b> <b>truss</b> {{bridge that}} {{was built on the}} site of a c. 1870 {{railroad}} bridge. The original bridge was completed and opened by August 3, 1877. Likely built by the Colchester Railway Company, the bridge was part of the [...] of track from Colchester, Connecticut, to Turnerville (now known as Amston, Connecticut). The line was leased to the Boston & New York Air Line Railroad and reported improvement in 1879 and a new [...] iron bridge by 1881. The line was leased to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1882. After dominating the region, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad petitioned for changes to the Air Line and the approval came on July 7, 1911.|$|E

50|$|The New Richmond Swing Bridge {{has four}} main spans, plus eight short {{approach}} spans, totaling 422 ft in length. The four main spans include an 89 ft long pinned <b>Warren</b> pony <b>truss</b> swing span, two 70 ft long pinned <b>Warren</b> pony <b>truss</b> spans on either side, and an additional 51 ft long rivetted <b>Warren</b> pony <b>truss</b> span (repaired in 1899). On the south side, two 24 ft long approach spans slope upward to meet the bridge, which sits on a concrete abutment. On the north side, six short-span steel stringer structures, each 12 ft to 16 ft long, approach the bridge, again on concrete abutments.|$|R
50|$|The Bronx-Whitestone Bridge {{had to be}} {{reinforced}} after only one year of operation because of perceptible movement during high winds. <b>Warren</b> <b>trusses</b> were initially implemented to stiffen the bridge, spoiling its classic streamlined looks. They have been removed and the wind problem solved using triangular shaped lightweight fiberglass aerodynamic fairing along both sides that slices the wind as it passes over the bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{duplicated}} in 1882 by the Railways Construction Branch, and minor works to the bearings and girder ends {{were made in}} 1887-8 to lower the levels of its girders by 6 in. A new double-track bridge using large double <b>Warren</b> <b>trusses</b> was built on its north side in 1912. One of the previous wrought iron lattice trusses was left in place.|$|R

From 2004 to 2010, the Muchea to Wubin section was upgraded, with parts reconstructed and realigned, and traffic lights {{installed}} at the intersection with Brand Highway. In the Kimberley, five sections between Halls Creek and Victoria Highway were improved between 2008 and 2009 with regards to pavement strength, alignment, safety, and flood resistance. From 2005 to 2010, the Perth section, through the Swan Valley, was upgraded, with the road widened, turning and overtaking lanes constructed, and street lighting improved. Construction of a realignment around Port Hedland's Wedgefield industrial area, including a new parclo interchange at Wilson Street, began {{towards the end of}} 2012.
