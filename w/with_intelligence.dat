This research aimed to investigate the linguistic characteristics of picture-elicited narratives in school-aged children <b>with</b> borderline <b>intelligence</b> quotient. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 30 students <b>with</b> borderline <b>intelligence</b> quotient and 25 typically developing children {{at the age of}} 6 - 13 years were randomly selected from a population of four schools. Narrative discourse was elicited with description of pictures of one storybook. Results: Students with borderline IQ were weaker than typically developing children in complex (p< 0. 001), compound sentences (p< 0. 001) and produced more ungrammatical sentences (p= 0. 007). Students <b>with</b> borderline <b>intelligence</b> quotient produced fewer related (p< 0. 001) but more unrelated information (p= 0. 033); and types of cohesive (p= 0. 010) and "HAM" conjunction (p= 0. 022) was fewer in them.

5|$|Many {{genes are}} known to be {{involved}} in schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression. The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation <b>with</b> <b>intelligence</b> and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.|$|E

More intelligent individuals display neural efficiency only when faced with tasks of subjectively easy to moderate difficulty, while no neural efficiency can be found during difficult tasks. In fact, more able individuals appear to invest more cortical resources in tasks of high difficulty. This appears to be especially true for the Prefrontal Cortex, as individuals <b>with</b> higher <b>intelligence</b> displayed increased activation of this area during difficult tasks compared to individuals <b>with</b> lower <b>intelligence.</b> It has been proposed that the main reason for the neural efficiency phenomenon could be that individuals <b>with</b> high <b>intelligence</b> are better at blocking out interfering information than individuals <b>with</b> low <b>intelligence.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to investigate: (1) which learning model of the TSTS model, the NHT model, and the direct learning model resulted in a better learning achievement in mathematics; (2) which students of the students with mathematical-logical, interpersonal, and linguistic intelligence had a better learning achievement in mathematics; (3) in each category of the multiple intelligences, which learning model of the TSTS model, the NHT model, and the direct learning model resulted in a better learning achievement in mathematics; and (4) in each learning model, which students of the students with mathematical-logical, interpersonal and linguistic intelligence had a better learning achievement in mathematics. This research used the quasi experimental research method with the factorial design of 3 x 3. Its population was {{all of the students}} in Grade VII of Junior Secondary Schools of Metro City. The size of the samples was 269 students. They were taken by using the stratified cluster random sampling technique. The instruments to gather the data of the research were test of learning achievement in mathematics and questionnaire of multiple intelligences. The proposed hypotheses of the research were tested by using the two-way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The results of the research were as follows. 1) The TSTS model resulted in a better learning achievement than the NHT model and direct model, and the NHT model resulted in a better learning achievement than the direct learning model. 2) The students <b>with</b> mathematical-logical <b>intelligence</b> had a better learning achievement than those with interpersonal and linguistic intelligences, and the students <b>with</b> interpersonal <b>intelligence</b> had a better learning achievement than those <b>with</b> linguistic <b>intelligence.</b> 3) In the students <b>with</b> mathematical-logical <b>intelligence,</b> the TSTS model resulted in a better learning achievement than the cooperative learning model of the NHT model, the TSTS model and the NHT model resulted in the same learning achievement as the direct learning model. In the students <b>with</b> interpersonal <b>intelligence,</b> the TSTS model resulted in the same learning achievement as the NHT and direct learning models, and the NHT model resulted in a better learning achievement than the direct learning model. In the students <b>with</b> linguistic <b>intelligence,</b> the TSTS and the NHT model sresulted in the same learning achievement as the direct learning model. 4) In the TSTS model, the students <b>with</b> mathematical-logical <b>intelligence</b> had the same learning achievement as those <b>with</b> interpersonal <b>intelligence</b> but had a better learning achievement than those with linguistic, and interpersonal intelligence had the same learning achievement those <b>with</b> linguistic <b>intelligence.</b> In the NHT model, the students with mathematical-logical, interpersonal, and linguistic intelligences had the same learning achievement.

5|$|In May 1962, Serong was {{selected}} to lead the 30-man Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) of instructors to South Vietnam. Serong had been appointed by Pollard—with whom he was close friends—and was given authority to act unilaterally. He conducted a reconnaissance of South Vietnam in June, and {{the main body of}} the AATTV began arriving in early August. Serong based his headquarters in Saigon; the rest of the team was located at various installations throughout the country. Although the AATTV was mostly involved in training the South Vietnamese forces, a few had been attached to the Combined Studies Division, run by the CIA as a counter-insurgency organisation. Serong later became a counter-insurgency advisor to General Paul Harkins, Commander US MACV, but this relationship ended under Pollard's successor, Lieutenant General John Wilton, who reduced Serong's autonomy while continuing to grant him considerable latitude. In May 1963 Serong accepted an invitation to visit the US Special Warfare School in North Carolina, only informing the Military Board after doing so, and he later visited West Germany to become familiar <b>with</b> <b>intelligence</b> activities there, again without informing Wilton, who reacted angrily after finding out about it from a newspaper report. Meanwhile, in late 1963, Serong started to redeploy members of the team into combat advisory roles, and by February 1964 some officers and NCOs were working with Special Forces teams involved in counter-insurgency operations. Resulting in the first involvement of Australian personnel in combat during the conflict, this was a significant decision; it was retrospectively approved by Wilton, who lifted earlier restrictions on the role of AATTV personnel that had prevented them being involved in combat.|$|E
