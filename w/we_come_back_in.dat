They took away his maypole and his original rural life and promised him instead the Golden Age of Peace and Commerce inaugurated at the Crystal Palace.

The reason I called it that right away, is because I was with a guy that I didn't know very well, but basically, it’s a long story, but in the three days {{we were supposed to}} spend together — he’s a music video maker — in those three days, his best friend (Heath Ledger) died and he was from Perth. It just sort of became the beginning of the record. And Perth has such a feeling of isolation, and also it rhymes with birth, and every song I ended up making after that just sort of drifted towards that theme, tying themselves to places and trying to explain what places are and what places aren't. We were down at my parents' house shooting the video for 'Wolves,'" [...] the director of the video, Matt Amato, happened to be close friends with Heath Ledger. [...] "It was January," [...] Vernon said, [...] "fucking 25 below. We're out shooting, and <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in,</b> and his phone had been going off." [...] Ledger, it turned out, was dead. [...] "So I've got this guy in my house whose best friend just passed away. He's sobbing in my arms. He can't go back to L.A. because the house is under siege. Michelle Williams is calling my parents' phone. All this stuff." [...] For the next two days, Amato drank brandy, cried and reminisced about Ledger riding horses back home in Perth. The morning he left, Vernon wrote the song's first draft.|$|E
50|$|This episode {{marked the}} last regular {{appearances}} of Scott Wilson (Hershel) and David Morrissey (The Governor), whose characters were killed {{off during the}} prison assault in the episode. On the decision to kill Hershel, Robert Kirkman explained:He was the moral compass {{of the group and}} it’s always good to lose the moral compass. It will all become clear when we finally show you the back half of season 4. It wasn’t enough for these characters to lose the prison. They also had to feel some kind of loss over something important and Hershel was that thing that was important to each and every character, so it made the most sense to take him off the table and see how it affects the characters, which we’ll see when <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a bit. So there’s a lot of cool stuff ahead because of that.Kirkman admitted it was difficult to remove Wilson from the cast, despite initially planning to kill off Hershel {{at the end of the}} second season, but admitted it was a necessary decision in order to move on with the show:I've been killing people on The Walking Dead since before there was a TV show. It was never a big deal, but it is really starting to wear on me personally. It's tough knowing that I'm going to go to set next year and Scott's not going to be there. That's kind of screwed up. It's getting to the point where I want to be in the writer's room and be like 'You know what, let's not kill anybody. Let's not do that anymore.' It's pretty terrible, but it is what it is. You gotta kill people to make the show work.During the climax of the episode, The Governor is about to kill Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) when The Governor is mortally wounded by Michonne (Danai Gurira) and later shot in the head by Lilly Chambler (Audrey Marie Anderson), who incidentally also kills him in the comics. Kirkman explained the reason behind Lilly - The Governor's lover, being the one to kill The Governor:In that moment Lilly is very angry with the Governor because she had in the episode prior said, “Let’s not do this. We don’t have to go after this other place.” And she was very much against everything that the Governor was doing and to a certain extent didn’t even see why he was doing it because she didn’t know that burning vengeance that was in the Governor or that desire to control and to have the prison. I think the Governor ultimately hated that there was this group out there that was existing without him and was possibly doing better than him, and it was eating away at him. So I definitely think in that moment when she shot him, she despised him quite a bit. I do think there was a lot of hatred behind that bullet.|$|E
40|$|COPYRIGHT: ?? International Astronomical Union 2016 The {{origin of}} Galactic halo {{stars and the}} {{contribution}} of globular clusters (GC) to this stellar population have long been (and still are) debated. The discovery of multiple stellar populations with peculiar chemical properties in GCs both in the Milky Way and in Local Group galaxies recently brought a renewal on these questions. Indeed most of the scenarios that compete to reproduce the present-day GC characteristics call for fast expulsion of both gas and low-mass stars from these clusters in their early infancy. In this framework, the initial masses of GCs could have been 8 to 25 times higher than their present-day stellar mass, and they could have contributed to 5 to 20 % of the low-mass stars in the Galactic halo. Here we revisit these conclusions, which are in tension with observations of dwarf galaxies and of young massive star clusters in the Local Group. <b>We</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> particular on the paradigm of gas expulsion from massive star clusters, and propose an alternative interpretation of the GC abundance properties. We conclude by proposing a major revision of the current concepts regarding the role massive star clusters play in the assembly of galactic haloes...|$|E

40|$|When {{change is}} happening, {{communities}} talk and some tales get taller in the telling. Opinions are {{often based on}} shared stories and collectively these opinions are the community sentiment that affects the way people live and act. This magazine was produced by a collaboration between the ECU Journalism Program and the Shire of Ashburton that set out to track the shifts in the community sentiment in Onslow over the construction phase of the Wheatstone and Macedon gas hubs. The project aims to capture the stories being told in Onslow as the town changes, regardless of their factual accuracy. Where possible we have sought to verify facts and provide balance, {{but we have not}} excluded comments by community members {{on the grounds that they}} didn 2 ̆ 7 t check out, because if we did that, then this would not be an accurate record of what people are saying. In all cases we have been careful to correctly report what people said in our interviews. The result is a sometimes optimistic and sometimes disgruntled reaction to the town 2 ̆ 7 s rapid, but in some ways not rapid enough, growth spurt. We hope that you enjoy this snapshot of what was being said in Onslow in the middle of 2013 and find it interesting food for thought about the impact of major resource projects on their host communities. There is a digital version of the magazine available on the website so you can email a link to it to your family and friends in other places. The website also has soon-to-be updated galleries showing how parts of the town have changed almost beyond recognition and video interviews with Onslow locals. We look forward to seeing you when <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> early 2014...|$|E
40|$|Onslow, {{the town}} and {{community}} you live in, is in {{for a lot of}} changes over the next few years. Gas projects will bring new faces, while many old faces are leaving, and new money will buy new things. Will this mean that Onslow loses some of it’s ramshackle, rustic charm? Will it attract hordes of new tourists who’ll crowd out the old crew? Maybe, maybe not — either way {{we want to know what}} you think. This project is a collaboration between the journalism program at Edith Cowan University and the Shire of Ashburton and it’s all about tracking your views and opinions over time as the changes roll out. We’ll be visiting Onslow every six months over the next few years and sitting down with as many of you as we can, to listen to what you have to say about what’s happening in your town. Your voices are important because you make up the community, and this is your history in the making. Our first visit was in July 2012. Journalism students Claire Ottaviano, Aine Ryan and Jasmine Amis came to Onslow with me and we interviewed, recorded and photographed as much of the town as we could. This magazine is the first document produced by the Tracking Onslow Project. We’ll do another in six month’s time. In the meantime we are working on a website that will include more photos and videos, that will also grow over time—providing a record of the community evolving. It’s not only for Onslow to be able to look back on—but also so the rest of Australia can see the impacts of major resource projects on the communities that accommodate them. We look forward to seeing you when <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> February 2013...|$|E

First, {{it is based on}} a further and very natural reduction argument, which was not exploited in the original proof of (4.3) given in [76], the reduction to a connected set. This further reduction, is again a consequence of the strict concavity of the isoperimetric function. Another interesting feature is the use of some ideas from the mass transportation argument of Gromov’s proof of the isoperimetric inequality, to which <b>we</b> will <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the next section.

30|$|It {{is somehow}} usual {{to apply the}} {{population}} density formalism to populations of integrate-and-fire neurons, due to {{the simplicity of the}} model and to the possibility to express the firing rate in terms of the population density function. We have chosen in this paper to consider a large homogeneous population of neurons that are characterized by the theta-neuron model ([16]). As it is known, the theta neuron model, or Ermentrout–Kopell model, is an alternative version of the Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF), which is the simplest spiking neuron model. In contrast to the leaky integrate-and-fire model, the QIF model does have a spike generation mechanism, which makes it suitable for us to describe the internal state of a population density function of neurons. Nevertheless, the use of the equivalent theta-neuron model is preferable since it is a continuous version of the QIF model, and the state variable varies in a finite domain. <b>We</b> will <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the first section of this paper with more details about this subject.|$|R
5000|$|We {{were coming}} down the street—a troop of young men, some of them like myself only nineteen, going to river or tennis-court or cricket-field—when Ruskin going up to lecture in cap and gown met us. He seemed troubled and prayed us to go back with him to his lecture, which {{a few of us}} did, and there he spoke to us not on art this time but on life, saying that it seemed to him to be wrong that all the best {{physique}} and strength of the young men in England should be spent aimlessly on cricket ground or river, without any result at all except that if one rowed well one got a pewter-pot, and if one made a good score, a cane-handled bat. He thought, he said, that we should be working at something that would do good to other people, at something by which we might show that in all labour there was something noble. Well, we were a good deal moved, and said we would do anything he wished. So he went out round Oxford and found two villages, Upper and Lower Hinksey, and between them there lay a great swamp, so that the villagers could not pass {{from one to the other}} without many miles of a round. And when <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> winter he asked us to help him to make a road across this morass for these village people to use. So out we went, day after day, and learned how to lay levels and to break stones, and to wheel barrows along a plank—a very difficult thing to do. And Ruskin worked with us in the mist and rain and mud of an Oxford winter, and our friends and our enemies came out and mocked us from the bank. We did not mind it much then, and we did not mind it afterwards at all, but worked away for two months at our road. And what became of the road? Well, like a bad lecture it ended abruptly—in the middle of the swamp.

The city's shell hasn't been enlarged or added to, but the life in it has multiplied past its utmost capacity. All the hotels and houses and flats are packed. The theaters, wherever the plays are bad enough, swarm with spectators. Along up and down every side-streets the motors stand in rows, {{and at the same time}} the avenues are so dense with them that you are killed at every crossing. There has been no building to speak of during the summer, but unless New York is overbuilt next year we must appeal to Chicago to come and help hold it. But I've an idea that the victorias are remaining to stay; if some sort of mechanical horse could be substituted for the poor old animals that remind me of my mortality, I should be sure of it. Every now and then I get an impression of permanence in the things of the Park. As long as the peanut-men and the swan-boats are with us I sha'n't quite despair. And the other night I was moved almost to tears by the sight of a four-in-hand tooling softly down the Fifth Avenue drive. There it was, like some vehicular phantom, but how, whence, when? It came, as if out of the early eighteen-nineties; two middle-aged grooms, with their arms folded, sat on the rumble (if it's the rumble), but of all the young people who ought to have flowered over the top none was left but the lady beside the gentleman-driver on the box.

This way of traffic optimization is not always the best, especially if one thinks from the driver’s perspective. Therefore, in the second part of my work, both traffic scenarios (two one-way crossroads and a roadblock) are discussed from a very dif-ferent angle – the driver’s perspective. Obviously, now quantities like maximum capacity of a road, maximum traffic flux, minimum waiting time are less relevant. Instead, we focus on the driver’s irritation produced by the surrounding traffic. We use a discrete traffic flow model to capture the effect of the traffic lights policy on both queue lengths and on the driver’s irritation. Our simulation results recover real-life data de-scribing the traffic flow on the Leidsestraat in Hillegom, The Netherlands...|$|R

For the position taken in this paper, the relationship of instantiation may provide one way to develop an account of lexical representation within the framework. The concept of construal is also significant. Halliday (1991 : 282) explains that “the culture is construed by systems of language choice; the situation is construed by patterns of language use”.
