What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones.

While Takeshi Abo, the composer for the Science Adventure games, only had a small role in the previous anime adaptation of the series, he was appointed to compose for the Steins;Gate anime together with his coworker Jun Murakami. Abo composed new music, and made use of the same atmosphere and musical worldview as when he composed for the Steins;Gate game, but also had to consider that the music had to be synchronized with the motions of the anime; this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> way of working {{than the one he}} uses when composing for games.|$|E

On his death in 1812, his nephew Edward Walhouse replaced him as MP, soon after changing his name to Littleton.

25|$|In August 1914, the 2nd Ox and Bucks {{arrived on}} the Western Front, {{as part of the}} 5th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Division, I Corps – the 2nd Division {{was one of the first}} {{divisions}} of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to arrive in France. The battalion took part in the first British battle of the war, at Mons, where the British defeated the German forces that they had encountered on 23 August. A combination of German numerical advantage and the French fifth Army's retreat led to the battalion subsequently taking part in the 220 mile retreat, in exceptionally hot weather, that began the following day, not stopping until just on the outskirts of Paris, then halting the German advance at the First Battle of the Marne (5–9 September). The 2nd Ox and Bucks later took part in all the subsidiary battles of the First Battle of Ypres (19 October – 22 November) that saw the heart ripped out of the old Regular Army, with 54,000 casualties being sustained. In the First Battle of Ypres the 2nd Ox and Bucks first engagement with the enemy was on 20 October in an attack on the Passchendaele ridge. The battalion had heavy casualties: 4 officers killed and 5 wounded and 143 other ranks killed or wounded. On 31 October the Germans launched a large scale attack against Lieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig's I Corps in the area of Ypres which commenced with a heavy bombardment followed by a mass infantry attack; 2 companies of the 2nd Ox and Bucks took part in the defence and subsequent counter-attack which forced the enemy back to their front line. On 11 November the Germans made another attempt to capture Ypres, sending—on the orders of the German Kaiser—the élite Prussian Guard against the British forces. The 2nd Battalion counter-attacked them at Nonne Bosschen wood, preventing their advance and then routing them; almost one hundred years after the 52nd had defeated Napoleon's Imperial Guard at Waterloo. First Ypres was the last major battle of 1914. The 2nd Ox and Bucks sustained 632 casualties during the first five months of the war and by 1915 it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> battalion from that which had {{arrived on the}} Western Front at the start of the war.|$|E

500|$|The central {{character}} in the novel is James Bond himself and the novel ends with his obituary, purportedly written for The Times by M. The obituary provides a number of biographical details of Bond's early life, including his parents' names and nationalities. Bond begins You Only Live Twice in a disturbed state, described by M as [...] "going to pieces", {{following the death of}} his wife Tracy eight months previously. Academic Jeremy Black points out that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> Bond to the character who lost Vesper Lynd at the end of Casino Royale. Given a final chance by M to redeem himself with a difficult mission, Bond's character changes under the ministrations of Dikko Henderson, Tiger Tanaka and Kissy Suzuki. The result, according to Benson, is a Bond with a sense of humour and a purpose in life. Benson finds the transformation of Bond's character {{to be the most important}} theme in the novel: that of rebirth. This is suggested in Bond's attempt at a Haiku, written in the style of Japanese poet Matsuo Bashō: ...|$|E

Zinn was placed in charge of Site A, under Fermi. Chicago Pile-1 was {{disassembled}} and rebuilt, {{this time with a}} radiation shield, at Site A. The reactor, now known as Chicago Pile-2, was operational again on March 20, 1943. Within a few months, Fermi began designing a new reactor, which became known as Chicago Pile-3. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> type of reactor. It was much smaller, being only [...] in diameter and [...] high.

Chicago Pile-3 went critical on May 15, 1944, and commenced operation on June 23 at its full power of 300 KW. When Fermi departed for the Hanford Site, Zinn became the sole authority at Site A.|$|E
500|$|Heller was {{responsible}} for writing the episode's voice-over, despite his dislike of the task. He said that despite it being his [...] "400th version," [...] he was [...] "still not happy with it." [...] He believed that an early scene in which spoils are distributed from a cart in front of Pompey represented the first real sense of how the series would depict city life. He said, [...] "I {{think this is the}} first time that we get sense of the version of Rome that the show is pushing," [...] which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> version than viewers may have been used to. To him, Rome was [...] "colorful and painted" [...] and cosmopolitan. A later scene featuring Cicero the Younger in the Senate proved difficult to film because of the large number of Italian extras who did not speak English. In the DVD audio commentary, he said that [...] "this is one of those scenes where you need really great assistant directors, because all of these Italian extras who have no idea whatsoever what [...] saying, so to keep them interested and focused and concentrated on what's going on is a real trick." ...|$|E

The song was later included in the release of their 1999 single, [...] "Turn". Lead singer Francis Healey said, [...] "We did it for a laugh the first time.

500|$|While {{searching for}} investors, Nagy and Berwin {{learned that the}} {{homosexuality}} of the characters was not {{as much of an}} obstacle for securing financing as {{the fact that they were}} women. [...] "Having two women leads was the issue," [...] Nagy noted. In 2015, Berwin said that, in those days, it was a risky idea to play the role of Carol. [...] "As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. You needed to always start with her role". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make the point.

500|$|Zak Penn, {{who wrote}} {{a draft of the}} first film in 1996, said the film would follow up Hulk, but {{stressed}} it would be more tonally similar to the TV show and Bruce Jones' run on the comic. He compared his script to Aliens, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> film from Alien, but still in the same continuity. He included two scenes from his 1996 script: Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation, and realizing he is unable to have sex with Betty. After the studio rejected a treatment by another screenwriter in 2006, Penn wrote three drafts before departing in early 2007 to promote his film The Grand. Norton, that April, began discussions to play Banner, and arranged a deal that included him as both an actor and a writer, with a screenplay draft he was contractually obligated to turn in within a month. He did so, and continued to polish his draft as late as halfway through principal photography. In November 2006, a June 13, 2008 release date was set. Leterrier acknowledged the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America, and that the film was a unique reboot, as generally audiences would have expected another forty-minute origin story. There were previous discussions to set the first act in Thailand. Leterrier felt audiences were left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee's film. Feige commented, [...] "we didn't want to tell the origin story again, because we thought people were so familiar with it, which is why we didn't tell that... One reason we made Incredible Hulk was to get Hulk into the [...] canon." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Hirth HM 500 was a German four-cylinder {{air-cooled}} inverted inline engine {{developed from}} the Hirth HM 504 in 1938. Although developing the same output of the HM 504 (105hp) and keeping the same capacity and bore, the HM 500 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> engine; the new HM 500 had a one-piece [...] "closed" [...] crankcase for simplified manufacture. The new cooling system reduced cylinder temperatures considerably (15°C less), and the fuel consumption was also reduced. The HM 500 carried a twin-magneto instead of the two separate magnetos as on the old HM 504. All these changes made that the HM 500 resulted a 12% lighter than the HM 504 and the front surface a 37% less than the previous HM 504.|$|E

Gustav was the local chief of police and had served in World War II as a Hauptfeldwebel after voluntarily joining the Nazi Party in 1938, though he was {{discharged}} in 1943 following a bout of malaria.

2500|$|During the Second World War, Klein {{published}} {{two more}} books, Poems and The Hitleriad, both in 1944.

The Hitleriad <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>different</b> work, a mock epic written in a satirical style reminiscent of Alexander Pope in such works as The Dunciad. In it, Klein attempted to satirize Adolf Hitler and his Nazi cohorts, although later critics often noted that the inescapable bitterness of the subject caused Klein's humorous intentions to run awry.|$|E

[...] Egerton had also said [...] "What struck me about Frank's playing was it reflected very reactionary tendencies -- all downstrokes, all six strings when he could.
