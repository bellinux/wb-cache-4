50|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the theory of the <b>will</b> to <b>live.</b> Among these studies are subject to the difference in gender and the elderly and also in the terminally ill. One study focused on a simple question that asked about rating one’s <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> and presented the findings that elderly participants reporting a stronger <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> and strengthened or stable <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> survived longer in comparison to those with a weak <b>will</b> to <b>live.</b> This study found that women were able to cope with life-threatening situations, but suggested that the participants could not have been stable and requires future replication.The second study presented the idea of the <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> in the terminally ill specifically cancer patients termed as older. In this study researchers were able to suggest that patients who had tested as having a low sustained <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> died soonest, as opposed to having a moderate level of the <b>will</b> to <b>live,</b> lived the longest while high <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> could affect individuals in any direction. This study needs future replication that can show the effects of <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> in the terminally ill from different diseases and age categories.Other accounts of the <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> exist in many extreme medical cases, where patients have overcome extraordinary odds to survive. The Holocaust has provided many instances of this phenomenon, and {{is a good example of}} this as well. A proposed mechanism for the <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> is the idea that positive mental thinking tends to lower one’s risk for disease and health complications. One study showed that women who thought positively were more likely to carry more antibodies against certain strains of the flu, thus having a stronger immune system than those who were told to think negative thoughts.Powerful examples of humans having a <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> can be seen in death records throughout history showing that people were more likely to die right after a major holiday, such as Christmas and Thanksgiving, and even birthdays, not actually on or before them, but passing shortly after.|$|R

5|$|After {{being shot}} in the head during the {{previous}} episode, Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) has had a miraculous recovery and <b>will</b> <b>live,</b> although doctors say he will be blind all his life. Crosetti (Jon Polito) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) question prime suspect Alfred Smith (Mojo Gentry), who was identified by eyewitness Charles Flavin (Larry Hull) as the shooter. Crosetti, a close personal friend of Thormann, is convinced Smith is the shooter, but Lewis insists on further investigation. Lewis later learns Flavin bragged about shooting a cop the day Thormann was shot. Crosetti confronts Flavin, who nonchalantly admits to shooting Thormann in frustration because Flavin was suffering a migraine. Although the police celebrate finding Thormann's shooter, Lewis comforts a guilt-stricken Crosetti, who feels he took the case too personally and almost let the true shooter go free.|$|E
5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved <b>will</b> <b>live</b> on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E

5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker <b>will</b> <b>live</b> {{somewhere between}} 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the {{psychiatric}} reform that had been implemented by Franco Basaglia in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures. But {{when it became clear that}} even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did. Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them. Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we <b>will</b> <b>live</b> in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence. Many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole. As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community. Despite the 1992 Russian Mental Health Law, coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period. In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.|$|E
50|$|The <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> is a {{psychological}} force {{to fight for}} survival seen as an important and active process of conscious and unconscious reasoning. This occurs particularly when one’s own life is threatened by a serious injury or disease. The idea in which someone {{who is on the}} threshold of death may consciously or unconsciously try to stay alive through the belief that they have a reason or something to live for, along with giving up on the <b>will</b> to <b>live.</b> There are significant correlations between the <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> and existential, psychological, social, and physical sources of distress. The concept of the <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> can be seen as directly impacted by hope. Many, who overcome near-death experiences with no explanation, have described concepts such as the <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> as a direct component of their survival. The difference between the wish to die versus the wish to live is also a unique risk factor for suicide.|$|R

5|$|M. hirsuta and M. inquilina are {{the only}} known species in this genus that are inquilines and live in other Myrmecia colonies. An M. inquilina queen {{has been found in}} an M. vindex colony. Myrmecia is a larval {{attendant}} to the butterfly Theclinesthes serpentata (saltbush blue), while some species, particularly M. nigrocincta, enslave other ant species, notably those in the genus Leptomyrmex. M. nigriceps ants are able to enter another colony of the same species without being attacked, as they may be unable to recognize alien conspecifics, nor do they try to distinguish nestmates from ants of another colony. Formicoxenus provancheri and M. brevinoda share a form of symbiotic relationship known as xenobiosis, where one species of ant <b>will</b> <b>live</b> with another and raise their young separately, with M. brevinoda being the host. Solenopsis may sometimes nest in Myrmecia colonies, as a single colony was found to have three or four Solenopsis nests inside. Lagria beetles and rove beetles in the genus Heterothops dwell inside colonies and skinks and frogs have also been found living unmolested within Myrmecia nests. Metacrinia nichollsi, for example, has been reported living inside M. regularis colonies.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> by evaluating its association with the wish to prolong life and with indicators of well-being among men and women. First were assessed the strength of the <b>will</b> to <b>live,</b> and its relationship to the wish to prolong life in hypothetical illness conditions. Next, association between the <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> and explanatory factors, such as religious beliefs, fear of death and dying, physical and psycho-social dimensions of well-being were comparatively evaluated among men and women. Data were collected from a random sample of 987 Israeli elderly persons by structured interviews at the participants' homes. Findings indicated that women express a significantly weaker <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> than men, and less desire to prolong life by medical interventions in all the hypothetical health conditions presented to them. Gender differences were also found on the variables which contribute to the explanation of the will to live: For both genders, psycho-social indicators of well-being had more explanatory power than health indicators of well-being, but this finding was more striking among women. The implications of these findings for the study of the perceived meaningfulness of life, and the potential use of the <b>will</b> to <b>live</b> as an indicator of well-being are discussed. <b>Will</b> to <b>live</b> Life-sustaining treatments Gender Elderly persons Religiosity Israel...|$|R
