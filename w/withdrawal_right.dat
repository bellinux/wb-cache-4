40|$|We {{analyze the}} nature of the dynamic fund {{protection}} which provides an investment fund with a floor level of protection against a reference stock index (or stock price). The dynamic protection feature entitles the investor the right to reset the value of his investment fund to that of the reference stock index.

The protected funds may allow a finite number of resets throughout the life of the fund, where the reset times are chosen optimally by the investor. We examine the relation between the finite-reset funds and automatic-reset funds. We also analyze the premium and the associated exercise policy of the embedded <b>withdrawal</b> <b>right</b> in protected funds, where the investor has the right to withdraw the fund prematurely. The impact of proportional fees on the optimal withdrawal policies is also analyzed. The holder should optimally withdraw at a lower critical fund value when the rate of proportional fees increases.

Some analytic approximations and numerical methods {{are applied to}} value those products if the closed-form solution does not exist. Pricing behaviours are also explored. I first analyze the dynamic fund protection which entitles the investor the right to reset his investment fund value to a reference stock index value. With embedded early <b>withdrawal</b> <b>right,</b> the valuation of these protected funds can be modeled as a free boundary value problem. Next I construct the contingent claims models that price participating poli-cies with interest rate crediting mechanism, sharing profits from an investment portfolio. Usually the interest is credited to the policy holder at or above cer-tain specified guaranteed rate periodically. The policy holder may also receive a terminal bonus. However the insurer may default at maturity. Under certain assumptions, the perturbation technique is used to approximate the solution. The guaranteed annuity option provides the holder the right to either receive at retirement an assured accumulated fund or a life annuity at a fixed rate. I propose three analytic approximation methods including stochastic duration approach, Edgeworth expansion and analytic approximation in affine diffusions to value this option under a multi-factor interest rate model. The target redemption note is an index linked note that provides a guar-anteed sum of coupons (target cap) with possibility of early termination. In a typical structure, the first coupon payment is fixed. The subsequent coupons are calculated based on an inverse floating LIBOR / Euribor formula. Once the accumulated coupon has reached the pre-specified target cap, the note will be terminated with final payment of the par.

40|$|Bankruptcy {{scholarship}} {{is largely a}} debate about the comparative merits of a mandatory regime {{on one hand and}} bankruptcy by free design on the other. By the standard account, the current law of corporate reorganization is mandatory. Various rules that cannot be avoided ensure that investors’ actions are limited and they do not exercise their rights against specialized assets in a way that destroys the value of a business as a whole. These rules solve collective action problems and reduce the risk of bargaining failure. But there are costs to a mandatory regime. In particular, investors cannot design their rights to achieve optimal monitoring as they could in a system of bankruptcy by free design. This Article suggests that the academic debate has missed a fundamental feature of the law. Bankruptcy operates on legal entities, not on firms in the economic sense. For this reason, sophisticated investors do not face a mandatory regime at all. The ability of investors to place assets in separate entities gives them the ability to create specific withdrawal rights in the event the firm encounters financial distress. There is nothing mandatory about rules like the automatic stay when assets can be partitioned off into legal entities that are {{beyond the reach of the}} bankruptcy judge. Thus, by partitioning assets of one economic enterprise into different legal entities, investors can create a tailored bankruptcy regime. In this way, legal entities serve as building blocks that can be combined to create specific and varied but transparent investor withdrawal rights. This regime of tailored bankruptcy has been unrecognized and underappreciated and may be preferable to both mandatory and free design regimes. By allowing a limited number of investors to opt out of bankruptcy in a particular, discrete, and visible way, investors as a group may be able to both limit the risk of bargaining failure and at the same time enjoy the disciplining effect that a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>right</b> brings with it...|$|E
40|$|Introduction// In Myanmar, people’s {{participation}} {{has been}} prioritized as an imperative of national forest policy in 1995 {{endorsed by the}} community forestry instructions (CFIs). Today, there are about 42, 148 ha of community forestry (CF) management by 572 user groups (USGs). In CF management, the people are engaging three types of activities: (1) to preserve or improve the production system such as planting trees and promoting the growth of trees, (2) to use forest resources for subsistence needs, (3) to get cash by selling the timber harvested or furniture made by the timber. Initial participation by {{the people and their}} continuation of CF activities are considered to be indispensable for sustainable forest management. In practice, however, the improvement of forest management and protection are often threatened because of difficulties in continuing the activities even though initial participation was achieved. Providing secure property rights is among the major factors that contribute to continuing CF activities. Thus the objectives of the dissertation are (1) to find out the factors affecting initial participation of USG members in management activities in Myanmar, (2) to assess the role of property rights in sustaining CF activities in the Philippines, and (3) to draw implications for Myanmar policy in terms of property rights issues from the case of the Philippines. //Analytical framework and data collection// Decentralized forest management is an alternative way for conventional centralized approach that encourages people participation in forest management. For achieving sustainable forest governance in this approach, participation of communities and the role of property rights are among the major factors. In order to investigate important factors for initial participation of local people, which is the first objective of the research, a framework that explores the nature of causal relationships among economic, social /institutional and physical factors was constructed by modifying existing framework. Data were collected from four USGs of agroforestry (AF) type and natural forest (NF) type of CFs in central dry zone of Myanmar. Semi-structured formal interviews were conducted at household level (15 households from each of sample USG in the AF type, 50 % of households from sample USG in the NF type) to know their social and economic situations. Other data were collected by applying key informant interviews, participant observation, informal interviews and reviews of the meeting records of USGs. In order to analyze the role of property rights in decentralization that shape sustainable forest governance, the second objective of the study, two concepts are applied as analytical framework: (1) “bundle of rights” consisting of the right of access, withdrawal, management, exclusion, and alienation, and (2) “three levels of rules” such as operational, collective-choice and constitutional rules. Different property rights will achieve different forest governance outcomes in terms of forest resources as well as income. The research is undertaken in 3 systems of community-based forest management (CBFM) located in northern Philippines: central government-initiated program (CGIP), local government-initiated program (LGIP) and traditional forest management (TFM) system. 111 households from 9 villages were randomly selected to collect data such as demographics data, property rights, income from selling crops and numbers of trees on their farms. Key informant and informal interviews with 41 respondents were also conducted. To facilitate decentralized policy for sustainable forest governance in Myanmar by improving property right issues through lessons from the Philippines, the third objective of the study, property right issues from three CBFM programs in the Philippines and two types of CF from Myanmar were compared by applying SWOT analysis. In SWOT analysis, the policies were regarded as external factors to generate ‘opportunities’ and ‘threats’: the communities such as POs in the Philippines and USGs in Myanmar might have some ‘strengths’ and ‘weaknesses’. Then the policy implication to support strategies to be taken by the USG in Myanmar were proposed by considering how {{to make use of the}} ‘opportunity’, how to defend against the ‘threats’, how to promote the ‘strengths’, and how to overcome the ‘weaknesses’. //Factors affecting participation of USG members in the Dry Zone, Myanmar// In AF type CF, performance of USG was measured by the number of trees managed by households in each individual plot. Under the favorable market situations, all respondents have income which encourage initial participation in CF. The study showed that the more the leaders work on the farm, the better their active participation in discharging their responsibilities for supervising, monitoring and decision making which affect rule awareness and cooperation among members in the execution phase. It was found that social/institutional factors can mediate the negative effect of economic factors. In NF type CF, performance of USG was measured in terms of the proportion of members participating in collective resource management. Under the situation where economic benefits are not yet received, those who had experience as village head could take better coordination and leadership. The achievement of collective action was higher when majority of members participated in decision-making process and vise versa. Additionally, the legal rights of CF motivated the people who have experience in traditional forest management as common property to participate in collective activities. When the institution lacked strong rule enforcement due to the weakness of social/institutional factors, it seemed that physical factor was more important for poor participation. //Property rights issues of CBFM in the Philippines// In both CGIP and LGIP, the people are granted all the five bundles of rights on the individual plots within the CBFM area, or full ownership. They are free to decide species of forest trees, fruit trees or crops as long as making sound ecological practices. Income from AF crops supported livelihoods of the households. In the TFM, the people can decide how to manage their resource and maximize the profit, although individual right holders are prohibited to sell or transfer their private property. Comparing <b>withdrawal</b> <b>right</b> on trees among three systems, the local people in TFM system are granted the most liberal and assured rights because they can devise operational rules in terms of quantity of resource use, timing of harvesting and harvesting technology, whereas such rules are regulated by higher level actors in CGIP and LGIP. The local people in CGIP gained operational and collective choice rights on the communal forest. Such devolution from the central government to local organization resulted in good forest management, although there are variations in three associations. On the other hand, LGIP i. e. devolution to local government unit, grant to communities limited operational level-rights and the management of whole watershed area is driven by local government, which weaken the function of the local organization in the long run. In the case of TFM, everybody can access and harvest the trees. //Comparison of the cases of Myanmar with the Philippines// In the Philippines, there were some opportunities: (1) Access, withdrawal, and management rights including marketing of forest products, and exclusion rights has been transferred to PO members; (2) PO members are permitted to rehabilitate the land by planting agricultural crops, fruit trees, trees or by making fish-breeding pond to enhance participation and support food security, and (3) PO members are given access to local financial, technical and seedlings support from other departments. The right to make operational rules, however, was controlled by national authority, which was obvious ‘threats’. The PO in the Philippines has the ‘strengths’ such as existence of internal regulation to define the powers and authority of the PO leaders and women’s involvement in collective-decision making and ‘weakness’ such as limited collective activities through participation of PO members. In Myanmar, the ‘opportunities’ were: (1) USGs were allowed to have the rights of access, withdrawal, management and exclusion, (2) Withdrawal rights to harvest naturally grown trees are not regulated, (3) They are not required to distribute any of CF benefits to the Forest Department (FD), and (4) The department provides seedlings of tree to USG. ‘Threats’ were: (1) CFIs did not prescribe the right of commercial harvest of forest products and the procedure involved when extracting forest products, (2) Exclusion rights were not ensured because there was no strong legal mechanism to punish the encroachers, even they are given the right to exclude outsiders, and (3) Legal status of the USG after termination of the project was fragile, (4) The management rights for the improvement of the land only emphasized on forest trees and, (5) Access to finance was limited for the USG members. The FUGs have ‘strengths’ such as existence of collective action under strong leadership, and ‘weaknesses’ such as lack of internal regulation to define the authority of the USG leaders and women’s involvement in collective decision making process. //Conclusion and policy implications// Decentralization in Myanmar is likely to be another form of centralization provided with few new benefits and little autonomy, while the approach of CBFM in the Philippines can be considered decentralization without devolution of authority, except TFM system. In order to overcome the threat of prohibition of commercial harvest of forest trees, the scope of CFIs should allow commercial harvest to supply wood-based industries. FD shall issue additional orders for commercial harvest of forest trees including authorized procedures for obtaining cutting permits. To ensure exclusion rights and secure legal status of USGs, article 15 of forest law, which permit establishing village owned firewood plantation, should be strengthened. Moreover, CFIs should add a section on forest protection and conservation that provides secured and strong institutional power to exercise exclusion right. To improve the management right of USGs, section 19 (e) of CFIs, which concern with property right on how to manage and rehabilitate the land, should provide USGs to decide on how to rehabilitate the land including what type of tree and crops to plant. Lack of financial incentive for USG members can be overcome by providing other incentive including non-forest based alternative livelihood system through institutional linkage with other departments concerned. The existing strength of USGs like collective action under strong leadership can be applied in national programs like the national greening policy e. g. Bago Yoma greening program. In order to overcome the weakness, USGs should modify internal regulations to define authority of leaders and to allow women’s involvement; the FD should create sections of CFI to promote and legalize such internal regulations. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2013 - 03 - 25; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士（農学）; 学位記番号: 博農第 3938 号; 研究科・専攻: 農学生命科学研究科農学国際専...|$|E

This paper analyzes the trade-o¤s between allowing a secured creditor to freely withdraw a key asset, and a mandatory stay of withdrawal. I show that free withdrawal creates excess incentive for debtors to borrow from asset-based lenders who are uninformed about the debtors going-concern value. This lack of information leads to bargaining ine ¢ ciencies that cause ine ¢ cient reorganizations and liquidations. A stay, by contrast, creates too much incentive to borrow from informed lenders, and excess continuation problems. I show that debtors will grant <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rights</b> excessively when permitted to do so, due to commitment problems caused by sequential contracting. This suggests caution in allowing a free opt-out of the stay through subsidiaries.

Oxygen saturation was not affected by anesthesia, but heart rate was depressed for as long as 1 h in both groups of frogs. Surgical anesthesia evaluated by using skin and abdominal incisions revealed that small frogs were anesthetized for a maximum of 15 min compared with 30 min in medium frogs. Frogs showed no ill effects 24 h after eugenol bath administration. These results suggest that body weight is an important parameter to consider when using a eugenol bath for anesthesia of Xenopus frogs...|$|R

40|$|A {{property}} rights-based {{approach is}} {{proposed in the}} paper to underline the common characteristics of the forest property rights specification in ten ECE countries, the specific patterns governing the harvesting of timber in private forestry {{and the role of}} the forest management planning in determining the content of the property rights. The analysis deals with the private forests of the individuals (non industrial ownership) from ten countries, covering 7. 3 million ha and producing yearly some 25 million m 3 timber. The study shows that the forest management rights in private forests belong to the State and that the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rights</b> on timber, yet recognised in the forest management plans, are in reality strongly restricted from an economic viewpoint. The forest management planning is the key instrument of the current forest governance system, based on top-down, hierarchically imposed and enforced set of compulsory rules on timber harvesting. With few exceptions, the forest owners have little influence in the forest planning and harvesting. The rational and State-lead approach of the private forest management has serious implications not only on the economic content of the property rights, but also on the learning and adaptive capacity of private forestry to cope with current challenges such the climate change, the increased industry needs for wood as raw material, or the marketing of innovative non wood forest products and services. The study highlights that understanding and comparing the regime of the forest ownership require a special analysis of the economic rights attached to each forest attribute; and that the evolution towards more participatory decision-making in the local forest governance can not be accurately assessed in ECE region without a proper understanding of the forest management planning process.  </span...|$|R
