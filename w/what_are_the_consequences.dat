50|$|<b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> {{of such a}} view of {{perception}} for the concept of knowledge? In Chapter 5 Steiner presents his concept of knowledge. Human beings are two-sided, as they both think and also perceive. The two activities together give a complete view of the world. Knowledge is the union of what is produced in thinking, the concept, and what is produced in perceiving, the percept. Steiner argues {{that there can be}} no relationship among the objects {{of perception}} other than what is revealed in the ideal element produced by thinking, the concept. Accordingly, the relation between some perceived object and ourselves is also an ideal one.|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} of degree correlations in unidimensional networks is fairly straightforward: do networks of similar degree tend {{to connect to}} each other? In multidimensional networks, what this question means becomes less clear. When we refer to a node's degree, are we referring to its degree in one dimension, or collapsed over all? When we seek to probe connectivity between nodes, are we comparing the same nodes across dimensions, or different nodes within dimensions, or a combination? [...] <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of variations {{in each of these}} statistics on other network properties? In one study, assortativity was found to decrease robustness in a duplex network.|$|E
