5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{began in the}} early twentieth century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but he died in the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, noting that he had never seen it in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E
25|$|While {{demand for}} his prints {{continued}} {{for a few}} years, eventually interest in him waned, both in Japan, and around the world. The canonical view in this period was that the generation of Hiroshige <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> last of the great woodblock artists, and more traditional collectors stopped even earlier, at the generation of Utamaro and Toyokuni.|$|E
25|$|Sverre, however, was not {{suited for}} a priestly life. The saga {{states that he}} had several dreams which he {{interpreted}} {{as a sign that}} he was destined for greater things. Further, in 1175, his mother revealed that Sverre <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> son of king Sigurd Munn. In the following year, Sverre travelled to Norway to seek his destiny.|$|E

25|$|Neal {{started to}} write {{some of his}} {{ensembles}} {{with some of the}} figures that come from that early bebop thing. We were really one of the first bands outside of Dizzy's big band that flavored bebop into the big band — different tonal quality and rhythms, and the drum feeling started changing, and that I think <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> beginning of it...|$|E

25|$|The rise of DJs <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> {{next step}} for the Japanese hip hop scene. Before 1985, there weren't very many DJs on the radio, {{but with the}} {{increase}} in the number that year, it led to the opening of the first all hip hop club in 1986. But despite the fact that DJing caught on rather quickly, it was initially thought that rapping wasn't going to have the same cache as it would be hard to rap in Japanese.|$|E

25|$|Despite his prosperity, Svarocis {{was unhappy}} {{in his life}} and could hear the ducks and deer talking about him behind his back. One day he went hunting and took aim at a boar, but a deer came through the {{clearing}} and asked to be shot in its place. When he enquired why, the deer told him that she <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> goddess of the forest and wished to marry Svarocisa. So he embraced the deer and she turned into a beautiful woman. Together, they had a son named Dyutiman, who later became the Svarocisa Manu.|$|E
25|$|The North of England and South of England cricket teams {{appeared}} in first-class cricket between the 1836 and 1961 seasons, {{most often in}} matches against each other but also individually in games against touring teams, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and others. Until international cricket became firmly established {{towards the end of}} the 19th century, the North v South match was one of the major fixtures in the cricketing calendar along with Gentlemen v Players. Indeed it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> major fixture because whereas the Gentlemen teams were often very weak, North v South could potentially showcase the best 22 players in the country. In all, the North played against the South 155 times in first-class matches.|$|E
25|$|Although Boas {{was making}} a very {{specific}} contribution to the methods of descriptive linguistics, his ultimate point is far reaching: observer bias need not be personal, it can be cultural. In other words, the perceptual categories of Western researchers may systematically cause a Westerner to misperceive or to fail to perceive entirely a meaningful element in another culture. As in his critique of Otis Mason's museum displays, Boas demonstrated that {{what appeared to be}} evidence of cultural evolution <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> consequence of unscientific methods, and a reflection of Westerners' beliefs about their own cultural superiority. This point provides the methodological foundation for Boas's cultural relativism: elements of a culture are meaningful in that culture's terms, even if they may be meaningless (or take on a radically different meaning) in another culture.|$|E

25|$|Experts on {{the ground}} in Japan agree that mental health {{challenges}} are the most significant issue. Stress, such as that caused by dislocation, uncertainty and concern about unseen toxicants, often manifests in physical ailments, such as heart disease. So even if radiation risks are low, people are still concerned and worried. Behavioral changes can follow, including poor dietary choices, lack of exercise and sleep deprivation, all of which can have long-term negative health consequences. People who lost their homes, villages and family members, and even just those who survived the quake, will likely continue to face mental health challenges and the physical ailments that come with stress. Much of the damage <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> psychological stress of not knowing and of being relocated, according to U.C. Berkeley's McKone.|$|E
25|$|Sullivan {{served as}} {{chairperson}} {{of a committee}} composed of delegates elected by Catholic Reading Circles which oversaw the Central Board, Catholic Educational Union, Archdiocese of Chicago. Several years before the Reading Circle method became generally disseminated throughout the country—as early as 1879– {{a small group of}} earnest students gathered daily under the tutelage of Sullivan for the enthusiastic acquirement of knowledge. This <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> nucleus of the circle theory in Chicago. The two Reading Circles of the Sacred Heart Institution conducted by Sullivan were probably the most exhaustive in scope and most diversified in plan of entertainment of any of the literary classes of the city. They were organized in October, 1894, the Venerable Mother Barat Circle, named for the woman who established the order in Paris, and the other, the Mother Duchesne Circle, named for the first Superior of the American foundation.|$|E

Abrams died. Acclaimed military historian Lewis Sorley professed in his biography of General Westmoreland that Palmer <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> Chief of Staff performing most of the duties of office while Westmoreland was making speeches about Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|From 3 August until 14 September, 33rd Armoured Brigade was {{attached}} to 51st (Highland) Infantry Division. From 16 August 144 RAC regularly worked with 153rd (Highland) Brigade of 51st Highland. 'On arriving at Brigade Headquarters, Major Secretan {{found that he was}} to support the 1st Gordons, the beginning of a long association between B Squadron and that battalion... this <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> beginning of our close connection with 153 Infantry Brigade, an association which was to continue {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Each infantry battalion also grew accustomed to being supported by the same squadron and in this way very close ties of confidence and friendship were established between A Squadron and the 5th Black Watch, B squadron and the 1st Gordons, and between C Squadron and the 5/7th Gordons... In order to make us feel part of the family, the 51st Highland Division asked us to wear the famous HD flash and issued every man in the brigade with one, a gesture which was very much appreciated'.|$|E
25|$|After several {{unsuccessful}} re-casts of {{the character}} of Mickey, {{the decision was made to}} kill him off, and in January 2010, Maggie was made a widow. Her storyline moved from supporting to front burner status with the decision to pair her with wealthy Victor Kiriakis and giving her a nasty rival with Vivian Alamain who was married to Victor at the time. After this storyline ended, Victor and Maggie were married, although she maintained her role as Horton matriarch. Maggie's life became further complicated by the revelation that Dr. Daniel Jonas <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>the</b> product of the eggs she had given in hopes of having a child years ago. Her airtime, relegated to only sporadic appearances for years (unless storyline had dictated her appearing more), became greater, and for the first time since the mid 1980s, she was considered a front burner character. This continued well past the mid 2010s, even after the leading characters of John and Marlena returned to the show, and exploded into leading character status once again in early 2016 after Daniel was suddenly killed off and other characters were introduced to create drama for both Maggie and Victor.|$|E

Nolan contacted Bowie, who initially turned down the part. A lifelong fan, Nolan flew out to New York to pitch the role to Bowie in person, telling him {{no one else could}} possibly play the part; Bowie accepted after a few minutes.|$|E

This early, unproduced idea evolved into Buffy, an inversion of the Hollywood formula of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie". Whedon wanted [...] "to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero". He explained, [...] "The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it".|$|E
