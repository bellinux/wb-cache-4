40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effect of}} the DFT methods and basis sets on harmine {{molecule}} has <b>been</b> <b>investigated.</b> 26 DFT methods with 6 basis sets were used. Two main comparison chosen DFT methods in this work has <b>been</b> <b>investigated.</b> It <b>is</b> concluded that this contribution is very important and cannot be neglected. In the following analysis, changes in energy levels <b>were</b> <b>investigated</b> by two different methods. Considering a specific basis set, changes in energy levels were obtained using different DFT methods. A specific DFT method is chosen and changes in energy levels have <b>been</b> <b>investigated</b> by means of various basis sets.
