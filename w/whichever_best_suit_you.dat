These confessions resulted from the harsh interrogations done against them by Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, for their alleged involvement in the assassination attempt made against Nasser (an assassination attempt that many believe was staged by Nasser himself). They revealed that the Muslim Brotherhood was merely a [...] "guild" [...] that fulfilled the goals of western interests: [...] "Nor was that all. Sound beatings of the Moslem Brotherhood organizers who had been arrested revealed that the organization had been thoroughly penetrated, at the top, by the British, American, French and Soviet intelligence services, any one of which could either make active use of it or blow it up, <b>whichever</b> <b>best</b> <b>suited</b> its purposes.

This algorithm is only one of multiple choices available within BSAFE toolkits, and users have always been free to choose <b>whichever</b> one <b>best</b> <b>suits</b> their needs. We continued using the algorithm as an option within BSAFE toolkits as it gained acceptance as a NIST standard and because of its value in FIPS compliance. When concern surfaced around the algorithm in 2007, we continued to rely upon NIST as the arbiter of that discussion. When NIST issued new guidance recommending no further use of this algorithm in September 2013, we adhered to that guidance, communicated that recommendation to customers and discussed the change openly in the media.

50|$|Many airfields have runways {{facing a}} variety of directions. The purpose {{of this is to}} provide {{arriving}} aircraft with the best runway to land on, according to the wind direction. Runway orientation is determined from historical data of the prevailing winds in the area. This is especially important for single-runway airports that do not have the option of a second runway pointed in an alternative direction. A common scenario is to have two runways arranged at or close to 90 degrees to one another, so that aircraft can always find a suitable runway. Almost all runways are reversible, and aircraft use whichever runway in <b>whichever</b> direction is <b>best</b> <b>suited</b> to the wind. In light and variable wind conditions, the direction of the runway in use might change several times during the day.|$|R
40|$|Two {{hundred years}} ago life writing was already highly popular {{in the form of}} autobiography, memoir, biography, journals, essays and diaries. It now {{commands}} a huge share of the publishing market, as there is an enormous demand from readers for narratives based directly on ‘real lives’. There is a lot of common ground between the two main forms – autobiography/memoir and biography: both require skilled storytelling (rather than listing facts and events), research and imagination. The quality of the writing itself is crucial to the impact on the reader. A person can have an exciting, worthy life but unfortunately write about it (or be written about) in a dull way. And how a person is remembered and valued can be a factor of life writing about or by them. This chapter will define and contextualise life writing, look at specific detailed examples, and offer guidance on how to write effectively. Key concepts and strategies in life writing These will help you think through what is required of each form, which form <b>best</b> <b>suits</b> <b>you,</b> and what aspects to address in your writing. Life writing is primarily a way of making an individual 2 ̆ 7 s life and times – either one 2 ̆ 7 s own or someone else 2 ̆ 7 s – ‘matter’ to others, and to reflect on what is important about that life. It makes a story about a ‘self’ that develops in some way. Finally, life writers use the organising principles of narrative to give shape to a life. (Biography also can be a story about a group of people, a city, animal or object.) ...|$|R
40|$|British {{overseas}} {{investment was}} one of the most powerful forces contributing to rapid global integration before World War 1. Approaching half of this total was in the form of foreign direct investment, as British entrepreneurs increasingly located their activities away from the mature domestic economy to faster growing, less-developed regions. Weetman Pearson {{was one of}} the most successful of all Britain’s overseasbased entrepreneurs of the period. Using original financial records, the paper shows how the Pearson group of companies became one of Britain’s most valuable industrial enterprises by 1919 having diversified from international contracting into the Mexican oil industry from 1901. The Pearson group highlights how British entrepreneurs were technically competent in managing large, complex infrastructure projects, able to navigate their way through various political systems, and adept at turning to <b>whichever</b> organisational form <b>best</b> <b>suited</b> their business interests; characteristics far removed from the outdated stereotype of the incompetent Late Victorian entrepreneur...|$|R
50|$|Metabolic {{pathways}} {{can be used}} by metabolic {{engineers to}} create a desired product. By modifying the types of cofactors used and the times at which they are used, the outcome of the metabolic network can change. To create a greater production of a product, metabolic engineers have the ability to supply the network with <b>whichever</b> cofactor is <b>best</b> <b>suited</b> for that specific process. This leads to the optimization of networks to give a higher production of desired products. Also, changing the cofactors used in a network may be an ingenious solution to a complicated problem. A network that is present in the cell, but is often unused, may have a desirable product. Instead of engineering a completely new set of pathways to produce the product, cofactor engineering can be applied. By replacing enzymes to use cofactors readily available in a cell, the typically unused network is no longer cofactor-limited, and production may be increased.|$|R

Possibly an in-transition or post-op transsexual, she still has breasts when not dressed in female clothes. Sly, calculating, and a 5th degree black belt, Fukunaga is a skilled {{manipulator}} whose weaknesses appear to be her desire for money and her temper. Age unknown; alludes to being noticeably older than she seems. During Round 3, Fukunaga learns to cooperate with Nao and Akiyama, and even when Fukunaga finishes the round debt-free, she chooses {{to continue in the}} tournament to aid them. However, Fukunaga is forced to confront Yokoya without their help in the third revival round and is eliminated from the game with over one billion yen of debt. In later chapters, Fukunaga recognizes Nao's improvement and starts to get fond of her, although she still believes she is incompetent. Nao also observed that Fukunaga may have a crush on Akiyama. After Fukunaga's identified-as-male-at-birth identity is revealed, the Japanese text deliberately avoids referring to [...] "her" [...] by gender.

Sly, calculating, and a 5th degree black belt, Fukunaga is a skilled yet short-tempered manipulator who {{participates in the}} Liar Game to try to amass wealth. Fukunaga alludes to being noticeably older than she seems, though her age is not given. During Round 3, Fukunaga cooperates with Nao and Akiyama. When Fukunaga finishes the round debt-free, she chooses {{to continue in the}} tournament. Nao bluntly tells Akiyama that Fukunaga is romantically interested in him, at which Akiyama expresses discomfited disinterest. After this episode, Fukunaga is always seen wearing a wig and in feminine dress. When Fukunaga is forced to confront Yokoya and his allies almost alone, she is eliminated from the game with over one billion yen of debt after transferring all the money acquired in the game to another player out of goodwill. As the game progresses, Fukunaga notes Nao's improvement and grows a little fond of her, although she still believes she is incompetent and aggravatingly stupid. After Fukunaga is identified-as-male-at-birth identity is revealed, the Japanese text deliberately avoids referring to [...] "her" [...] by gender. (In the live version, this character is still male, but with a vaguely homosexual overtone.) However, in English translations, the feminine pronoun is usually used when referring to Fukunaga. She often alternates between personas - an ultra-feminine cold and superior mature femme fatale; a bullheaded boisterous and physically intimidating man in obvious drag; a seemingly none-too-bright loud young delinquent girl; and gradations in between - <b>whichever</b> currently <b>best</b> <b>suits</b> Fukunaga's own needs, both in the game and outside of it.

Many legal news web sites offer the option for visitors to sign up for e-mail alerts that can provide up-to-the-minute news delivered to your e-mail inbox. It is also possible to use a combination of web resources and e-mail to monitor court dockets. If you need in-depth information about a topic, you might consider joining a legal listserv or e-mail discussion list. Finally a recent strategy for staying on top of current legal topics is to become acquainted with legal blogs and how to access them. The latest expansion of blogging that is useful for obtaining current information is podcasting or sending soundfiles via the Internet.
