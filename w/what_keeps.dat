The chief character in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell isn't, in fact, either of the magicians: it's the library that they both adore, the books they consult and write and, in a sense, become.

It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music.

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle, Dinah faces off against her former friend, accidentally decapitating Edaniel in the process. An enraged Edrear {{attempts}} to kill her, but eventually halts when Dinah {{points out that}} he's crying for his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and share one kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's scythe (the only thing she had that could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to see into the monster, she finds that {{a piece of the}} cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged in her chest, allowing Dinah to conclude that the piece is <b>what</b> <b>keeps</b> the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.|$|E

Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} half of its first season, Fringe staff and critics noted that the series was still trying to define itself and its characters.

Actor Lance Reddick, who portrays Agent Broyles, later explained in an interview how important the episode was to the evolution of the series, [...] "We found who we were in episode 10, the episode where Olivia got kidnapped... We were trying to hedge our bets and trying to be too many kinds of shows at once. I'm not saying we got rid of the procedural element because each episode still is on a case – a case in terms of the quote-unquote police work — but it's not formulaic, not like the early episodes. <b>What</b> <b>keeps</b> the show most watchable is the fact that it is character-based." ...|$|E

500|$|Jon Pareles of The New York Times {{said that}} “Loud works the pop gizmos as neatly as any album this year, {{maintaining}} the Rihanna brand. But the album has a hermetic, cool calculation until {{it gets to}} 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' her take on the tortured hit she shared with Eminem. 'It’s sick that all these battles are <b>what</b> <b>keeps</b> me satisfied,' she sings. A lone piano humanizes her first vocals, and she rides the ascending power ballad to a pained resolve; then Eminem delivers new verses in a spiraling rage. It’s purely theatrical, but it’s also, for a moment, raw. Christopher Richards of The Washington Post said that [...] "With 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' the maniac-mouthed rapper is limited to just one verse, giving Rihanna the space to take ownership of the proceedings. Will the real Rihanna please stand up? She does -- and she sounds as remote as ever." [...] James Skinner of BBC Online viewed 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)' as being even better than the original. He said, [...] "Eminem’s verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited {{about him in the}} first place. But it is Rihanna’s vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself, elevating it from a hit-and-miss collection into something oddly arresting." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{association}} of wealth with merits done has deeply affected many Buddhist countries. The relation between giving and wealth is ubiquitous in vernacular Pāli literature, and many stories of exemplary donors exist, {{such as the}} stories of Anāthapiṇḍika and Jōtika. In Buddhism, by emphasizing the usage of wealth for generosity, accumulating wealth for giving purposes thus became a spiritual practice. But using wealth in unrighteous ways, or hoarding it instead of sharing and giving it, is condemned extensively. Greed is <b>what</b> <b>keeps</b> a person wandering in Saṃsāra (the cycle of rebirth), instead of becoming liberated. It is the attachment to wealth that is an obstacle on the spiritual path, not wealth per se. Stories illustrating these themes in vernacular Buddhist literature, have profoundly influenced popular culture in Buddhist countries. Several scholars have described merit {{as a sort of}} spiritual currency or bookkeeping system. Though objections have been made against this metaphor, it is not new. Similar comparisons {{have been made in the}} Milinda Pañhā, and in seventeenth-century China. Moreover, Schopen has shown that Buddhism has had strong connections with the mercantile class, and Rotman thinks that a mercantile ethos may have informed Buddhist texts such as the Divyāvadāna. Gombrich objects to calling merit-making [...] "dry metaphysical mercantilism", but he does speculate on a historical relation between the concept of merit and the monetization of ancient India's economy.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the mixed}} reaction, many critics were {{fond of the}} album. Rolling Stones music critic Jenny Eliscu wrote that the album [...] "has made what ends up {{being one of the}} best straight-up pop-rock albums of 2006". Elicsu also complimented the band, writing: [...] "Like the Goo Goo Dolls... Yellowcard have {{rightfully}} recognized the transcendent value of a big, fist-pumping anthem coated with a light dose of romantic schmaltz." [...] Alternative Press gave the album a perfect rating, saying, [...] "It {{may be one of the}} least 'punk' albums a pop-punk band will make this year--but it's probably one of the best, too." [...] Sputnikmusic gave the album 3.5 out of five stars, writing: [...] "It's pop-punk, and fairly unambitious stuff at that ... <b>What</b> <b>keeps</b> this record on its feet is the lyricism, the production and the simplicity of it all." [...] Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote: [...] "On Lights and Sounds, Yellowcard sounds light years away from its One for the Kids/Where We Stand days. Granted, the band still trades in the immediate melodies and heart-on-sleeve lyrics that they've used since the beginning, but major-label success suits them well." [...] Though, Phares went on to add that the band [...] "ends up sounding self-assured instead of compromised in its big-budget surroundings." [...] Billboard magazine gave the album 8 out of 10 stars, and claimed that Yellowcard made a [...] "strong effort that trades sunny-sounding rockers and breakup songs for weightier concerns of war and family, 'Lights' conveys that maturity without seeming strained." [...] Dan McClanahan of Iowa State Daily wrote: [...] "...This disc will likely change people's opinion of Yellowcard. Much more angst and a drastically matured sound make for a pleasant surprise." [...] McClanahan revealed that he was not looking forward to listen to the album, but admitted once he heard he knew it embraced the band's [...] "strengths" [...] and that they [...] "greatly expanded the subject matter of its songs." ...|$|E

500|$|In sheep breeds lacking facial wool, {{the visual}} field is wide. In 10 sheep (Cambridge, Lleyn and Welsh Mountain breeds, which lack facial wool), the visual field ranged from 298° to 325°, {{averaging}} 313.1°, with binocular overlap ranging from 44.5° to 74°, averaging 61.7°. In some breeds, unshorn facial wool can limit the visual field; in some individuals, {{this may be}} enough to cause [...] "wool blindness". In 60 Merinos, visual fields ranged from 219.1° to 303.0°, averaging 269.9°, and the binocular field ranged from 8.9° to 77.7°, averaging 47.5°; 36% of the measurements were limited by wool, although photographs of the experiments indicate that only limited facial wool regrowth had occurred since shearing. In addition to facial wool (in some breeds), visual field limitations can include ears and (in some breeds) horns, so the visual field can be extended by tilting the head. Sheep eyes exhibit very low hyperopia and little astigmatism. Such visual characteristics are likely to produce a well-focused retinal image of objects in both the middle and long distance. Because sheep eyes have no accommodation, one might expect the image of very near objects to be blurred, but a rather clear near image {{could be provided by}} the tapetum and large retinal image of the sheep's eye, and adequate close vision may occur at muzzle length. Good depth perception, inferred from the sheep's sure-footedness, was confirmed in [...] "visual cliff" [...] experiments; behavioral responses indicating depth perception are seen in lambs at one day old. Sheep are thought to have colour vision, and can distinguish between a variety of colours: black, red, brown, green, yellow and white. Sight is a vital part of sheep communication, and when grazing, they maintain visual contact with each other. Each sheep lifts its head upwards to check the position of other sheep in the flock. This constant monitoring is probably <b>what</b> <b>keeps</b> the sheep in a flock as they move along grazing. Sheep become stressed when isolated; this stress is reduced if they are provided with a mirror, indicating that the sight of other sheep reduces stress.|$|E
