40|$|Objective-To {{determine}} {{clinical signs}} and clinicopathologic abnormalities in dogs with naturally occurring clinical spirocercosis. Design-Retrospective case series. Animals- 39 dogs with spirocercosis. Procedures-Medical records were reviewed, {{and information on}} signalment, residence (rural vs urban), owner complaints, physical examination findings, clinicopathologic abnormalities, radiographic and endoscopic findings, and concurrent systemic diseases was recorded. Results-Hellenic hounds and mixed-breed dogs were overrepresented, compared with a group <b>of</b> 117 control <b>dogs</b> without spirocercosis that were examined because of gastrointestinal tract disease, and mean body <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>dogs</b> with spirocercosis {{was significantly higher than}} mean body <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> control <b>dogs.</b> Cidynophagia (34 [87]), regurgitation (24 [62 %]), and excessive salivation (14 [36 %]) were the most common clinical findings. The most common radiographic abnormalities were a mass in the caudodorsal aspect of the mediastinum (15 / 35 [43 %]) and spondylitis of the caudal thoracic vertebrae (10 [29 %]). Parasitic nodules were seen during esophagoscopy in all 39 dogs. Normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia; neutrophilic leukocytosis; hyperproteinemia; and high alkaline phosphatase activity were significantly more common in dogs with spirocercosis than in a control group <b>of</b> 56 healthy <b>dogs.</b> Concurrent systemic diseases, mainly leishmaniosis, dirofilariosis, and monocytic ehrlichiosis, were documented in 14 (36 %) dogs. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggest that clinical spirocercosis occurs more often in youngadult, large-breed dogs. Nonregenerative anemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis, hyperproteinemia, and high alkaline phosphatase activity may be useful clinicopathologic indicators of this disease...|$|R

40|$|A simple, rapid {{method for}} the {{bioassay}} of renin has been presented. Reliable and consistent results are obtained by this method whereby an arbitrary <b>dog</b> unit <b>of</b> renin has been established. The response <b>of</b> normal unanesthetized <b>dogs</b> to renin is independent <b>of</b> the body <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>dogs</b> weighing between 10 and 25 kilos. An estimate of potency of renin per kilo <b>of</b> body <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the test animals {{is therefore not}} only unnecessary but misleading. A <b>dog</b> unit <b>of</b> renin {{has been defined as}} that amount which raises the blood pressure at least 30 and not more than 35 mm. Hg within 3 minutes in at least three unanesthetized dogs.

40|$|The minimal {{lethal dose}} (MLD), the classic factor which expresses the acute {{toxicity}} of ‘ocal anesthetics, has long been accepted as a standard of control in the clinical use of these drugs. The acceptability of this factor, which is usually calculated on the basis <b>of</b> body <b>weight,</b> is doubtful when applied {{to the field of}} subarachnoid anesthesia. Co Tui (1) was the first to call attention to its inapplicability when, in 1933, he found the spinal length to be a more accurate determinant of the intracisternal MLD of procaine-hydrochloride in the dog than its weight. He analyzed parallel figures given by Flexner, Clark and Weed (2) on the intradural volumes, spinal lengths and body <b>weights</b> <b>of</b> <b>dogs</b> and he showed a closer relationship between the intradural volume and the spinal length than between the intradural volume and the body weight.

40|$|Abstract Background Doppler {{ultrasonography}} is {{an important}} tool for evaluating hepatic portal hemodynamics. However, no study in <b>dogs</b> <b>of</b> different body <b>weights,</b> in the range encountered in routine clinical veterinary practice, has been reported. It {{can be difficult to}} obtain an ideal insonation angle when evaluating the main portal vein, so evaluation of the right portal vein branch has been described in humans as an alternative. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze, through Doppler ultrasonography, the hemodynamics in the right portal vein branch in <b>dogs</b> <b>of</b> different body <b>weights.</b> Methods Thirty normal dogs were divided in three groups by weight, in order to establish normal values for mean velocity, flow volume and portal congestion index of the right portal vein branch by means of Doppler ultrasonography. Results In all dogs ideal insonation angles were obtained for the right portal vein branch. The average velocity was similar in the three groups, but the portal congestion index and the flow volume differed, showing that the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dog</b> can influence these values. Conclusion Doppler ultrasonography for the evaluation of flow in the right branch of the portal vein could be a viable alternative, or complement, to examining the main vessel segment. This is especially so in those animals in which an ideal insonation angle for examination of the main portal vein is hard to obtain. In addition, the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dog</b> must be considered for the correct evaluation of the portal system hemodynamics, particularly for portal blood flow and the congestion index. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} the ultrasonographic {{appearance of the}} major duodenal papilla (MDP) in <b>dogs</b> without evidence <b>of</b> hepatobiliary, pancreatic, or gastrointestinal tract disease. ANIMALS 40 adult client-owned <b>dogs</b> examined because <b>of</b> conditions that did not include hepatobiliary, pancreatic, or gastrointestinal tract disease. PROCEDURES Ultrasonographic examination of the MDP was performed. Each MDP was measured in 3 planes. Intraobserver reliability of measurements was determined, and associations between MDP dimensions and characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>dogs</b> were investigated. Histologic examination of longitudinal sections of the MDP was performed for 1 dog to compare the ultrasonographic and histologic appearance. RESULTS The MDP appeared as a layered structure with a hyperechoic outer layer, hypoechoic middle layer, and hyperechoic inner layer that corresponded to the duodenal serosa, duodenal muscularis, and duodenal submucosa, respectively. Layers visible during ultrasonographic examinations were consistent with layers identified histologically. Intraobserver reliability was substantial for each plane of measurement. Mean ± SD length, width, and height of the MDP were 15. 2 ± 3. 5 mm, 6. 3 ± 1. 6 mm, and 4. 3 ± 1. 0 mm, respectively.

Currently, the available device of GES cannot meet the clinical needs. The {{purpose of this study}} is to verify the effect of a new type of adjustable gastric elec-trical stimulator in reducing food intake and body weight. Methods Eight beagle dogs randomly followed GES and sham GES for 3 months in a crossover design. Parameters were adjusted and individualized during the experiment. Symptoms of GES were recorded, and the effective param-eters were selected. Resistance to GES was assessed. Food intake and body weight were measured to evaluate the effect of GES. Results The effective parameters were varied among the dogs. Resistance to GES was observed in different periods in dogs. Parameters needed to be adjusted every 10. 2 ± 2. 1 days during the period of GES. Food intake during GES for 3 months was significantly reduced than that during sham GES of 3 months (P< 0. 05).

50|$|The {{analysis}} of variance {{can be used as}} an exploratory tool to explain observations. A dog show provides an example. A dog show is not a random sampling of the breed: it is typically limited to dogs that are adult, pure-bred, and exemplary. A histogram <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> <b>weights</b> from a show might plausibly be rather complex, like the yellow-orange distribution shown in the illustrations. Suppose we wanted to predict the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> a <b>dog</b> based on a certain set of characteristics <b>of</b> each <b>dog.</b> Before we could do that, we would need to explain the distribution <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> by dividing the dog population into groups based on those characteristics. A successful grouping will split dogs such that (a) each group has a low variance <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> <b>weights</b> (meaning the group is relatively homogeneous) and (b) the mean of each group is distinct (if two groups have the same mean, then it isn't reasonable to conclude that the groups are, in fact, separate in any meaningful way).In the illustrations to the right, each group is identified as X1, X2, etc. In the first illustration, we divide the dogs according to the product (interaction) of two binary groupings: young vs old, and short-haired vs long-haired (thus, group 1 is young, short-haired dogs, group 2 is young, long-haired dogs, etc.). Since the distributions <b>of</b> <b>dog</b> <b>weight</b> within each <b>of</b> the groups (shown in blue) has a large variance, and since the means are very close across groups, grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights: knowing which group a dog is in does not allow us to make any reasonable statements as to what that dog's weight is likely to be. Thus, this grouping fails to fit the distribution we are trying to explain (yellow-orange).|$|R

50|$|While snowmobiles may makeup {{the quickest}} {{transportation}} {{means for the}} Inuit, they still relied on dog sledding until the 1980s. Most of the food that was once fed to the sled dogs who pulled the sleighs was meat from seals, caribou, walruses, or whatever form of food was available at the time. But even dog food has been modernized, and 12.8 million kilo-calories were imported: one hundred and twenty-eight billion calories, which if converted to the human two thousand calorie diet, {{would be able to}} feed six hundred and forty thousand people. When put into perspective, with the temperature being as cold as it, more body heat has to be produced, and with the amount of running and the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> sleds the <b>dogs</b> pull, that more energy consumption that is needed in order to maintain a state of homeostasis and good nutrition for each dog.|$|R
40|$|Key words: growth curve, dog, curve fit, {{maximum weight}} Abstract: The present studies have the purpose the {{anticipation}} of growth <b>of</b> the <b>dogs</b> and the estimation of the associated critical period. For the estimation of growth curve was used the results obtained after the measurement done at a group <b>of</b> 83 <b>dogs,</b> and was applied three mathematic models. The curves fitted using the linear, the Gompertz modified and the logarithmic modified, has lead at {{the determination of the}} individual specific values. These models permit the achievement of some supplementary parameters: the maximum <b>weight,</b> the time <b>of</b> maximum growth and the maximum speed of growth. The substantiate of results have permit {{the anticipation of}} the high intensity growth period (the time of maximum growth) placed between 2 and 5 months of age, individual variable in this interval. At the same time, the application of the mathematic models permit the estimation of the development potential (the maximum weight) and the specific period of growths (the maximum speed of growth) {{that can be used to}} adjust the nutrition and the life stile. INTRODUCTION. In the course of growth the body development is dinamic, so it is very important to anticipate the critical period like that to assure the proper management.

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{proposed}} {{to evaluate a}} new method for autograft transplantation of liver tissue fragments (LTF) in the lung parenchyma and bronchus <b>of</b> <b>dogs</b> and to compare the results {{to find out if}} they are suitable sites for hepatocyte implantation or not. Materials and Methods: The dogs were randomly assigned into two categories: LTF auto-transplantation to the lung parenchyma and into the bronchus. The suspensions of normal saline and LTF were injected and implanted into the lung parenchyma and the main bronchus of the right accessory lobe in first and second groups, respectively. Two weeks later the right accessory lobe was removed and sent for a histopathological study. All samples were checked under a light microscope with regard to the presence of hepatocytes, with both the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) preparation and immunohistochemistry (IHC) method, using a CK- 18 marker. All results were double-checked with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The mean <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> all the <b>dogs</b> was 19. 87 ± 0. 93 kg and mean age was 3. 58 ± 0. 31 years. After 15 days, the H and E, IHC, and PCR studies revealed that in the first group, all the dogs (n = 4) had living liver tissue, which survived in the lung parenchyma successfully. In contrast, none <b>of</b> the <b>dogs</b> (n = 0) in the second group showed surviving hepatocytes in the bronchus (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Implantation of the LTFs into the lung parenchyma could be a source of hepatic cell production...|$|R
40|$|An {{intravenous}} infusion procedure using pi-locarpine hydrochloride {{maintains a}} steady state of parotid saliva flow {{for at least}} 30 minutes in the anesthetized <b>dog.</b> The per-formance <b>of</b> the method is independent of age, sex, body <b>weight,</b> and breed <b>of</b> <b>dogs.</b> The effect <b>of</b> changes in flow rate on the chemical composition of saliva complicates the study of salivary gland physiology. Even minor variations in rate of gland function can bring about {{major changes in the}} con-centration of certain constituents. If a steady state of flow could be produced in experimental animals, meaningful results could be obtained in studies of the glandular handling of salivary constituents. This study was concerned with developing and testing a procedure that provides such a steady rate of flow from the parotid gland <b>of</b> the <b>dog.</b> Base-line biochemical data on these saliva samples are presented. Materials and Methods Eight fasting adult mongrel <b>dogs</b> <b>of</b> both sexes (11. 4 to 22. 7 kg each) were studied. The dogs were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) and an intratra-cheal cannula was inserted in each dog. Vacuum-maintained collection capsl were positioned over the parotid ducts and the combined flow from both glands was col-lected in a 5. 0 -ml pipette through a 4 -inch length of polyethylene tubinga (inside diam-eter, 0. 023 inch). Sixteen to 20 three-minute samples were collected during each of three experiments conducted with each dog. Th...|$|R

40|$|Forearm {{blood flow}} in normal human {{subjects}} {{was found to}} decrease progressively during intra-venous infusions of norepinephrine as the rate of infusion increased (2). After 1 week of treat-ment with chlorothiazide, the same subjects re-sponded to the same doses of norepinephrine with progressive increases in flow. This reversal of the response might be interpreted as redistribution of blood flow into the extremity because of relatively greater vasoconstriction in other vascular beds. It also could {{be the result of}} increased cardiac out-put with the proportion of blood flow to the vari-ous vascular beds remaining the same. The latter hypothesis seemed more attractive. The experiments to be reported here were done on intact dogs to see if treatment with chlorothia-zide alters hemodynamic responses to norepineph-rine. METHODS AND PROCEDURE The experiments were done on 12 male, mongrel dogs weighing 10 to 15 kg. Six were given daily intravenous injections of chlorothiazide, 25 mg per kg for 7 days. Six were untreated. All were given water ad libitum and the same diet (based on body <b>weight)</b> <b>of</b> canned commercial <b>dog</b> food for 7 days before the acute experi-ments were carried out.

40|$|Sled {{dogs are}} known to develop {{numerous}} serum biochemical changes due to endurance exercise. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} mild hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia can develop during endurance racing. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine if serum biochemical alterations are similar to previous reports, and if electrolyte alterations are still present with present feeding practices utilised by mushers. Serum chemistries were obtained from 26 Alaskan Huskies belonging to 3 different teams, before and after a 1600 km race. Meals and snacks were analysed via calculation to determine daily macronutrient and electrolyte intake. Numerous biochemical alterations were observed including significant differences in serum total protein, albu-min, globulin, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, TAG, NEFA and urea nitrogen (P< 0 · 05). Serum electrolyte status revealed a mild, yet signifi-cant decrease in serum sodium (P = 0 · 002); and serum potassium was not significantly different (P = 0 · 566). Further examination of the sodium intake across the three teams revealed two teams with an average daily intake of approximately 8 · 5 g/dog/d (700 mg/ 4184 kJ) and the other team consuming 11 · 1 g/dog/d (1200 mg/ 4184 kJ). Regression analysis shows a significant modest positive correlation between serum sodium decrease and sodium intake per metabolic body <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dogs,</b> as well as a modest positive correlation between sodium intake and serum potassium implicating the renin–angio-tensin aldosterone system as a major factor involved in sodium and potassium homoeostasis. These findings suggest that consumption of approximately 0 · 9 g/kg 0 · 75 (1 · 2 g/ 4184 kJ) of sodium per d may prevent exercise-induced decreases in sodium and potassium...|$|R
