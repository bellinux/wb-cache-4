5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{is home to}} one of {{the last}} stands of old-growth forest in eastern North Carolina. A forest of bay trees, sweetgum, pawpaw, persimmon, bald cypress and poplar are found on the {{northern}} shore of Lake Phelps. The cypress have a trunk diameter of up to tenfeet (3m) and the poplar have a trunk diameter of sixfeet (2m). There are vines that are as wide as an average man's leg and grow up the trees in excess of 130feet (40m).

Several of the trees at Pettigrew State Park are listed on the North Carolina and National Registries of Big Trees.|$|E
5|$|The Swan Coastal Plain {{north of}} Perth {{has become an}} {{important}} feeding area. There, cockatoos also forage in the Gnangara pine plantations, where they feed on the seeds of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). Carnaby's black cockatoos have come to depend on these plantations since the early 20th century. Almost two-thirds of the Carnaby's black cockatoos in the Perth–Peel Coastal Plain roost in the Gnangara-Pinjar pine plantation.

2500|$|Arkansas's {{plant life}} varies with its climate and elevation. The pine belt {{stretching}} from the Arkansas delta to Texas consists of dense oak-hickory-pine growth. Lumbering and paper milling activity is active throughout the region. In eastern Arkansas, one can find Taxodium [...] (cypress), Quercus nigra (water oaks), and hickories with their roots submerged in the Mississippi Valley bayous indicative of the deep south. Nearby Crowley's Ridge is only home of the tulip tree in the state, and generally hosts more northeastern plant life such as the beech tree. The northwestern highlands are covered in an oak-hickory mixture, with Ozark <b>white</b> <b>cedars,</b> cornus (dogwoods), and Cercis canadensis (redbuds) also present. The higher peaks in the Arkansas River Valley play host to scores of ferns, including the Woodsia scopulina and Adiantum (maidenhair fern) on Mount Magazine.|$|R

5000|$|The old-growth forestlands {{throughout}} Green Lakes State Park were extensively {{surveyed in}} 2001-2002 {{by members of}} the Wildwood Ancient Forest Alliance. The surveys found that there are about 800 acre of old-growth forest within the park. The surveyors speculated that the paucity of hemlock trees in some areas indicates selective cutting of this species, perhaps for log roads in the mid 19th Century. They nonetheless conclude that [...] "Green Lakes State Park is likely the finest old growth forest in central New York." [...] Green Lakes State Park contains particularly old and large examples of tuliptrees, sugar maples, beech, basswood, hemlocks, and <b>white</b> <b>cedars.</b> One particularly impressive grove of trees, lying just southwest of Round Lake, was renamed the Tuliptree Cathedral following the 2001-2002 old-growth surveys. A survey of the heights of especially large trees was reported in 2011; the tallest was 147 ft.|$|R
25|$|Vegetation on the {{limestone}} and other sedimentary soils ranges from lowland rainforest to grasslands to scrub brush in more arid areas. In forested areas, the trees include oaks, pines, <b>white</b> <b>cedar,</b> strawberry trees and oyamels. In the drier areas, {{there are also}} mesquite trees with some other desert plants including cactus. In the lowest elevations there are tropical hardwoods such as red cedar, Montezuma cypress and a tree called the “parota.” Wildlife mostly consists of birds and mammals such as doves, quails, chachalacas, eagles, roadrunners, and some waterfowl. Mammals include squirrels, rabbits, armadillos, white-tailed deer, foxes, coyotes, wild boar, pumas, raccoons, skunks, and opossums. There are some reptiles such as rattlesnakes and coral snakes.|$|E
25|$|There {{are about}} 20,000 {{hectares}} of forest {{which can be}} cut and include species such as pine, oyamel, juniper, <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> and red cedar, oak, poplar, strawberry trees, mesquite and more. In areas without logging, {{there are a number}} of species of plants with medicinal properties, including wild oregano, cat´s claws and more, which produce a harvest of about 500 tons per year. Wild foodstuffs include maguey, nopal cactus, pitayo fruit, yuccas and more, which usually give a more abundant harvest once every four years. Wild herbs area generally harvested between August and November. Another product is the production of willow branches, which is supplied as raw material to communities such as Tequisquiapan for crafts.|$|E
25|$|In the {{northeast}} {{part of the}} range (United States and Canada), prime habitat consists of a forest canopy of hardwoods such as beech, maple, and birch, and coniferous species. Corn crops and oak-hickory mast are also common sources of food in some sections of the Northeast; small, thick swampy areas provide excellent refuge cover largely in stands of <b>white</b> <b>cedar.</b> Along the Pacific coast, redwood, Sitka spruce, and hemlocks predominate as overstory cover. Within these northern forest types are early successional areas important for black bears, such as fields of brush, wet and dry meadows, high tidelands, riparian areas, {{and a variety of}} mast-producing hardwood species. The spruce-fir forest dominates much of the range of the black bear in the Rockies. Important nonforested areas here are wet meadows, riparian areas, avalanche chutes, roadsides, burns, sidehill parks, and subalpine ridgetops.|$|E

[...] Overall the park contains Laurentian Mixed Forest comprising both conifers and broadleafs. [...] Before European settlement the Brule River Valley would have been forested mostly with white pine. [...] Extensive logging and forest fires have altered the park's vegetation significantly, except around the rocky and inaccessible ridgetops. [...] Today's secondary forest is dominated by aspen and birch, with stands of white spruce, sugar maple, and basswood. [...] There are a few remnant stands of white pine on hilltops and ravines, especially along Gauthier Creek. [...] Large northern <b>white</b> <b>cedars</b> are abundant along the river. [...] Inland are many dense stands of white spruce, the result of planting and vigorous natural reseeding after the timber harvests. [...] Around the waterfalls, the constant mist creates a microclimate conducive to several plant species not found elsewhere in the park.|$|R

Individual artisans create each piece from selecting the wood to polishing the final product. These products can be found in markets and stores, especially in areas with a large indigenous population. Patzcuaro and Uruapan are particularly noted for wood working.|$|E
