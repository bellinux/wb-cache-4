By using Fluent {{and the environment}} wind tunnel, some results were simulated and tested for two different types of airfoils and its <b>wind</b> <b>guide</b> vane. The performance data on certain condition was obtained. Research showed that utilization of wind energy with guide vane wind turbine was higher than those without guide vane structure. The performance of airfoil was more excellent than airfoil. <b>Wind</b> <b>guide</b> vane structure is a new structure for wind turbine which will have a wide prospect...|$|E

Airflow parameters and efficiency improvement for the main plant cooling process using the applied technology were determined and compared with the capabilities of existing systems. The project required significant planning and pre-test execution {{in order to reach}} the required Air Cooled Condenser system configuration for evaluation. A host Power Plant ACC system had to be identified, agreement finalized, and addition of the SPX ACC <b>Wind</b> <b>Guide</b> Technology completed on that site. Design of the modification, along with procurement, fabrication, instrumentation, and installation of the new airflow enhancement technology were executed. Baseline and post-modification cooling system data was collected and evaluated. The improvement of ACC thermal performance after SPX <b>wind</b> <b>guide</b> installation was clear. Testing of the improvement indicates there is a 5 % improvement in heat transfer coefficient in high wind conditions and 1 % improvement at low wind speed. The benefit increased with increasing wind speed. This project was completed on schedule and within budget...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTurpan area {{is one of}} the harsher climate {{areas in}} the world. It belongs to the {{continental}} desert climate in warm temperate zone, the highest temperature is up to 48. 3 °C in summer (2008) and the lowest temperature in winter is low to - 28. 9 °C (1998). The number of days of wind speed more than 17. 0 m/s are 80. 3 on average and the annual rainfall is only 16 mm[1]. However, Turpan area is rich in solar energy resources and the annual sunshine hours are 3200 on average. Thus the key to architecture design is how to withstand extreme climate conditions and make full use of solar energy resources. The case integrates active solar systems and passive solar effect is achieved simultaneously, such as shading, ventilation, insulation, etc. The effect such as sheltering from the <b>wind,</b> <b>guiding</b> the <b>wind</b> and shading sunlight is achieved by setting up semi-translucent PV curtain and certain number of cavity on exterior wall. More, the solar ventilation system between the PV curtain wall and exterior wall can take away the heat generated from the PV curtain wall and interior rooms; PV skylight roof can adjust the illumination of the atrium to avoid too low or too high illumination; The extruding PV curtain wall can block sunlight radiation on the underlying window to achieve self-shading...|$|R

40|$|Fujian earthen {{building}} {{which was}} known as a classic for ecological buildings was listed on the world heritage in 2008 (UNESCO) in China. Its design strategy can be applied to modern architecture planning and design. This study chose two different cases (Round Atrium: Er-Yi Building, Double Round Atrium: Zhen-Chen Building) of earthen building in Fu-Jian to compare the ventilation effects of different atrium forms. We adopt field measurements and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of temperature, humidity, and wind environment to identify the relationship between external environment and atrium about comfort and to confirm the relationship about atrium H/W (height/width). Results indicate that, through the atrium convection effect, it makes the natural <b>wind</b> <b>guides</b> to each space surrounded and keeps indoor comfort. It illustrates that the smaller the ratio of the H/W which is the relationship between the height and the width of an atrium is, the greater the wind speed generated within the street valley. Moreover, the wind speed is very close to the reference wind speed. This field measurement verifies that the value of H/W has great influence of solar radiation heat and sunshine shadows. The ventilation efficiency is: Er-Yi Building (H/W = 0. 2778) > Zhen-Chen Building (H/W= 0. 3670). Comparing the cases with the same shape but with different H/W, through the different size patios, airflow revolves in the atriums and can be brought into each interior space. The atrium settings meet the need of building ventilation, and can adjust the humidity and temperature within the buildings. It also creates good ventilation effect...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Aerial cargo delivery, {{also known}} as airdrop, systems are heavily {{affected}} by atmospheric <b>wind</b> conditions. <b>Guided</b> air-drop systems typically employ onboard wind velocity estimation methods to predict the wind in real time as the systems descend, but these methods provide no foresight of the winds near the ground. Unexpected ground winds can result in large errors in landing lo-cation, and they can even lead to damage or complete loss of the cargo if the system impacts the ground while traveling downwind. This paper reports on a ground-based mechatronic system consist-ing of a cup and vane anemometer coupled to a guided airdrop system through a wireless transceiver. The guidance logic running on the airdrop system’s onboard autopilot is modified to integrate the anemometer measurements at ground level near the intended landing zone with onboard wind estimates to provide an improved, real-time estimate of the wind profile. The concept was first devel-oped {{in the framework of}} a rigorous simulation model and then val-idated in the flight test. Both simulation and subsequent flight tests with the prototype system demonstrate reductions in the landing position error by more than 30 % as well as a complete elimination of potentially dangerous downwind landings.
