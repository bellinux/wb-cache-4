25|$|Bereket Gymnastic Club {{was founded}} under special {{permission}} on 4 March 1903. Their sporting activities gained more freedom with {{the declaration of}} the Constitutional Monarchy in 1908. After the political events of 31 March 1909, Fuat Balkan and Mazhar Kazancı, who were in Edirne, came to Istanbul with the Movement Army. After the political events settled down, Fuat Balkan, who was a good fencing coach, and Mazhar Kazancı, a good wrestler and <b>weight</b> <b>lifter,</b> found the youths involved in gymnastics in Serencebey and got them to agree to participate in sports together. Refik and Şerafettin Beys, friends of Fuat Bey, were also good fencers. Fuat Balkan made the space under his home in Ihlamur the Club’s headquarters, and the title of Bereket Gymnastics Club was changed to Beşiktaş Ottoman Gymnastics Club. Thus, a stronger sports club, where gymnastics, wrestling, boxing, fencing and athletics were emphasized, was formed. Founding member Mehmet Şamil Şhaplı was elected {{the first president of}} the club.|$|E

[...] Rollins reports that Black Flag's set-lists in this era rarely included older crowd favorites like [...] "Six Pack" [...] or [...] "Nervous Breakdown", and that audiences were often irritated by the new, slower Black Flag. Violence against the band (and especially Rollins) was ever-present, although the vocalist was now an avid <b>weight</b> <b>lifter,</b> and more than able to defend himself. Furthermore, to Rollins' chagrin, Ginn's interest in marijuana steadily increased; as Rollins put it, [...] "By '86 it was 'Cannot separate the man from his Anvil case with a big-ass stash.'" [...] Despite the initial resistance to the new music and quasi-psychedelic direction, My War would later be cited as a formative influence on the grunge, stoner and sludge metal genres. The band would continue to evolve toward a more heavy metal sound, with 1985's Loose Nut featuring more polished production.|$|E
60|$|But this dismal creed {{does not}} {{discourage}} {{those who believe}} that the impulse that produces evolution is creative. They have observed the simple fact that the will to do anything can and does, at a certain pitch of intensity set up by conviction of its necessity, create and organize new tissue to do it with. To them therefore mankind is by no means played out yet. If the <b>weight</b> <b>lifter,</b> under the trivial stimulus of an athletic competition, can 'put up a muscle,' it seems reasonable to believe that an equally earnest and convinced philosopher could 'put up a brain.' Both are directions of vitality to a certain end. Evolution shews us this direction of vitality doing all sorts of things: providing the centipede with a hundred legs, and ridding the fish of any legs at all; building lungs and arms for the land and gills and fins for the sea; enabling the mammal to gestate its young inside its body, and the fowl to incubate hers outside it; offering us, we may say, our choice of any sort of bodily contrivance to maintain our activity and increase our resources.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} velocity specific isokinetic {{forces and}} {{cross sectional area}}s of reciprocal muscle groups in Olympic <b>weight</b> <b>lifters.</b> METHODS: The cross sectional area of the flexor or extensor muscles of the elbow or knee joint was determined by a B-mode ultrasonic apparatus in 34 college <b>weight</b> <b>lifters</b> and 31 untrained male subjects matched for age. Maximum voluntary force produced in the flexion and extension of the elbow and knee joints was measured on an isokinetic dynamometer at 60, 180, and 300 degrees/s. RESULTS: The average cross sectional area was 31 - 65 % higher, and the force was 19 - 62 % higher in <b>weight</b> <b>lifters</b> than in the untrained subjects. The ratio of force to cross sectional area was the same in both groups. The <b>weight</b> <b>lifters</b> showed a lower velocity associated decline in force than untrained subjects in the elbow and knee flexors {{but not in the}} extensors. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that for muscle contractions with velocities between 60 degrees/s and 300 degrees/s the difference in isokinetic force between <b>weight</b> <b>lifters</b> and untrained subjects can be primarily attributed to the difference in the muscle cross sectional area. However, the lower velocity associated decline in force implies that <b>weight</b> <b>lifters</b> may have a higher force per cross sectional area than untrained subjects at velocities above 300 degrees/s. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the factors motivating the <b>weight</b> <b>lifters</b> participating in a weight-lifting championship and their organizational motivation level. Survey method was used in the study and the data were obtained from the <b>weight</b> <b>lifters</b> participating in Inter-club weight lifting champion.

40|$|Objective: in {{an effort}} to begin to {{construct}} a psychological profile ofanabolic steroid users, the authors compared <b>weight</b> <b>lifters</b> and bodybuilders who did or did not use anaholic steroids on an objective measure of narcissism and on clinical ratings of empathy. Method: The subjects were 1 6 <b>weight</b> <b>lifters</b> and bodybuilders who reported that they had used anabolic steroids within {{the past year and a}} comparison group of 20 <b>weight</b> <b>lifters</b> who had not used steroids. The Narcissistic Personality Inventory and clinical ratings of empathy were used to assess narcissism. Results: Steroid users had significantly higher scores on dimensions of pathological narcissism and significantly lower scores on clinical ratings of empathy. Conclu-Signs: These preliminary results document a relationship between anabolic steroid use and narcissistic personality traits. They also indicate the need for further research to determine whether narcissistic personality traits contribute to the initiation of anabolic steroid use or result from their use.

25|$|The {{development}} of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc {{countries such as}} East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur <b>weight</b> <b>lifters.</b> In response {{to the success of}} Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects. Ziegler's work resulted in the production of methandrostenolone, which Ciba Pharmaceuticals marketed as Dianabol. The new steroid was approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1958. It was most commonly administered to burn victims and the elderly. The drug's off-label users were mostly bodybuilders and <b>weight</b> <b>lifters.</b> Although Ziegler prescribed only small doses to athletes, he soon discovered that those having abused Dianabol suffered from enlarged prostates and atrophied testes. AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the IOC in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition.|$|R
