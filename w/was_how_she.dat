25|$|By {{the age of}} ten, Nouhad {{was already}} known at school for her unusual singing voice. She would sing {{regularly}} during school shows and on holidays. This <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> {{came to the attention}} of Mohammed Flayfel, a well known musician and a teacher at the Lebanese Conservatory, who happened to attend one of the school's shows in February 1950. Impressed by her voice and performance, he advised her to enroll in the conservatory, which she did. At first, Nouhad's conservative father was reluctant to send her to the conservatory; however, he eventually allowed her to go on condition that her brother accompany her. That having been said, Nouhad's family as a whole encouraged her in her musical career.|$|E

500|$|María Amelia Batvinik {{was born}} on 13 November 1914 in Buenos Aires, the {{youngest}} of seven children to Belarusian Jewish immigrants, Jaime Batvinik from Minsk, and Ana Zaguer from Pinsk. From an early age, she was drawn to acting and began performing alongside other neighborhood children in the courtyards of their homes. That <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> met Paulina Singerman, a neighbor, who suggested to Bence's mother that the child be enrolled in the Lavardén Children's Theater, operating in the Teatro Colón. At the age of five, she officially debuted, encouraged by the sisters Paulina and Berta Singerman, in poet Alfonsina Storni's work, [...] "Juanita".|$|E
500|$|Although {{she did not}} reign for long, Berengaria {{continued}} to be her son's closest advisor, intervening in state policy, albeit in an indirect manner. [...] Well into her son's reign, contemporary authors wrote that she still wielded authority over him. [...] One example <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> arranged the marriage of her son with princess Elisabeth of Hohenstaufen (known as Beatriz in Castile), daughter of Duke Philip of Swabia and granddaughter of two emperors: Frederick Barbarossa and Isaac II Angelos of Byzantium. [...] The wedding took place on 30 November 1219 at Burgos. [...] Another instance in which Berengaria's mediation stood out developed in 1218 when the scheming Lara family, still headed by former regent Álvaro Núñez de Lara, conspired to have Alfonso IX, King of León and King Ferdinand's father, invade Castile to seize his son's throne. However, the capture of Count Lara facilitated the intervention of Berengaria, who got father and son to sign the Pact of Toro on 26 August 1218, {{putting an end to}} confrontations between Castile and León.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to her musical skills, Callas had a particular gift for language {{and the use of}} language in music. In recitatives, she always knew which word to emphasize and which syllable in that word to bring out. Michael Scott notes, [...] "If we listen attentively, we note how her perfect legato enables her to suggest by musical means even the exclamation marks and commas of the text." [...] Technically, not only did she have the capacity to perform the most difficult florid music effortlessly, but also she had the ability to use each ornament as an expressive device rather than for mere fireworks. Soprano Martina Arroyo states, [...] "What interested me most <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> gave the runs and the cadenzas words. That always floored me.

In March, Ardent {{returned to}} the UK, and on 14 March was taken in hand at Sheerness for a long refit. The refit lasted until March 1938, and included the installation of anti-submarine detection equipment (ASDIC/Sonar). After the refit had been completed Ardent was nominated to serve with the Devonport Local Flotilla, along with her sister destroyers [...] and , along with the older destroyer [...] After post refit trials in April, Ardent was recommissioned with a reduced complement to serve with the Plymouth Command. She served with this command as a training and emergency destroyer, and on 24 September her complement was increased {{as a result of}} the Munich crisis. She was also prepared for war service. By October, the crisis seemed to have abated, and on 11 October her complement was again reduced and she resumed her local flotilla duties. On 17 October, she entered Devonport Dockyard for repairs. She was back in service on 15 November and in December she was deployed at Devonport for boy's training, whilst remaining ready for emergency duty. This <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> would spend the first half of 1939. In July, she was again undergoing repair, and in August she was moved to her war station with the 18th Destroyer Flotilla, for convoy defence and anti-submarine patrol in the English Channel. On 23 August, with war looming, she was joined with a full complement and prepared for war.|$|E
