5|$|Hill faced further {{problems}} as he {{planned for the}} operation. The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before, {{and there was no}} time for any training or exercises. There was also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas, and only a single, smallscale map available for navigation. To ensure that the aircraft found the dropzone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill decided that he <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cockpit of the leading Dakota and assist the pilot. Despite the battalion's parachutes only arriving at 16:30 on 14 November, and were packed twelve to a container which meant they had to be removed and individually repacked, the battalion was prepared by 15 November and took off at 07:30. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border, they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. At the same time, 2nd Battalion of the 509th PIR successfully conducted a drop at Tebessa, capturing its objectives and securing the area; it then passed from the control of 1st Parachute Brigade and remained in the area for some time. 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November, and encountered excellent weather which allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck middrop, throttling him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired. The battalion's secondincommand, Major Pearson, remained at the airfield with a small detachment which collected airborne equipment and supervised the burial of the casualty.|$|E

25|$|The lack {{of celebrity}} was symbolised in earlier series by the {{presence}} of a minor, and often somewhat cult, celebrity, locked up in a cage in the dungeon of the Bungalow. In later series, the celebrity <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attic. In both cases they would say nothing and often do nothing.

25|$|At {{the centre}} of many early stories, there was Ena Sharples (Violet Carson), {{caretaker}} of the Glad Tidings Mission Hall, and her friends: timid Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant), and bespectacled Martha Longhurst (Lynne Carol). The trio were likened to the Greek chorus, and the three witches in William Shakespeare's Macbeth, as they <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> snug bar of the Rovers Return, passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other. Headstrong Ena often clashed with Elsie Tanner, whom she believed espoused a dauntlessly loose set of morals. Elsie resented Ena's interference and gossip, {{which most of the}} time had little basis in reality.|$|E
500|$|The flight {{would be}} made in Reid's Cessna 177B Cardinal, a four-seat {{single-engine}} propeller aircraft manufactured in 1975, registered N35207, which like most aircraft had dual flight controls in the front. Jessica <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front left seat, Reid in the front right, and Lloyd in the back. It was agreed that Reid would be paid for his services at normal flight instruction rates, plus compensation for the layover time. Reid reportedly told his wife that he considered the flight a [...] "non-event for aviation", simply [...] "flying cross country with a 7-year-old {{sitting next to you}} and the parents paying for it." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the Green League's loss of one third of their MPs, party leader Anni Sinnemäki said on the {{election}} evening that [...] "the objectives and values advocated by the party had suffered a clear defeat". She added that the party <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposition. Sinnemäki was also considering her resignation from the head of the party. In the end, she did run for re-election, but placed only third as the party's members elected Ville Niinistö as the new chairman on 11 June. The Green League's support was highest in the Helsinki electoral district with 16.7% of the votes and lowest in the electoral district of Vaasa with 1.4%.|$|E
50|$|Grass It Up {{began in}} 2004 with singer-songwriter David Jeffrey (guitar, mandolin) and Jon Bross (bass) playing {{progressive}} bluegrass at the Front Range Barbeque, {{a restaurant in}} Colorado Springs.

500|$|This {{method of}} {{recording}} caused conflicts to arise. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote of Spector's obsessive techniques: [...] "Phil <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control room and would listen through the headphones to Marky hit one {{note on the}} drum, hour after hour, after hour, after hour." [...] During the recording of [...] "Rock 'n' Roll High School", Johnny was forced by Spector to repeat his part hundreds of times {{over the course of}} several hours. Sire Records owner Seymour Stein relates: [...] "To Johnny, this must have been like the Chinese water torture." [...] "I understood [...] attitude," [...] said Marky. [...] "He was from The Bronx, I was from Brooklyn. We got along very well and had a nice rapport… But he had his way of working that was very slow, and the Ramones had their way of working which was very fast. So that would sometimes irk everybody, and led to animosity with Johnny and Dee Dee." ...|$|E
500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E

500|$|As cattle {{were the}} basis of Celtic wealth, butter and cheese were {{generally}} made from cows' milk. [...] The Celts were amongst the earliest producers of butter in Britain, and {{for hundreds of years}} after the Romans left the country butter was the primary cooking medium and basis for sauces.

After leaving Doom, she aligned herself with Ric Flair and the Four Horsemen.|$|E
2500|$|Doris Heffer served jointly as her husband's {{secretary}}, {{and secretary}} to fellow Labour MP Norman Buchan. She often accompanied him to speaking engagements where {{they made an}} odd couple: Heffer was both tall and heavily built, while his wife was only 4'6" [...] tall. Heffer made a good-humoured complaint when political journalist Andrew Roth described Doris as [...] "tiny", insisting that she was actually [...] "petite". According to the diaries of Giles Radice, Doris Heffer <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front row of the audience when Heffer was speaking, saying, [...] "Nonsense, Eric" [...] if he said something with which she disagreed.

2500|$|During the Monday Celebrity Nights, many notable guest musicians such as Roy Eldridge, Hot Lips Page, Ben Webster, Don Byas, and Lester Young <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> trumpet duels between Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie became legend, with Gillespie {{eventually}} surpassing his mentor. Speaking to Al Fraser, Gillespie {{recalled how}} Thelonious Monk one night teased Eldridge after being out-played by Gillespie saying, [...] "Look, you're {{supposed to be}} the greatest trumpet player in the world...but that's the best." [...] Even though Eldridge was an established musician in the older swing style, he was an active figure at Minton's and contributed through his encouragement of Gillespie and Clarke to further their explorations.|$|E
50|$|As a guru, Nityananda gave {{relatively}} little {{by way of}} verbal teachings. Starting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1920s, his devotees <b>in</b> Mangalore <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> with him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evenings. Most {{of the time he}} was silent, though occasionally he would give teachings.

500|$|Although the Pittston strike {{involved}} coal miners, many of {{the supporters}} of the strike were not miners at all. A majority of the support that the union members received was from women, who were a pivotal aspect of the strike. Many of these women were either wives or daughters of miners who worked for Pittston, but some women supporters had no affiliation with Pittston Coal Company or mining at all. <b>The</b> women <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of roads causing blockages while others would drive slowly in front of coal trucks to cause delays. Two famous groups of women supporters arose during this time; [...] "The Daughters of Mother Jones" [...] and [...] "The Freedom Fighters".

50|$|ABC's {{involvement}} with NASCAR began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days of ABC's Wide World of Sports, {{in which it}} presented some of <b>the</b> biggest races <b>in</b> stock car racing.

While in her office, Hughes just looked at Morgan and proclaimed [...] "you're a camp counselor". The next day Morgan was on the set. [...] Morgan only {{appeared}} on-set for a day to shoot all her scenes. Rex Everhart, who portrays Enos, did not film the truck scenes with Morgan, {{so she had to}} either act with an imaginary Enos, or exchange dialogue with Taso Stavrakis—Savini's assistant—who <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> truck with her. It was Peter Brouwer's girlfriend that helped him land a role on Friday the 13th. After recently being written off the show Love of Life, Brouwer moved back to Connecticut to look for work. Learning that his girlfriend was working as an assistant director for Friday the 13th, Brouwer asked about any openings. Initially told casting was looking for big stars to fill the role of Steve Christy, it was not until Sean Cunningham dropped by to deliver a message to Brouwer's girlfriend, and saw him working in a garden, that Brouwer was hired.|$|E
50|$|As a lad, {{he joined}} a junior {{theatrical}} club and was appointed the club's music maestro for their theatrical presentations. He used to watch silent films at <b>the</b> Royal theatre <b>in</b> Lucknow. Theatre owners would hire a team of musicians to play the tabla, harmonium, sitar and violin. The musicians would watch the film first, make notes, finalize the scales required. When <b>the</b> show began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening, they <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> screen and play music for the scenes.

50|$|Clemons began {{sculpting}} in school, {{where he}} <b>would</b> <b>sit</b> silently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{back of the}} classroom, molding bits of clay into tiny animals. When his teachers took the clay from him, he began scraping bits of pliable tar from the pavement around his school and working on sculptures in his room at night. Alonzo is now considered a top sculptor. He creates incredibly realistic sculptures of animals—mostly horses, antelopes, and bulls—after seeing an image of one {{for only a few}} seconds. According to his mother, he can see an animal on TV and then complete a sculpture of that animal in half an hour. Even though he is unable to tie his shoes or eat on his own, his mind somehow grasps the shapes and forms that he sees, and his hands are skilled in reproducing those images. When asked how he does it, Alonzo will simply smile and point to his head.|$|R
