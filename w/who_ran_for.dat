Two players made their first career interceptions: true freshman safety Kenny Tate and senior defensive back Jeff Allen. Tate's interception in the Maryland end zone prevented a Nevada score, while Allen's interception with 4:54remaining helped seal the victory for Maryland. Offensive lineman Scott Burley forced a fumble against Nevada linebacker Brandon Marshall, who had recovered a third-down fumble by Turner.

After a running play was stopped for no gain, Clark completed a pass to Pegues, <b>who</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> a first down at the Alabama nine-yard line. After the first down, Alabama committed an offsides penalty. After the penalty, Tech had a first down inside the Alabama five-yard line.

5|$|The {{system worked}} well {{during the regular}} season. Nevada {{starting}} quarterback and 2008 WAC Offensive Player of the Year Colin Kaepernick ran for more than 1,100yards and 16touchdowns in addition to passing for 2,479yards and 19touchdowns. Alongside Kaepernick, Nevada's rushing offense was led by running back Vai Taua, <b>who</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> 1,420yards and 14touchdowns.

5|$|After {{receiving}} the kickoff, Middle Tennessee quarterback Joe Craddock led an 80-yard, 10-play drive. It included a fake punt that caught Maryland off-guard, which allowed the punter {{to complete a}} 28-yard pass for a first-down conversion. Craddock ended the drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass. On Maryland's second offensive play of the game, Da'Rel Scott broke free for a 63-yard run for a touchdown. In the second quarter, Middle Tennessee re-took the lead with a 31-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Turner threw an interception that was returned 25yards to the Maryland five-yard line, and Middle Tennessee subsequently scored on a rushing play. On Maryland's next possession, Turner completed a short pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey <b>who</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> an 80-yard touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Maryland advanced inside the Middle Tennessee 35-yard line three times, {{but was unable to}} capitalize. Middle Tennessee defenders saved two potential touchdowns with interceptions on their own two-yard line and in the end zone to preserve a Blue Raider victory, 24–14.|$|E

5|$|Following the missed field goal, Clemson's offense {{started at}} its 25-yard line. On {{the first play}} of the drive, Dantzler {{completed}} a pass to wide receiver Rod Gardner, <b>who</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> 25 yards and a first down at the 50-yard line. A nine-yard shovel pass play {{was followed by a}} run up the middle for a first down at the Tech 37-yard line. Dantzler completed an eight-yard pass, then a running play was stopped short of the first-down marker. On third down, Dantzler faked a quarterback sneak in order to attempt a long pass downfield. Dantzler was unable to pass, however, and was sacked for a four-yard loss. Rather than attempt a field goal or punt the ball, Clemson coach Tommy Bowden had his team attempt to gain a first down. Dantzler scrambled forward, but didn't gain the five yards needed. The Tigers thus turned the ball over on downs at the Tech 28-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Maryland's {{offense was}} run by first-year {{offensive}} coordinator and former wide receivers coach James Franklin, who utilized a West Coast system. During the 2008 regular season, starting quarterback Chris Turner threw for 2,318yards, 11touchdowns, and 10interceptions. NFL Draft prospect Darrius Heyward-Bey accumulated 561receiving yards in ten games. Heyward-Bey also recorded 208rushing yards and was often utilized in reverses and other trick plays due to his breakaway speed. Maryland had another offensive weapon in running back Da'Rel Scott, <b>who</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> 959yards during the regular season. Overall, the rushing offense gained 134.5yards per game and was ranked 72nd in the nation. Against Virginia Tech and Boston College, Maryland rushed for −12and −6yards, respectively. The previous year, in the 2007 Emerald Bowl against Oregon State, Maryland recorded 19yards on the ground against the then second-ranked rushing defense.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's rushing offense, led {{by running}} back Ken Oxendine, led the Big East in rushing yards, {{averaging}} 215.3 yards per game. Oxendine entered the Gator Bowl as the No. 5 rusher in Virginia Tech history to that point, and accumulated 904 rushing yards and 13 receptions during his final {{season as a}} Hokie. Oxendine was supported by fullback Marcus Parker, <b>who</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> 363 {{yards and four touchdowns}} during the regular season. Parker also found success in the passing game, becoming Tech's leading receiver for the season by catching 20 passes for 212 yards. He was the first Virginia Tech runner since 1969 to lead the team in receptions. Backing up Oxendine was running back Lamont Pegues, a transfer student from Clemson who accumulated 85 carries for 391 yards and five touchdowns. All three players were assisted by Virginia Tech's offensive line, which was led by Gennaro DiNapoli. DiNapoli was named to the All-ACC team, but was predicted to face a tough task in stopping North Carolina's top-ranked defense.|$|E

Although a staunch Democrat, Smith did support one of his former players, Richard Vinroot, a Republican <b>who</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> governor of North Carolina in 2000. In 2006, Smith became the spokesperson for Devout Democrats, an inter-faith, grassroots political action committee designed to convince religious Americans to vote for Democrats.

5|$|Florida State {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down, needing three yards for a first down. Weinke completed a pass for {{just short of the}} needed three yards. Instead of punting the ball away, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden ordered the team to attempt to convert the first down. He brought backup quarterback Marcus Outzen into the game as a misdirection move, and instead of running a quarterback sneak as anticipated, Outzen tossed the ball to Minor, <b>who</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> 16yards and a first down. During the play, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty that advanced the ball further and gave Florida State a first down at the Virginia Tech 23-yard line. Weinke returned to the game and threw a 10-yard pass to Chaney for another first down. Weinke threw an incomplete pass, then Tech stopped a rush up the middle for no gain. On third down, Weinke connected on a touchdown pass to Dugans, returning the lead to Florida State. The Seminoles, as had Virginia Tech before them, elected to attempt a two-point conversion. Unlike Virginia Tech's failed two-point conversions, the Seminoles successfully earned two points with a pass to Warrick, and the scores gave Florida State a 3629 lead with 12:59 remaining.|$|E
5|$|The Bearcats' kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 14-yard line, and the Hokies began the first drive of the third quarter. Evans rushed for four yards, but Oglesby lost four yards on a run during the next play. Facing third and ten, Taylor picked up the first down with an 11-yard run, but fumbled the ball {{at the end of}} the play. The loose ball was scooped up by Boone, who kept the Hokies' drive going at the Tech 30-yard line. After the fumble, Evans ran for seven yards and Taylor completed a 10-yard pass to Roberts for a first down at the Tech 47-yard line. Coale then rushed for seven yards on an end-around, and his run was followed by one by Boone, <b>who</b> <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> 16yards and a first down at the Cincinnati 30-yard line. Two more rushes by Roberts and Evans resulted in another first down, but once the Hokies passed the Cincinnati 20-yard line, the Bearcats' defense stiffened and denied the Hokies another first down. Facing fourth down, Tech again sent in Keys, who kicked a 35-yard field goal. The kick extended Tech's lead to 13–7 with 8:32 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
40|$|The male-dominated {{nature of}} U. S. {{politics}} still {{means that the}} vast majority of women <b>who</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> office face a male opponent. As a result, one dramatic change in U. S. politics-the increase in women candidates-may contribute to another change, that being the experience of men <b>who</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> office. The research reported here begins to consider how running against a woman might have influenced the behavior of male candidates for Congress in 2002 and 2006. Past research suggests that men <b>who</b> <b>run</b> against women feel that they need to take steps to appeal to women voters by giving attention to issues of concern to women in their campaigns.
