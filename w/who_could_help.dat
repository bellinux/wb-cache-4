5|$|The chapter-general re-elected Vermigli to the Spoletan abbacy in 1534 {{and again}} in 1535, {{but he was not}} elected to lead any house the {{following}} year. He may have been identified as a promising reformer <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> with reform efforts in higher places. Vermigli was in contact with the Catholic leaders working on the Consilium de emendanda ecclesia, an internal report on potential reforms of the Church commissioned by Pope PaulIII. He may have even travelled to Rome to assist in writing it.|$|E
5|$|Vladislav : The Times {{stated that}} the police have {{identified}} the man they believe may have poisoned Litvinenko with a fatal polonium dose in {{a cup of tea}} on the fourth-floor room at the Millennium Hotel to discuss a business deal with Dmitry Kovtun and Andrey Lugovoy before going to the bar. These three men were joined in the room later by the mystery figure who was introduced as Vladislav, a man <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> Litvinenko win a lucrative contract with a Moscow-based private security firm.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie, who {{had served}} as Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, was close to retirement. The current Lord Chancellor Lord Haldane {{believed}} that the duties of a Lord Chancellor were too much for one man, and should be divided between a Lord Chancellor and a Minister of Justice. As such he looked for a Permanent Secretary who was a qualified lawyer and <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war, appointing Schuster in early 1915. The two did not work together, however, until Haldane became Lord Chancellor {{for a second time}} in 1924; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro-German sympathies.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Matt and Jeff {{created their}} own wrestling promotion, The Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (frequently {{abbreviated}} to OMEGA Championship Wrestling, or simply OMEGA), in which Matt competed under the name High Voltage. The Hardys launched the promotion because, at the time, there weren't many places to wrestle, nor did they know anyone <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help.</b> Both Matt and Jeff would take apart the ring {{and put it back}} together at every event they had, while Matt sewed all the costumes worn in OMEGA. The promotion would fold in October 1999, after both Matt and Jeff signed with the World Wrestling Federation. Eight years later in 2007, Highspots.com produced a two-disc DVD set entitled OMEGA: Uncommon Passion, chronicling the history of the promotion, including matches and interviews with many OMEGA wrestlers.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 24 and 25. Heading into the draft, the Capitals had only five picks due {{to a variety of}} trades, which was tied for the fewest in {{franchise}} history. Believing that they had prospect depth in their organization and not seeing an available player <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> immediately, Washington traded their first round pick for Troy Brouwer. With just late round selections remaining, the Capitals decided to take players that required time to develop. Three of their four picks were in, or set to attend, college. Fourth-round pick Steffen Soberg, the lone player not attending college, played in the GET-ligaen, Norway's highest level of competition. At the 2011 IIHF World U18 Championships, he posted the second-highest save percentage in the tournament and was considered one of Norway's top three players, though no Norwegian goaltender has ever played an NHL game.|$|E
5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{retreated to}} the {{isolation}} of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record their debut album, working with Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue. They contacted Ezrin because they {{grew up listening to}} his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper and they felt {{he was the only one}} <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> them capture the size and scope of what they wanted to accomplish on their debut recording. The band chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, striving for the precise location that would enhance their sound. Even before the album was released, Puddle of Mudd invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002. The band later embarked on a North American tour to support Incubus and began a club tour in August.|$|E

5|$|When Saldívar {{became a}} {{business}} associate, their relationship began to deteriorate. In September 1994, Selena met Ricardo Martinez, {{a doctor who}} lived in Monterrey, Mexico. Selena wanted to expand the number of boutiques by opening a Selena Etc. store in Monterrey. Martinez said he had contacts in Mexico <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> her grow her business. Martinez became a business adviser to Selena, though her family said he was simply a fan who posed in several pictures with her. Saldívar became envious of Selena's dependency on Martinez. He began sending flowers to Selena's hotel room. Saldívar warned the singer that Martinez might have unprofessional intentions. Selena began visiting Monterrey more frequently, often in disguise. Sebastian D'Silva, Martinez's assistant, would pick up Selena at the airport; he said he noticed she was wearing wigs and using her husband Chris Pérez's surname so others would not identify her. According to Martinez, he had lent several thousand dollars to Selena because she was short on cash.|$|E

25|$|Nina {{decided that}} it was time she re-discovered her lost {{memories}} and {{came to the conclusion that}} the only person <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> her was her sister, Anna Williams. Anna meets with Nina soon after. However, Nina's memories and hatred instinctively returned, and they rapidly engaged in a gun battle. The duel lasted for days and the two later agreed to meet at The King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 and finish their battle. The two promised that only one would walk away from the coming battle, however, when Nina won, she refused to take Anna's life as their fight was not satisfactory.|$|E
25|$|The investors of the Virginia Company of London {{expected}} to reap rewards from their speculative investments. With the Second Supply, they expressed their frustrations and made demands upon {{the leaders of}} Jamestown in written form. They specifically demanded that the colonists send commodities sufficient to pay {{the cost of the}} voyage, a lump of gold, assurance that they had found the South Sea, and one member of the lost Roanoke Colony. It fell to the third president of the Council Captain John Smith to deliver a bold and much-needed wake-up call in response to the investors in London, demanding practical laborers and craftsmen <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> make the colony more self-sufficient.|$|E
25|$|The US and UK {{were losing}} faith with Musharraf. His {{domestic}} popularity was slipping; a mid-2007 poll gave him only a 26% approval rating. In 2007, mass anti-Musharraf protests {{broke out in}} what {{was known as the}} Lawyers' Movement. Pakistan was also experiencing growing levels of violence from Islamist militants, such as the Siege of Lal Masjid. Official figures held that 8 suicide bombings took place in 2006 and 44 in 2007. The US government increasingly saw Bhutto as an important figure <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> to constrain Pakistan's domestic problems. They nevertheless wanted a power sharing deal and did not want Musharraf removed from power completely, regarding him as a vital ally in their War on Terror.|$|E

25|$|Word of Rasputin's {{activity}} and charisma {{began to spread}} in Siberia during the early 1900s. Sometime between 1902 and 1904, he travelled {{to the city of}} Kazan on the Volga river, where he acquired a reputation as a wise and perceptive starets, or holy man, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> people resolve their spiritual crises and anxieties. Despite rumors that Rasputin was having sex with some of his female followers, he won over the father superior of the Seven Lakes Monastery outside Kazan, as well as a local church officials Archimandrite Andrei and Bishop Chrysthanos, who gave him a letter of recommendation to Bishop Sergei, the rector of the St. Petersburg Theological Seminary at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, and arranged for him to travel to St. Petersburg, either in 1903 or in the winter of 1904-1905.|$|E
25|$|Cosimo {{was searching}} for a wife <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> {{strengthen}} his political position and had initially asked to marry Margaret of Austria, the widow of Duke Alessandro de’ Medici, who displayed enormous reluctance at the idea (thus serving her father’s own interest and plans for her). The Emperor, not wanting to antagonize Cosimo, offered {{him one of the}} daughters of the rich viceroy of Naples. The viceroy agreed, provided Cosimo settled a large amount of money on her as dowry. This marriage was politically beneficial as the Medici were new to their ducal status. Additionally, Eleanor's royal Castilian ancestors and relations with the Habsburgs provided the Medici with the blue blood they had hitherto lacked and began the process of placing them on a footing with other European sovereigns. Through her father, Eleanor also provided the Medici with a powerful link to Spain, at that time ultimately in control of Florence, so that the marriage offered Cosimo I the opportunity to show sufficient loyalty to and trust in Spain that Spanish troops could be withdrawn from the province.|$|E
25|$|Parnok left Moscow in {{late summer}} 1917 and spent the Russian Civil War years in the Crimean town of Sudak with Erarskaya. Soon after their arrival, she was {{approached}} by Alexander Spendiaryan (known in Russia as Alexander Spendiarov) and asked to prepare the libretto for a 4-act opera Almast, based on an Armenian legend. Parnok immediately set to work, sourcing her dramatic verse on the epic poem, The Taking of Tmuk Fortress, by Hovhannes Tumanyan and using Erarskaya as her inspiration. She finished the libretto by the winter of 1918, long before Spendiaryan had completed the musical score, and returned to reading Sappho. At that time in Russia, as elsewhere, Sappho was considered a heterosexual poet because she wrote about desire. Both physical love and desire, were perceived as masculine traits, thus women poets who wrote erotic lyrics without shame, regardless of their sexual orientation, were often given the label Sapphic. Simultaneously, she and Eugenia Gertsyk, Adelaida's sister, became closer friends, reveling in their spiritual quest. She viewed her relationship with Eugenia as that of an older and wiser guide, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> her mature spiritually and break her addiction to love.|$|E
