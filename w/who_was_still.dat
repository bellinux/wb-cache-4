5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson at the crease. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Saggers {{came in and}} only managed five in his first Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> bowling in an attacking manner and flighting his deliveries, undeterred by the sixes Loxton had hit from him, rather than bowling leg theory. This left Australia at 355/8 ten minutes before tea, with only Johnston and Toshack remaining.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{disagreement}} {{as to whether}} Craig was deserving of the captaincy, the team proceeded smoothly without infighting. Prior to the Fifth Test, Craig wanted to drop himself due to poor form, which would have made Harvey captain. Peter Burge, the third member of the selection panel and a Harvey supporter, was comfortable with this, but Harvey relinquished his opportunity to seize the leadership by ordering Burge to retain Craig. When the vote was formally taken, Harvey and Burge outvoted Craig, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> offering to drop himself.|$|E

5|$|Henry rode to Winchester, {{where an}} {{argument}} ensued {{as to who}} now had the best claim to the throne. William of Breteuil championed the rights of Robert, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> abroad, returning from the Crusade, and to whom Henry and the barons had given homage in previous years. Henry argued that, unlike Robert, {{he had been born}} to a reigning king and queen, thereby giving him a claim under the right of porphyrogeniture. Tempers flared, but Henry, supported by Henry de Beaumont and Robert of Meulan, held sway and persuaded the barons to follow him. He occupied Winchester Castle and seized the royal treasury.|$|E

Cáceres then distributed the Indian settlements in encomienda. He collected reinforcements from Gracias a Dios, then returned immediately to Comayagua, and began to push eastwards towards Olancho.|$|E

No one was hurt, but Adkins was charged with felony illegal possession of a shotgun and spent five months in jail.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{served as}} Vice President from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841. His term was largely unremarkable, and he enjoyed little {{influence}} with President Van Buren.

When Lewis Tappan requested presentation of an abolitionist petition to the Senate, Johnson, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a slaveholder, declined the request.|$|E

5|$|The changes led to {{significant}} department reorganisations within RNC, with several dozen staff members being summarily dismissed without explanation; some {{were replaced by}} volunteers. A number of former college employees made complaints regarding {{the manner in which}} their employment was ended. In July 2008 the college lecturers union, the University and College Union, called for greater consultation between management and staff at the college.

Level-headed Tatiana was needed to watch over her ill brother. They were forced to leave their other children behind in Tobolsk because Maria's brother Alexei was ill.
