5|$|The opening {{movie to}} Ever 17 <b>was</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> game's producer, who picked out CGs and {{keywords}} {{from the game}} to include. Nakazawa gave instructions to have the characters appear {{in the same order}} as the recommended route playing order the developers had decided on, hoping for the order to leave an impression and influence players to play the game in that order. The ending movie was created by Nakazawa, who was not used to the tools used in video creation. He added a timeline to the credits roll, intending for it to feel emotional to get an overview of the story after having finished it, and finding it fitting to have a timeline scrolling along with the calm ending theme. For the PlayStation Portable version, {{the creation of a new}} opening movie was outsourced to a video design company, chosen specifically for one designer working there. Nakazawa sent them instructions on what text and graphics to use, and they created an animatic based on it, before adding the details. The ending movie for this version <b>was</b> <b>created</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> publisher, Cyberfront, without Nakazawa's involvement.|$|E
