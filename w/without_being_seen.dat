5|$|The {{shareholders}} {{decided to}} open the property year-round; it had only previously opened for the summer season. Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater and installed a helicopter pad on the roof. He re-utilized prohibition-era smuggling tunnels beneath the property to allow mob members to move around the property <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> by the public.|$|E
5|$|The common cuckoo, a brood parasite, {{provides}} {{examples of}} mimesis {{both in the}} adult and in the egg. The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female mimics a sparrowhawk. The resemblance is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female cuckoo then has time to lay her egg in their nest <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> to do so. The cuckoo's egg itself mimics the eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.|$|E
5|$|The local {{population}} remained faithful to Skanderbeg {{and did not}} reveal his whereabouts. Isak bey and Hamza grew confident that Skanderbeg had been defeated and had thus began to withdraw. When he judged the time right, Skanderbeg gave the signal for the army, which had up until then been in separate groups, to assemble <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> by the Ottomans. The army gathered by the hills at Tumenishta – as the weakest point in the Ottoman camp was in this direction – and on 2 September 1457, it was split again into three groups to assault the Ottoman camp. With {{some of his most}} trusted men, he climbed to a high peak to scout on the Ottoman camp and saw that the Ottomans were resting. He descended with his chosen band to eliminate any watching guards, but one saw Skanderbeg and fled into the camp yelling that Skanderbeg had arrived. In order to maintain the surprise, Skanderbeg ordered his men to get ready for battle.|$|E

25|$|Also in mid-2006 a major {{renovation}} of C-Block and the science laboratories {{on its first}} floor was completed. The new building work included two observation classrooms (one a laboratory {{and the other a}} normal classroom), with one way mirrors allowing people in a small room in between the two observation classrooms to sit and observe lessons <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E
25|$|There were {{rectangular}} {{openings in}} the cell wall through which food and work materials could be passed to the prisoner, as well as peepholes for guards to observe prisoners <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen.</b> To minimize the opportunities for communication between inmates Haviland designed a basic flush toilet for each cell with individual pipes leading to a central sewer which he hoped would prevent the sending of messages between adjacent cells.|$|E

25|$|The fort is {{situated}} at the north-eastern part of the island, 35 m above the water with cliffs on three sides, and commands the Fat Tong Mun Channel. No vessel could pass through <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> entering or leaving Joss House Bay. The fort {{may also have been}} a signal station, passing messages on to military headquarters in Kowloon. When in use it was manned by an average of 25 men of the Tai-pang-hsi navy.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{the first}} {{submarine}} snorkels came into service. These allowed diesel submarines to operate near the surface, using their diesel engines, and <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> by surface search radar. Designs {{such as the}} German type XXI U-boat were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as submersibles that navigated {{on the surface and}} could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. After World War II, this emphasis on submerged operation, battery capacity and higher submerged speed continued. In the US, the GUPPY program rebuilt wartime submarines to emphasise this. New Soviet Union submarines, primarily of the Whiskey class, were based on the four Type XXIs that were assigned to them by the Potsdam Agreement.|$|E
25|$|The Palais Strousberg, a vast {{town house}} built in Berlin between 1867–1868, {{confined}} the servants to its semi-basement. The only windows facing outwards {{at the front}} of the mansion, were ironically those of servants' bedrooms: all the workrooms either had no windows at all or were lit by a complicated system of light-wells and small internal courtyards. The servants' quarters were designed to run like a well-oiled machine. Everything from the carriage horses to the wine cellar, kitchen and laundry was confined to one compact floor under one roof and, most importantly, out of sight. Small staircases led to convenient points in a complex labyrinth of narrow passages on the piano nobile above, allowing servants to enter reception rooms when required, <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> in other parts of the house.|$|E

25|$|Aircrew {{photographed the}} attack front, {{reported}} {{on the condition of}} wire and trenches, assessed the opposition, linked headquarters and front line and then joined in by bombing and strafing from low altitude. Artillery-observation led to the neutralisation of German batteries, destruction of trenches and strong points and fleeting opportunities to bombard German troops in the open. British aircraft caused a feeling of defencelessness among German troops and deprived them of the support of the Fliegertruppen, leaving them dependent on wasteful unobserved area artillery-fire, while being vulnerable to British aircrew seeing muzzle-flashes giving away battery positions. Reinforcements of fighters were slow to arrive on the Somme and prevented the Fliegertruppen from challenging Anglo-French aerial dominance. The morale of British troops was correspondingly increased, that German artillery could not conduct observed shoots against them and that German troops could not move against them <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> by the RFC.|$|E
25|$|In Wanted, {{at least}} six players are on a map where they must find and assassinate each other. Each player is given another player as a target. The goal is to find and kill a target <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> or killed by the player's own pursuer or pursuers. If the player breaks cover, they are more easily spotted by pursuer or target alike, {{sometimes}} resulting in a chase. The player with the highest score {{at the end of}} the session wins. Players will lose their contract if they kill an NPC, are stunned by their target or their target is killed by another player. A player cannot kill another player who is not the target, but they can stun their hunter. Advanced Wanted mode is a variant of Wanted mode, with differences between malakas and skilas includes an increased amount of NPCs on the map to make it difficult to pick out targets and a less accurate compass. There is generally more stealth involved in this mode than in basic Wanted.|$|E

500|$|Maxine Miller and Ken Pogue both {{make their}} first {{appearances}} as Catherine Black's parents Justine and Tom Miller in this episode; the pair would later reprise their respective roles in several episodes {{of the third}} season, including [...] "The Innocents", [...] "Exegesis", and [...] "Seven and One". The character played by Paul Raskin, credited here as [...] "The Figure", would return in the second season opening episode [...] "The Beginning and the End", which continues the storyline from [...] "Paper Dove", although the character would by then be credited as [...] "Polaroid Man", played instead by Doug Hutchison.

500|$|The {{regiment}} and {{a battalion}} from the Imperial Camel Corps would attack point [...] "A". The Canterbury Mounted Rifles {{would support the}} attack on the regiment's left. At 01:45 the regiment moved forward, dismounted and managed to get close enough to the first objective to charge home <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen,</b> capturing the first trench, five machine-guns and twenty-three prisoners. The regiment continued on, capturing the position. At daybreak Turkish troops were able to bring enfilade fire from point [...] "B" [...] against the regiment's positions. So 4th Squadron, with 3rd Squadron providing covering fire, mounted an attack and captured that position. At 09:30 Turkish troops were seen gathered on the north-east side of the hill. McCarroll asked for artillery support to break up their troops, but there was none available. The mountain battery, at the time, only had four rounds left. The Turkish forces attacked and managed to close on the regiment's defences before they were stopped by rifle and machine-gun fire.|$|E
500|$|Early in {{the second}} half a third disputed try was scored by the English. The try and its {{aftermath}} caused controversy and a rift between the Natives and the RFU. Ellison attempted to tackle the English player Stoddart, and in the process ripped his shorts off. The Natives quickly formed a circle around Stoddart to allow him to replace his clothing <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen.</b> While this was happening one of the English players, Frank Evershed, picked up the ball and scored a try. The New Zealanders protested, believing that play had stopped after claiming Stoddart had called [...] "dead ball"– but Hill awarded the try, prompting three of the Native players, Dick Taiaroa, Williams, and Sherry Wynyard, to leave the field in protest. The aggrieved players were eventually persuaded to return, but not before Hill had restarted play. Ellison was very critical of Hill, particularly because he was also Secretary of the RFU. Ellison wrote after the tour that [...] "gross as these errors were, they were insignificant when compared with another that Mr Hill committed {{at the outset of the}} game, viz, refereeing at all in that game". The disputed try was followed by a final try for the English, who ultimately won 7–0.|$|E

500|$|Sil first {{tries to}} mate with a man she meets at a nightclub (Anthony Guidera), but after sensing that he is diabetic, she rejects him. Unsatisfied, he [...] tries to rape her, {{prompting}} her to kill him by puncturing his skull with her tongue. She then tries {{to mate with}} John Carey (Whip Hubley), a man she meets after a car accident. They swim in Carey's pool where Sil forces him to open his swimming trunks in order to mate, but he refuses. This act is interrupted by Preston and Laura. She kills Carey, morphing into her alien form, a bipedal mutant with tentacles on her shoulders and back, and flees naked into a forest <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> by the team. She pretends to be a rape victim to kidnap a woman (Marliese K. Schneider) in order to assume her identity. Sitting in the car near Carey's home, she reads Fitch's lips, as she had done earlier, learning of their plan to stake out the Nightclub for her return. There, she is seen by Dan, prompting a car chase. She fakes her death by crashing the car, which she has previously filled with gasoline containers, into a high-voltage transformer, using the kidnapped woman as a stand-in for her own body.|$|E
2500|$|The hill must be {{high enough}} that {{survivors}} who were wounded in battle {{would be able}} to hide safely at the top <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>seen</b> by the Lamanites below, but not so high that wounded men could not climb it at night [...] Sorenson suggests that, if this is the correct hill, then Mormon had once hidden the Nephite archive of records somewhere within it.|$|E
