5|$|B.violacea {{occurs in}} {{southern}} regions of Western Australia, from Woodanilling to Esperance {{and as far}} north as Hyden. This distribution includes areas of the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. It favours white sandy soils, often overlying laterite, clay or quartzite. It usually grows among heath and shrublands, associated with mallee eucalypts and Banksia sphaerocarpa var. caesia. Banksia violacea is classified as Not Threatened under the 1950 <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Conservation</b> Act of Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Ethiopia: In Ethiopia, {{where the}} size of the {{elephant}} population has decreased by 90% since the 1980s, officials issued a National Ivory Action Plan to address poaching and ivory trafficking. Among other strategies, the Plan includes the publicized destruction of seized ivory. The first such event took place in March 2015, in Addis Ababa, where the Ethiopian <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Conservation</b> Authority's 6.1-ton stockpile was burned.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1927 by the West Australian botanist Charles Gardner, the species {{was at one}} stage considered a variety of B.sphaerocarpa. Although there are no recognised subspecies or varieties, both lignotuberous and nonlignotuberous forms exist for Banksia violacea. Wasps, ants and flies have been recorded visiting flower spikes. Banksia violacea is classified as Not Threatened under the <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Conservation</b> Act of Western Australia. Regarded as of little value to floriculture, it is rarely cultivated.|$|E

5|$|Hunting for ivory is {{responsible}} for significant reductions in elephant populations in several parts of Africa. Between 1979 and 1989, the African elephant population decreased in size from 1.3million to 600,000.

5|$|After {{fifteen years}} of off-again, on-again, conversations, The Koch Administration and the then-named NY Zoological Society (now <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Conservation</b> Society), signed a fifty-year {{agreement}} in April 1980, where the Central, Prospect, and Queens zoos would be administered by the Society.

5|$|Banksia oligantha {{is listed}} as an {{endangered}} species under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and as rare under Western Australia's <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Conservation</b> Act 1950. These rankings are due to its small and severely fragmented distribution, and the ongoing degradation of its habitat. Threats include grazing by sheep and rabbits, drought, the drift of aerosol chemicals from surrounding farmland, invasion by weeds, and rising salinity. Studies have shown it to be moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E

Banksia lemanniana is classified as Not Threatened under the <b>Wildlife</b> <b>Conservation</b> Act of Western Australia.
