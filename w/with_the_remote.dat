5|$|The early {{attempts}} to bomb Japan from the Marianas proved just as ineffective as the China-based B-29s had been. Hansell continued {{the practice of}} conducting so-called high-altitude precision bombing, aimed at key industries and transportation networks, even after these tactics had not produced acceptable results. These efforts proved unsuccessful due to logistical difficulties <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> location, technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft, unfavorable weather conditions, and enemy action.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{beginnings}} of the war with the Covenant, humanity was in turmoil, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> colonies fighting for independence from the UEG. To help quell the revolts, the UNSC commissioned the highly classified Spartan Project, responsible for the development of four generations of unique special force infantry, collectively called Spartans, who operate in powered armor known as MJOLNIR. The Spartans undertook classified missions against rebels and insurrectionists. When the Covenant began destroying the outer colonies, these Spartans became humanity's best hope against the technological superiority of the Covenant.|$|E
25|$|By {{the third}} day of his capture, Bryson had earned {{sufficient}} trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a regime of tying his hands in front of him after his sexual abuse rather than above his head and to the bed upon the excuse that his (Berdella's) doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms; he had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on within the room, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> control placed between his legs whenever Berdella was out of the room. However, he would later state to investigators that he had thought almost constantly about escaping. The following day, he managed to break free of his restraints by burning through them using a book of matches Berdella had inadvertently left in the room and within his reach when he had left the house to go to his place of work.|$|E

25|$|At the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Nintendo {{introduced}} the Classic Controller, which plugs into <b>the</b> Wii <b>Remote</b> via a cord {{in a similar}} fashion to the Nunchuk.

25|$|The {{functionality}} is {{only provided}} via a public API, {{which can be}} used by any application to provide screen sharing functionality. Windows Desktop Sharing API exposes two objects: RDPSession for the sharing session and RDPViewer for the viewer. Multiple viewer objects can be instantiated for one Session object. A viewer can either be a passive viewer, who is just able to watch the application like a screencast, or an interactive viewer, who is able to interact in real time <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> application. The RDPSession object contains all the shared applications, represented as Application objects, each with Window objects representing their on-screen windows. Per-application filters capture the application Windows and package them as Window objects. A viewer must authenticate itself before it can connect to a sharing session. This is done by generating an Invitation using the RDPSession. It contains an authentication ticket and password. The object is serialized and sent to the viewers, who need to present the Invitation when connecting.|$|E

500|$|Intensive {{geological}} {{sampling and}} survey {{work of the}} pipeline route started in spring 1970. Aerial photograph were taken, examined, and a preliminary route was detailed. Small survey parties physically visited the route and hammered stakes into the ground. The work was difficult; animal dangers forced the crews to be armed, and they also had to cope <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> area and limited infrastructure. In places, the foliage was so dense that trees had to be cut down and progress was limited to [...] per day. The surveyed route passed through several mountain passes: Atigun Pass, Isabel Pass, Thompson Pass, and Keystone Canyon. In the latter location, surveyors had to rappel down cliffs in order to perform their work.|$|E

500|$|In December, it {{was decided}} that the {{plutonium}} production facilities would not be built at Oak Ridge after all, but at the even more remote Hanford Site in Washington state. Compton and the staff at the Metallurgical Laboratory then reopened the question of building the plutonium semiworks at Argonne, but the engineers and management of DuPont, particularly Roger Williams, the head of its TNX Division, which was responsible for the company's role in the Manhattan Project, did not support this proposal. They felt that there would be insufficient space at Argonne, and that there were disadvantages in having a site that was so accessible, as they were afraid that it would permit the research staff from the Metallurgical Laboratory to interfere unduly with the design and construction, which they considered their prerogative. A better location, they felt, would be <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> production facilities at Hanford. [...] In the end a compromise was reached. On January 12, 1943, Compton, Williams, and Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, agreed that the semiworks would be built at the Clinton Engineer Works.|$|E
500|$|The {{cultural}} and musical scene in Scotland, dubbed [...] "Cool Caledonia" [...] by {{some elements of}} the press, produced a number of successful alternative acts, including The Supernaturals from Glasgow, whose re-released single [...] "Smile" [...] (1997) reached number 25 in the UK charts, and whose album It Doesn't Matter Anymore (1997) entered the top ten, but who failed to sustain their success or achieve the anticipated international breakthrough. Travis, also from Glasgow, {{were one of the}} first major rock bands to emerge in the post-Britpop era. Utilising the hooks and guitar rock favoured by Oasis in a song-based format, they moved from the personal on Good Feeling (1997), through the general on their breakthrough The Man Who (1999), to the socially conscious and political on 12 Memories (2003) and have been credited with a major role in disseminating a new Britpop. From Edinburgh Idlewild, more influenced by post-grunge, just failed to break into the British top 50 with their second album Hope Is Important (1998), but subsequently produced 3 top 20 albums, peaking <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Remote</b> Part (2002), and the single [...] "You Held the World in Your Arms", which both reached number 9 in the respective UK charts. Although garnering some international attention, they did not break through in the US.|$|E
500|$|Jon O'Brien of Metro and James Poniewozik of The New York Times {{identified}} vigilantism as {{a central}} concept in the story. Writing for Esquire, Corey Atad commented {{it is about the}} societal [...] "appetite for punishment", while Sam Parker of The Huffington Post and Andrew Liptak of The Verge considered it represents [...] "a cruel society's fantasy of 'real justice" [...] and a [...] "perverted justice" [...] respectively. More specifically, it deals <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> punishment done via the anonymity of the Internet, according to some of TheWrap staff members and Page. While Sims stated there are parallels between Victoria's suffering and the crime she committed, Joyner considered these parallels to be central to the episode's critique. When her crime is revealed, Joyner wrote, [...] "the construction of the White Bear centre becomes apparent now, as a real-life karmic experience for the general public who wish to see biblical retribution". Mark Monahan of The Telegraph wrote that the episode [...] "mocked, above all, our insatiable, voyeuristic, neo-Medieval thirst for supposedly 'real-life' pain and humiliation repackaged as entertainment". Jeffery stated it depicted how society turns horror into entertainment, and Parker concluded, [...] "The fact Victoria was a murderer allows them to accept her suffering, but it's the mobile phones that allow them to enjoy it - after all, she's just a character on their screens." ...|$|E
