50|$|Mathematically speaking, however, <b>the</b> Skewb <b>Ultimate</b> has exactly <b>the</b> same {{structure}} as the Skewb Diamond.

50|$|As {{part of the}} All-New, All-Different Marvel, Blue Marvel {{appeared}} {{as a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Ultimates.</b> Blue Marvel's first mission <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ultimates</b> involved retrieving <b>the</b> incubator that Galactus was brought out of prematurely. Once they put him back into it, he fully emerged as a lifebringer. While in Exo-Space <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ultimates</b> within their ship the Aboena, Blue Marvel finds that his old enemy Anti-Man has reassembled there.

5|$|The next day, Aya {{sees the}} orange {{mass of people}} from the park enter the city water supply. She goes to Dr. Klamp one more time, and discovers that Dr. Klamp has {{engineered}} special sperm for Eve so that she can create the Ultimate Being. He then spontaneously combusts. Aya finds Eve {{in another part of the}} museum, where the orange mass has surrounded her, forming an impermeable shield to protect her while the Ultimate Being gestates within her. After several failed attempts to attack Eve, the military asks Aya to attack her from a chopper, as she is the only one who can get close without combusting. The plan works, but Aya has to personally finish the fight on a now-wrecked Statue of Liberty, where Eve finally succumbs to necrosis due to her unstable cells. As Aya rests on a naval vessel, the Ultimate Being is born and attacks the surrounding ships. Aya does battle <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Being, but its mitochondria causes it to evolve at an alarming rate. Aya sets the vessel's boiler pressure dangerously high, so as to destroy it <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Being on board.|$|E

5|$|In ancient China, {{biological}} topics can {{be found}} dispersed across several different disciplines, including the work of herbologists, physicians, alchemists, and philosophers. The Taoist tradition of Chinese alchemy, for example, can be {{considered part of the}} life sciences due to its emphasis on health (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> goal being the elixir of life). The system of classical Chinese medicine usually revolved around the theory of yin and yang, and the five phases. Taoist philosophers, such as Zhuangzi in the 4th century BCE, also expressed ideas related to evolution, such as denying the fixity of biological species and speculating that species had developed differing attributes in response to differing environments.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{survival}} horror game {{can be traced back}} to earlier horror fiction. Archetypes have been linked to the books of H. P. Lovecraft, which include investigative narratives, or journeys through the depths. Comparisons have been made between Lovecraft's Cthulhoid Old Ones and the boss encounters seen in many survival horror games. Themes of survival have also been traced to the slasher film subgenre, where the protagonist endures a confrontation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> antagonist. Another major influence on the genre is Japanese horror, including classical Noh theatre, the books of Edogawa Rampo, and Japanese cinema. The survival horror genre largely draws from both Western (mainly American) and Asian (mainly Japanese) traditions, with the Western approach to horror generally favouring action-oriented visceral horror while the Japanese approach tends to favour psychological horror.|$|E
5|$|A second bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for the {{connection}} from Stonehouse to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal at Saul was rejected in 2007.

The roundabout where the A38 joins the A419 road was built over Bristol Road Lock, and part of the route was destroyed by flood relief work for the River Frome.

Outside of the main restoration, the Cotswold Canals Trust are gradually restoring many of the other structures, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> goal of re-opening a link between the River Thames and the River Severn.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Árbenz {{participated in}} the Communist Congress in Helsinki. Soon afterwards, his {{daughter}} Arabella committed suicide in Bogota, an incident that badly affected Árbenz.

On one of his visits to Mexico, Árbenz contracted a serious illness, {{and by the end of}} 1970 he was very ill. He died soon after. Historians disagree as to the manner of his death: Roberto Garcia Ferreira stated that he died of a heart attack while taking a bath, while historian Cindy Forster wrote that he committed suicide. In October 1995, Árbenz's remains were eventually repatriated to Guatemala, accompanied by his widow María. The Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala awarded him with a posthumous decoration soon after.|$|E
