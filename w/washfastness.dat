40|$|International audienceCotton {{was treated}} with β-cyclodextrin (BCD) and two {{derivatives}} of β-cyclodextrin (2 -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and monochlorotriazinyl-B-cyclodextrin) to assess the optimal type for fixation with cotton. The experimental results showed that treatment of cotton with BCD using the crosslinker BTCA resulted in higher fixation than the treatments {{with the other two}} derivatives. The concentration of BTCA used did not significantly influuence the amount of fixation of BCD on cotton. FTIR-ATR spectroscopic analysis showed that the amount of ester formed on the fabric was influenced by the addition of BCD on cotton with BTCA in comparison to crosslinking of only BTCA with cotton. The laundering tests showed relatively poor <b>washfastness</b> of the β-cyclodextrins on the fabrics...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a new {{approach}} to a UV-blocking treatment for cotton fabrics is developed using the sol-gel method. The treatment forms a thin layer of titania on the surface of cotton fibers, and the treated fabrics show much improved protection against UV radiation, with a UPF factor of 50 + or excellent protection according to the Australian/New Zealand standards. The treated fabrics are also tested for <b>washfastness.</b> The results show that the excellent UV protection rating of the treated fabrics can be maintained even after 55 home launderings, indicating a high level of adhesion between the titania layer and the cotton. A bursting strength test of the treated fabrics shows no adverse effect from the treatment. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|Dyeing {{cellulosic}} fibres with reactive dyes wastes great {{quantities of}} salt and water. The objective of this work is to dye cellulosic fibers using coloured nanoparticles (CNPs) {{as an alternative to}} dyeing with reactive dyes, without salt and with only a short washing-off procedure at the end of dyeing. Samples of cotton were dyed by exhaustion with CNPs at light to medium colours. <b>Washfastness</b> results are given. Complete Washing-off sequence after dyeing was not necessary for the red and yellow colours, only one rinsing. The blue colour needs some washing off since the fastness is lower than for the other colours even though soaping is not necessary, saving energy and time relative to dyeing with reactive dyes.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using thermal drop-on-demand ink jet printing to print pigmented ink systems onto textile materials was investigated. Preliminary {{studies showed that}} a novel binder system, Synthappret BAP (traditionally used as a shrink resist treatment for wool), could be successfully incorporated within a screen ink formulation for printing onto cotton fabric. Such a printing ink produced a high quality print which offered the required fastness properties of a textile print whilst maintaining a soft fabric handle. The cross-linking mechanism/properties of the Synthappret BAP were fully characterised. It was found that Synthappret BAP underwent rapid self cross-linking at elevated temperatures. There was no significant evidence of the cross-linking of the Synthappret BAP and the textile fibres. However, the Synthappret BAP was capable of (a) diffusing into the fibre matrix and (b) entrapping the pigment particles, thus, successfully fixing the pigment to the substrate. Such fixation resulted in {{a high degree of}} <b>washfastness</b> and rubfastness. Following the initial success of applying Synthappret BAP as a binder for textile printing, various ink jet printing inks suitable for textile printing were developed. Such inks were tested for physical characteristics required of a typical ink jet printing ink and successfully printed using a desktop ink jet printer. Successful printing of an array of textile materials was achieved. Based on initial trials of such inks further investigation was carried out in order to improve/ensure the following criteria were met:. Suitability for a one pack printing process.. Excellent stability of inks including pH and freeze- thaw stability of pigmented inks thus giving indications on possible shelf life.. Excellent printability on cotton and polyester.. Excellent <b>washfastness</b> on cotton and polyester.. Excellent fabric handle after printing.. Acceptable rubfastness and lightfastness of printed cotton and polyester...|$|E
40|$|Abstract ― PET fabric was dyed {{in black}} shade with {{disperse}} dyes of three primary color. The effect of combination ratio of dye concentration and energy type of disperse dye on dyeing and color property of black dyed PET fabric was investigated. Dyeing compatibility of disperse dyes of three primary color on PET was evaluated by comparison of dyeing rates of them. From the results, color property was {{dependent upon the}} combination ratio of dye concentration. In order to obtain low lightness (L*) and black color, blue dye should be added enough. S-type disperse dye and 130 ℃ dyeing was suitable rather than SE-type dyes or 120 ℃ dyeing. Disperse dyes of three primary color used showed good dyeing compatibility at high dye concentration. <b>Washfastness</b> was fair to moderate and lightfastness was moderate...|$|E
40|$|Disperse dyeing of nylon {{and wool}} fibers with two new {{nanosized}} copper(II) complexes including phosphoric triamide ligands with formula Cu(NO 3) 2 L 2 (1) and Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 L 2 (2) where L =  4 -NO 2 C 6 H 4 NHP(O) (NC 4 H 8 O) 2 (A) was performed successfully. Both complexes 1 and 2 produced yellow and green colored nylon and wool fabrics, respectively. The complexes were synthesized by ultrasonic method and characterized by 1 H, 13 C, 31 P NMR, Fourier-transform infrared, photoluminescence, ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field-emission microscopy and elemental analysis. The FE-SEM micrographs {{revealed that the}} nanoparticles of these compounds are spherical in morphology and ∼ 17 – 20  nm in size. Very appropriate <b>washfastness</b> while poor lightfastness results were deduced for the dyed fibers. The in vitro antibacterial activities of the dyes 1, 2 and dyed wool/nylon fibers against the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis bacterium illustrated increasing in the antibacterial effect by increasing the dye concentration from 0. 1 % to 0. 5 % o. w. f. on both wool and nylon dyed fibers...|$|E
40|$|Klebsiella pneumoniae LZ is a {{bacterium}} isolated from soil which can produce 1, 3 -propanediol from glycerol. Here {{we present a}} 5, 431, 750 -bp assembly of its genome sequence. We annotated 9 coding sequences (CDSs) responsible for glycerol fermentation to 1, 3 -propanediol, 19 CDSs encoding glycerol utilization, and 134 CDSs related to its virulence and defense. Biomass-converted 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PDO) is one of themost important value-added platform chemicals (7). 1, 3 -PDO is used mainly in the synthesis of polymers, {{such as the new}} polyester polytrimethylene terephthalate, which possesses superior characteristics of stretching, stretch recovery, and bet-ter <b>washfastness</b> (2). The tremendous growth of the biodiesel industry has created a surplus of glycerol, resulting in a dra-matic decrease in crude glycerol price and making it desirable to produce 1, 3 -PD by microbial fermentation using glycerol as the substrate (6). Klebsiella pneumoniae is a typical microorganism capable of producing 1, 3 -PD by glycerol fermentation, and the relevant an-abolic pathway has been well studied (5). However, there are stil...|$|E
30|$|Overall, {{colorfastness}} {{to light}} and laundering findings indicate mixed results for color change when using a PAS mordant for the selected mill waste, however any improvement to colorfastness is considered positive. Thus, using a PAS mordant may be preferable as lightfastness improved for black walnut and eastern redcedar, while <b>washfastness</b> improved for Osage orange. Improved colorfastness properties may enhance sell-ability of dyed products as consumer concern for color longevity is addressed. Environmentally and economically, {{the use of}} a premordant does increase cost and the amount of time, water, and thermal energy required. Future studies could evaluate adding the mordant to the dye bath, instead of as a pretreatment. As noted prior, there is growing concern over disposal of any residual manufactured metallic mordant {{and its impact on the}} environment and community health. As we did not measure the amount of remaining PAS mordant from a 12  % owf mordant bath, we cannot provide insight to this concern. A possible social impact of introducing use of a PAS mordant is that such practice may not be conducive to long standing natural dye traditions and if accepted could change a cultural heritage.|$|E
40|$|The fibers of poly (lactic acid) (PLA), {{derived from}} {{annually}} renewable agricultural resources, {{had a great}} potential {{when they were first}} introduced into the market as they have the advantages of synthetic fibers, as well as they are biodegradable. Some current challenges and limitations associated with these new fibers have constrained their popularity, especially when they were dyed. They easily become saturated leading to pastel shades and their <b>washfastness</b> is poor. We verified that the crystallinity of PLA fibers is comparable to that of conventional polyester (55 - 60 % at worst). However, this crystallinity has increased during the wet treatment, especially dyeing, which {{may be due to the}} hydrolysis of amorphous regions. Rapid stricke of the dye means that the amorphous regions are barely oriented (hence X-ray background intensity is really flat) and they do not retain the dye molecules. The adsorption isotherms also show that there is no adsorption but it is a "solution" as they are of the Nernst type and the dye fixation decreases with increasing temperature. But each wet treatment leads to a fiber hydrolysis which causes a loss of dye and a slow loss of mechanical properties of the fiber. The latter phenomenon is relatively long leading to a hypothesis that the hydrolysis by side-group elimination would be faster than the degradation of weak points in the macromolecular polymer chains. Les fibres d'acide polylactique (PLA), issues de ressources agricoles renouvelables, ont suscité à leur apparition un grand intérêt car il s'agit de fibres ayant les avantages des fibres synthétiques. Or très vite des inconvénients sont apparus en particulier lors de leur teinture : elles se saturent très facilement conduisant a des nuances pastel et les solidités aux lavages des teintures sont médiocres. Nous avons vérifié que la cristallinité des fibres de PLA est du même ordre de grandeur que celle du polyester classique (55 - au pire 60 %). Par contre les traitements aqueux type teinture font croître cette cristallinité, peut-être par hydrolyse des zones amorphes. Mais la teinture est très rapide, ce qui signifierait que les zones amorphes sont à peine orientées ce qui est confirmé par RX (un fond continu vraiment plat) et de ce fait elles ne retiennent pas le colorant. Les isothermes d'adsorption montrent également qu'il n'y a pas d'adsorption mais « solution » puisqu'elles sont de type Nernst et que la fixation de colorant décroît avec la croissance de la température. En plus, à chaque traitement aqueux de la fibre est hydrolysée ce qui entraîne une perte de colorant et une réduction lente des propriétés mécaniques de la fibre. Ce dernier phénomène étant relativement long d'où nous avons formulé une hypothèse que l'hydrolyse des bouts de chaine serait plus rapide que celle des milieux de chaine...|$|E
