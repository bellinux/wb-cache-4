40|$|Abstract. —We used a nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton (NPZ) model {{coupled to}} a fish {{bioenergetics}} model {{to simulate the}} weight-at-age responses of Pacific herring Clupea pallasii to climate regimes. The NPZ model represents the daily dynamics of the lower trophic levels by simulating the uptake and recycling dynamics of nitrogen and silicon and the photosynthesis and grazing interactions of multiple functional groups of phytoplankton and zooplankton. The bioenergetics model simulates the number and mean weight of Pacific herring for each of 10 age-classes. Three zooplankton groups simulated in the NPZ model provide estimates of the prey {{used to determine the}} consumption component of the herring bioenergetics model. We used a spawner–recruit relationship to estimate the number of new age- 1 individuals joining the herring population every year. The coupled models were applied to the coastal upwelling area off the west coast of Vancouver Island. Model simulations were performed to isolate the effects of each of four documented climate regimes on Pacific herring <b>weights</b> <b>at</b> age. The climate regimes differed in the environmental variables used in the spawner–recruit relationship {{as well as in the}} water temperature, mixed-layer depth, and nutrient influxing rate used by the NPZ model. In agreement with general opinion and with the Pacific herring data from the west coast of Vancouver Island, the model-predicted estimates of <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> age, <b>recruitment,</b> and spawning stock biomass were highest in regime 1 (1962 – 1976), intermediate in regime 2 (1977 – 1988), an...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between longitudinal change in total cholesterol as a main cardiovascular disease risk factor and shift work, controlling for the effect of the <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> baseline of <b>recruitment.</b> Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study consists of 674 employees of Iranian Corporation Polyacril from 1992 to 2009. Stratified analysis of the relationship between shift work and cholesterol based on <b>weight</b> status <b>at</b> baseline of <b>recruitment</b> controlled for the effect of confounders including age, body mass index, pre-employment cholesterol, glucose, triglyceride, urea, work types, education, and marital status. A linear mixed model used for analyzing the data. Estimation of parameters has done by Bayesian approaches using Winbugs statistical software. Bayesian confidence interval (CI) was used for testing regression coefficients. Results: Average age mean at employment was 25 years (standard deviation [SD] = 3. 3); the average number of measurement for each individual was 3. 7 times (SD = 0. 6). In this model, relationship between shift work and cholesterol changes controlled for confounding factors was significant in whom overweight was at baseline (beta = 2. 25, P < 0. 001, 95 % CI: 0. 67 - 3. 88) but was not significant for whom overweight was at baseline of employment.

40|$|PURPOSE: There is {{inconsistent}} evidence regarding {{the relationship between}} higher intake of nuts, being an energy-dense food, and weight gain. We investigated the relationship between nut intake and changes in weight over 5  years. METHODS: This study includes 373, 293 men and women, 25 - 70  years old, recruited between 1992 and 2000 from 10 European countries in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Habitual intake of nuts including peanuts, together defined as nut intake, was estimated from country-specific validated dietary questionnaires. Body <b>weight</b> was measured <b>at</b> <b>recruitment</b> and self-reported 5  years later. The association between nut intake and body weight change was estimated using multilevel mixed linear regression models with center/country as random effect and nut intake and relevant confounders as fixed effects. The relative risk (RR) of becoming overweight or obese after 5  years was investigated using multivariate Poisson regressions stratified according to baseline body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: On average, study participants gained 2. 1  kg (SD 5. 0  kg) over 5  years. Compared to non-consumers, subjects in the highest quartile of nut intake had less weight gain over 5  years (- 0. 07  kg; 95 % CI - 0. 12 to - 0. 02) (P trend = 0. 025) and had 5 % lower risk of becoming overweight (RR 0. 95; 95 % CI 0. 92 - 0. 98) or obese (RR 0. 95; 95 % CI 0. 90 - 0. 99) (both P trend < 0. 008).

We investigated associations between main nutrient patterns and prospective weight change in adults. Methods: This study includes 235, 880 participants, 25 – 70 years old, recruited between 1992 and 2000 in 10 European countries. Intakes of 23 nutrients were estimated from country-specific validated dietary questionnaires using the harmonized EPIC Nutrient DataBase. Four nutrient patterns, explaining 67 % of the total variance of nutrient intakes, were previously identified from principal component analysis. Body <b>weight</b> was measured <b>at</b> <b>recruitment</b> and self-reported 5 years later. The relationship between nutrient patterns and annual weight change was examined separately for men and women using linear mixed models with random effect according to center controlling for confounders. Results: Mean weight gain was 460 g/year (SD 950) and 420 g/year (SD 940) for men and women, respectively. The annual differences in weight gain per one SD increase in the pattern scores were as follows: principal component (PC) 1, characterized by nutrients from plant food sources, was inversely associated with weight gain in men (− 22 g/year; 95 % CI − 33 to − 10) and women (− 18 g/year; 95 % CI − 26 to − 11).

40|$|Context: UK Biobank is a {{prospective}} study {{of half a}} million subjects, almost all aged 40 – 69 years, identified in 22 centres across the UK during 2006 – 2010. Objective: A healthy lifestyle {{has been described as}} ‘better than any pill, and no side effects [5]. We therefore examined the relationships between healthy behaviours: low alcohol intake, non-smoking, healthy BMI, physical activity and a healthy diet, and the risk of all cancers, colon, breast and prostate cancers in a large dataset. Method: Data on lifestyle behaviours were provided by 343, 150 subjects, and height and <b>weight</b> were measured <b>at</b> <b>recruitment.</b> 14, 285 subjects were diagnosed with cancer during a median of 5. 1 years of follow-up. Results: Compared with subjects who followed none or a single healthy behaviour, a healthy lifestyle based on all five behaviours was associated with a reduction of about one-third in incident cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 68; 95 % confidence intervals [CI] 0. 63 – 0. 74). Colorectal cancer was reduced in subjects following the five behaviours by about one-quarter (HR 0. 75; 95 % CI 0. 58 – 0. 97), and breast cancer by about one-third (HR 0. 65; 95 % CI 0. 52 – 0. 83). The association between a healthy lifestyle and prostate cancer suggested a significant increase in risk, but this can be attributed to bias consequent on inequalities in the uptake of the prostate specific antigen screening test. Conclusions: Taken together with reported reductions in diabetes, vascular disease and dementia, it is clearly important that every effort is taken to promote healthy lifestyles throughout the population, and it is pointed out that cancer and other screening clinics afford ‘teachable moments’ for the promotion of a healthy lifestyle...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether changes in smoking status among women recruited for the Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study affected previous risk estimates for myocardial infarction. DESIGN: (1) Postal survey between November 1994 and July 1995 of women still under general practitioner observation. Validation of the smoking information {{supplied by the}} women on the questionnaire by comparison with that reported by the general practitioner <b>at</b> <b>recruitment</b> to the main study. (2) Nested case-control study of 103 cases of myocardial infarction, matched with 309 controls, to see if different risk estimates were obtained when smoking status <b>at</b> <b>recruitment</b> or smoking status at time of event were used in the analysis. SETTING: 650 general practices throughout the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 10, 073 women who responded to the questionnaire (85. 4 % of 11, 797 sent out). MAIN RESULTS: There was good agreement between smoking information recorded by the general practitioner <b>at</b> <b>recruitment</b> and that supplied retrospectively by respondents to the questionnaire. The risk estimates for myocardial infarction associated with use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) were almost identical irrespective of whether smoking status <b>at</b> <b>recruitment</b> or <b>at</b> time of event was used for the statistical adjustment. This was because few women stopped smoking while also using COCs. In fact, fewer regular smokers who have ever used COCs reported stopping smoking than never users. The risk estimates for myocardial infarction associated with smoking were smaller when smoking habits <b>at</b> <b>recruitment</b> was used than when smoking habits at time of event was used. CONCLUSIONS: Previous results from the Oral Contraception Study regarding the effects of COCs are unlikely to have been biased by changes in the smoking habits of the cohort, but the effects of smoking have probably been underestimated. There is still a need for effective health education regarding the risks associated with smoking, particularly among users of COCs...|$|R

40|$|Background: Inadequate and {{excessive}} gestational weight gain (GWG) {{is among the}} most important determinant of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. In most developing countries including Malawi, monitoring changes in pregnancy weight is challenging because of late Antenatal care (ANC) attendance. In addition, it is not a routine procedure to monitor and recommend appropriate gestational weight gain in Malawi. Objectives: To identify factors associated with the rate of gestational weight gain and with other indicators of nutritional status in a rural setting of Malawi, and to compare if the weekly weight gain is in accordance to the Institute Of Medicine recommendations for pregnant women in different BMI categories of nutritional status. Methodology: A longitudinal study was done on 257 pregnant women who were recruited in the first and second trimester of their pregnancies to participate in a cluster randomized controlled intervention study. Measurements of maternal <b>weight</b> were done <b>at</b> <b>recruitment</b> and <b>at</b> pregnancy midpoint check-up at local health clinics. Changes in weekly gestational weight over this period were compared to 2009 guidelines set by the IOM to determine whether the pregnant women were meeting these guidelines. Haemoglobin (Hb), Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) and skinfold thickness measurements were taken at the time of recruitment. Analysis: Binary data (met IOM guidelines/ not met) were analyzed using the logistic regression model within the generalized linear regression model (GLM) framework to determine factors that were associated with the rate of gestational weight gain. Prevalence of inadequate gestational weight gain was also determined. The GLM was also used to identify factors associated with haemoglobin (Hb) status, MUAC and body fat percentage <b>at</b> <b>recruitment.</b> Results: The study revealed that 19. 8 % of the pregnant mothers gained adequate GWG. The mean GWG per week was 0. 26 (SD ± 0. 2) kg. Starting pregnancy before harvest season was significantly associated with inadequate GWG, (AOR = 0. 33, 95 % CI 0. 16, 0. 65) significantly predicted GWG. The factors that were associated with low Hb status on recruitment were malaria β and higher gestational age on recruitment. Maternal age was significantly associated with large MUAC whereas very poor socio economic status (SES) and large households significantly decreased the size of MUAC. Each one year increase in age was associated with an increase in body fat percentage whereas lower body fat was common among women from very poor SES. Conclusion: A small proportion of the pregnant women obtained adequate gestational weight gain. Season of recruitment significantly predicted GWG; before harvest season was associated with a lower weight gain...|$|R

The maximum expected genetic gain in 12 -month body weight was 8. 85 kg/generation when all five body weights were included in the index; this decreased to 8. 09 kg/generation when body <b>weights</b> <b>at</b> birth, 3 and 6 months were excluded and further decreased to 6. 94 kg/ generation when selection based on yearling weight only. From the practical standpoint, selection on I 5 involving body <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> 9 month of age can be considered as the best for improving body <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> 12 month since its application is earlier, less expensive, higher accuracy than any index excluding body <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> 12 month and giving reasonable amount (+ 5. 39 kg) improvement in yearling weight as compared to direct selection (+ 6. 94 kg) ...|$|R

Records on the birth weight (n = 6207), weaning weight (n = 4444), <b>weights</b> <b>at</b> 24 weeks (n = 3494), 48 weeks (n = 2633) and 72 weeks of age (n = 1874) were evaluated for fixed effects: year of birth, season of birth, sex, birth type, age of dam and location of differences. The overall unadjusted mean <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> birth and weaning were 2. 68 and 15. 15 kg, respectively. The mean <b>weights</b> <b>at</b> 24, 48 and 72 weeks of age were 18. 19, 22. 93 and 33. 24 kg respectively.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the genetic and phenotypic parameters for meat production characters using {{the results in}} progeny testing based on 1, 705 half brothers offspring of 105 Friesian bulls from Romania. The live traits taken into account were <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> the age of 180 and 365 days, and weight daily gain {{during the period of}} fattening starting at the age of 2. 5 months and ending at the age of 12 - 15 months of the steers. Taking into account that the fattening was made in 28 herds and the peculiarities of half sibs families, it was used a linear mathematical model for nested (hierarchical) classification. <b>Weight</b> <b>at</b> the age of 180 days registered 138. 85 ± 6. 04 kg, <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> the age of 365 days was 293. 41 ± 1. 04 kg in average and daily gain 881. 977 ± 4. 24 g/head/day. Heritability was h 2 = 0. 524 for <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> the age of 180 days, h 2 = 0. 642 for <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> the age of 365 days and h 2 = 0. 372 for daily gain. The correlations between <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> the age of 180 days and <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> the age of 365 days was rG = - 0. 287 and rP = - 0. 189, between <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> the age of 180 days and weight daily gain rG = - 0. 307 and rF = - 0. 726, and between <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> the age of 365 days and weight daily gain rG = 0. 850 şi rF = 0. 771. The meat production traits are closely related one to each other. Weight daily gain is substantially influenced by environmental factors. In practice, farmers should pay attention to live <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> various fattening stages and improve all the environment conditions in order to reach the weight daily gain as planned. In the breeding programmes, live characters are the most important ones and the steers month of birth needs to be corrected in order to precisely detemine sire position in the breeding pyramid...|$|R
40|$|Postpartum {{body weight}} {{dynamics}} of zebu and crossbred cows {{in relation to}} postpartum reproduction was studied {{using data from the}} Bako Agricultural Research Centre. Body <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> calving, first postpartum oestrus, first service and conception were analysed using the General Linear Model which included cow breed, parity, and calving season and year as a fixed effects and calving weight and body weight gain from calving to three months as a covariate. Accordingly, the result indicated that the overall mean body <b>weights</b> <b>at</b> calving, estrus, service and conception were 299. 7 t 1. 35, 304. 6 ± 0. 61, 309. 5 ± 0. 79 and 313. 3 ± 0. 90 kg, respectively. Boran Simmental cows had significantly (p < 0. 001) the heaviest <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> calving (381. 3 t 5. 95 kg), estrus (322. 3 ± 3. 07 kg), service (330. 6 t 4. 00 kg) and conception (344. 2 t 4. 56 kg), while Horro cows had the lightest <b>weight.</b> Significantly (<b>at</b> least p < 0. 05) higher calving weight was recorded for cows that calved during June to August while the highest service and conception weights were recorded for cows that calved during December to February. Cows in the first parity had significantly (p < 0. 05) lighter <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> calving, estrus, service and conception compared to cows in the other parities. Body <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> estrus, service and conception were linearly and significantly (p < 0. 001) related to body <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> calving and body weight gain from calving to three months. All breeds except Horro and Horro Jersey cows lost a portion of their calving <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> estrus (0. 3 to 16. 3 %), service (3. 7 to 13. 3 %) and conception (0. 9 to 11. 5 %). The Jersey lost 0. 3 % of its calving <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> estrus but gained 1. 5 and 2 % of their calving <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> first service and conception. From this study it can be concluded that cows had to attain the critical postpartum body weight to resume reproduction and conceive. Besides, the critical <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> conception is higher than at first postpartum estrus and service. Cows had to gain a portion of their calving weight lost to resume reproduction...|$|R
