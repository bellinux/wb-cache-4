40|$|Statistics (OES) {{survey is}} a {{periodic}} survey of nonfarm establishments that collects occupational employment data on workers by industry. The survey uses a <b>weighting</b> <b>cell</b> adjustment procedure {{to adjust for}} unit nonresponse. Previous {{research has shown that}} this procedure works reasonably well with these data.

The adjustment cell for the current procedure is, at most, an entire three-digit SIC within a sampled area. The OES sample is originally allocated at the Substate-Area, three-digit SIC, Employment-Size level. Estimates are produced at the Substate-Area, three-digit SIC level.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the diminished n-butyrate oxidation observed in ulcerative colitis {{may be the result}} of sulphide induced inhibition of short chain acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) dehydrogenase activity. AIM: To examine the acyl-CoA ester profiles in isolated rat colonic epithelial cells treated in vitro with sodium hydrogen sulphide (NaHS). METHODS: Isolated rat colonic epithelial cell suspensions were incubated for 10 minutes in the presence of [1 - 14 C] n-butyrate (5 mM), with and without NaHS (1. 5 mM). Incubations were carried out both in the presence and the absence of exogenous CoA and ATP. Metabolic performance was assessed by 14 CO 2 production and by acyl-CoA ester production measured by HPLC with ultraviolet detection. RESULTS: Results are given as mean (SEM). For colonocytes incubated in the presence of exogenous CoA and ATP, treatment with NaHS significantly diminished 14 CO 2 production (control 0. 97 (0. 06) mumol/g dry weight cells/min, treated 0. 26 (0. 09) mumol/g dry weight cells/min, p = 0. 0019), was associated with an increase in butyryl-CoA concentrations in the final reaction mixture at 10 minutes (control 2. 55 (0. 28) mumol/g dry <b>weight</b> <b>cells,</b> treated 3. 32 (0. 32) mumol/g dry <b>weight</b> <b>cells,</b> p = 0. 002), and a reduction in crotonyl-CoA concentrations (control 0. 274 (0. 02) mumol/g dry <b>weight</b> <b>cells,</b> treated 0. 120 (0. 04) mumol/g dry <b>weight</b> <b>cells,</b> p = 0. 008). The mean concentration of acetyl-CoA in the reaction mixture at 10 minutes was not significantly different between control and sulphide treated incubations. There were no significant differences in acyl-CoA ester profiles observed when cells were incubated in the absence of exogenous CoA and ATP. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the view that sulphides inhibit n-butyrate oxidation in colonic epithelial cells by inhibiting short chain acyl dehydrogenation of activated fatty acids.

40|$|Continuous {{production}} of L-malic acid {{will be presented}} in this paper. The fumarase isolated from porcine heart, fumarase in the permeabilized non-growing cells of baker’s yeast and Saccharomyces bayanus (UVAFERM BC) were used as biocatalysts. In the {{production of}} L-malic acid with fumarase isolated from porcine hearts, there was no enzyme deactivation {{for a period of}} two days. At the average residence time of 4 hours, the conversion of about 80 % was achieved. Inactivation of the enzyme was observed using permeabilized cells. Thi s inactivation is described as a reversible process. C onversion of about 50 % was achieved with the remaining enzyme activity. A mathematical model that describes the production of L-malic acid, which contains the enzyme inactivation rate, was developed. Based on simulations, the used biocatalysts were compared. The results show that in the continuous production of L-malic acid, one milligram of purified enzyme corresponds to 68 g (wet <b>weight)</b> <b>cells</b> of Saccharomyces bayanus or 120 g (wet <b>weight)</b> <b>cells</b> of baker’s yeast...|$|R

The continuous fermentation was operated over a range of steady-state dilution rates from 0. 085 to 0. 301 hr− 1.

At concentrations above 10 μg/ml no increase in the rate of norfloxacin accumulation was observed.
