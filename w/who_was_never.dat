5|$|Before the {{original}} Doctor Who series reached its conclusion, some tentative plans {{had been made}} for a proposed 27th season {{under the assumption that}} it would maintain the then-current pattern of two four-part and two three-part stories. As noted in each entry, Big Finish Productions has produced audio adaptations of several scripts as part of their The Lost Stories releases. The safecracking companion introduced in Crime of the Century (see below), <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> named during the planning, has now been given a name, that of Raine Creevey, and she is portrayed by Beth Chalmers.|$|E

5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's owner, Dee Garrett, bred {{her to his}} {{champion}} stallion Vandy, {{and produced}} three world champions: Vandy's Flash, Vanetta Dee, and Vannevar. Vansarita Too set a new track record and Vandy's Betty and Miss Vanity earned AAA speed ratings. Her first foal was Vandy's Betty, {{who went on to}} earn an AAA rating on the race track and became the dam of Mr. Van Deck. Her next foal was Vanetta Dee, who racked up 94 starts with 31 wins, 20 seconds and 16 thirds in six years of racing. Her total earnings were $83,325 (approximately $ in current dollars). Vannevar was the next foal, and was AQHA Champion Racing Gelding in 1956 and 1957. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's 1954 foal was Vandy's Flash, who was the first gelding named World Champion Quarter Running Horse, in 1960. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's 1955 foal was Vansarita, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> raced. A number of miscarriages followed, but in 1958 Garrett's Miss Pawhuska produced Miss Vanity, another AAA-rated racehorse. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska slipped, or lost, her next two foals, but produced Vansarita Too in 1961, who also earned an AAA on the race track. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's last foal by Vandy was Vandy's Flash, a stallion, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> raced but sired 107 foals. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's last foal was not by Vandy, but was by a son of Three Bars named The Ole Man, but the gelding was never raced.|$|E
5|$|This {{same period}} of {{economic}} and political uncertainty, however, produced an unsurpassed literary flowering in England. The first signs of a new literary movement had appeared {{at the end of the}} second decade of Elizabeth's reign, with John Lyly's Euphues and Edmund Spenser's The Shepheardes Calender in 1578. During the 1590s, some of the great names of English literature entered their maturity, including William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. During this period and into the Jacobean era that followed, the English theatre reached its highest peaks. The notion of a great Elizabethan era depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth's reign. They owed little directly to the queen, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> a major patron of the arts.|$|E

5|$|At {{the house}} of Will's friends Max and Bella, Anna fits in {{perfectly}} as they all share stories. Honey immediately recognizes Anna and declares them best friends instantly. She and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (<b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E

25|$|For {{audiences in}} the United States, {{who saw the}} show only in {{syndication}} (mostly on PBS), Tom Baker was the incarnation of the Doctor who is the best known, since his episodes were the ones most frequently broadcast stateside.

The paper was identified as part of Loch Vennachar's cargo. Three weeks later, the sea began delivering scraps of her cargo to the jagged coast of Kangaroo Island which confirmed the disaster. The steamer Governor Musgrave was sent on two separate occasions {{to search for the}} wreck and any survivors. Weeks of searching by government and local fishing boats produced only flotsam and the body of a young seaman, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> identified.

25|$|The second {{semifinal}} featured red group no. 1 Victoria Azarenka {{and white}} group no. 2 Vera Zvonareva. She broke serve {{three times in}} the first set, including once at love. There were some tough moments in the 59-minute second set, including a marathon six-deuce fourth game where Zvonareva defied four break points to hold for 2–all, but Azarenka got a late break and save two brek points at the final game and served it out, It is her fourth win in their 10 meetings. Azarenka of Belarus eventually won 6–2, 6–3 Saturday to reach the final of the WTA Championships. The No. 4-ranked Azarenka's solid groundstrokes forced errors from No. 6 Zvonareva, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> able to gain momentum in the match.|$|E
25|$|In 1251, Kublai's eldest brother Möngke became Khan of the Mongol Empire, and Khwarizmian Mahmud Yalavach and Kublai {{were sent}} to China. Kublai {{received}} the viceroyalty over North China and moved his ordo to central Inner Mongolia. During his years as viceroy, Kublai managed his territory well, boosted the agricultural output of Henan, and increased social welfare spendings after receiving Xi'an. These acts received great acclaim from the Chinese warlords and were essential to {{the building of the}} Yuan Dynasty. In 1252, Kublai criticized Mahmud Yalavach, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> highly valued by his Chinese associates, over his cavalier execution of suspects during a judicial review, and Zhao Bi attacked him for his presumptuous attitude toward the throne. Möngke dismissed Mahmud Yalavach, which met with resistance from Chinese Confucian-trained officials.|$|E

25|$|Blair was a fast bowler <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> quite able {{to carry}} his {{enormous}} success for Wellington in the Plunket Shield over into the Test arena. In 59 matches for Wellington from 1951–52 to 1964–65 he took 330 wickets {{at an average of}} 15.16. In his best season, he took 46 wickets in the five matches of 1956–57 at an average of 9.47, twice taking nine wickets in an innings. The next season, he took 34 at 11.20, then in a trial match {{at the end of the}} season he took five wickets in each innings for North Island against South Island. But in the series that followed a few months later in England, he took only three wickets in three Tests, at an average of 70. He achieved his best Test match figures, 7 for 142, in what turned out to be his last Test, against South Africa at Auckland in 1963–64.|$|E
25|$|Ongoing {{conflict}} in the Maya region soon destabilised the whole area following the defeat of DosPilas' patron Calakmul and in 761 the city was dramatically abandoned after Tamarindito and other Petexbatún centres rebelled against their DosPilas overlord. A hieroglyphic stairway at Tamarindito mentions the enforced flight of K'awiil Chan K'inich, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> mentioned again. The DosPilas royal family probably transported itself to the more defensible Aguateca, which lies only 10km to the southeast. The violent end of Dos Pilas {{is evident from the}} smashed remains of a royal throne recovered from the Bat Palace. The entire Petexbatún region was engulfed by warfare in the late 8th century AD until almost all the settlements of the former DosPilas kingdom were abandoned. The monuments of Ixlú in the central Petén lakes region bear some hieroglyphic texts that closely resemble texts from DosPilas, suggesting that the lords of Ixlú may have been refugees from the collapse of the Petexbatún region.|$|E
25|$|After the Aloha special, Parker made a {{deal that}} would later be used in court {{to prove that he}} had not acted in the best {{interests}} of Presley. He offered RCA the opportunity to buy Presley's entire back catalog for a mere $5.4 million. At the time, Presley's back catalog was not considered that important and RCA initially calculated it at being worth much less, but in later years it would become one of the most valuable catalogs in the music business. The sale of the catalog to RCA meant that after his death Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973. To be fair to Parker, however, Presley had asked him to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement. Presley, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> one to know the full ins and outs of the music business, would have probably had no idea how important his back catalogue was, and therefore would have trusted Parker's judgment on the matter. Parker, too, could have never known how valuable the catalog would become.|$|E
