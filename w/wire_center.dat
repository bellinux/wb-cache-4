50|$|A central-office {{engineer}} {{is responsible}} for designing and overseeing the implementation of telecommunications equipment in a central office (CO for short), {{also referred to as}} a <b>wire</b> <b>center</b> or telephone exchange A CO engineer {{is responsible for}} integrating new technology into the existing network, assigning the equipment's location in the <b>wire</b> <b>center,</b> and providing power, clocking (for digital equipment), and alarm monitoring facilities for the new equipment. The CO engineer is also responsible for providing more power, clocking, and alarm monitoring facilities if there are currently not enough available to support the new equipment being installed. Finally, the CO engineer is responsible for designing how the massive amounts of cable will be distributed to various equipment and wiring frames throughout the <b>wire</b> <b>center</b> and overseeing the installation and turn up of all new equipment.|$|E

2500|$|In {{historical}} perspective, telecommunication terms {{have been}} used with different semantics over time. The term telephone exchange is often used synonymously with central office (CO), a Bell System term. Often, a central office {{is defined as a}} building used to house the inside plant equipment of potentially several telephone exchanges, each serving a certain geographical area. Such an area has also been referred to as the exchange. Central office locations may also be identified in North America as <b>wire</b> <b>centers,</b> designating a facility from which a telephone obtains dial tone. [...] For business and billing purposes, telephony carriers also define rate centers, which in larger cities may be clusters of central offices, to define specified geographical locations for determining distance measurements.|$|R

50|$|The {{cross-connect}} box, {{also known}} as a serving area interface, is then installed to allow connections to be made more easily from the <b>wire</b> <b>center</b> to the destination point and ties up fewer facilities by not having dedication facilities from the <b>wire</b> <b>center</b> to every destination point. The plant is then taken directly to its destination point or to another small closure called a terminal, where access can also be gained to the plant if necessary. These access points are preferred as they allow faster repair times for customers and save telephone operating companies large amounts of money.|$|E
50|$|A {{key element}} in wire wrapped jewelry is a loop made in a segment of wire. In general, loops in wire are {{connected}} to one another to make the mechanical connections between components. A loop can be {{something as simple as}} bending the end of a piece of wire until {{the very end of the}} wire is bent far enough that it touches the wire itself. This simple form of a loop is called a “P” loop. A “P” loop is a loop in the wire in the shape of the letter “P”. Another form of a loop is an eye loop. An eye loop is a more complex loop with a full circle of <b>wire</b> <b>centered</b> over the stem of wire just like a lollipop.|$|R
50|$|Among his {{earliest}} work, Stolfo along with colleague Greg Vesonder of Bell Labs, developed a large-scale expert data analysis system, called ACE (Automated Cable Expertise) for the nation's phone system. AT&T Bell Labs distributed ACE {{to a number}} of telephone <b>wire</b> <b>centers</b> to improve the management and scheduling of repairs in the local loop. ACE is likely to have been the first system to combine rule-based inference (an AI expert system) with a relational database management system, the AT&T CRAS system, and serves as a model for deductive data base systems that were the subject matter of research for many years in the database community. ACE was the first expert system of its kind that was commercialized and widely distributed.|$|R

50|$|In modern times, most {{telephones}} are {{plugged into}} telephone jacks. The jacks are connected by inside wiring to a drop wire which connects {{the building to}} a cable. Cables usually bring {{a large number of}} drop wires from all over a district access network to one <b>wire</b> <b>center</b> or telephone exchange. When a telephone user wants to make a telephone call, equipment at the exchange examines the dialed telephone number and connects that telephone line to another in the same <b>wire</b> <b>center,</b> or to a trunk to a distant exchange. Most of the exchanges in the world are interconnected through a system of larger switching systems, forming the public switched telephone network (PSTN).|$|E

50|$|Local number {{portability}} allows a number {{to be moved}} to a different carrier or a different <b>wire</b> <b>center</b> within the same rate center. A landline provider typically will not allow a cross-town move to a different rate center under the same number at standard rates; possible alternatives include expensive foreign exchange service or a nomadic class of service such as voice over IP or a mobile phone.|$|E
50|$|Outside plant (OSP) {{engineers}} are also often called field engineers because they frequently {{spend much time}} in the field taking notes about the civil environment, aerial, above ground, and below ground. OSP {{engineers are}} responsible for taking plant (copper, fiber, etc.) from a <b>wire</b> <b>center</b> to a distribution point or destination point directly. If a distribution point design is used, then a cross-connect box is placed in a strategic location to feed a determined distribution area.|$|E
50|$|As {{electrical}} engineers, CO {{engineers are}} responsible for the resistance, capacitance, and inductance (RCL) design of all new plant to ensure telephone service is clear and crisp and data service is clean as well as reliable. Attenuation or gradual loss in intensity and loop loss calculations are required to determine cable length and size required to provide the service called for. In addition, power requirements have to be calculated and provided to power any electronic equipment being placed in the <b>wire</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E

40|$|The gaseous {{proportional}} counter is {{a device that}} can be used to detect ionizing radiation. These devices can be as simple as a cylindrical cathode and a very thin anode <b>wire</b> <b>centered</b> along its axis. By applying a high voltage, a strong electric field is generated close to the anode wire. Ion-pairs, generated by passing ionizing radiation, create avalanches once they drift into the strong electric field region near the anode. The electrical charges created by the avalanche generate an observable signal which is proportional to the energy loss of the incoming radiation. We discuss the construction of such a device. Our detector was built from an ordinary aluminium beverage can and uses a common electric wire strand as the anode. The construction of this detector offers students at universities or technically oriented high schools a detailed understanding of the design and operation of gaseous radiation detectors. The equipment required to complete the project should be available at most institutions. Comment: 9 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

40|$|The muon {{detector}} of the Atlas experiment at LHC (CERN) {{consists of}} 370000 high-resolution drift tubes assembled in multi-layer chambers. To {{take full advantage}} of the single-tube resolution, the high- precision external surface of tube end-plugs is used for positioning a layer before gluing. The wire position in the tube is defined at construction time by means of a locator inserted in the end-plug. To check that the wire is in the nominal position after the tube assembly an electromagnetic micrometer (EMMI) has been developed. EMMI detects the wire position by measuring the electromotive force induced in two sensors symmetrically placed {{on both sides of the}} tube when a small sinusoidal current circulates on the wire. An accuracy of two microns on the <b>wire</b> <b>centering</b> has been obtained. The simplicity of this method and the short measuring time allow every drift tube to be checked, thus guaranteeing the precision requested for the Atlas muon detector. (4 refs) ...|$|R
50|$|The Loop Maintenance Operations System (LMOS) is a {{telephone}} company trouble ticketing system to coordinate repairs of local loops (telephone lines). When {{a problem is}} reported to the Centralized Repair Service Answering Bureau (CRSAB) by a subscriber dialing the designated number (often (1)+611), it is filed and relayed through the Cross Front End, which is a link from the CRSAB to the LMOS network. The trouble report is then sent to the Front End via the Datakit network, where a Basic Output Report is requested (usually by a lineman). The BOR provides line information including past trouble history and MLT (Mechanized Loop Testing) tests. As LMOS is responsible for trouble reports, analysis, and similar related functions, MLT does the actual testing of customer loops. MLT hardware {{is located in the}} Repair Service Bureau. Test trunks connect MLT hardware to the telephone exchanges or <b>wire</b> <b>centers,</b> which in turn connect with the subscriber loops.|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} the Long-Reach Optical Access Network (LROAN) is to replace the optical/electrical/optical {{conversion}} that {{takes place at the}} local exchange with a continuous optical path that extends from the customer to the core of the network. Work by Davey and Payne at BT showed that significant cost savings could be made by reducing the electronic equipment and real-estate required at the local exchange or <b>wire</b> <b>center.</b> A proof of concept demonstrator showed {{that it was possible to}} serve 1024 users at 10Gbit/s with 100 km reach.|$|E
50|$|The {{response}} of the company was to hire and train thousands of new employees and to buy much new equipment for them to work on. Underground construction took years, but emergency installation of Anaconda Carrier pair gain systems normally used in rural areas expanded service while construction was in progress. Bell Labs added processing power to their new systems and fixed the software bugs. A new <b>wire</b> <b>center</b> at 1095 Avenue of the Americas and 42nd Street relieved four others in Midtown Manhattan of part of their load, {{as well as providing}} the company with a new headquarters for the next quarter century.

50|$|The {{company went}} {{underground}} {{in a big}} way in the 1920s, creating expensive new outside plant that fixed its geometry for the century to come. New cable ducts brought more reliable service to customers. They converged at approximately twenty wire centers, which were connected by larger trunk cable ducts running along the East and West Sides of Manhattan. The locations were a mile or two apart (2-3 km), close to concentrations of office workers without paying prime prices for land. At each <b>wire</b> <b>center</b> a new central office arose to house telephone switchboards, panel switches and other inside plant, and technicians, clerks, operators and other workers. The largest of these was also the corporate headquarters, at 140 West Street on the Lower West Side, about a kilometer (half mile) from AT&T HQ at 195 Broadway.|$|E
