The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the birth control services in England and Wales (birth control services were interpreted broadly to include sterilization and therapeutic abortion as well as conventional methods) and also to study variations in services between areas. The Birth Control Services study consisted of 5 surveys: SN: 402 General Practitioners recorded information about advice given by general practitioners and the views of general practitioners about their role in relation to conventional birth control as well as in relation to therapeutic abortion and sterilisation. Close attention was given to the pill, its possible health hazards, prolonged use, and side effects. SN: 909 Health Visitors and Midwives collected data about advice given by health visitors and midwives and their views about their respective roles.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{financial}} support program for high-risk pregnant <b>women</b> based <b>on</b> <b>opinions</b> obtained using a questionnaire survey. MethodsThe program development involved two steps: (1) developing a questionnaire through reviewing previous financial support programs for maternal care and then validating it via professional consultation; and (2) drafting a financial support program. Sixty professionals, 26 high-risk pregnant women, and 100 program implementers completed the questionnaire between August 2014 and October 2014. ResultsBased on the obtained professional consultation and survey investigation, the framework of the financial support program was constructed. The suggested recipients were mothers with early labor pains, mothers who have been hospitalized for >  3  weeks, and mothers who used uterine stimulant Pitocin during hospitalization. All hospitalization, medication, and examination costs needed to be supported considering the income level of the recipient. ConclusionA basic policy for financially supporting high-risk pregnant women has been developed. The efficacy and feasibility of the policy needs to be carefully examined in future studies...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the efficacy of}} moxibustion between 34 and 38 weeks of gestation to facilitate the cephalic version of fetuses in breech presentation and the acceptability of this method by women. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in a Swiss university hospital maternity unit. We proposed to stimulate the acupoint BL 67 by moxibustion daily for 2 weeks for 212 consenting women between 34 and 36 weeks of gestation with a single fetus in breech presentation. We did the intervention three times weekly {{in the hospital and}} a teaching session and information leaflet on the technique for additional daily therapy at home. The control group received expectant management care. The availability of external cephalic version was maintained for both groups. The main outcome measure was the comparison of the proportion of women with cephalic presentation at delivery. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, except more nulliparous women were randomized to moxibustion. The percentage of versions was similar between groups: 18 % in the moxibustion group compared with 16 % in the control group (relative risk 1. 12, 95 % confidence interval 0. 62 to 2. 03). Adjustment for the imbalance in parity did not change these results. The frequency of cesarean delivery was similar (64 % compared with 58 % in the moxibustion group and the control group, respectively). Acceptability of the intervention and women's perceptions of moxibustion were favorable. CONCLUSION: We observed no beneficial effect of moxibustion to facilitate the cephalic version of fetuses in breech presentation.
