5|$|The Swedes {{were not}} {{popular in the}} regions that Sweden had gained at the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. With the new <b>war</b> <b>going</b> badly, insurgents saw their chance to rise up against the unpopular rule. Swedish response, {{especially}} in Scania, was more subtle than one might believe. An all out terror campaign would have been economically disastrous. Instead small patrols searching the woods were often employed combined with promises of carrots or sticks to the local farmers.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1918, {{with the}} <b>war</b> <b>going</b> against the Austrians, Radetzky was {{prepared}} {{to be transferred to}} the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 10 November 1918 — six days after the Austrian armistice — Yugoslav navy officers sailed the battleship out of Pola and surrendered it to a squadron of American submarine chasers. Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the transfer was not recognized; instead, Radetzky was given to Italy and broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|As a {{steamship}} line connecting northern {{cities and}} the south, the Old Bay Line hauled a considerable volume of freight between the two regions and their ships' cargo holds were filled with bales of cotton, produce, and other goods. When hostilities commenced, Southern ports were blockaded by the Federal Navy and the Old Bay Line was unable to serve Norfolk {{for the duration of}} the <b>war,</b> <b>going</b> no further south than Old Point Comfort. Passenger traffic as well as cargo shipping declined significantly. The Powhatan Line discontinued operations altogether between Norfolk and Richmond until the war's end.|$|E

5|$|In 1368, a Han Chinese revolt {{known as}} the Red Turban Rebellion toppled the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China. Zhu Yuanzhang then {{established}} the Ming dynasty, ruling as the Hongwu Emperor (r.1368–1398). It {{is not clear how}} much the early Ming court understood the civil <b>war</b> <b>going</b> on in Tibet between rival religious sects, but the first emperor was anxious to avoid the same trouble that Tibet had caused for the Tang dynasty. Instead of recognizing the Phagmodru ruler, the Hongwu Emperor sided with the Karmapa of the nearer Kham region and southeastern Tibet, sending envoys out in the winter of 1372–1373 to ask the Yuan officeholders to renew their titles for the new Ming court.|$|E

Following the handover to the United States Navy, she was briefly designated USS Zrínyi.

In 1380 he helped to negotiate the marriage of King Richard II to Anne of Bohemia.|$|E
25|$|The slaves, {{along with}} free gens de couleur and allies, {{continued}} their fight for independence. Jean-Jacques Dessalines defeated French troops at the Battle of Vertières on 18 November 1803, leading {{the first ever}} successful slave army revolution. In late 1803, France withdrew its remaining 7,000 troops from the island and Napoleon gave up his idea of re-establishing a North American empire. With the <b>war</b> <b>going</b> badly, he sold Louisiana (New France) to the United States, in the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E
25|$|With the <b>war</b> <b>going</b> {{badly for}} the British, Johnson found it {{difficult}} to enlist the support of the Six Nations, who were not eager to join a losing cause. In July 1758, he managed to raise 450 warriors {{to take part in a}} massive expedition led by the new British commander, General James Abercrombie. The campaign ended ingloriously with Abercrombie's disastrous attempt to take Fort Carillon from the French. Johnson and his Indian auxiliaries could do little as British forces stormed the French positions in fruitless frontal assaults.|$|E

25|$|An {{attack by}} Japan on the U.S. could not {{guarantee}} the U.S. would declare war on Germany. After such an attack, American public anger would {{be directed at}} Japan, not Germany, just as happened. The Tripartite Pact (Germany, Italy, Japan) called for each to aid another in defense; Japan could not reasonably claim America had attacked Japan if she struck first. For instance, Germany had been {{at war with the}} UK since 1939, and with the USSR since June 1941, without Japanese assistance. There had been a serious, if low-level, naval <b>war</b> <b>going</b> on in the Atlantic between Germany and the U.S. since summer of 1941, as well. Nevertheless, it was only Hitler's declaration of war on 11 December, unforced by treaty, that brought the U.S. into the European war.|$|E

Mr. Freeze and Clayface later encounter the Rogues when they land in their territory. Mr. Freeze tells Mirror Master II he is not interested in capitalizing on the bounty on their heads, only to use Weather Wizard to create optimal conditions for him to freeze Gotham. As the Rogues are fighting the two, Black Mask (alongside his False Face society) arrives to capture the Rogues to receive the bounty.|$|E

Confusion about the two Spocks allows the new Spock to defect to the Klingons. With the <b>war</b> <b>going</b> badly for Starfleet, the Enterprise travels to Organia to investigate.|$|E
500|$|The {{mobilisation}} {{of white}} British South Africa Police officers {{for military service}} led to black male and white female constables taking on higher responsibilities.

This [...] "Africanisation" [...] led to higher appreciation for black constables among senior policemen and the public. The police remained rigidly segregated, but black constables received uniforms more similar to those of their white counterparts, and the nominal distinction between the BSAP [...] "proper" [...] and the British South Africa Native Police—the [...] "force within the force" [...] black personnel were traditionally regarded as members of—was abolished.|$|E
