30|$|Resistant to <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise: The {{images in}} the AR {{database}} are also injected <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise to test the performance of different methods. <b>Salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise is composed by two noise components: <b>salt</b> noise <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise. <b>Salt</b> noise is the bright spot <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise is the darker spot, which generally appear in the image at the same time. The third row in Fig.  4 shows some samples injected <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise <b>with</b> different noise density d[*]=[*] 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.25. Table  5 lists the average recognition rates of different methods for face recognition under <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise. From the table, we can see that, compared with the Gaussian noise and the uniform noise, the recognition rates of the FLBP and NRLBPs drops much sharply when the images are injected <b>with</b> the <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise. Especially, when the noise level is higher than d[*]=[*] 0.15, the recognition rates of the FLBP and NRLBPs are even lover than 40 %. However, it is observed from Table  5 that our proposed method can still give some significant recognition results even when the face images are seriously polluted by this kind of noise.|$|R
