5|$|Link can {{transform}} at will into different creatures: the Deku Mask transforms Link into a Deku Scrub, the Goron Mask into a Goron, and the Zora Mask into a Zora. Each form features unique abilities: Deku Link can perform a spin attack, shoot bubbles from his mouth, skip on water, and fly {{for a short}} time by launching from Deku Flowers; Goron Link can roll at high speeds (and grow spikes at higher speeds), punch with deadly force, stomp the ground with his massive, rock-like body, walk in lava without taking damage, and <b>weigh</b> <b>down</b> heavy switches; Zora Link can swim rapidly, throw boomerang-like fins from his arms, generate a force field, and walk on the bottoms of bodies of water. Many areas can be accessed only by use of these abilities.|$|E
25|$|Only limited artefactual {{evidence}} survives of {{the users}} of Acheulean tools {{other than the}} stone tools themselves. Cave sites were exploited for habitation, but the hunter-gatherers of the Palaeolithic also possibly built shelters such as those identified in connection with Acheulean tools at Grotte du Lazaret and Terra Amata near Nice in France. The presence of the shelters is inferred from large rocks at the sites, {{which may have been}} used to <b>weigh</b> <b>down</b> the bottoms of tent-like structures or serve as foundations for huts or windbreaks. These stones may have been naturally deposited. In any case, a flimsy wood or animal skin structure would leave few archaeological traces after so much time. Fire was seemingly being exploited by Homo ergaster, and would have been a necessity in colonising colder Eurasia from Africa. Conclusive evidence of mastery over it this early is, however, difficult to find.|$|E
25|$|A {{break in}} the case came in 1998, when police noticed that broken {{concrete}} at Miracle Motors, a business owned by Karyn's ex-father-in-law Michael Slover Sr, were similar to concrete blocks used to <b>weigh</b> <b>down</b> Karyn's body. A forensic geologist {{was brought in to}} see if anything on the Slovers' business matched evidence found {{at the scene of the}} crime. The geologist found that not only was the concrete consistent with that found at Miracle Motors, but that evidence found in the abandoned car was also likely from Slover's business. The task force sifted through dirt at Miracle Motors and eventually discovered a metal rivet and a plastic button that fit a pair of Paris Club jeans and a white shirt that Karyn had been wearing the day of her murder. Police also reported finding bones at the scene, but these were not introduced to trial and were believed to have been animal meat bones that came from food fed to two dogs that Slover used to secure the property.|$|E

50|$|The {{second book}} of Dante's epic poem The Divine Comedy is {{structured}} around the seven deadly sins. The most serious sins, {{found at the}} lowest level, are the abuses of the most divine faculty. For Dante and other thinkers, a human's rational faculty makes humans more like God. Abusing that faculty with pride or envy <b>weighs</b> <b>down</b> the soul the most. Abusing one's passions with wrath {{or a lack of}} passion as with sloth also <b>weighs</b> <b>down</b> the soul {{but not as much as}} the abuse of one's rational faculty. Finally, abusing one's desires for to have one's physical needs met via greed, gluttony, or lust abuses a faculty that humans share with animals. This is still an abuse that <b>weighs</b> <b>down</b> the soul, but it does not <b>weigh</b> it <b>down</b> like other abuses. Thus, the top levels of the Mountain of Purgatory have the top listed sins, while the lowest levels have the more serious sins of wrath, envy, and pride.|$|R

25|$|His Geese Alighting on Water, painted at Enman'in, Ōtsu in 1767, is {{an early}} example of his mature style. The subject is treated {{as a part of}} nature; nothing {{philosophical}} is implied as had been done with such imagery in the East Asian tradition. Likewise, Kingfisher and Trout, painted in 1769, features a bird {{near the top of the}} image, waiting for a fish. The trout swims under a large rock near the center. Bird, fish, and stone all appear as they do in nature, creating a matter-of-fact, comprehensible, and natural-looking piece. Later in his oeuvre, Pine Trees in Snow, executed in 1773 for the wealthy Mitsui family, is realistic despite being in the Japanese idiom of ink on a gold background. The two six-panel screens show tree bark and pine needles separated by differing brush strokes, and the white snow seems to <b>weigh</b> <b>down</b> the branches. The bark is painted in the tsuketate technique, which uses no outlines, just dark and light shades to create the illusion of volume.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, he {{released}} his autobiography, Transformed, which was co-written by Peter Jeffs. It received generally positive reviews: Christianity Magazine said {{the book was}} a [...] "disarmingly honest account of Primus's triumphs and struggles {{on and off the}} pitch" [...] while FourFourTwo described it as [...] "an antidote to the 'me-me-me' tales that <b>weigh</b> <b>down</b> the shelves". Rival football magazine When Saturday Comes was more critical, pointing out its [...] "sometimes ungrammatical and often ponderous style" [...] and going on to say [...] " [...] book is also full of cliches".|$|E
500|$|Apollo 18 {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album 4 out of 5 stars {{and stated that}} it was more [...] "consistent" [...] than predecessors, making note of its darker tone. However, Erlewine also felt that the album was [...] "lacking a standout single". Robert Christgau, who assigned the album an A–, praised the first five tracks especially, asserting that the remaining thirty-three were more experimental in nature. Christgau acclaimed the album melodically, while stating that the lyrics were pleasant but [...] "meaningless". Ira Robbins, reviewing for Rolling Stone magazine, gave Apollo 18 4 out of 5 stars. Similar to Christgau, Robbins called the lyrics throughout the album [...] "whimsy", and said that they were not too complex to <b>weigh</b> <b>down</b> melodies. Robbins also praised the album's eclecticism, observing that Turn Around' mimics Forties swing; the funky bass groove of 'The Guitar' interpolates a rewrite of 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight', fetchingly sung by Laura Cantrell. Another wry science lesson, 'See the Constellation', mixes a psychedelic/New Wave potion for a bouncy space trip." [...] Robbins was critical of the disorganized [...] "Fingertips" [...] selections. A review by Craig Tomashoff, published in People, lauded the variety found in [...] "Fingertips". Tomashoff also made note of the wide vocabulary employed in the lyrics (citing, specifically, [...] "Turn Around" [...] and [...] "I Palindrome I"), concluding that the album was [...] "totally cool".|$|E

2500|$|No {{examples}} of Cucuteni-Trypillia textiles have yet been found – preservation of prehistoric textiles is rare {{and the region}} {{does not have a}} suitable climate. However, impressions of textiles are found on pottery sherds (because the clay was placed there before it was fired). These show that woven fabrics were common in Cucuteni-Trypillia society. Finds of ceramic weights with drilled holes suggest that these were manufactured with a warp-weighted loom. It has also been suggested that these weights, especially [...] "disposable" [...] examples made from poor quality clay and inadequately fired, were used to <b>weigh</b> <b>down</b> fishing nets. These would probably have been frequently lost, explaining their inferior quality.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1943, the {{pedestrian}} walkways {{were removed from}} the bridge allowing for vehicular traffic expansion by the creation of two more vehicular lanes. The project's primary goal was to reinforce the bridge with trusses after the Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster. The four lanes of roadway traffic were widened to six lanes and [...] high steel trusses were installed {{on both sides of the}} deck to <b>weigh</b> <b>down</b> and stiffen the bridge in an effort to reduce oscillation. These trusses detracted from the former streamlined looking span. In 2003, the Metropolitan Transit Authority restored the classic lines of the bridge by removing the stiffening trusses and installing fiberglass fairing along both sides of the road deck. The lightweight fiberglass fairing is triangular in shape giving it an aerodynamic profile [...] "that slices the wind as it passes over the bridge". The removal of the trusses and other changes to the decking cut the bridge's weight by 6,000 tons, some 25% of the mass suspended by the cables.|$|E
2500|$|In {{lieu of a}} 2009 series, Tennant {{appears as}} the Tenth Doctor, without a regular companion, in several special episodes {{over the course of}} 2008 and 2009, the last of which aired on New Year's Day, 2010. [...] In the Christmas special [...] "The Next Doctor", the Doctor mistakenly {{believes}} he has met a later incarnation of himself in an amnesiac Londoner (David Morrissey), with whom he saves Victorian-era London. [...] "Planet of the Dead" [...] (Easter 2009) features jewel thief Lady Christina de Souza (Michelle Ryan) as the Doctor's one-off companion, and the Doctor is presented with a prophecy of his imminent death. Tennant makes a crossover appearance in a The Sarah Jane Adventures two-parter, The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith, in which a powerful being known as the Trickster (Paul Marc Davis) also alludes to the Tenth Doctor's impending demise. In [...] "The Waters of Mars", the Doctor tries to alter history and avert the death of one-off companion Adelaide Brooke (Lindsay Duncan); when she commits suicide, he begins to feel his mortality <b>weigh</b> <b>down</b> upon him. In the animated serial Dreamland, the Doctor is joined by two one-off companions in 1950s Roswell, New Mexico. In the two-part send-off The End of Time, the Doctor confronts the Ood about their original prophecy and is led to contemporary Earth where, in the second part, the again-resurrected Master (Simm) restores Gallifrey and the Time Lords to existence, although he redeems himself by assisting the Doctor to defeat Time Lord President Rassilon (Timothy Dalton) before disappearing alongside the other Time Lords. The Doctor sacrifices his life to save Mott, exposing himself to 500,000 rads of deadly radiation and triggering his regeneration. He holds it back and is shown visiting several companions. He gives Donna a winning lottery ticket on her wedding day, buying it with money he borrowed from her late father in the past, saves Martha and Mickey from a Sontaran sniper, saves Sarah Jane's son Luke (Tommy Knight) from a car, introduces Jack to a romantic interest (Russell Tovey), and finally, just before regenerating into the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), he informs Rose in 2005 that she is about to have a [...] "great year". As he begins regenerating once in the TARDIS, his last words are [...] "I don't want to go".|$|E

2500|$|Scenes {{shot at the}} United Palace theater {{created new}} {{challenges}} for the series' stunt team due to {{not being able to}} drill holes in the historic building for creating anchors for wire rigs and other complex stunts. The crew had to find other ways to <b>weigh</b> <b>down</b> the equipment to remain safe for the actors and stunt doubles. For the explosion at the restaurant [...] "Genghis Connie's", a practical explosion was created in the storefront on location, which was extended with visual effects to show the destruction of the building. A set showing the inside of the rubble of the destroyed building was then created on a soundstage, while a lot was found that [...] "feels" [...] similar to the original location, where rubble could by piled and fire trucks could be brought to show the exterior. The lot was previously being used to store vehicles that had been seized as evidence, with the production having to negotiate with the NYPD to have the vehicles moved elsewhere. Looking back on the filming style of the season, and comparing it to the previous Marvel Netflix series, Weeks said,"You want it to feel like it's all in the same city, all in the same time frame, but you want each show, each character to feel a little different. Have its own visual identity. Some of that is lighting, and of course, some of that is production design and location work ... We embraced Harlem for exactly what it is. The color, the life, the activity on the streets. There's so much character to the neighborhood… I think it was important to feel that these characters were rooted in the real place". The series' production sound mixer Joshua Anderson, who worked on Daredevil and Jessica Jones as well, worked to capture as much sound on set with boom mics over lavaliers to ground the unbelievable elements of the series in [...] "naturalistic sound". He noted that Ali's Cottonmouth laugh and many of Colter's lines in particular sounded [...] "incredible on the boom". Anderson also talked about Luke Cage adding a new layer of sound that the other series did not—music. The captured sound had to be clear to be properly mixed in with music later, and live performances in Harlem's Paradise had to be recorded for which Anderson and his team had experience after working on the musical series Smash.|$|E
