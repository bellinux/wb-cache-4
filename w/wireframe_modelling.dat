50|$|Wireframing {{is one of}} {{the methods}} used in {{geometric}} <b>modelling</b> systems. A <b>wireframe</b> <b>model</b> represents the shape of a solid object with its characteristic lines and points. There are two types of wireframe modelling: Pro's and Con's. In Pro's user gives a simple input to create a shape. It is useful in developing systems. While in Con's <b>wireframe</b> <b>model,</b> it does not include information about inside and outside boundary surfaces. Today, <b>wireframe</b> <b>models</b> are used to define complex solid objects. The designer makes a <b>wireframe</b> <b>model</b> of a solid object, and then the CAD operator reconstructs the object, including detailed analysis. This technique has some advantages: generally the 3-dimensional solid objects are complex, but <b>wireframe</b> <b>models</b> can be viewed in 1 dimension, improving comprehensibility; the solid object can be modified further; the designer can ignore the geometry inside a surface while in solid modelling the designer has to give consistent geometry for all details; <b>wireframe</b> <b>models</b> require less memory space and CPU capacity.|$|R

40|$|Precise {{registration}} of a generic 3 D face {{model with a}} subject's face is a critical stage for model based analysis of facial expressions. In this study we propose a semi-automatic model fitting algorithm to fit a high-polygon <b>wireframe</b> <b>model</b> to a single image of a face. We manually mark important landmark points both on the <b>wireframe</b> <b>model</b> and the face image. We carry out an initial alignment by translating and scaling the <b>wireframe</b> <b>model.</b> We then translate the landmark vertices in the 3 D <b>wireframe</b> <b>model</b> so that they coincide with inverse perspective projections of image landmark points. The vertices that are not manually labeled as landmark are translated with a weighted sum of vectorial displacement of k neighboring landmark vertices, inversely weighted by their 3 D distances to the vertex under consideration. Our experiments indicate that we can fit a high-polygon model to the subject's face with modest computational complexity. Publisher's Versio...|$|R

Invalid profiles (those containing edges belonging to more than two loops) are searched for and successively removed. The final test is that of edge type.

40|$|In rapidly {{developing}} {{urban areas}} that include high-rise, large, and complex buildings, {{indoor and outdoor}} maps in GIS become a basis for utilizing and sharing information pertaining to {{various aspects of the}} real world.

Therefore, to facilitate fast and accurate construction of indoor GIS, this paper proposes a semi-automatic method consisting of preprocessing, 2 D mapping, and 3 D mapping stages. The preprocessing is designed to estimate heights of building interiors and to identify noise data from point clouds. In the 2 D mapping, a floor map is extracted with a tracing grid and a refinement method.

Since the middle of the twentieth century, 3 D human modeling technology has been widely studied and applied. During this period, many different implementations have emerged. The main human modeling methods can be summarized as follows: three-dimensional <b>wireframe</b> <b>model</b> [1], three-dimensional solid model [2, 3], three-dimensional surface model [4], and physics-based three-dimensional modeling [5]. The 3 D <b>wireframe</b> <b>model</b> was first used to represent virtual 3 D human <b>model.</b> The three-dimensional <b>wireframe</b> <b>model</b> simulates a three-dimensional human body shape from a combination of points, lines, arcs, and various parametric curves. Although the structure is simple and the operation is convenient, it conforms to the habit of people proofing. The three-dimensional solid modeling includes two parts: one part is the definition and description of voxels (cuboids, spheres, cylinders, cones, etc.), and the other part is the set of operations between voxels (combination, difference, intersection, etc.). Surface modeling mainly studies the mathematical description of a surface profile with a certain degree of smoothness. Surface modeling, also known as surface modeling, {{is one of the most}} commonly used human modeling methods. Surface modeling is used to fit partially discrete data points on a surface to get a smooth transition of the surface, so as to achieve the reconstruction of the original surface. It can provide three-dimensional body surface information, making hidden line elimination and realistic 3 D human model display. The modeling based on physical characteristics is to add physical characteristics of human body to its geometric model and simulate it through numerical calculation, and then, human behavior is determined automatically in the process of simulation.|$|R

Since roadside objects {{have to be}} maintained periodically, their 3 D models are useful for planning maintenance tasks. In our previous work, we proposed a method for detecting cylindrical poles and planar plates in a point-cloud. However, it is often required to further classify pole-like objects into utility poles, streetlights, traffic signals and signs, which are managed by different organizations. In addition, our previous method may fail to extract low pole-like objects, which are often observed in urban residential areas. In this paper, we propose new methods for extracting and classifying pole-like objects. In our method, we robustly extract {{a wide variety of}} poles by converting point-clouds into <b>wireframe</b> <b>models</b> and calculating cross-sections between <b>wireframe</b> <b>models</b> and horizontal cutting planes. For classifying pole-like objects, we subdivide a pole-like object into five subsets by extracting poles and planes, and calculate feature values of each subset.

40|$|An {{automated}} model-image fitting {{algorithm is}} proposed in this paper for generating façade texture image from pictures taken by smartphones or tablet PCs. The façade texture generation requires tremendous labour work and thus, has been the bottleneck of 3 D photo-realistic city modelling. With advanced developments of the micro electro mechanical system (MEMS), camera, global positioning system (GPS), and gyroscope (G-sensors) can all be integrated into a smartphone or a table PC. These sensors bring the possibility of direct-georeferencing for the pictures taken by smartphones or tablet PCs. Since the accuracy of these sensors cannot compared to the surveying instruments, the image position and orientation derived from these sensors are not capable of photogrammetric measurements. This paper adopted the least-squares model-image fitting (LSMIF) algorithm to iteratively improve the image’s exterior orientation. The image position from GPS and the image orientation from gyroscope are treated as the initial values. By fitting the projection of the <b>wireframe</b> <b>model</b> to the extracted edge pixels on image, the image exterior orientation elements are solved when the optimal fitting achieved.
