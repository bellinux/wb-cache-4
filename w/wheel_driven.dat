5|$|To {{protect and}} support the {{multitude}} of ships sailing for maritime interests into {{the waters of the}} East China Sea and Yellow Sea (to Korea and Japan), Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Red Sea, it was necessary to establish an official standing navy. The Song dynasty therefore established China's first permanent navy in 1132, with a headquarters at Dinghai. With a permanent navy, the Song were prepared to face the naval forces of the Jin on the Yangtze River in 1161, in the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi. During these battles the Song navy employed swift paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>driven</b> naval vessels armed with traction trebuchet catapults aboard the decks that launched gunpowder bombs. Although the Jin forces commanded by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing) boasted 70,000 men on 600 warships, and the Song forces only 3,000 men on 120 warships, the Song dynasty forces were victorious in both battles due to the destructive power of the bombs and the rapid assaults by paddle wheel ships. The strength of the navy was heavily emphasized after that. A century after the navy was founded it had grown in size to 52,000 fighting marines.|$|E
25|$|Trearne House {{had been}} built about 1870, almost on the 'footprint' of an older mansion house. Mr and Mrs Ralston-Patrick lived for some time in Burnhouse Manor until their new house was ready for them. By 1877 Mr and Mrs Ralston-Patrick {{were living in the}} new Trearne. Jenny Kerr was {{probably}} the last person born at Trearne Lodge; her mother was living there with her parents when her father was a Lieutenant in the Glasgow Highlanders, and was fighting in France during the first World War. Over Hessilhead was on the Trearne Estate along with Hessilhead, Townend of Hessilhead and an estate saw mill with its water <b>wheel</b> <b>driven</b> by the Dusk Water. During WW2 Trearne House was used by the army, following which it became Gresham House Boarding School. The school had a cook, a matron and five or six teachers up. There would be about thirty boys in the private boarding school, many of whom had parents who worked abroad.|$|E

60|$|The {{elevator}} was a Persian well wheel--a wheel squashed out {{thin and}} cased in a pipe, a <b>wheel</b> <b>driven</b> not by bullocks, but by much horse-power, licking up the grain {{at the rate}} of thou-sands of bushels the hour. And the wheat sunk into the fore-hatch while a man looked--sunk till the brown timbers of the bulkheads showed bare, and men leaped down through clouds of golden dust and shovelled the wheat furiously round the nose of the trunk, and got a steam-shovel of glittering steel and made that shovel also, till there remained of the grain not more than a horse leaves in the fold of his nose-bag.|$|E

50|$|Further, the 993's {{optional}} all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{system was}} refined over {{that of the}} 964. Porsche departed from the 964's setup consisting of three differentials and revised the system based on the layout from its 959 supercar, replacing the centre differential with a viscous coupling unit. In conjunction with the 993's redesigned suspension, this system improved handling characteristics in inclement weather and still retained the stability offered by all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> without having to suffer as many compromises as the past all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system. Its simpler layout also reduced the earlier all <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system's weight, though the four <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> C4 weighs 111 pounds (50 kg) more than the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> version (at 3,131 pounds vs. 3,020 pounds or 1,420 kg vs. 1,370 kg).|$|R
