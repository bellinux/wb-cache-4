500|$|Since the mid–1970s, {{references}} to Four Years Among the Cannibals {{have continued to}} appear in studies on New Guinea. In the 1990s, Detzner's work received some rehabilitation from ethnographer Terence Hays, who placed Detzner's work in its contemporary context: [...] Four Years Among the Cannibals, he wrote, [...] "paved the way for me [...] by creating romanticized images {{that served as a}} backdrop for more serious readings". [...] Since then, geographer Robert Linke has raised some important questions: [...] "Why did Detzner resort to lies to embellish his <b>wonderful</b> <b>story?</b> The unadorned truth would have been enough to establish him {{as one of the great}} figures in New Guinea history." [...] Detzner had remained at large for four years, as a fugitive in enemy-held territory: surely, Linke concluded, this was an exceptional feat. No doubt the Australians could have made a more broadly organized attempt to capture him, and probably would have succeeded, but they did not make the effort; they preferred instead the more convenient [...] "shoot-at-sight" [...] method. [...] "It is impossible", Linke wrote, [...] "not to admire his [...] sheer elan, his courage and tenacity." [...] In 2008, Detzner's book was retranslated, reprinted, and marketed as a modern translation of a rare and valuable book about the exploration of the New Guinean interior during World War I.|$|E

2500|$|After {{becoming}} a renowned author, Bianco wrote numerous other children's books, {{with her son}} becoming the namesake of one of them, 1925's Poor Cecco: The <b>Wonderful</b> <b>Story</b> of a Wonderful Wooden Dog Who Was the Jolliest Toy in the House Until He Went Out to Explore the World, about the interactions of children's toys {{with each other and}} with the human, animal, and toy members of the world beyond the toy cupboard. [...] A return to more sober themes marks Bianco's other popular works, such as the same year's The Little Wooden Doll, illustrated by her daughter Pamela, in which the title character is badly mistreated by some children, but shown love and compassion by another child, which made her whole again.|$|E

[...] "On the Trail of Dr. Cook," [...] published in three parts, is Rusk’s account of the Mazamas McKinley expedition. [...] "The Snow Peaks of the Cascades" [...] describes the various peaks of the Cascade Range. Rusk’s other book, Timberline Campfires, was never published except for one chapter, [...] "The <b>Wonderful</b> <b>Story</b> of Abe Lincoln," [...] published in the American Alpine Journal in 1946. His Mount Adams–Towering Sentinel of the Lower Columbia Basin promoted creating a national park protecting Mount Adams.|$|E
2500|$|Rusk’s {{father died}} in 1923 and Rusk moved back to Grants Pass. After the move, he started up his law {{practice}} again. In 1924, he wrote Tales of a Western Mountaineer, his only published book. Some time after his first book was published, Rusk wrote another book, Timberline Campfires. This collection of essays and short stories was never published except for one chapter, [...] "The <b>Wonderful</b> <b>Story</b> of Abe Lincoln," [...] {{which was published in}} the American Alpine Journal in 1946. After some time in Grants Pass, Rusk was appointed to the position of justice of the peace. He was known to be quite the prohibitionist and would [...] bootleggers. In addition to being justice of the peace, Rusk worked his father’s Lucky Spot mine on the weekends, walking 14 miles there and back. In 1930, Rusk attempted to organize an expedition to Mount St. Elias; however, no one else was able to go with him and he went by himself. During this expedition, he contracted a cold, which lingered and, according to Rusk, strained his heart. Rusk died of heart disease on February 2, 1931 in Grants Pass, Oregon. Rusk, about two months prior, requested that some members of the Cascadians take his ashes and place them in a cairn on The Castle of his beloved Mount Adams. Clarence Truitt and Clarence Starcher completed this request on July 27, 1931. This small monument remains today.|$|E
