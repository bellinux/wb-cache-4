This new currency, however, had a silver purity of about 52% for the period between 215 and 217 and an actual size ratio of 1antoninianus to 1.5denarii. This in effect made the antoninianus equal to about 1.5denarii. The reduced silver purity of the coins caused people to hoard the old coins that had higher silver content, making the inflation problem caused by the earlier devaluation of the denarii <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> had been before.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{has also}} often {{been accused of}} exaggerating the atrocities he {{described}} in the Indies, some scholars holding that the initial population figures given by him were too high, making the population decline look <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> actually was, and that epidemics of European disease were the prime cause of the population decline, not violence and exploitation. Demographic studies {{such as those of}} colonial Mexico by Sherburne F. Cook in the mid-20th century suggested that the decline {{in the first years of}} the conquest was indeed drastic – ranging between 80 and 90%, due of course to many different causes, but all ultimately traceable to the arrival of the Europeans. The overwhelming main cause was disease introduced by the Europeans. It has also been noted that exaggeration of numbers was the norm in writing in 16th-century accounts, and both contemporary detractors and supporters of Las Casas were guilty of similar exaggerations.|$|E

25|$|On March 4, 2007, Hansbrough had 26 {{points and}} 17 rebounds before {{suffering}} an injury that looked <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> really {{was in the}} closing seconds of the Tar Heels' 86–72 win over Duke, clinching the top seed in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. With 14.5 {{seconds left in the}} game, Hansbrough leaped for a layup. After the ball left his hand, he was struck in the face by Gerald Henderson's right elbow. The errant elbow broke Hansbrough's nose. Henderson was ejected from the game and received an automatic one-game suspension from the NCAA. Hansbrough went on to play with a nose-guard/face mask through the postseason, before taking it off {{in the second half of}} a game against Michigan State, in the second round of the 2007 NCAA tournament.|$|E
25|$|Emily {{attended}} the University of Deseret. For a time, {{she was a}} school teacher. In 1883, Grant asked Emily to marry him. Since she had not renounced her dislike for polygamy and he was already married to Lucy, that {{was in many ways}} a very daring move on his part, and she initially declined his request. Emily then {{had a change of heart}} and she and Grant married on May 27, 1884. Since the Edmunds Act had been enacted in 1882, the situation of Mormon polygamists was far <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> had been a decade earlier when Emily had first renounced polygamy. To avoid Grant having to go to prison on charges of unlawful cohabitation, Emily went to England to live at the LDS mission home to have her first child. She returned to the United States 16 months later and moved between multiple locations in Utah Territory and Idaho to avoid capture.|$|E
25|$|Martínez {{started the}} 2006 {{season at the}} top of his game. At the end of May, he was 5–1 with a 2.50 ERA, with 88 strikeouts and 17 walks and 44 hits allowed in 76 innings; Martínez's record was <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> could have been, with the Mets bullpen costing him two victories. However, during his May 26 start against the Florida Marlins, Martínez was {{instructed}} by the umpires to change his undershirt. He slipped in the corridor, injuring his hip, and his promising season curdled. The effect was not immediately apparent; although Martínez lost the Marlins game, his following start was a scintillating 0–0 duel with Arizona's Brandon Webb. But after that, beginning on June 6, Martínez went 4–7 with a 7.10 ERA in a series of spotty starts interrupted twice by stays on the disabled list. A right calf injury plagued him for the last two months of the season. After Martínez was removed from an ineffective September 15 outing, television cameras found him in the Mets dugout, apparently crying. Subsequent MRI exams revealed a torn muscle in Martínez's left calf, and a torn rotator cuff. Martínez underwent surgery which sidelined him for most of the 2007 season.|$|E

500|$|Randy Miller III, in {{his review}} of the Blu-ray release of the second season for DVD Talk, said that the memory of this season was <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> {{actually}} was. He criticised the studio's instance at stand-alone episodes but {{said that there was}} a marked improvement about halfway through the season, calling the finale [...] "game-changing". He added {{that at the time of}} the DVD release, he did not feel so positively towards the season and agreed with Holly Ordway's opinion at the time.

500|$|Baen's successors, Pierce, Stine, and Kemske, {{were unable}} to {{maintain}} his standard. Pohl remained loyal to the magazine, but the serialization of his novel Jem exemplified Galaxys growing problems. Due to the magazine's increasingly erratic schedule, the serialization stretched from the last issue of 1978 into 1980, well after it had appeared in book form. [...] In November 1977, Paul Walker took over the book column from Spider Robinson, and Jerry Pournelle left the science column {{at the end of}} 1978. [...] The artwork quality dropped to an amateurish level, and despite the appearance of a few successful stories and novels, such as C. J. Cherryh's The Faded Sun: Kesrith, the overall quality was dramatically <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> had been under Baen. [...] Galaxys deterioration was largely due to the financial troubles of the publisher, Arnold Abramson, who reduced the pay rate (at a time of high inflation) to a penny a word. [...] Even that low rate did not guarantee timely disbursement, and many writers stopped submitting because of Galaxys reputation for paying slowly, if at all. [...] Costs were increasing for paper, postage, and production, and the paperback anthology market was booming, adding to the competition that Galaxy faced. [...] Floyd Kemske's only issue never received newsstand distribution, doomed by the financial troubles of the magazine's publisher, Vincent McCaffrey.|$|E

500|$|An {{executive}} for Frontline Studios stated that major publishers were wary of releasing exclusive titles for the Wii, {{due to the}} perception that third-party companies were not strongly supported by consumers. In his blog, 1UP.com editor Jeremy Parish stated that Nintendo was the biggest disappointment for him in 2007. Commenting {{on the lack of}} quality third-party support, he stated that [...] "the Wii landscape is bleak. <b>Worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> was on N64. Worse than on GameCube...the resulting third-party content is overwhelmingly bargain-bin trash." [...] The Globe and Mail and Forbes noted that the Wii had few successful third-party titles compared to its rivals (due, in part, to its weaker hardware). Third-party developers often skipped the Wii instead of making games for all three consoles simultaneously ("blockbusters like the Call of Duty franchise either never arrive on Nintendo hardware or show up in neutered form"). Forbes observed that of the most successful games of 2011 ( [...] , Mass Effect 3, Portal 2, L.A. Noire, Battlefield 3, [...] ), although all were released for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, only Modern Warfare 3 received a Wii version which was also the least positively received port of the game. The lack of third-party games may be exacerbated in the future, as Nintendo faces the [...] "dilemma of having fallen out of sync with its rivals in the console cycle"; Microsoft and Sony would design their consoles to be more powerful than the Wii U. Strong third-party titles are seen as a key sign of a gaming console's health.|$|E

2500|$|Further REBT {{generally}} {{posits that}} disturbed evaluations {{to a large}} degree occur through over-generalization, wherein people exaggerate and globalize events or traits, usually unwanted events or traits or behavior, out of context, while almost always ignoring the positive events or traits or behaviors. For example, awfulizing is partly mental magnification of the importance of an unwanted situation to a catastrophe or horror, elevating the rating of something from bad to <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> should be, to beyond totally bad, worse than bad to the intolerable and to a [...] "holocaust". The same exaggeration and overgeneralizing occurs with human rating, wherein humans come to be arbitrarily and axiomatically defined by their perceived flaws or misdeeds. Frustration intolerance then occurs when a person perceives something to be too difficult, painful or tedious, and by doing so exaggerates these qualities beyond one's ability to cope with them.|$|E
