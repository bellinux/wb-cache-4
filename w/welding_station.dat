The frame is moved to a second <b>welding</b> <b>station</b> for further welding by robots. The third and final welding stage is completed by human welders. To ensure quality, welds are tested using an ultrasonic flaw detector. In total, 275 lbs kg of welding wire is used to join the individual castings into a monolithic frame.|$|E
50|$|In {{areas where}} the water is very deep, the S-lay system may not be {{appropriate}} because the pipeline leaves the stinger to go almost straight down. To avoid sharp bending {{at the end of}} it and to mitigate excessive sag bending, the tension in the pipeline would have to be high. Doing so would interfere with the vessel's positioning, and the tensioner could damage the pipeline. A particularly long stinger could be used, but this is also objectionable since that structure would be adversely affected by winds and currents. The J-lay system, one of the latest generations of lay-barge, is better suited for deep water environments. In this system, the pipeline leaves the vessel on a nearly vertical ramp (or tower). There is no overbend - only a sagbend of catenary nature (hence the J notation), such that the tension can be reduced. The pipeline is also less exposed to wave action as it enters the water. However, unlike for the S-lay system, where pipe welding can be done simultaneously at several locations along the vessel deck's length, the J-lay system can only accommodate one <b>welding</b> <b>station.</b> Advanced methods of automatic welding are used to compensate for this drawback.|$|E

The objective of the present work was to study the mitigation of air pollutants at <b>welding</b> <b>stations,</b> using different ventilation scenarios. Four air pollutants including iron oxide, respirable dust, ozone, and carbon monoxide were measured during four different ventilation scenarios using US OSHA and US NIOSH sampling and analysis methods. Meantime, face velocity, volumetric airflow rates, duct velocity, static, and velocity pressures at different locations of the ventilation systems were also measured using BS 1042 standard methods. The paired t-test revealed that with p< 0. 05 {{there was a significant}} difference between occupational exposure to air pollutants in 4 different ventilation scenarios. The results also showed that when local and general ventilation systems were both on, the occupational exposure to iron oxide and carbon monoxide were below than their TLVs, but the exposure to the respirable dust in two <b>welding</b> <b>stations</b> and ozone levels in three <b>welding</b> <b>stations</b> were higher than their respective TLVs. The duct air velocity in three <b>welding</b> <b>stations</b> is higher and in eight stations lower than 10. 1 m/s recommended by ACGIH. The mean value of volumetric airflow rates in all 11 stations were 34. 7 % of the required volumetric airflow rates based on standard ventilation systems recommended value. The applied general exhaust ventilation was only 35. 5 % of standard required value. The local exhaust ventilation is expected to mitigate the air pollutants to acceptable levels at <b>welding</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R

50|$|In the S-lay system, the {{pipeline}} assembly is {{done at the}} installation site, on board a vessel that has all the equipment required for joining the pipe segments: pipe handling conveyors, <b>welding</b> <b>stations,</b> X-ray equipment, joint-coating module, etc. The S notation refers {{to the shape of}} {{the pipeline}} as it is laid onto the seabed. The pipeline leaves the vessel at the stern or bow from a supporting structure called a stinger that guides the pipe's downward motion and controls the convex-upward curve (the overbend). As it continues toward the seabed, the pipe has a convex-downward curve (the sagbend) before coming into contact with the seabed (touch down point). The sagbend is controlled by a tension applied from the vessel (via tensioners) in response to the pipeline's submerged weight. The pipeline configuration is monitored so that it will not get damaged by excessive bending. This on-site pipeline assembly approach, referred to as lay-barge construction, is known for its versatility and self-contained nature - despite the high costs associated with this vessel's deployment, it is efficient and requires relatively little external support. But it may have to contend with severe sea states - these adversely affect operations such as pipe transfer from supply boats, anchor-handling and pipe welding. Recent developments in lay-barge design include dynamic positioning and the J-lay system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Modern {{production}} {{plants are}} highly automated complex systems consisting of several robots and other working machines. Errors leading to damage and stop of production are extremely expensive {{and must be}} avoided by all means. Hence, the state of practice is to test control programs in advance which implies high effort and comes with high costs. To increase the confidence into the control systems and to reduce the necessary effort, this paper proposes to use model checking to verify certain properties. It presents a compiler that can transform industrial robot programs into PROMELA models. Since the statements of the robot programming language can not be mapped directly into PROMELA statements, we apply compiler optimization techniques to close the semantic gap. In case of a specification violation the trace is mapped to the original context so that the robot programmer can reconstruct the problem. As a case study we applied the tool to verify the absence of collisions and deadlocks. We were able to detect one deadlock in a car-body <b>welding</b> <b>station</b> with 9 robots, correct the program and verify the correctness of the resulting system...|$|E

Furthermore, the aim is to help improve the company's work with 5 S and TPM (Total Productive Maintenance). A combination of tools and concepts are being used in this project when generating improvement proposals to avoid the risk of falling back into old habits and facilitate the work. The combination of concepts, intends to be continued to work with, in order to facilitate for the company to reach even higher results. The methodology of TPM is the basis of the project, although it is not about a complete implementation of TPM, but is limited to chosen parts since it is a time consuming process that can go on for years. The main focus of TPM is about the first pillar, 5 S. Action plans for how to solve these problems and how to achieve the desired state has been established. Thereafter, the researchers in cooperation with the company´s staff have implemented a couple of small improvement proposals. Further improvement proposals have also been presented in this report, but due to the limited time no implementations was made. Moreover, this project is divided into a couple of phases. Situational analysis has been made through both interviews with staff and observation studies. Analysis has also been made by some numeric data taken out by researchers and partly through mapping the equipment. The intention of this is to create a status image of the current situation over the hand <b>welding</b> <b>station.</b> The current state has shown the appearance of problems and challenges that exist. Additional wastages and disturbances in the station can come up to the surface and can thus easily be identified.

Another method that occurs is spaghetti charts. It has been used for mapping up the existing procedures during the process of the orders in the station, and by that identified different types of disturbances.

Important success factors during {{the design process}} are typically the abilities to identify and manage risks, develop mitigation plans, and conduct timely proactive problem solving. The work reported in this paper is part of research addressing methods for how the design process can be supported by using virtual representations of the factory environments captured with 3 D laser scanning. This support is evaluated in an industrial study of one industrialization project in the manufacturing industry. The industrialization project follows the process to design layout, work places, and plan for installation of new equipment to create a production system within a refurbished shop floor area.

The research approach and its questions investigate the benefits of combining the lean principles to design and development of production systems using a realistic visualization, which include systematic risk analysis and problem solving as important activities. The result shows that visualization support gave a great advantage to identify the possible risks and problems, which resulted in higher confidence and substantial timesaving in planning and execution of the industrialization project...|$|R
