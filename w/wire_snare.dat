The large mammal fauna, now almost gone in West Africa, is still present, although threatened by commercial bushmeat (and some ivory) hunting. Local people in the area have few other activities that bring in money: profits on the small-scale agricultural products grown in the area are much lower than those gained by selling meat. The main methods of commercial hunting are thick <b>wire</b> <b>snares</b> aimed at the larger ungulates, and gun hunting, although small game hunting is carried out using thin <b>wire</b> <b>snares</b> near the villages (often outside the Park border). Conservation success will depend on reducing the levels of large mammal hunting in the area, and encouraging local people to see the wildlife of the Park as a potential for the future, not just today.|$|R

40|$|Hunting with <b>wire</b> <b>snares</b> is rife within many {{tropical}} forest systems, and constitutes {{one of the}} severest threats {{to a wide range}} of vertebrate taxa. As for all threats, reliable monitoring of snaring levels is critical for assessing the relative effectiveness of management interventions. However, snares pose a particular challenge in terms of tracking spatial or temporal trends in their prevalence because they are extremely difficult to detect, and are typically spread across large, inaccessible areas. As with cryptic animal targets, any approach used to monitor snaring levels must address the issue of imperfect detection, but no standard method exists to do so. We carried out a field experiment in Keo Siema Wildlife Sanctuary in Eastern Cambodia with the following objectives: (1) To estimate the detection probably of <b>wire</b> <b>snares</b> within a {{tropical forest}} context, and to investigate how detectability might be affected by habitat type, snare type or observer. (2) To trial two sets of sampling protocols feasible to implement in a range of challenging field conditions. (3) To conduct a preliminary assessment of two potential analytical approaches to dealing with the resulting snare encounter data. We found that although different observers had no discernible effect on detection probability, detectability did vary between habitat type and snare type. We contend that simple repeated counts carried out at multiple sites and analyzed using binomial mixture models could represent a practical yet robust solution to the problem of monitoring snaring levels both inside and outside of protected areas. This experiment represents an important first step in developing improved methods of threat monitoring, and such methods are greatly needed in Southeast Asia, as well as in as many other regions. </p...|$|R

50|$|Snares were {{originally}} made with small vines. Later rope or twine was used.Snares are now made of wire or cable, usually 2mm to 8 mm. The snares {{are placed in}} the trails or runways of animals. The loop of the snare is several inches above the ground {{depending on the size}} of the animal. The snare is wired to a small tree. Bait is placed near the snare so that as the animal moves forward, it places its head through the snare. As the animal moves forward the <b>wire</b> <b>snare</b> tightens, choking the animal.Snares are also made using a small sapling about ten feet high. The tree is bent over with a string or wire being tied to the tree and to a stick. The stick is placed under another stick in the ground. This stick is attached to the snare loop. When the animal goes through the snare loop and pulls, the stick becomes dislodged and the animal is hoisted into the air, four to five feet above the ground. Most predators can not reach the rabbit in the air.|$|E

These differences tend to give the pipe drums a [...] "snappier" [...] snare sound, emphasizing the higher frequencies of the drum. Recently, corps-style drums have been produced with steel <b>wire</b> <b>snares</b> underneath the batter head (while remaining the gut snares under the bottom head).

It includes her <b>wire</b> <b>snare</b> removal work with colleagues called in to dart well-known injured elephants using a Tranquillizer gun. It also features Pincott's work recommending and encouraging President Robert Mugabe to reaffirm his commitment to this flagship clan of elephants, which bears his identity, in an effort to secure their future. The subsequent 'Presidential Decree Reaffirmation' ceremony, attended by then-Minister of the Environment Francis Nhema on behalf of President Robert Mugabe, was held in Hwange in August 2011 and was included in the filming. All the President's Elephants premiered at the 2012 Durban International Film Festival, where it was considered among the best on show. During an interview with Pincott in 2013 ScreenAfrica - Africa's leading broadcast and film publication - called the film [...] "touching and profound...beautifully emphasising the deep relationship between Pincott and the elephants". This documentary focusing on Pincott's wild elephant work and relationships won 'Outstanding Contribution to Nature' in 2013, with the judges commenting how [...] "very moving" [...] it was [...] "to see how closely people and elephants can be mentally connected", and expressing their respect and appreciation for Pincott's elephant conservation work. Among other nominations and selections including 'Best TV Wildlife Program' at the South African Film and Television Awards 2013, it was shortlisted as a finalist in the prestigious 2016 International Elephant Film Festival - where the world's best elephant films from the previous nine years were celebrated. This event, which involved both the United Nations (UN) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), was organised to raise global awareness of the various challenges facing the African and Asian elephants, as a highlight of UN World Wildlife Day 2016. The distinguished panel of international judges included the United States Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, South Africa's Minister of Environmental Affairs and the Director-General of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Occasionally, it is {{difficult}} to design an appropriate treatment plan for central-type lung cancer. We present the usefulness of combined treatment with a bronchoscopic electrocautery <b>wire</b> <b>snare</b> prior to wedge bronchoplastic lobectomy for patients with central-type lung cancer. Presentation of case: A 64 -year-old man, who was a long-term corticosteroid user, complicated with left obstructive pneumonia. Chest CT scan showed total atelectasis of the left lung due to obstruction of the left main bronchus by an endobronchial tumor, which protruded from the left lower lobe. He was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of c-T 3 N 0 M 0 Stage IIB. Endobronchial tumor resection of the left main bronchus was initially performed, which resulted in an improvement of the patient’s symptoms; the patient’s pulmonary function was evaluated and bronchial extension of the tumor was also observed. He subsequently underwent elective bronchoplastic left lower lobectomy and lymphadenectomy, with no recurrence 2 years after surgery. Discussion: A variety of therapeutic bronchoscopic intervention are available for the treatment of advanced central-type lung cancer. The effectiveness of endobronchial electrocautery using the snare wire has been reported for the treatment of respiratory tract tumors, which allowed planning of the following treatment procedure. Conclusion: The combination of a bronchoscopic electrocautery <b>wire</b> <b>snare</b> and bronchoplastic surgical procedure was useful for the treatment of central-type lung cancer such as in our case...|$|E
40|$|Epiglottic {{entrapment}} can {{be associated}} with poor performance in- and exspiratory stertor and occasionally with coughing (Honnas and Wheat 1988; Robertson, 1991; Lumsden et al., 1994; Lumsden at al. 1995). But it can also be an incidental finding (Ferraro, 1990). A 14 year old Trakehner stallion was presented to the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Zurich with a history of an abnormal inspiratory noise increasing with exercise. The general physical examination showed no abnormalities. By endoscopy during exercise on a high-speed treadmill the diagnosis of intermittent epiglottic entrapment could be made. Therapy consisted of two transendoscopic surgeries two days apart. In the first session subepiglotteal tissue was resected via a transoral approach, in a second session the aryepiglottic folds were partly removed. Both manipulations were performed electrosurgically with a <b>wire</b> <b>snare</b> in the standing, sedated horse and local anaesthesia of the mucosal membranes. No medication was given after surgery. The horse was fed fresh gras and was walked daily for 15 minutes for one week. Six days after the second surgery no abnormalities on general physical examination and during an endoscopy at rest were present. By exercise endoscopy on the treadmill the Epiglottic entrapment could not be induced any more neither at the same or at higher exercise intensities than before surgery. The main advantages of the surgical technique used in this case are the easy to perform procedure, minimal trauma by the transoral approach and a short reconvalescence period...|$|E

The study employed both the primary and the secondary data sources. The questionnaires were used to collect data from officers and the discussion with relevant officials was conducted. A total 90 local community members were interviewed from the three countries. The secondary data were collected from management of Mgahinga National Park, Parc Nationaux des Volcano of Rwanda, Parc National des Virunga IGCP staff and crossection of protected areas stakeholders and government institutions of the three countries. The Results indicated that regarding the collaborative management between the three authorities, it was found out that information exchange and joint patrol were the major activities.

60|$|The fox {{whose life}} has been spent on the hillsides {{surrounding}} a New England village seems to have profited by generations of experience. He is much more cunning every way than the fox of the wilderness. If, for instance, a fox has been stealing your chickens, your trap must be very cunningly set if you are to catch him. It will not do to set it near the chickens; no inducement will be great enough to bring him within yards of it. It must be set well back in the woods, near one of his regular hunting grounds. Before that, however, you must bait the fox with choice bits scattered over a pile of dry leaves or chaff, sometimes for a week, sometimes for a month, till he comes regularly. Then smoke your trap, or scent it; handle it only with gloves; set it in the chaff; scatter bait as usual; and you have one chance of getting him, while he has still a dozen of getting away. In the wilderness, on the other hand, he may be caught with half the precaution.
