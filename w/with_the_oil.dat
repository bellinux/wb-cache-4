5|$|In October 2012, an ICSID {{tribunal}} {{awarded a}} judgment of $1.8 billion for Occidental Petroleum {{against the government}} of Ecuador. Additionally, Ecuador had to pay $589 million in backdated compound interest {{and half of the}} costs of the tribunal, making its total penalty around $2.4 billion. The South American country annulled a contract <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> firm {{on the grounds that it}} violated a clause that the company would not sell its rights to another firm without permission. The tribunal agreed the violation took place but judged that the annulment was not fair and equitable treatment to the company.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1989, Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi founded Braathens Helikopter. The {{shipping}} company had {{signed an agreement}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> companies Norsk Hydro, Phillips Petroleum and Statoil to provide helicopter transport for their crews to their offshore oil installations Ekofisk, Oseberg, Gullfaks, Veslefrikk. This {{was the first time}} the incumbent Helikopter Service had received competition on their offshore helicopter services. The initial agreement secured Braathens Helikopter a revenue of NOK800 million in the course of five years, and gave the company a 20% market share. Four 19-seet Aérospatiale Super Puma helicopters were ordered, each costing NOK60 million. Total investment costs were NOK300 million. Two helicopters were stationed at Stavanger Airport, Sola and two at Bergen Airport, Flesland. The initial contract involved flying 10,000 passengers per year.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Giro {{featured}} {{an assortment}} of contenders for the overall victory. Defending champion Danilo Di Luca had faced potential bans which would have {{kept him out of}} the race, after investigations into his involvement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oil</b> for Drugs scandal and an irregular doping test given after stage 17 of the 2007 Giro d'Italia, either of which could have resulted in a two-year suspension. Though he was suspended for three months because of Oil for Drugs, he was cleared by the Italian National Olympic Committee of any wrongdoing in the 2007 Giro, and was thus permitted to start.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} time {{anything}} other than a canoe or other oar-powered vessel had sailed into Lake Huron, and La Salle's voyage was thus germinal in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes. Located in the natural harbour, the Sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products. The natural port and the salt caverns that exist in the surrounding areas, together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 led to the massive growth of the petroleum industry in this area. Because Oil Springs {{was the first}} place in Canada and North America to drill commercially for oil, the knowledge that was acquired there led to oil drillers from Sarnia travelling the world teaching other nations how to drill for oil.|$|E

25|$|The Dorniers were {{subsequently}} mostly used for charters with oil companies, with Statoil being a dominant customer.

25|$|In 1969, an English {{translation}} {{was released}} of the Rite of Baptism for Children (later amended 1984).

25|$|Egg {{emulsion}} sauces include mayonnaise, Hollandaise and Béarnaise. For hollandaise sauce, {{egg yolks}} and water, lemon juice or vinegar are emulsified. Unlike custard, the egg does not coagulate. An emulsion {{is a mixture}} of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible (unmixable or unblendable). Droplets of the butter become suspended in the water and lemon juice once emulsion occurs. While emulsions can be either stable or unstable, hollandaise is made stable by the addition of eggs which contain lecithin, combining <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> and water, holding it together.|$|E

25|$|The {{intensified}} {{power struggle}} between {{oil companies and}} host governments in Middle East, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> price shocks that followed the 1973 oil crisis meant British Petroleum lost most of its direct access to crude oil supplies produced in countries {{that belonged to the}} Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and prompted it to diversify its operations beyond the heavily Middle East dependent oil production. In 1976, BP and Shell de-merged their marketing operations in the United Kingdom by dividing Shell-Mex and BP. In 1978 the company acquired a controlling interest in Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio).|$|E
25|$|In recent years, the University's {{campus in}} Edinburgh has benefitted from major infrastructural {{projects}} worth £60 million, with another £68 million worth investment announced. These include the UK's first purpose built graduate centre (£6 million), Scotland's elite Oriam Sports Performance Centre facility (£33 million), and the UK's first FlexBIO flexible downstream bioprocessing centre (£2 million). It is also constructing a 5,000m² Watt Innovation Building for £19 million to boost ‘creativity and ideas generation’ on the University's growing Edinburgh campus, and {{has plans to}} host a major £65 million film studio and a £2.5 million academic partnership <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> and gas firm TOTAL.|$|E
25|$|Newspapers {{were quick}} to {{publicize}} the issue. The injustice of the South Improvement scheme outraged many independent oil producers and owners of refineries. Rogers led the opposition among the New York refiners. The New York interests formed an association, and about the middle of March 1872 sent a committee of three, with Rogers as head, to Oil City to consult <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oil</b> Producers' Union. Working with the Pennsylvania independents, Rogers and the New York delegation managed to forge {{an agreement with the}} railroads, whose leaders eventually agreed to open their rates to all and promised to end their shady dealings with South Improvement.|$|E

25|$|The main {{theological}} {{issue in}} these texts {{is that of}} the consequences of the Fall of Man, of which sickness and death are mentioned. Other themes include the exaltation of Adam in the Garden, the fall of Satan, the anointing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> of the Tree of Life, and a combination of majesty and anthropomorphism in the figure of God, involving numerous merkabahs and other details that show a relationship with 2 Enoch. While the idea of resurrection of the dead is present, there is no idea of Messianism, a fact that lends strong support to the theory of a Jewish origin. The Life of Adam and Eve is also important {{in the study of the}} early Seth traditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{third wave}} took off due to rapid {{economic}} growth related to the intensified hydrocarbon exploration in the region. This led {{to the discovery of}} large quantities of crude oil. Although oil had already been discovered in GCC region during the beginning of the 20th century, the economic benefits of the oil resources were properly actualised during the 1960s and 1970s, as the GCC countries officially gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1971. The author Al Shehabi further argues that a capitalist approach to the economy became increasingly more dominant in the GCC region during this time period. Together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> boom, it constituted an important factor explaining the importation of migrant workers and economic development.|$|E
25|$|Recently, Douglas {{has moved}} to {{photographic}} works which do not depict {{the history of the}} site of the narrative in an installation but rather are used as a contrast to a different work. His photographic series Every Building on 100 West Hastings from 2001 is a depiction of a stretch of a run-down section of Vancouver that is about to be gentrified. The photographs accompanied the installation Journey into Fear (also 2001), which is based on Norman Foster's 1942 war-time thriller of the same name and its remake, shot in Vancouver in 1975 and directed by Daniel Mann.
