Para isto, este estudo teve como base um painel de dados n??o balanceado, com informa????es de 222 companhias brasileiras n??o financeiras com a????es listadas na BM&FBOVESPA e presentes na Base de Dados Compustat, durante um per??odo de 11 anos (2000 a 2010), totalizando 2. 278 observa????es. Foram testadas diferentes vari??veis, utilizando-se modelos de regress??es lineares de complexidades distintas. A partir dos resultados da regress??o final, gerada pelo Painel Din??mico, foram identificados dez fatores determinantes da necessidade de capital de giro corporativa, todos significantes. O modelo evidencia a import??ncia da NCG do ano {{anterior}} na explica????o da NCG do ano corrente e mostra que empresas maiores, com vendas mais vol??teis, maior fluxo de caixa livre, maior ??ndice de endividamento e em dificuldades financeiras adotam uma necessidade de capital de giro proporcionalmente reduzida, tornando-se mais eficientes na sua gest??o do capital de giro. Por outro lado, as evid??ncias mostram que uma maior margem de contribui????o, um maior ??ndice market-to-book e a presen??a de remunera????o anual vinculada ao lucro levam a um aumento da necessidade de capital de giro corporativa. Al??m disso, os resultados sugerem que um menor risco pa??s encoraja o investimento em capital de giro, evidenciando que fatores ex??genos a empresa tamb??m determinam o volume da sua NCG. Assim, esta disserta????o pretende contribuir com pesquisas futuras, visto que ?? a primeira a investigar os determinantes do investimento l??quido em capital de giro operacional sob a ??tica de quatro teorias robustas de finan??as. This thesis aims {{to identify}} and analyze the determinants of the <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> corporate, from robust theories of finance (Theory of Asymmetric Information, Agency Theory, Pecking Order Theory and Theory of Financial Distress) and empirical studies that also had as object the WCR. Therefore, this study {{was based on a}} panel data unbalanced, with information of 222 Brazilian companies non-financial with stocks listed on the BM&FBOVESPA and presents in Compustat Database, for a period of 11 years (2000 to 2010), totaling 2278 observations. We tested different variables, using linear regression models of different complexities. From the results of the final regression, generated by Dynamic Panel, ten factors determinants of the <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> corporate were identified, all significants. The model evidences the importance of WCR last year in explaining the WCR this year and shows that larger companies, with more volatile sales, higher free cash flow, higher debt ratio and financially distressed adopt a <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> proportionally reduced, making it more efficient in its management of working capital. Moreover, the evidence shows that a higher contribution margin, a higher rate market-to-book and the presence of annual compensation tied to earnings lead to an increased <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> corporate. Furthermore, the results suggest that a lower country risk encourages investment in working capital, showing that company exogenous factors also determine the volume of your WCR. Thus, this thesis aims to contribute to future research, since it is the first to investigate the determinants of the net investment in operating working capital from the perspective of four robust theories of finance...|$|E

A {{clear understanding of the}} complex relationship between corporate investments and liquidity could help firms to gain benefits from growth opportunities. While the study supports several previous studies on the sensitivity of investments to liquidity, it more importantly contributes to the literature on working capital by showing the dual-role of working capital in relation to corporate investments.

The model incorporates a <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> and the Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009) preference that allows for flexible parameterization of the strength of income effects on labor supply. The model can account for the high volatility of wage and consumption relative to output and countercyclical trade balances that characterize emerging market economies. During economic downturns, rising interest rates in emerging markets induce relatively large income effects on labor supply, so households would not reduce their labor input as much even though wages drop significantly.
