5|$|A video by Ken McCallum, a {{cameraman}} for Channel4 News, was broadcast on 8 April. Shot {{from a different}} angle, the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to head height before bringing the baton down on Tomlinson's legs. McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but recorded by the camera. Half an hour later Alex Thomson, chief correspondent of Channel4 News, was doing a live broadcast <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> was damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is when they saw that Tomlinson's assault was on it.|$|E
5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E

5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E

500|$|From a {{technical}} point of view, critics regarded Ninja Gaiden and Black {{as the best}} of the available Xbox software at the time; the console hardware had been pushed to its limits without showing significant drops in performance. GameSpot's Kasavin was impressed with their [...] "first-rate presentation" [...] and said that no other games at that time came close in visuals and audio. According to IGN, the games could [...] "make [...] momentarily forget about the next generation of consoles". Both Ninja Gaiden and Black were top-sellers, which led to them being compatible with the Xbox 360 for all regions on the new platform's release. Ninja Gaiden attracted criticism for the way on-screen action is framed by the game's camera. The default camera system centers the action on Ryu and his surroundings, but reviewers were frustrated by occasions <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> locked on to part of the scenery, thus losing track of Ryu. [...] Tecmo attempted to address this with the introduction of manual camera controls in the Hurricane Packs, [...] and most critics judged that either the camera frame was usually acceptable, or that Ninja Gaiden was a good enough game that its flaws could be overlooked.|$|E

On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in [...] "Stick", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in [...] "The Ones We Leave Behind" [...] when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect {{was going to be in}} [...] "Daredevil" [...] <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together.

500|$|Character {{designs were}} created by Mutsumi Inomata. A key element of the designs was the {{variation}} of time periods many characters came from. To make the character sprites {{as close as possible}} to the original artwork, the team took Inomata's artwork and turned them into 2D [...] "dot-by-dot" [...] sprite pictures. This gave the sprites roughly four times the detail of most environments. They then built the world around the sprites. The sprite details sometimes caused problems, as they would appear larger than the environments <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> zoomed in. The animated cutscenes {{were created by}} anime company Production I.G. The game's opening was the longest ever created for a Tales game up to that point. While many contemporary PS2 role-playing games were being developed around three-dimensional characters, Destiny 2 used two-dimensional sprites for its characters. Part of the reason behind this was that the development team wanted to create the [...] "ultimate 2D RPG". As opposed to previous Tales games, where gameplay development was focused on the battle system, the development leads requested that the gameplay should be [...] "waste-free and strategic". The Grade system and new skill customizing elements, later staples of the series, were also developed. The game's artificial intelligence was markedly improved, the combat system was made both more elaborate and more user-friendly, and health and magic systems were adjusted. The PlayStation 2 hardware enabled the expansion of mini-games, the improvement of the game's graphics, and the incorporation of advanced interactive elements on the world map.|$|E
500|$|First Contact was {{the first}} Star Trek film to make {{significant}} use of computer-generated starship models, though physical miniatures were still used for the most important vessels. With the Enterprise-D destroyed during the events of Generations, the task of creating a new starship fell to veteran Star Trek production designer Herman Zimmerman. The script's only guide on {{the appearance of the}} vessel was the line [...] "the new Enterprise sleekly comes out of the nebula". Working with illustrator John Eaves, the designers conceived the new Sovereign Class Enterprise-E as [...] "leaner, sleeker, and mean enough to answer any Borg threat you can imagine". Braga and Moore intended it to be more muscular and militaryesque. Eaves looked at the structure of previous Enterprise iterations, and designed a more streamlined, capable war vessel than the Enterprise-D, reducing the neck area of the ship and lengthening the nacelles. Eaves produced 30 to 40 sketches before he found a final design he liked and began making minor changes. Working from blueprints created by Paramount's Rick Sternbach, the model shop at effects house Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) fabricated a [...] miniature over a five-month period. Hull patterns were carved out of wood, then cast and assembled over an aluminum armature. The model's panels were painted in an alternating matte and gloss scheme to add texture. The crew had multiple difficulties in prepping the miniature for filming; while the model shop originally wanted to save time by casting windows using a clear fiberglass, the material came out tacky. ILM instead cut the windows using a laser. Slides of the sets were added behind the window frames to make the interior seem more dimensional <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> tracked past the ship.|$|E

We assume that one camera has square pixels of size dv and the other has pixels of size rdv, where r is between 0 and 1. We then derive results for the average error, the maximum error, and the error distribution in the depth determination of a point.
