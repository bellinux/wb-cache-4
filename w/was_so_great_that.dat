On {{the final day of}} commercial service, public interest <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> grandstands were erected at Heathrow Airport. Significant numbers of people attended the final landings; the event received widespread media coverage.|$|E

5|$|At the University of Texas, {{ticket sales}} {{likewise}} were rapid. On {{the first day}} of sales, Texas' ticket office received 10,500 orders. The demand <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> some students camped overnight in front of the ticket office to ensure they would receive a ticket. Despite that initial surge in orders, as late as December 27, four days before the game, tickets were still readily available. In terms of chartered flights and the number of fans spending money at New Orleans businesses, Texas also trailed Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Because the 1995 Sugar Bowl was Virginia Tech's {{first major}} bowl game in school history, tickets and travel {{packages}} {{were in high}} demand. Prior to {{the first day of}} ticket sales, the price of travel packages skyrocketed due to demand. In Virginia, travel agencies hired temporary workers to meet demand, and in New Orleans, the demand for hotel rooms <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> many hotels instituted a three-night minimum stay.|$|E
5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud {{is only a small}} part of the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E

5|$|In 1721, the {{economic}} disaster of the South Sea Bubble allowed Walpole {{to rise to}} the pinnacle of government. Walpole and his Whig Party were dominant in politics, as the king feared that the Tories would not support the succession laid down in the Act of Settlement. The power of the Whigs <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.|$|E
5|$|On the tour's {{opening night}} at the Odeon in Cheltenham, the volume of sound created by the {{screaming}} crowds <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> The Beatles' amplification equipment proved unequal to it, {{so much so that}} the band members were unable to hear any sounds they were making themselves, whether speaking, singing, or playing their instruments. As a result, they were unable to count songs in or perform in unison.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the Plumbicon tubes <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> Amperex, built a second plant adjacent to the 1959 building on the Slatersville site to meet the demand. The new plant was , {{and at the time}} of construction employed the largest and cleanest clean room facilities in the world. The plant was officially opened in 1967 and is still making Plumbicon camera tubes today. Although the original use of Plumbicon camera tubes was in broadcast television, current demand is primarily in for use in medical imaging equipment.|$|E

5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, {{and the office}} received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed {{large amounts of money}} to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E
5|$|Having {{resigned}} the Bishopric of Chiapas, Las Casas {{spent the}} rest of his life working closely with the imperial court in matters relating to the Indies. In 1551 he rented a cell at the College of San Gregorio, where he lived with his assistant and friend Fray Rodrigo de Ladrada. He continued working as a kind of procurator for the natives of the Indies, many of whom directed petitions to him to speak to the Emperor on their behalf. Sometimes indigenous nobility even related their cases to him in Spain, for example, the Nahua noble Francisco Tenamaztle from Nochistlán. His influence at court <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> some even considered that he had the final word in choosing the members of the Council of the Indies.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Richard {{started to}} {{complain}} {{of pain in}} his left calf. The synthetic graft inserted in his July 1980 surgery had closed off, which meant that he needed a surgical bypass in his left leg. Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still had faith in him, so he was re-signed on February 17 of the following year. Just {{a little over two}} months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career. Despite an almost complete recovery, the risk of future complications <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493strikeouts and a 3.15ERA in 238games and 1,606innings. Nolan Ryan broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{prior to the}} {{construction}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the Fairbanks economy was unsteady. The News-Miner planned to expand its printing plant, but many in the company were unsure if the economy could support the added capacity. Over the objections of the News-Miner newsroom, Snedden decided to expand the Aurora Building by adding a second floor at a cost of $2 million. In 1974, as construction of the pipeline got under way, demand for office space in Fairbanks <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> Alyeska Pipeline Company rented several News-Miner offices in the newly expanded building. About this time, the News-Miner replaced its Associated Press teletypes with a satellite connection.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of , a fire {{broke out in the}} Old Building. It caused {{widespread}} damage to {{a large part of the}} structure, including the two oldest rooms in the school, School Room and Big School. The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged, either by fire or water from the fire brigade's hoses. The damage to the building <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> rebuilding took over 2 years, with the unusually cold winter of 1962–1963 delaying the restoration. Lessons, however, continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street.|$|E
5|$|Progressive Field {{set a new}} MLB record between June 12, 1995 and April 4, 2001 {{in selling}} out 455 {{straight}} games. Demand for tickets <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> all 81 home games were sold out before opening day in five separate seasons. The Indians retired the number 455 {{in honor of the}} sellout record. The Boston Red Sox later surpassed this record when Fenway Park recorded 456 straight sellouts on September 9, 2008. The record for the largest attendance at Progressive Field was set in Game 3 of the 1997 ALDS when 45,274 people attended the game. On Saturday, April 2, 2011, the Indians' lowest attendance record was broken with a very small crowd of 9,853, and again the following day with an even smaller attendance figure of 8,726.|$|E

5|$|The dam's primary goal, irrigation, was {{postponed}} as the wartime need for electricity increased. The dam's powerhouse began production {{around the time}} World WarII began, and its electricity was vital to the war effort. The dam powered aluminum smelters in Longview and Vancouver, Washington, Boeing factories in Seattle and Vancouver, and Portland's shipyards. In 1943, its electricity was also used for plutonium production in Richland, Washington, at the Hanford Site, {{which was part of}} the top-secret Manhattan Project. The demand for power at that project <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> in 1943, two generators originally intended for the Shasta Dam were installed at Grand Coulee in an effort to hurry the generator installation schedule.|$|E
5|$|The first {{roadshow}} {{opened at}} the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940. The Disneys had secured a year's lease with the venue that was fully equipped with Fantasound, which took personnel a week {{working around the clock}} to install. Proceeds made on the night went to the British War Relief Society for the efforts in the Battle of Britain. Ticket demand <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> eight telephone operators were employed to handle the extra calls while the adjoining store was rented out to cater the box office bookings. Fantasia ran at the Broadway for forty-nine consecutive weeks, the longest run achieved by a film at the time. Its run continued for a total of fifty-seven weeks until February 28, 1942.|$|E
5|$|The gas {{chambers}} {{worked to}} their fullest capacity from April–July 1944, during {{the massacre of}} Hungary's Jews. Hungary was an ally of Germany during the war, but it had resisted turning over its Jews until Germany invaded that March. A rail spur leading directly into Birkenau was completed that May to deliver the victims closer to the gas chambers. From 14 May until early July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews, half of the pre-war population, were deported to Auschwitz, {{at a rate of}} 12,000 a day for a considerable part of that period. The incoming volume <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> <b>that</b> the SS resorted to burning corpses in open-air pits {{as well as in the}} crematoria. The last selection took place on 30 October 1944.|$|E
