5|$|The argasid tick Hyalomma marginatum {{was found}} in pale crag martin nests on a {{sarcophagus}} and an ancient tomb in Egypt. This tick has been implicated in the transmission of Bahig virus, a pathogenic arbovirus previously thought to be transmitted only by mosquitoes. Another argasid tick, Argas africolumbae, <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nest of the closely related rock martins in Kenya. The nasal mite Ptilonyssus echinatus <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pale crag martin in the Tibesti Mountains of northern Chad.|$|E
5|$|A {{murder by}} cyanide was sensational news in Washington. When another tainted bottle {{from the same}} lot <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> grocery store in nearby Kent, Washington, the {{manufacturers}} of Excedrin, Bristol-Myers, responded to the discovery with a heavily publicized recall of all Extra-Strength Excedrin products in the Seattle, Washington area, {{and a group of}} drug companies came together to offer a $300,000 reward for the capture of the person responsible.|$|E
5|$|An {{image of}} Mahavira at the State Museum Lucknow is dated to 1007AD, while {{one at the}} Parshvanatha temple, Kumbharia, is dated to 1179AD.

Further potbelly monuments have been found in caches under Late Classic stelae in the Great Plaza itself and throughout the Copán valley.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 2003, five flint {{artefacts}} {{were discovered}} near the Shimna River. A flake, two blades and a concave scraper {{were found in}} two locations in Tollymore Forest.

5|$|Dermotherium major <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lignite pit {{known as}} Wai Lek in Krabi Province, southwestern Thailand. It {{is part of}} the Krabi Basin fauna, which {{contains}} at least 40 mammalian genera, mostly artiodactyls but also including some primates, such as Siamopithecus, Wailekia, and Muangthanhinius. This fauna has been dated to about 33 to 35 million years ago, during the Late Eocene.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the small}} size of {{brachytherapy}} sources and low control in early decades, there is a risk that some of these have escaped into the environment to become orphaned sources.

5|$|Evidence of a {{fractured}} hip bone <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specimen of Iguanodon, which had {{an injury to}} its ischium. Two other individuals were observed with signs of osteoarthritis as evidenced by bone overgrowths in their anklebones which are called osteophytes.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Flagstad {{family of}} Green Bay {{donated to the}} Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame an {{authentic}} Packers No. 14 jersey worn by Hutson. The jersey <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> trunk of old uniforms in 1946 at the Rockwood Lodge, the Packers' summer training camp from 1946 to 1949, owned by Melvin and Helen Flagstad.

5|$|Originally {{described}} {{from the}} Sierra Nevada, C.sculpta {{is found in}} mountainous areas in western North America, and <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Brazilian dune in 2008. It may be easily confused with Calbovista subsculpta, a similar puffball that—in addition to differences observable only with a microscope—is larger, and has slightly raised warts with a felt-like texture. Other similar species include Calvatia arctica and immature specimens of Amanita magniverrucata.|$|E
5|$|Some higher {{forms of}} land life are now colonising {{the soil of}} Surtsey. The first {{earthworm}} <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> soil sample in 1993, probably carried over from Heimaey by a bird. However, the next year earthworms were not found. Slugs were found in 1998, {{and appeared to be}} similar to varieties found in the southern Icelandic mainland. Spiders and beetles have also become established.|$|E
5|$|Acoli {{then drove}} the car (a white Pontiac LeMans with Vermont license plates)—which {{contained}} Assata Shakur, who was wounded, and Zayd Shakur, who was dead or dying— down the road. The vehicle was chased by three patrol {{cars and the}} booths down the turnpike were alerted. Acoli then exited the car and, after being ordered to halt by a trooper, fled into the woods as the trooper emptied his gun. Assata Shakur then walked towards the trooper with her bloodied arms raised in surrender. Acoli was captured after a 36-hour manhunt—involving 400 people, state police helicopters, and bloodhounds. Zayd Shakur's body <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nearby gully along the road.|$|E

5|$|After the war Blamey was Deputy Chief of the General Staff, and was {{involved}} {{in the creation of the}} Royal Australian Air Force. He resigned from the regular Army in 1925 to become Chief Commissioner of the Victoria Police, but remained in the Militia, rising to command the 3rd Division in 1931. As chief commissioner, Blamey set about dealing with the grievances that had led to the 1923 Victorian Police strike, and implemented innovations such as police dogs and equipping vehicles with radios. His tenure as chief commissioner was marred by a scandal in which his police badge <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> brothel, and a later attempt to cover up the shooting of a police officer led to his forced resignation in 1936. He later made weekly broadcasts on international affairs on Melbourne radio station 3UZ. Appointed chairman of the Commonwealth Government's Manpower Committee and controller general of recruiting in 1938, he headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia.|$|E
5|$|An eighth, fragmentary {{specimen}} {{was discovered}} in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at Daiting, Suevia. Therefore, it {{is known as the}} Daiting Specimen, and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the Naturkundemuseum in Bamberg. The original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsdörfer in 2009. It was on display {{for the first time with}} six other original fossils of Archaeopteryx at the Munich Mineral Show in October 2009. A first, quick look by scientists indicates that this specimen might represent a new species of Archaeopteryx. It <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> limestone bed that was a few hundred thousand years younger than the other finds.|$|E
5|$|At a {{press conference}} in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his {{followers}} of participation in this and other crimes, including an aborted plan in 1985 to assassinate a United States Attorney, and he asked State and Federal authorities to investigate. Oregon Attorney General David B. Frohnmayer set up an Interagency Task Force, composed of Oregon State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and executed search warrants in Rajneeshpuram. A sample of bacteria matching the contaminant that had sickened the town residents <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory. Two leading Rajneeshpuram officials were convicted on charges of attempted murder and served 29months of 20-year sentences in a minimum-security federal prison.|$|E

5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims.

McGrath and his disciplinary board decide {{to shut down the}} X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E
5|$|Burial 67 <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cist {{under the}} second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The {{skeleton}} was lying on its back with the head towards the north. The remains were poorly preserved but belonged to an adult. Of the skull only some dental remains were found. A ceramic plate had been placed under {{the head of the}} deceased and another plate was placed upon the knees. The plate was painted with four seated anthropomorphic figures with inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws. The facial features of the figures are unusual. The bottom of the plate bears the image of a dancer. The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|Desha {{continued}} on to San Antonio, where {{he lost a}} substantial amount of money playing Monte Bank. He decided to return to San Felipe.
