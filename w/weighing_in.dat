5|$|Usually made of silver, the Greek drachma coin, {{including}} the tetradrachm, was the standard currency {{used throughout the}} Parthian Empire. The Arsacids maintained royal mints at the cities of Hecatompylos, Seleucia, and Ecbatana. They most likely operated a mint at Mithridatkert/Nisa as well. From the empire's inception until its collapse, drachmas produced throughout the Parthian period rarely weighed less than 3.5g or more than 4.2g. The first Parthian tetradrachms, <b>weighing</b> <b>in</b> principle around 16g with some variation, appear after Mithridates I conquered Mesopotamia and were minted exclusively at Seleucia.|$|E
5|$|After winning all the breaststroke {{events at}} the country championships, O'Brien was taken by his father to the Ryde pool in Sydney in 1960, to be coached by Forbes Carlile and his assistant, retired world record-breaking breaststroker Terry Gathercole.

5|$|Other {{texts that}} include Krishna {{such as the}} Bhagavad Gita have {{attracted}} numerous bhasya (commentaries) in the Hindu traditions.

5|$|The {{captaincy}} {{was given}} to Vic Richardson, Bradman's predecessor as South Australian captain. Cricket author Chris Harte's {{analysis of the situation}} is that a prior (unspecified) commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia. Harte attributed an ulterior motive to his relocation: the off-field behaviour of Richardson and other South Australian players had displeased the South Australia Cricket Association (SACA), which was looking for new leadership. To help improve discipline, Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the South Australian and Australian teams. He took his adopted state to its first Sheffield Shield title for 10years, Bradman <b>weighing</b> <b>in</b> with personal contributions of 233 against Queensland and 357 against Victoria. He finished the season with 369 (in 233minutes), a South Australian record, made against Tasmania.

5|$|The current voting format {{introduced}} in 1999 is a positional voting system, {{similar to that}} used at the Eurovision Song Contest. The voting is made up of two segments, in the first of which juries announce their votes; in the second segment the televoting result is announced. The total value of votes has usually been 2 x 473 points, which means that televotes and juries have an equal 50/50 <b>weighing</b> <b>in</b> the final result. The juries, usually 11, have represented either Swedish regions or, since 2010, countries participating in the year's Eurovision Song Contest. Each jury award 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 points to their top seven songs. After the jury voting, the televoting result is revealed by the hosts in ascending order. Between 1999 and 2011, the televoting points were fixed; the top seven songs would receive 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 points. Starting in 2011, televoting points are given to each entry based on its percentage of total vote. If an entry receives 10% of the televotes it will be equivalent to 10% of 473 points, i.e. 48 points. The song with the highest number of points {{at the end of the}} voting is the winner.|$|E
