5|$|The program {{requires}} that the reverse of the dollar depict a new design every year. In order to determine which design to depict on the coins, officials from the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, the Native American Caucus and the National Congress of American Indians, the consulting organizations for the program, appoint a liaison to the United States Mint. Between twelve and fifteen themes are selected after consultation with the National Museum of the American Indian and the Smithsonian Institution. At this point, the consulting organizations supply the Mint with <b>written</b> <b>comments</b> regarding the themes. The suggestions are then sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee, where a theme is recommended. After reviewing the recommendations and input from the contributing organizations, the selected theme is finalized, at which point designs are produced that represent the theme. Once designs are created, the consulting organizations and the National Museum of the Native American are consulted, and the designs are sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee for approval. Based on all comments and recommendations received, the Mint selects a final design that is recommended to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} characterise {{the doctors who}} <b>wrote</b> <b>comments</b> {{at the end of}} a postal {{questionnaire}} about their careers, to quantify the frequency of negative comments, and to study relationships between the questionnaire content and the topics of comment. Graduates of all UK medical schools in 1999 were surveyed at the end of their pre-registration year. Structured questions about career intentions, current jobs and attitudes were accompanied by an invitation to <b>write</b> <b>comments</b> about any aspect of training, career choices or work. Comments were transcribed and coded according to theme and whether they were positive, negative or neutral. Numbers of comments on each theme, and of positive and negative comments, were counted. Bivariate analyses based on respondents' answers to structured questions were used to characterise those who <b>wrote</b> <b>comments</b> on each theme. The survey response rate was 65 %, and 40 % of respondents <b>wrote</b> <b>comments.</b> Sixteen themes were identified. Ninety-four percent of those who commented said something negative or critical. Respondents who <b>wrote</b> <b>comments</b> differed in some characteristics from the whole cohort. The structured content of the questionnaire, particularly certain attitude statements, prompted the <b>writing</b> of <b>comments</b> on related themes, although not all attitudinal items acted in this way. © Springer 2005...|$|R

Republican Representative Phil Roe said, [...] "Do you think that’s normal in business, that nearly every executive is successful? That means you put the bar down here, so anybody can step over it."
