He compared the episode the third season episode [...] "A Benihana Christmas", writing that [...] "both deal with Michael’s heart being broken and the somewhat self-destructive ways he deals with it." [...] However, {{he felt that the}} episode [...] "struggles greatly if you have no emotional connection to Holly and Michael" [...] because it [...] "isn't funny, by any real stretch of the term, nor is it really intended to be funny." [...] He went on to say [...] "I like episodes like this one in general and don't necessarily need the show to make me laugh, but I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted this hour to be slightly more... pleasant." ...|$|E

After growing frustrated with the lack of answers regarding his health condition, Burnley decided to abandon searching for a diagnosis and focus on the album. Recorded and produced at a personal studio of Burnley's, Dark Before Dawn is the first album with the front man credited as the producer. The singer stated that [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did the same amount of producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] ", adding, [...] "You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I have done in the past.

[...] He also praised the episode's guest voice actors, citing in particular Bill Hader's character Mickey as [...] "very odd, but so much fun"; Bonaime gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] an overall grade of 8.3 out of 10. Jen Johnson, writing for Den of Geek, also cited Mickey as a highlight of the episode, stating: [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hope {{this is the end of}} Mickey and the chaos he brings to the Belcher family, but [...] was just too much fun.

500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E

2500|$|Simcha Jacobovici, {{involved}} {{in the production of}} a documentary on Freund's work for the National Geographic Channel, stated that the biblical Tarshish (which he believes is the same as Tartessos) was Atlantis, and that [...] "Atlantis was hiding in the Tanach". Aren Maeir, a professor of archeology at Bar-Ilan University said [...] "a lot of people have made many crazy claims about Atlantis – it’s one of those classic places where you have a lunatic fringe looking for all types of things. And Richard Freund is known as someone who makes 'sensational' finds. I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am exceptionally skeptical about the thing, but I wouldn’t discount it 100% until I see the details, which haven’t been published as far as I know...every few years we hear something like this from him...

Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{the nuclear}} {{disaster}} in Japan {{is likely to}} have major effects on US energy policy, according to billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Speaking on CNBC in March, Buffet said that the [...] "United States was poised to move ahead with nuclear plans here, but the events in Japan derailed that". [...] "Radiation terrifies people", Buffett told CNBC. [...] "It's unseen, there's no way to quantify sort of the limits of what might happen from it so I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be very surprised if there's any nuclear facilities built in the United States for a long time." [...] Moreover, Japan's government and TEPCO response to the Fukushima Daiichi incident has been criticized worldwide, and Gregory B. Jaczko, Chairman [...] of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, broke with ordinary protocols by overruling the Japanese with regard to the public exclusion zone. As a result of the harshly criticized Japanese handling of the crisis, there has been a scramble by the EU to reform nuclear policy. Some commentators expect that US will have greater influence on nuclear policy worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|MacMillan was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in August 1915. Due to him not being 19, he was posted to the 3rd Battalion, Argylls, a training unit, stationed near Edinburgh. In April 1916 {{he was sent to}} the Western Front where he joined the 2nd Battalion (the 93rd), a Regular Army unit which was then serving as part of the 98th Brigade of the 33rd Division, in Northeast France, and immediately became involved in fierce trench warfare at Brickstacks. This was followed by engagements, as part of the battles of the Somme and Passchendaele, at Cuinchy, Bazentin-le-Petit, High Wood, Mametz Wood, Arras, Le Cateau and the Selle. While still only 19 years old and a second lieutenant, he was appointed acting adjutant of the battalion in November 1916. He was promoted to lieutenant in April 1917, and formally confirmed as Adjutant in June. He remained in this post {{for the rest of the}} war, serving seven different commanding officers (CO). The casualties were immense and, at one time, while a second lieutenant, he found himself by default commanding the battalion. MacMillan wrote [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was fortunate to belong to the best battalion in the Army, with an unbreakable spirit. You can see this from the record of their operations – and then look at the casualty list: 63 officers and 1175 men killed, and ready for anything at the end of it all".|$|E

2500|$|In 1863 Carson and John Dolbeer {{formed the}} Dolbeer and Carson Lumber Company. Eighteen {{years later in}} 1881, as the company {{advanced}} into areas more difficult to log, Dolbeer invented the Steam Donkey Engine which revolutionized log removal, especially in hard to reach areas. At about the same time, Carson {{was involved in the}} founding of the Eel River and Eureka Railroad with John Vance. Before commencing the building of his mansion, Carson said, [...] "If I build it poorly, they <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a damned miser; if I build it expensively, they will say I'm a show off; guess I'll just build it to suit myself." [...] In 1884, on the eve of construction of the great home, the company was producing [...] of lumber annually. The milling operations, combined with additional investments as far away as Southern California and at least partial ownerships in schooners used to move the lumber to booming markets on the west coast and all over the globe, {{set the stage for the}} unlimited budget and access to resources the builders would have. Pacific Lumber Company purchased the company in 1950 and maintained milling operations at the original Humboldt Bay site, located bay-side below the house, well into the 1970s. Following the Carson family divestiture of remaining family holdings (including the home) in 1950, the family left the area. The building was purchased for $35,000 in 1950 by local community business leaders, and currently houses the Ingomar Club, a private club, which was named after Carson's Ingomar Theater, itself named for Carson's favorite play Ingomar the Barbarian.|$|E
