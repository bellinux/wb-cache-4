50|$|A factory LPG {{conversion}} (using an underfloor LPG {{tank and}} a rear-mounted petrol tank) was also available using a converted Ford 8-valve petrol engine with a {{peak power output}} of 115PS. This conversion was popular with police due to the high power output without the running costs of the V8 (explained below). The conversion did however significantly change the 'class-leading' <b>warranty</b> <b>terms,</b> the general warranty being reduced from 150000 miles to 60000 miles.|$|E

Most building services products are installed while {{a building}} is constructed, {{but they are not}} operated until the building is commissioned. The <b>warranty</b> <b>term</b> for the building service systems may cover the time starting from their installation {{to the end of the}} warranty period. Prior to the commissioning of the building, the building services systems are protected by warranty although they are not operated. The bum in time for such systems is important when warranty costs is analyzed. In this paper, warranty cost models for products with burn in periods are presented. Two burn in policies are developed to optimize the total mean warranty cost. A special case on the relationship between the failure rates of the product at the dormant state and at the I operating state is presented...|$|R
50|$|Nokia often offers new N8 or E7 devices as {{warranty}} {{replacements for}} N900s. Although <b>warranty</b> <b>terms</b> and consumer rights legislation differ across jurisdictions, users have reported success in refusing those and pressing for an N900 {{in at least}} the EU and India as recently as August 2011. Owners who are not confident of getting an N900 as a warranty replacement often attempt to repair their own devices, or sell the Nokia-provided replacement to buy an N900 instead.|$|E
50|$|Any {{warrantor}} warranting {{a consumer}} product to a consumer {{by means of}} a written warranty must disclose, fully and conspicuously, in simple and readily understood language, the terms and conditions of the warranty to the extent required by rules of the Federal Trade Commission.

30|$|Beside the seller–buyer {{relationship}} between second life manufacturer and second life customer, {{the provision of}} a warranty or the offering of the SLBESS as a service, where the product liability stays with the OEM, {{can be interpreted as}} a quasi-insurance on the battery system’s performance that is issued by the second life manufacturer as principal to the second life customer as agent (see Fig.  3, right). Considering the present role allocation, the critical information asymmetry occurs after the conclusion of the contract. Safeguarded by the warranty or the service contract, the second life customer might reduce his care in the operation of the BESS or might not operate the battery system by the contract’s or <b>warranty’s</b> <b>terms</b> and conditions. An agency problem occurs as the customer’s actions are typically not observable by the second life manufacturer, who, however, has to pay for the repair or replacement of the battery components (hidden actions) (Arrow 1986) (EC# 6).|$|R

5000|$|These {{types of}} {{warranties}} are provided for various products, but automobiles and electronics are common examples. Warranties which are sold through retailers such as Best Buy may include significant commission for the retailer {{as a result}} of reverse competition. [...] For instance, an auto warranty from a car dealership may be subcontracted and vehicle repairs may be at a lower rate which could compromise the quality of service. At the time of repair, out-of-pocket expenses may be charged for unexpected services provided outside of the <b>warranty</b> <b>terms</b> or uncovered parts.|$|E
50|$|A user who breaks {{equipment}} by modifying it {{in a way}} {{not intended}} by the manufacturer might deny they did it, in order to claim the warranty or (mainly in the case of PCs) call the helpdesk for help in fixing it. Tamper-evident seals may be enough to deal with this. However, they cannot easily be checked remotely, and many countries have statutory <b>warranty</b> <b>terms</b> that mean manufacturers may still have to service the equipment. Tamper proof screws will stop most casual users from tampering in the first place. In the US, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act prevents manufacturers from voiding warranties solely due to tampering. A warranty may be dishonored only if the tampering actually affected the part that has failed, and could have caused the failure.|$|E
5000|$|A {{formal letter}} sent to Porsche {{from members of}} the US-based Rennlist.com [...] "991.1 GT3 Concerned Owners Group" [...] about {{additional}} engine durability issues lead to a meeting between representatives of the owners group and Porsche, including head of Porsche Motorsport Dr. Frank-Steffen Walliser, on 3 August 2017 at the Porsche North America Atlanta headquarters. According to Dr. Walliser the concerning high-RPM misfire issue could be traced primarily to a metallurgical defect in certain batches of [...] "finger followers" [...] (valve train rocker arms) and secondarily to individual driving patterns and engine variations - such as temperature, oil quality, oil viscosity and parts tolerances - that lead to increased wear of the specific parts. In response to the issue and after implementing new engine tests to trace down the issue Porsche had developed revised camshafts and finger followers and offers a fully transferable 10-year, 120,000 mile extended engine warranty to all 991.1 generation GT3 owners world-wide that covers the replacement of the defective engine with a new engine with the revised parts if failure {{is a direct result of}} the finger-follower issue. The base bumper-to-bumper warranty and all other <b>warranty</b> <b>terms</b> and conditions remain unchanged. Porsche confirms that the issue is isolated to the 991.1 GT3, and that the 991.1 GT3 RS and the 991 R are not affected.|$|E

This study focuses on effects of warranty in the purchase decision of electronic products in Bangladesh. After conducting an effective exploratory research to gain initial idea and knowledge, the study proceeded further to draw a conclusion about the research topic. Through the convenience sample selection process, 100 samples were selected from the target population. The literature review elaborated and explained about the past and recent research works on the product warranty in different countries on different samples. The questionnaire consisted of 33 questions under eight key variables including Service Provider’s Accountability, Reliability of Product, Long <b>Term</b> <b>Warranty,</b> Short <b>Term</b> <b>Warranty,</b> Branded Product, Non-branded Product, Country of Origin and Risk Reliever.
