5000|$|In Israel {{and part}} of the British areas under the mandate a low water {{crossing}} or <b>watersplash</b> had been known as [...] "Irish bridge" [...] in reference to the Anglo-Irish war ...|$|E
50|$|The {{manor house}} of Brochelie was {{situated}} on the plot now occupied by the <b>Watersplash</b> Hotel. Its manor itself extended over the lands {{on the western side}} of the A337 Lyndhurst-Lymington Road.|$|E
5000|$|Scotland Eyot is {{a former}} name. [...] Thomas Vincent owned the land and <b>Watersplash</b> Farm in the 19th century prior to selling it, a Shepperton {{landowner}} related to Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon., having acquired it from Thomas Carr.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} old fords known as <b>watersplashes</b> in the United Kingdom. Examples are at Brockenhurst in Hampshire, Wookey in Somerset, and Swinbrook in Oxfordshire. Some {{of these are}} being {{replaced}} by bridges as these are a more reliable form of crossing in adverse weather conditions.|$|R
50|$|Ingram and Moreau {{entered the}} WRC Wales GB rally with the Autosport Technology team, making their debut in WRC3 and JuniorWRC, driving a Citroen DS3. Running 2nd in both classes, after {{completing}} 17 of the 19 stage event, they retired in a <b>watersplash</b> whilst in transit to the penultimate stage.|$|E
5000|$|Not just a British phenomenon, {{some very}} {{spectacular}} {{versions of the}} <b>watersplash</b> feature {{can be found in}} diverse locations. Australia has the Gulf Savannah, and others may be found in Canada, Italy, South Africa, and Finland. They are also found on some Tennessee backroads, where they are referred to as [...] "underwater bridges".|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Watersplash</b> pool (a warm indoor {{swimming}} pool made for mostly young children), {{and many other}} restaurants were closed to facilitate {{the construction of the}} Twentieth Century Fox World. A Casino was also built on the location of the previous [...] "The Pavilion" [...] which was a concert venue for entertainment-related performances.|$|E
50|$|There was a ford to {{the north}} of the church on <b>Watersplash</b> Lane, but the main {{crossing}} was where the bridge replaced it on the Bath Road. The river was widened, probably in the 18th century, on either side of the Church Road to form two ornamental lakes. By 1820 there were at least four large ponds, three of which lay in the village on the edge of the common on the Southall Road. The fourth lay immediately east of the moat. By 1958 these had all been drained.|$|E
40|$|Eighteen spontaneous, non-toxigenic (Tox-) mutants of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci {{were found}} to cause symptomless infections in tobacco leaves. One of these mutants was {{selected}} for detailed study. Infected tissue displayed none of the physiological alterations (loss of chlorophyll, accumulation of ammonia, inactivation of glutamine synthetase) that characterized the effect of tabtoxin in infections caused by the wild-type. However, early growth in, and invasion of inoculated leaves by the Tox- mutant was not detectably {{different from that of}} the wild-type. Also, infectious cells of both cultures were transmitted with equal efficiency from inoculated to healthy seedlings in <b>watersplash.</b> Therefore the Tox- mutant was a non-pathogenic parasite. One important difference between the parasitic abilities of these cultures was revealed in the steady decline in numbers of the Tox- mutant in tobacco leaves from 3 days after inoculation whereas numbers of the wild-type continued to increase, or remained constant, after 3 days. The population of the wild-type in inoculated tissue grew to an apparent upper limit of 1 · 6 × 107 cells cm- 2 leaf from inocula containing between 5 × 103 and 1 · 0 × 107 cells. This upper limit may have been determined by the amount of free nutrient in the apoplast. The Tox- and wild-type differed not only in toxigenicity, but also in that growth of the former was inhibited by 30 nmol ml- 1 tabtoxin whereas growth of the latter was unaffected or even stimulated by as much as 3 · 5 µmol ml- 1...|$|E
