40|$|An optimum dietary {{carbohydrate}} content {{is important for}} maximum fish growth. In this study, we fed <b>Wuchang</b> <b>bream</b> (Megalobrama amblycephala) with either control diet (30. 42 %) or high carbohydrate diet (52. 92 %) for 90 d. Fish were fed to apparent satiation three times daily in an aquarium with automatic temperature control and circulated water. Growth performance, plasma biochemical parameters, hepatic morphology and enzyme activities were determined. It was shown that compared to fish fed control diet, fish fed high carbohydrate diet had higher plasma triglyceride and cortisol levels for d 90, and lower alkaline phosphatase level for d 45, lower hepatic superoxide dismutase and total antioxidative capacity for d 90, higher malondialdehyde for d 45 and glycogen content for d 45 and 90 (p< 0. 05). Histological and transmission electron microscopy studies showed that hepatocytes of fish fed high carbohydrate diet contained large lipid droplets, causing displacement of cellular organelles to periphery of hepatocytes. The relative level of hepatic heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) mRNA of <b>Wuchang</b> <b>bream</b> fed high carbohydrate diet {{was significantly higher than}} that of fish fed the control diet for 90 d (p< 0. 05). These changes led to decreased specific growth rate and increased feed conversion ratio (p< 0. 05). Upon hypoxia challenge, fish fed high carbohydrate diet had higher cumulative mortality than those fed the control diet (p< 0. 05). These results suggested that high dietary carbohydrate (52. 92 %) was detrimental to the growth performance and health of <b>Wuchang</b> <b>bream...</b>|$|E

40|$|Bream pond {{aquaculture}} plays a {{very important}} role in China's aquaculture industry and is the main source of aquatic products. To regulate and control pond water quality and sediment, a movable solar pond aquaculture water quality regulation machine (SMWM) was designed and used. This machine is solar-powered and moves on water, and its primary components are a solar power supply device, a sediment lifting device, a mechanism for walking on the water's surface and a control system. The solar power supply device provides power for the machine, and the water walking mechanism drives the machine's motion on the water. The sediment lifting device orbits the main section of the machine and affects a large area of the pond. Tests of the machine's mechanical properties revealed that the minimum illumination necessary for the SMWM to function is 13, 000 Lx and that its stable speed on the water is 0. 02 - 0. 03 m/s. For an illumination of 13, 000 - 52, 500 Lx, the sediment lifting device runs at 0. 13 - 0. 35 m/s, and its water delivery capacity is 110 - 208 m(3) /h. The sediment lifting device is able to fold away, and the angle of the suction chamber can be adjusted, making the machine work well in ponds at different water depths from 0. 5 m to 2 m. The optimal distance from the sediment lifting device {{to the bottom of the}} pond is 10 - 15 cm. In addition, adjusting the length of the connecting rod and the direction of the traction rope allows the SMWM to work in a pond water area greater than 80 %. The analysis of water quality in <b>Wuchang</b> <b>bream</b> (Parabramis pekinensis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) culture ponds using the SMWM resulted in decreased NH 3 (+) -N and available phosphorus concentrations and increased TP concentrations. The TN content and the amount of available phosphorus in the sediment were reduced. In addition, the fish production showed that the SMWM enhanced the yields of <b>Wuchang</b> <b>bream</b> and silver carp by more than 30 % and 24 %, respectively. These results indicate that the SMWM may be suitable for <b>Wuchang</b> <b>bream</b> pond aquaculture in China and that it can be used in pond aquaculture for regulating and controlling water quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} high {{carbohydrate}} diet on growth, serum physiological response, and hepatic {{heat shock protein}} 70 expression in <b>Wuchang</b> <b>bream</b> were determined at 25 °C and 30 °C. At each temperature, the fish fed the control diet (31 % CHO) had significantly higher weight gain, specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio and hepatic glucose- 6 -phosphatase activities, lower feed conversion ratio and hepatosomatic index (HSI), whole crude lipid, serum glucose, hepatic glucokinase (GK) activity than those fed the high-carbohydrate diet (47 % CHO) (p< 0. 05). The fish reared at 25 °C had significantly higher whole body crude protein and ash, serum cholesterol and triglyceride, hepatic G- 6 -Pase activity, lower glycogen content and relative levels of hepatic growth hormone (GH) gene expression than those reared at 30 °C (p< 0. 05). Significant interaction between temperature and diet was found for HSI, condition factor, hepatic GK activity and the relative levels of hepatic GH gene expression (p< 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary {{carbohydrate}} (CHO) level on serum physiological response, hepatic antioxidant abilities and {{heat shock protein}} 70 (HSP 70) expression of <b>Wuchang</b> <b>bream</b> (Megalobrama amblycephala) was studied. Two isonitrogenous (28. 56 % crude protein) and isolipidic (5. 28 % crude lipid) diets were formulated to contain 30 % or 53 % wheat starch. Diets were fed for 90 days to fish in triplicate tanks (28 fish per tank). At the end of feeding trial, significantly higher serum triglyceride level, insulin level, cortisol level, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were observed in fish fed the 53 % CHO diet, while significantly lower serum total protein content, alkaline phosphatase activity, superoxide dismutase activity and total antioxidative capacity were found in fish fed the 53 % CHO diet compared with those fed the 30 % diet. The relative level of hepatic heat shock protein 70 mRNA was significantly higher in the 53 % CHO group than that in the 30 % CHO at 6, 12 and 48 h after feeding.

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed at {{evaluating}} {{the effects of the}} feed additive curcumin on the growth and non-specific immune responses in juvenile <b>Wuchang</b> <b>bream</b> (Megalobrama amblycephala). Six experimental diets were formulated to contain graded curcumin levels (0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 mg/kg of diet, respectively). After 60 days feeding trial, fish fed the 60 mg/kg curcumin diet had significantly higher weight gain rate (WGR) and specific growth rate (SGR), and significantly lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) than the control group. The number of leucocytes (WBC), interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), alternative pathway of complement (ACH 50), and respiratory burst activity increased with increasing dietary curcumin levels up to 60 mg/kg, and thereafter declined. Significantly lower alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) activities were observed in fish fed the 60 mg/kg curcumin diet compared to those in the control group. Fish fed with the diets containing 60 and 120 mg/kg curcumin had significantly higher TNF-α and ACH 50 activities than those in the control, and the fish fed diets supplemented with 60 and 240 mg/kg curcumin had significantly higher IL- 1 β activities than those in the control. The results suggest that appropriate dietary curcumin supplementation (60 mg/kg curcumin of diet) significantly improved growth and non-specific immune responses in juvenile M. amblycephala...|$|E
40|$|Selection {{experiments}} with the herbivorous blunt snout bream or <b>Wuchang</b> <b>bream</b> (Megalobrama amblycephala) were started in 1985. Mass selection for size and length/depth ratio {{resulted in a}} significant increase in growth and better shape, while inbreeding led to a significant decrease in growth. The total selection ratio from fry to mature brooders was about 0. 03 per cent per generation. In the grow out stage, the average daily body weight gains of two lines of fifth generation (F 5) fish were 29 per cent and 20 per cent respectively more than the control group, with an average of 5. 8 per cent and 4 per cent improvements per generation, respectively. The body was 4 per cent deeper in ratio of standard length/body depth. The effects of inbreeding were examined by crossing full-sibs, the offspring of which were kept without selection. The third generation inbred fish showed 17 per cent lower growth as compared to the control group, with an average of 7. 5 per cent per generation. The results demonstrate that selection is a powerful tool to improve the economic traits of the blunt snout bream, but inbreeding can rapidly lead to a reduction in performance. In 2000, the 6 th generation of selected bream was certified by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture as a good breed for aquaculture...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{antibacterial}} peptide obtained from Bacillus subtilis fmbJ on growth, serum lysozyme complements 3 and 4, total protein content, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total antioxidative capacity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and disease resistance of <b>Wuchang</b> <b>bream</b> (Megalobrama amblycephala) were examined. Fish were randomly divided into five groups: a control group which was fed a basic diet, and four groups fed the basic diet supplemented with 0. 1 %, 0. 2 %, 0. 4 %, or 0. 8 % antibacterial peptide. At eight weeks, M. amblycephala fed the diet containing 0. 2 % antibacterial peptide had higher serum lysozyme activity, complement 3 and 4 contents, and SOD activity than the control fish, but lower serum MDA content and AST activity. Fish fed the 0. 4 % diet had higher weight gain rate, serum lysozyme activity, complement 4 content, total antioxidative capacity, and total protein than the control, and lower serum ALT activity. Feed conversion ratios of fish fed the 0. 2 % or 0. 4 % diets were {{lower than those of}} control fish. Artificial infection with Aeromonas hydrophila resulted in 93 % cumulative mortality in the control group, and 61 - 84 % in the groups fed the 0. 2 % or 0. 4 % diets.
