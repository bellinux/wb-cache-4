She and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect with any of them.|$|E

5|$|From January until March 1686, La Salle {{and most}} of his men searched {{overland}} for the Mississippi River, traveling towards the Rio Grande, possibly as far west as modern-day Langtry, Texas. The men questioned the local Native American tribes, asking for information on the locations of the Spaniards and the Spanish mines, offering gifts, and telling stories that portrayed the Spanish as cruel and the French as benevolent. When the group returned, they were unable to find the Belle where they had left her and were forced to <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> to the fort.|$|E

5|$|San Esteban {{was one of}} a {{flotilla}} of four ships carrying treasure from New Spain (Mexico) to Cuba. Three were wrecked in the storm, including San Esteban. Many of {{the three}} hundred sailors and passengers drowned while trying to reach shore. About thirty took a boat to seek help. Almost all the others died of thirst or starvation, or were killed by hostile local Karankawa Indians during their attempt to <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> to safety. The Spanish sent a salvage expedition, but recovered {{less than half of the}} cargo and treasure.|$|E

Haku appears in his dragon form and flies Sen and Boh to the bathhouse. No-Face becomes Zeniba's spinner. In midflight, Sen recalls falling in her youth into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, thus {{revealing}} Haku's real identity as the Kohaku River. When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents from {{among a group of}} pigs in order to break their curse. After Sen answers that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract combusts and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, who do not remember anything. They quietly <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> to their car (which is now covered in dust) and drive away.|$|E

When Riley claims she would like to join their group, Marlene refuses, and the two argue, resulting in Marlene threatening to shoot Riley. Ellie intervenes, demanding at gunpoint that Marlene explain how she knows information about Ellie. When Ellie finally lowers the gun, Marlene informs her that she knew Ellie's mother, and had promised her that she would take care of Ellie. Ellie hands the gun to Marlene, who says that she would tell her more about her mother in the future, before telling the girls to leave. When Ellie and Riley reenter the quarantine zone, Riley says that there is no escape. Ellie suggests running away, but Riley informs her that this will just result in death.

5|$|The <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> to Bear Valley {{was very}} slow; at one point, Reed sent ahead {{two of the}} men to {{retrieve}} the first cache of food, expecting the third relief to come at any moment, a small party led by Selim E. Woodworth. A violent blizzard arose after they scaled the pass. Five-year-old Isaac Donner froze to death, and Reed nearly died. Mary Donner's feet were badly burned because they were so frostbitten that she did not realize she was sleeping with them in the fire. When the storm passed, the Breen and Graves families were too apathetic and exhausted to get up and move, not having eaten for days. The relief party {{had no choice but to}} leave without them.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday 3 April 1888, {{following}} the Easter Monday bank holiday, prostitute Emma Elizabeth Smith was assaulted and robbed {{at the junction}} of Osborn Street and Brick Lane, Whitechapel, {{in the early hours}} of the morning. Although injured, she survived the attack and managed to <b>walk</b> <b>back</b> to her lodging house at 18 George Street, Spitalfields. She told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of them a youth. Mrs Russell took Smith to the London Hospital, where medical examination revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her peritoneum. She developed peritonitis and died at 9am on 4 April 1888. The inquest was conducted on 7 April by the coroner for East Middlesex, Wynne Edwin Baxter, who also conducted inquests on six of the later victims. The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police, Edmund Reid of H Division Whitechapel, investigated the attack but the culprits were never caught. Walter Dew, a detective constable stationed with H Division, later wrote that he thought Smith was the first victim of Jack the Ripper, but his colleagues suspected it was the work of a criminal gang. Smith claimed that she was attacked by a group of men, but either refused to or could not describe them. Prostitutes were often managed by gangs, and Smith could have been attacked by her pimps as a punishment for disobeying them, or as part of their intimidation. She may not have identified her attackers because she feared reprisal, and her murder is unlikely to be connected with the later killings.|$|E

50|$|Five years later, {{the band}} held a reunion gig in 1999, and this led on {{to a new}} album, <b>Walking</b> <b>Back</b> Home, with the band now working on a {{part-time}} basis. The <b>Walking</b> <b>Back</b> Home album combines eight songs that were brand new compositions, previously unreleased tracks, or released only with limited availability, with nine previously released Deacon Blue songs. In this sense, it is not purely a studio album nor a typical compilation album. Because, however, <b>Walking</b> <b>Back</b> Home {{marked the beginning of}} a new period of reformation and activity for the group, it is a significant album in their catalogue. The band released another album, Homesick, in 2001.|$|R

25|$|Backyard cricket, Beach cricket, Street cricket are all {{different}} names {{used to describe}} {{a wide range of}} related informal games. The rules are often ad hoc, and the laws of cricket, such as those involving leg before wicket, penalty runs, and others, are ignored or modified to suit both the setting and participants' preferences. In India and Pakistan, there is Gali cricket ('gali' in Hindi means 'street'. It is pronounced as 'gully' but {{should not be confused with}} the fielding position). Often, there are no teams, and each player plays for himself, and fields when he is not batting. Often, there is one wicket, and one bowling position, and no overs.
