40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} family <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> use and the barriers in accessing family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> among urban poor women in Pakistan. Data were collected from a household survey of 5338 married women of reproductive age (15 - 45) from slum areas of six cities. The use of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> by women in urban slums is strongly linked to individual and household socioeconomic factors. In particular, women were ten {{times more likely to}} have used a family <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> if her husband approved. This research has highlighted two key issues regarding the provision of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> to the urban poor. First, the urban poor cannot be treated as a homogenous group; there exist important socio-demographic variations within the urban poor population in relation to their use of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> and the barriers faced in service utilization. Second, although the urban poor are both economically and physically disadvantaged in access to services, women identified socio-cultural factors as the greatest barrier to family <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> use. This finding is consistent with studies focusing on the general population of Pakistan. ...|$|R

First, preconception care is more likely if pregnancies are planned, and family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> encourage pregnancy <b>planning.</b> Second, family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> usually include counseling, and counseling provides an opportunity to discuss the advantages of preconception care. However, the potential of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> to promote preconception care is limited by underutilization of these services and inadequate attention to preconception care during family planning visits. This article suggests ways to reduce these problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to empirically examine the {{determinants}} of demand for family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> in Kenya’s slums using a binomial logit model. The study revealed low usage of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> due to various factors. In order of significance, these include partner’s approval, quality of the services, friendliness of the staff administering the services and the woman’s knowledge about family <b>planning</b> <b>services.</b> Others were the woman’s income level, proximity to the provider and the religious background of the woman. In lieu of the findings, various recommendations were suggested to enhance use of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> in the slums as a bold step towards enhance uptake of family <b>planning</b> <b>services.</b> Other than reviving and enhancing the activities of community based distributors, promotion of family planning education and activities at the household level should be carried out. Similarly, formation of lobby groups to enhance cultural change, as well as awareness creation and counselling, and integration of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> with HIV/AIDS were also been recommended. </p...|$|R

Methods: This study used secondary data analysis {{from the results of}} the Intercensal Population Survey (SUPAS) in 2015. The sample is 189, 652 ever married women, aged 10 - 54 years in all provinces in Indonesia, and have received family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> both before and during JKN. The analysis used chi-square test. Result: One year after the introduction of the JKN program, the proportion of contraceptive use including the Long-term Contraceptive Method (LTCM) fell significantly compared to before JKN, whereas injections and pills remained high. Family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> at Puskesmas increased sharply, while hospital and government service both went down and services by doctors and private practice midwives remained high. Utilization of BPJS health card for family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> is still low. The use of BPJS Health card for family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> has a significant relationship to the use of LTCM. Conclusion: Non contraceptive use of LTCM is still high. Utilization of BPJS health card for family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> is still low, whereas the use of BPJS health card has almost four chance to encourage the use of KB MKJP...|$|R

This paper challenges such a view, and highlights some important dimensions {{of the relationship between}} planners and users of the <b>planning</b> <b>service</b> that have been overlooked in previous studies. It draws on sociological research into consumption to interrogate the various logics that underlie the concept of “customer-focused” <b>planning</b> <b>services,</b> and shows that they are typically based on an oversimplification of the relationships involved in both producing and consuming <b>planning</b> <b>services.</b> In particular, analyses of these reforms tend to underplay the demands that are made of consumers of <b>planning</b> <b>services.</b> The new analytic framework that is presented is illustrated with a case study that investigates the experience of small businesses when applying for planning permission...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Both {{availability}} {{and quality of}} family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> {{are believed to have}} contributed to increasing contraceptive use and declining fertility rates in developing countries. Yet, there is limited empirical evidence to show the relationship between the quality of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> and the population based prevalence of contraceptive methods. This study examined the relationship between quality of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> and use of intrauterine devices (IUD) in Egypt. Methods The analysis used data from the 2003 Egypt Interim Demographic and Health Survey (EIDHS) that included 8, 445 married women aged 15 – 49, and the 2002 Egypt Service Provision Assessment (ESPA) survey that included 602 facilities offering family <b>planning</b> <b>services.</b> The EIDHS collected latitude and longitude coordinates of all sampled clusters, and the ESPA collected these coordinates for all sampled facilities. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) methods, individual women were linked to a facility located within 10 km of their community. A facility-level index was constructed to reflect the quality of family <b>planning</b> <b>services.</b> Four dimensions of quality of care were examined: counseling, examination room, supply of contraceptive methods, and management. Effects of quality of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> on the use of IUD and other contraceptive methods were estimated using multinomial logistic regression. Results are presented as relative risk ratios (RRR) with significance levels (p -values). Results IUD use among women who obtained their method from public sources was significantly positively associated with quality of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> (RRR = 1. 36, p Conclusion This study is one among the few that used geographic information to link data from a population-based survey with an independently sampled health facility survey. The findings demonstrate that service quality is an important determinant of use of clinical contraceptive methods in Egypt. Improving quality of family <b>planning</b> <b>services</b> may help further increase use of clinical contraceptive methods and reduce fertility. </p...|$|R
