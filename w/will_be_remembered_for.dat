25|$|Walsh {{is one of}} {{only four}} bowlers to have bowled over 5000 overs in Test cricket, the other three being spinners: Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka and Shane Warne of Australia, and Anil Kumble of India. These four, in {{addition}} to Glenn McGrath are also the only bowlers to have taken 500 or more Test wickets. Among the five, Walsh {{is the only one who}} has not taken 8 or more wickets in an innings. In ODIs, Walsh was not as successful although he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> his best performance, 5 wickets for just 1 run against Sri Lanka in 1986. In first-class cricket, he took 5 wickets in an innings more than 100 times and 10 wickets in a match 20 times.|$|E
25|$|The finals of the 1991 season <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> {{the number}} of {{international}} cricketers {{who were part of}} the match with Kapil Dev, Chetan Sharma, Ajay Jadeja and Vijay Yadav turning up for Haryana and Bombay cricket team represented by Sanjay Manjrekar, Vinod Kambli, Sachin Tendulkar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Chandrakant Pandit, Salil Ankola and Abey Kuruvilla. Deepak Sharma (199), Ajay Jadeja (94) and Chetan Sharma (98) helped Haryana to a score of 522 while Yogendra Bhandari (5 wickets) and Kapil Dev (3 wickets) restricted Bombay to 410 runs in the first innings. A crucial 41 from Kapil and top scorer Banerjee (60) took Haryana to 242 runs, setting Bombay a target of 355 runs. After the initial wickets, Vengsarkar (139) and Tendulkar (96) fought back for the Bombay team. After Tendulkar's dismissal, Haryana took the final 6 wickets for 102 runs and Vengsarkar and Bombay were stranded 3 runs short of the target. Kapil won his maiden and only Ranji Trophy championship.|$|E
25|$|Clarke's {{spending}} {{had left}} Leeds in a precarious financial situation, and Gray {{was forced to}} concentrate on youth development to rebuild the team. Gray had no {{money to spend on}} team building, and those players he developed were often sold off as well. Young players to emerge during this period included Neil Aspin, Denis Irwin, John Sheridan, Scott Sellars and Bob Taylor – who all enjoyed considerable success at other clubs after leaving Leeds. The 1984–85 season saw Leeds take the promotion battle to the final game, but lost 1–0 away to Birmingham City. However, that game <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> all the wrong reasons by both clubs due to a high-profile hooliganism incident at St Andrew's stadium. Leeds fans rioted at the game, causing a wall to collapse and crushing a 14-year-old boy to death. 96 policemen were injured, hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage was caused by vandalism and graffiti, and the collapsed wall also crushed several parked motor vehicles beyond repair.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} round, the Oilers faced the Winnipeg Jets. Trailing the series 3–1 and {{trailing}} Game 5 by the identical score, the Oilers rallied {{to win the}} next three and take the series. In the division final, the Oilers met Los Angeles for the second-straight season. Edmonton swept the series 4–0, outscoring the Kings 22–10. The Oilers then met the Chicago Blackhawks in the Campbell Conference Final and fell behind 2–1 in the series. However, the Oilers won the next three games to earn a rematch of the 1988 Stanley Cup Finals with Boston. The Final <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> Game 1, which still stands as the longest Stanley Cup Final game played in the modern NHL. Despite being soundly outshot by the Bruins, the Oilers won the game 3–2 when Petr Klima—benched {{for much of the}} game, and thus the only player on either team who not exhausted—scored at 15:13 of the third overtime period. The Oilers would go on to defeat the Bruins in five games, and win their first Cup without Gretzky. For his superlative goaltending, Bill Ranford was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.|$|E
500|$|Historian and {{political}} scientist James MacGregor Burns observed of Nixon, [...] "How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president, so brilliant and so morally lacking?" [...] Nixon's biographers disagree {{on how he}} will be perceived by history. According to Ambrose, [...] "Nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished. What he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> is the nightmare he put the country through {{in his second term}} and for his resignation." [...] Irwin Gellman, who chronicled Nixon's congressional career, suggests that [...] "he was remarkable among his congressional peers, a success story in a troubled era, one who steered a sensible anti-Communist course against the excess of McCarthy". Aitken feels that [...] "Nixon, both as a man and as a statesman, has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues. Yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism, no simple verdict is possible." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conclusion}} of the serial in March brought similar praise.

It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> an intimate sense of character, powerful enough to make you forgive its faults and stay loyal to the end," [...] was the verdict of The Independent on the final episode. Writing in the same newspaper the following day, Jeffrey Richards added that [...] "Monday night's final episode of Our Friends in the North has left many people bereft. The serial captivated much of the country, sketching a panoramic view of life in Britain from the sixties to the nineties... At once sweeping and intimate, both moving and angry, simultaneously historical and contemporary, it has followed in the distinguished footsteps of BBC series such as Boys from the Blackstuff." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{match was}} hailed {{as one of the}} most {{exciting}} finals in modern times, with Alan Hansen declaring: [...] "the best final ever." [...] Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier hailed his players after the match: [...] "When you play in a European final, you are looking for immortality. People remember who was playing and when you look at programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> a long time — and that is thanks to Alavés too." [...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but I will put up with that. We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all I know is that our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E
500|$|Barfi!s soundtrack {{received}} positive reviews by critics. Hindustan Times {{rated the}} album 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "verall, the soundtrack is a joyride sans flaws.

There are no foot-tapping numbers or remixes here, but the simplicity {{that makes this}} album a winner." [...] Koimoi gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "In simple words, Barfi! is excellent music on all counts. Very rarely does one get to hear an album where you can hear a complete soundtrack without skipping tracks; {{this is one of}} them. So, just play, enjoy the music and the world of Barfi!". Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated [...] "Barfi!s soundtrack is quite good and is easily one of the best quality creations by Pritam. He has totally reinvented himself with this album which defies Bollywood norms and boasts of a sound of its own." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} review, Billboard called the record [...] "short, to the point, and bristling with attitude," [...] and {{predicted}} it would poise the band for commercial breakthrough. In a less enthusiastic review, Rolling Stone Neva Chonin wrote, [...] "It's all harmless but still gnarly enough to foment {{the kind of}} anti-everything rebellion that spawned rock & roll {{way back in the}} day." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic desbribed it as a [...] "fun record that's better than the average neo-punk release." [...] Kerrang! wrote that the album includes [...] "enough energy, attitude and cracking songs here to ensure that blink <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> more than just onstage nudity." [...] The catchy, pop sensibility of the album was praised by Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club, describing the band as finding success within a [...] "well-worn genre" [...] (punk rock). The New York Times also designated the record its 'Album of the Week'. The record did have its detractors: British music publication New Musical Express (NME) gave the record a very poor review, calling the record despicable, [...] "wholly toothless and soulless" [...] and deriding the band as [...] "as bad, as meaningless, as the cock-rockers and hippy wankers punk originally sought to destroy." ...|$|E

2500|$|That {{particular}} session <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>for</b> some of {{the worst}} bowling ever witnessed by England fans. [...] The attack was blatantly tired (from 2+ days in the field) but displayed their lack of fitness by still being tired even after 2 days off (rest days on Sundays were still the case in 1989). [...] The Australian batsmen scored at over a run a ball that morning as Gower was left with 3 bowlers. [...] In his autobiography, Gower remarked how bad a game Newport had had such that he was allowed only 5 overs (which cost 22 runs) in the second innings. [...] It should also be remembered that the chance of victory for Australia was slim at best - declaring only around an hour before lunch to take ten wickets. [...] The England bowlers were therefore demotivated by the feeling of going through the motions during that hour and the result was the fast scoring which firmly ensured there could be only one winner.|$|E
