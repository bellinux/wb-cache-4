5|$|Widespread strikes marked 1922, {{as labor}} sought redress for falling wages and {{increased}} unemployment. In April, 500,000 coal miners, led by John L. Lewis, struck over wage cuts. Mining executives {{argued that the}} industry <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> hard times; Lewis accused them of {{trying to break the}} union. As the strike became protracted, Harding offered compromise to settle it. As Harding proposed, the miners agreed to return to work, and Congress created a commission to look into their grievances.|$|E
5|$|It was at Pennsylvania in 1901 that Pound met Hilda Doolittle (later {{known as}} the poet H.D.), his first serious romance, {{according}} to Pound scholar Ira Nadel. In 1911 she followed Pound to London and became involved in developing the Imagism movement. Between 1905 and 1907 Pound wrote several poems for her, 25 of which he hand-bound and called Hilda's Book, and in 1908 he asked her father, the astronomy professor Charles Doolittle, for permission to marry her, but Doolittle dismissed Pound as a nomad. Pound <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> two other women at the same time—Viola Baxter and Mary Moore—later dedicating a book of poetry, Personae (1909), to the latter. He asked Moore to marry him too, but she turned him down.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 1850, Joseph Terry {{had been}} granted freedom of the city due to the {{economic}} growth York <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> fueled by his company's success. Chairmanships of local guilds were to follow; with York's Merchant Taylor's and Merchant Adventurer's both seeing the benefit of representation from a well respected and moneyed benefactor. Other local organizations followed suit; with the York Art Gallery, Horticultural Society and local waterworks company all receiving funding and financial direction {{by the end of}} his career.

5|$|One of President Garfield's more wearying duties <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> office seekers, {{and he saw}} Guiteau {{at least}} once. White House {{officials}} suggested to Guiteau that he approach Blaine, as the consulship was within the Department of State. Blaine also saw the public regularly, and Guiteau became a regular at these sessions. Blaine, who {{had no intention of}} giving Guiteau a position he was unqualified for and had not earned, simply stated that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship, which required Senate confirmation. Once the New York senators had resigned, and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector, Guiteau pressed his claim, and Blaine told him he would not receive the position.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the film}} would not feature any songs, the {{directors}} hired James Newton Howard to compose the score. Approaching it as a live-action film, Howard {{decided to have}} different musical themes for the cultures of the surface world and Atlantis. In the case of Atlantis, Howard chose an Indonesian orchestral sound incorporating chimes, bells, and gongs. The directors told Howard that the film would {{have a number of}} key scenes without dialogue; the score would need to convey emotionally what the viewer <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> on screen.|$|E
5|$|Makinti's {{first contact}} with white people <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> them riding camels, {{when she was}} living at Lupul.

On the one hand, congenitally blind participants did not comprehend better UNDERSTANDING is GRASPING expressions than UNDERSTANDING <b>is</b> <b>SEEING</b> expressions.

5|$|The Clevedon branch <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> {{increased}} passenger traffic, up to 26 trains {{daily and}} 10 on Sundays by 1958, and in 1956 the unusual canopy was taken down, {{replaced by a}} second-hand canopy from Dauntsey railway station. However, this uptick was not to last: coal traffic along the line ended in 1951, and by 1963 there were no longer any freight workings. The line closed completely on 3 October 1966, taking the station's bookstall with it. The Claverham loops had been closed on 6 September 1964, and the goods yard at Yatton was closed on 29 November 1965. The now-redundant bay platforms were converted into car parks, and the canopy on the westbound platform removed along with the two water towers. On 24 January 1972, the passing loops {{to the west of}} the station were cut back to , and the station's signal box, which had had 129 levers, closed on 31 January the same year.|$|E
5|$|The King of Sparta– Featured in God of War comic #6. The King's Guard was {{convinced}} by Kratos' wife Lysandra to allow Kratos {{to embark on}} a quest for the Ambrosia that would restore their plague-stricken daughter, Calliope. Kratos and his men were given until the next full moon to return before the King executed his daughter. Ultimately successful, Kratos returned, saved Calliope, and gave the rest of the elixir to the King. The King then officially awarded Kratos with the rank of Captain. The King of Sparta also appears as an illusion created by Tisiphone in Ascension where he honors Kratos for his service as his best general. Kratos believed what he <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> at first until he saw Tisiphone's ring on the king's finger. He kicked Tisiphone off the balcony, dispelling her illusion. When Kratos {{was on the verge of}} victory over the Furies, Tisiphone changed into the form of the King once again, telling him that he was unworthy of being called a Spartan. The character was voiced by Crispin Freeman in Ascension.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Chicago work {{went on a}} tour {{of eight}} cities before returning to Chicago in 1933 where it was displayed at the World's Fair. It was in a warehouse until it was purchased by Winston-Salem, North Carolina, artist and collector Joseph Wallace King in 1965. King had first seen the painting in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair. Years later he described the painting and how magnificent it <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> it displayed in Chicago to his friend Ed Grout of Maryland. Mr. Grout arranged a meeting with the nephew of George McConnel and the painting was purchased by Mr. King. King appeared on the panel game show I've Got A Secret on May 30, 1966, displaying a 22' by 25' section of the painting (his secret was that this was only part of the painting). It was revealed that King had been searching for it for some time, and now that he'd found it, he hoped to construct a new cyclorama building.|$|E
