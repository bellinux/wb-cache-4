The methodology for the assessment of vegetative accompaniment was developed on the basis of literature search and field experience. The ground of the assessment is a field research in each locality. The main characteristic of stream and the existing state of riparian stands are recorded and then assessed on the basis of proposed criteria. Clasification system developed for comparison of <b>watercourses</b> or their stretches and for determination of restoration principles and maintenance of vegetative accompaniment includes five classes of management...|$|R
5|$|A second {{expedition}} {{was mounted}} shortly thereafter, and Throsby's nephew Charles Throsby Smith, Wild and Vaughan further explored the Molonglo (Ngambri) and Queanbeyan (Jullergung) Rivers, {{becoming the first}} Europeans to camp at the site. However, they failed to find the Murrumbidgee, and Smith declared that the river did not exist. The issue of the Murrumbidgee was solved in 1821, when Charles Throsby mounted a third expedition and successfully reached the <b>watercourse,</b> on the way providing the first detailed account of the land where Canberra now resides.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour then resumed her course northward and {{parallel}} to the reef, the crew looking for a safe harbour in which to make repairs. On 13 June, the ship came to a broad <b>watercourse</b> that Cook named the Endeavour River. Cook attempted to enter the river mouth, but strong winds and rain prevented Endeavour from crossing the bar until the morning of 17 June. She grounded briefly on a sand spit but was refloated an hour later and warped into the river proper by early afternoon. The ship was promptly beached on the southern bank and careened to make repairs to the hull. Torn sails and rigging were also replaced and the hull scraped free of barnacles.|$|E
5|$|The {{south bank}} of the Potomac River forms the District's border with Virginia and has two major tributaries: the Anacostia River and Rock Creek. Tiber Creek, a natural <b>watercourse</b> that once passed through the National Mall, was fully {{enclosed}} underground during the 1870s. The creek also formed {{a portion of the}} now-filled Washington City Canal, which allowed passage through the city to the Anacostia River from 1815 until the 1850s. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal starts in Georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the Little Falls of the Potomac River, located at the northwest edge of Washington at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} {{importance of}} benthic diatoms in Mediterranean <b>watercourses</b> has received limited academic attention historically. This {{study sought to}} provide baseline information for this poorly studied group. Temporary and permanent <b>watercourses</b> in Portugal differ in catchment characteristics, climatic variables and water chemistry. The benthic diatom communities were characterized in terms of ecological preferences and conservation status for taxa with relative abundance above 1 % {{in at least one}} site covering 39 temporary sites (109 taxa) and 53 permanent sites (130 taxa). The low-profile guild dominated both temporary and permanent <b>watercourses,</b> followed by the high-profile and motile guilds. Indicator value analysis indicated that Amphora copulata, Cocconeis placentula, Diploneis separanda, Encyonopsis subminuta, Fragilaria radians, Gomphonema olivaceum, Gomphonema truncatum, Halamphora veneta, Navicula radiosa, Navicula veneta, Sellaphora seminulum and Ulnaria acus were indicators of temporary <b>watercourses,</b> whereas Encyonema minutum, Eunotia minor, Fragilaria rumpens, Fragilaria cf. socia and Navicula rhynchocephala were characteristic of permanent <b>watercourses.</b> Ecological preferences of indicator taxa were inferred on the basis of environmental variables that differed significantly between temporary and permanent <b>watercourses.</b> The importance of temporary <b>watercourses</b> for the maintenance of diatom biodiversity is discussed and explored...|$|R
50|$|The {{species can}} be found {{along the banks of}} <b>watercourses,</b> as well as the {{floodplains}} of those <b>watercourses.</b> Due to the proximity to these <b>watercourses,</b> river red gum is subject to regular flooding in its natural habitat. River red gum prefers soils with clay content. The trees not only rely on rainfall but also on regular flooding, since flooding recharges the sub-soil with water.|$|R
5|$|A {{river is}} a natural <b>watercourse,</b> usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river {{is said to be}} larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} was made, but in 2005 the Environment Agency and the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust promoted {{the formation of}} the Itchen Navigation Trust. They were committed to conserving the remains, rather than a full restoration to navigable standards. A request was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund in the United Kingdom for funds to restore the <b>watercourse.</b> Known as The Itchen Navigation Heritage Trail Project, funding was granted and a five-year restoration project began. Work has included widening the aperture at College Mead Lock and the construction of a bypass channel around Malm Lock to assist the movement of fish and other aquatic fauna. The navigation has been designated a European Special Area of Conservation as well as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, due to the rich diversity of wildlife found along the system, and its historical importance.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1610, {{works on}} the {{aqueduct}} continued {{under the direction of}} another Jesuit called Padre Natale Tomasucci. By this time, Garzez had died and was succeeded as Grand Master by Alof de Wignacourt. In July 1612, the Bolognese hydraulic expert Bontadino de Bontadini took over the project, probably on the recommendation of Inquisitor Evangelista Carbonesi. Bontadini designed a new <b>watercourse</b> with water being carried through underwater pipes, and over stone arches when there were depressions in the ground. Bontadini was assisted by a Maltese capomastro Giovanni Attard and several other engineers. 600 local workers were employed {{in the construction of the}} aqueduct, which was completed in 1614 and inaugurated on 21 April 1615. The aqueduct cost a total of 434,605 scudi, most of which were paid by Grand Master Wignacourt. The aqueduct was therefore named in his honour.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} {{side of the}} massif lies mostly within Italy and is {{bounded by}} the Val Veny and Val Ferret whose watercourses meet just above the town of Courmayeur. From Courmayeur these waters flow southwards as the Dora Baltea towards Aosta, eventually joining the Po river. However, the extreme southwestern end of the massif does lie within France and is bounded by the Vallée des Glaciers (which connects to the Val Veny over the watershed of the col de la Seigne), and its waters flow southwards towards the Isère river and onwards to the Rhône. The northeastern end of the massif falls within Switzerland, and is bounded by a separate valley, confusingly also called Val Ferret, and which separates it from the Pennine Alps further east. Its <b>watercourse,</b> la Dranse de Ferret, flows northwards to join the Rhône at Martigny.|$|E
5|$|Villages {{were usually}} {{concentrated}} around irrigation reservoirs to enable {{easy access to}} water for agriculture. Houses stood immediately below the reservoir embankment, between {{the water and the}} paddy fields below. This facilitated easy control of the water supply to the fields and also supported maintenance of domestic gardens for fruit and vegetable production. A village typically consisted of a cluster of dwellings, paddy fields, a reservoir, a grazing ground, shift crop reserves and a village forest. In areas of high rainfall, a perennial <b>watercourse</b> often took the place of the reservoir. Inland fishing was widespread during the Anuradhapura Kingdom period because of the numerous reservoirs. Although not entirely absent, sea fishing was not common during this period mainly because of the rudimentary nature of transporting sea fish to cities which were located far inland.|$|E
5|$|Dawson Creek {{is named}} after the <b>watercourse</b> of the same name, itself named after George Mercer Dawson who led a {{surveying}} team through the area in August 1879; {{a member of the}} team labelled the creek with Dawson's name. The community that formed by the creek was one of many farming communities established by European-Canadian settlers moving west through the Peace River Country. When the Canadian government began issuing homestead grants to settlers in 1912, the pace of migration increased. With the opening of a few stores and hotels in 1919 and the incorporation of the Dawson Creek Co-operative Union on 28 May 1921, Dawson Creek became a dominant business centre in the area. After much speculation by land owners and investors, the Northern Alberta Railways built its western terminus 3km (2mi) from Dawson Creek. The golden spike was driven on 29 December 1930, and the first passenger train arrived on 15 January 1931. The arrival of the railway and the construction of grain elevators attracted more settlers and business to the settlement. The need to provide services for the rapidly growing community led Dawson Creek to incorporate as a village in May 1936. A small wave of refugees from the Sudetenland settled in the area in 1939 as World War II was beginning. The community exceeded 500 people in 1941.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{steepness}} {{and orientation}} of the Darling Scarp, <b>watercourses</b> run off the scarp in a westerly direction. On reaching the Swan Coastal Plain, they encounter two obstacles: firstly, the high permeability of the soil results {{in the loss of}} much water. Much flow is lost, and some <b>watercourses</b> simply cease to flow, for example, Wungong Brook, Cardup Brook, and Manjedal Brook. Secondly, the sequence of north-to-south-oriented dunes create obstacles to further westerly flow. Many <b>watercourses</b> turn at right angles and flow south or north along the dune swales, and in some cases this allows multiple <b>watercourses</b> to coalesce. For example, on reaching the coastal plain, Ellen Brook runs south for around 30 km, picking up a number of <b>watercourses</b> along the way, before finally emptying into the Swan River. Another example is the Serpentine River, which runs west to less than 10 km from the coast, then turns south, running parallel with the coast for nearly 20 km before disgorging into Peel Inlet.|$|R

As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the <b>watercourse).</b> Through the open window other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E

40|$|Today, {{three factors}} {{relating}} to fresh water sources are universally recognized: first, fresh {{water is a}} finite and shrinking resource, essential to sustain life, development, and the environment; second, the effective development and management of fresh water resources requires the participation and cooperation of all users, planners, and policy makers; and third, fresh water has an economic value in all its compelling uses and should, therefore, be recognized as an economic good. More than two decades ago, recognizing that many nations share international <b>watercourses,</b> {{members of the international}} community felt that an agreement was needed to codify the rules regulating international <b>watercourses,</b> to minimize environmental damage, and to ensure each state an equitable share in the use of such <b>watercourses.</b> The international community also recognized that because any such international agreement would require the harmonization of a variety of concepts, principles, and interests, and would involve addressing a host of political, legal, economic, and geographic factors implicating vital state interests, an umbrella agreement for regulating international <b>watercourses</b> was needed. The international community envisaged that such an umbrella agreement would set out general rules applicable to all international <b>watercourses</b> and would be complimented by other, more specific, local agreements. The duty to cooperate and notify other riparian states about planned measures for shared <b>watercourses</b> and the obligation not to cause significant harm to other states 2 ̆ 7 <b>watercourses</b> were among the cornerstone articles of customary law for the envisaged umbrella agreement. Bangladesh has always attached paramount importance to the evolution and elaboration of universal rules of law that regulate international <b>watercourses</b> through comprehensive national, regional, and global regimes.
