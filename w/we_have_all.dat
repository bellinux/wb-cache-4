25|$|In {{place of}} these, Gowen {{proposed}} his own reorganization plan based, one more time, upon optimistic earnings estimates {{and his ability}} to attract new money into the company. Also, one more time, his oration carried the audience into great enthusiasm. Such was the momentum generated by Gowen's overall campaign that Keim conceded the January 1886 presidential election in advance; Gowen and his Board of Managers slate were elected unanimously and adopted a resolution calling for a change in the receivership. Notwithstanding the optimistic reorganization plan Gowen rode back into the presidency, shareholder enthusiasm and a board resolution were insufficient to remove the Reading from its deeply troubled circumstance. Before Gowen was able to mobilize any of the money required to take action, Morgan reentered the arena, this time heading a syndicate that offered to return peace and prosperity to the company through a different means. An anonymous member of Morgan's syndicate described a central element of the proposed peace:In order to do this it has been found necessary to get rid of Mr. Gowen. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> combined {{to get him out of}} railroad management, just as all the powers of Europe combined to crush Napoleon, and there will be no peace until Mr. Gowen is in St. Helena. He is an able and brilliant man and in some respects a veritable Napoleon, but he is no railroad manager.... The trouble with Mr. Gowen is that he wants to be fighting all the time. When he was after the Molly Maguires he was in his element, but as a railroad manager he is a failure.|$|E

500|$|In the VH1 special Madonna Speaks, {{the artist}} further {{clarified}} that the theme behind [...] "Hollywood", {{as well as}} [...] "American Life" [...] And [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] from the album, was about her [...] "wanting to shout from the rooftops that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> {{been living in a}} dream. I have been living in a dream — and you're all living in a dream and we have to wake up to reality." [...] Madonna's first single from American Life—the title track—became the lowest charting first single from a Madonna album since her debut, reaching a peak of number37 on the Billboard Hot 100. Warner Bros. Records hastily wanted to save the album from dropping off the charts, and decided to release [...] "Hollywood", believing the song to have commercial success potential.|$|E
500|$|The Maharishi had {{arranged}} a simple lifestyle for his guests, which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting. The days {{were devoted to}} meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi, who spoke from a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, nominally due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation, relaxation, {{and away from the}} media throng – helped the band to relax. Harrison told Saltzman, [...] "Like, we're The Beatles after all, aren't we? <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the money you could ever dream of. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the fame you could ever wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?" [...] Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him. At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was [...] "amiable but non-talkative", and during an awkward silence Lennon walked across the room and patted the Maharishi on the head, saying, [...] "There's a good little guru" [...] while the room erupted in laughter. Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours. Boyd's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well, but also suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive. Like the 60 other students at the ashram, the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men, which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} team maintained heavily enforced security around the film. Karl Urban revealed, [...] " [...] {{level of security}} and secrecy that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> been forced to adopt. I mean, it's really kind of paranoid crazy, but sort of justified. We're not allowed to walk around in public in our costumes {{and we have to}} be herded around everywhere in these golf carts that are completely concealed and covered in black canvas. The security of it is immense. You feel your freedom is a big challenge." [...] Actors like Jennifer Morrison were only given the scripts of their scenes. The film's shooting script was fiercely protected even with the main cast. Simon Pegg said, [...] "I read [...] with a security guard near me – it's that secretive." [...] The film used the fake working title of Corporate Headquarters. Some of the few outside of the production allowed to visit the set included Rod Roddenberry, Ronald D. Moore, Jonathan Frakes, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, Ben Stiller, Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg (who had partially convinced Abrams to direct because he liked the script, and he even advised the action scenes during his visit).|$|E
500|$|In {{the words}} of Nicholas C. Pano, [...] "Khrushchev {{attempted}} to transform the Bucharest Conference into a communist summit meeting {{for the purpose of}} securing the condemnation of the Chinese" [...] with Kapo being the only representative of a European party [...] "to refrain from criticizing Peking, to attack Yugoslav revisionism, and to refuse to alter his stand on the Chinese and Yugoslav issues despite Soviet pressure. Khrushchev's hopes of bringing the Albanians to heel by means of peaceful persuasion were certainly shattered by the time the Bucharest Conference had come to an end." [...] During the Conference Hoxha communicated with Kapo via radiogram, stating for instance on June 24, in response to a lengthy document distributed at the Conference by the Soviets attacking the Chinese, [...] "When you make your speech at the meeting you should declare: 'I am not authorized to make statements on these matters because our leadership knows that these matters will be discussed at the forthcoming Meeting of representatives of the parties, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> agreed.'... We understand your difficult situation, but don't worry at all, for we are on the right road." ...|$|E
500|$|Back in London at M's office, Bond is {{informed}} that Blofeld intends {{to hold the}} world to ransom by threatening to destroy its agriculture using his brainwashed women. Apart from money, Blofeld demands amnesty for all past crimes and to be recognised as Count de Bleuchamp. M tells 007 that the ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond then enlists Draco and his forces to attack Blofeld's headquarters, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsleigh, with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch and injures his neck. Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal, then drive away in Bond's Aston Martin. When Bond pulls over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car, Blofeld (wearing a neck brace) and Bunt open fire on the couple's car. Bond survives, but Tracy is killed in the attack. When a police officer arrives to help, a tearful Bond cradles Tracy's body and says: [...] "It's all right. It's quite all right, really. She's having a rest. We'll be going on soon. There's no hurry you see, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> {{the time in the}} world." ...|$|E

500|$|... "A Time Machine Is My New Girlfriend" [...] is a frenetic rocker with a Bo Diddley rhythm, {{and lyrics}} cautioning {{listeners}} that relationships can come with [...] "late fees". Hunt explained its lyrics to be {{a metaphor for}} his lover making him feel younger. The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs. It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood. The setting is described in the first verse, [...] "It's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap-toothed / end of white flight / maybe now you see something you like / money tight and you're hating your life". Hunt said that writing the song was [...] "essentially a response {{to some of the}} things I have seen {{as a result of the}} global recession we are going through. I wasn't trying to make any political statement. I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially says <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> these unspoken issues in our society. But I see a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues. My question is what could you have been hoping for when we make the kind of decisions in our society that we have made." ...|$|E
500|$|In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, Clarke infuses her dry wit with prosaic quaintness. For example, {{the narrator}} notes: [...] "It has been remarked (by a lady {{infinitely}} cleverer {{than the present}} author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised {{to life in the}} early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week." [...] As Michel Faber explains in his review for The Guardian, [...] "here <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the defining features of Clarke's style simultaneously: the archly Austenesque tone, the somewhat overdone quaintness ("upon the Tuesday"), the winningly matter-of-fact use of the supernatural, and drollness to spare." [...] Gregory Maguire notes in The New York Times that Clarke even gently ridicules the genre of the novel itself: [...] " [...] picks up a book and begins to read...but he is not attending to what he reads and he has got to Page 22 before he discovers it is a novel– the sort of work which above all others he most despises– and he puts it down in disgust." [...] Elsewhere, the narrator remarks, [...] "Dear Emma does not waste her energies upon novels like other young women." [...] The narrator's identity has been a topic of discussion, with Clarke declaring that said narrator is female and omniscient rather than a future scholar from within the real storyline as some had suggested.|$|E
500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge I want him {{to be the one to}} oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E

500|$|Stevenage's league {{campaign}} {{got off to}} {{a typically}} patchy start; with the side recording just one win from their first five games of the season. Following a 2–1 defeat to Oxford United in August 2009, the team went on a 17-game unbeaten run that stretched four months from August to December 2009, propelling the club into the top two. Unlike in previous seasons, the club were performing strongly away from home, and secured victories at the likes of Luton Town and Mansfield Town. A 4–1 victory against Cambridge United on New Year's Day ultimately meant that Stevenage hit top-spot {{for the first time in}} the season. However, two defeats on the road within the space of a week in February meant that rivals Oxford United had an eight–point lead going into March 2010. The team responded well, winning eight games on the bounce; including an important 1–0 victory over Oxford United in late March, subsequently replacing Oxford at the top of the table. Borough brushed aside a late challenge from Luton Town, securing promotion to the Football League with two games to spare following a 2–0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough. The team won their last six games of the league campaign without conceding a single goal, and recorded 42 points from a possible 45 from their last 15 league fixtures. Stevenage finished the season having amassed a total of 99 points from 44 games, winning the league by 11 points, with Westley winning many plaudits for the way he had secured promotion despite considerably less resources than a lot of the teams in the division. The promotion means Westley has led Stevenage to the Football League for the first time in their history, as well as managing a Football League team for the first time in his managerial career. Westley also guided the club to another FA Trophy Final; this time losing 2–1 after extra-time against Barrow at Wembley Stadium. At the end of the season, Westley signed a new two-year contract; keeping him contracted to the club until 2012. On signing the new deal, Westley said [...] "I am grateful for all the support that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> been given in the past two years. I am delighted to have the opportunity to manage the launch of the club into the Football League". In his first two seasons back at the club, from May 2008 to May 2010, Westley has been in charge for 114 games, winning a total of 70 games – recording a win percentage of 61.40%.|$|E
