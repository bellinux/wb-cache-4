500|$|Beginning in August 1968, McCain was {{subjected}} to a program of severe torture. He was bound and beaten every two hours; this punishment occurred {{at the same time}} that he was suffering from dysentery. Further injuries led McCain to attempt suicide, which was stopped by guards. Eventually, McCain made an anti-U.S. propaganda [...] "confession". He has always felt that his statement was dishonorable, but as he later wrote, [...] "I had learned <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> learned over there: every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine." [...] Many U.S. POWs were tortured and maltreated in order to extract [...] "confessions" [...] and propaganda statements; virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors. McCain received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} and commercially successful films of Hoffman's career was The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), which he considered [...] "as edgy {{as you can get}} for a Hollywood movie". He played a [...] "preppy bully" [...] who taunts Matt Damon's Ripley in the thriller, a character which Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called [...] "the truest upper class twit in all of American movies". Hoffman's performance caught the attention of Meryl Streep– another of his cinematic idols– with his performance: [...] "I sat up straight in my seat and said, 'Who is that?' I thought to myself: My God, this actor is fearless. He's done <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> strive for– he's given this awful character the respect he deserves, and he's made him fascinating." [...] In recognition of his work in Magnolia and The Talented Mr. Ripley, Hoffman was named the year's Best Supporting Actor by the National Board of Review.|$|E
500|$|Nolan's work explores existential, {{ethical and}} {{epistemological}} themes such as subjective experience, distortion of memory, human morality, {{the nature of}} time, causality and construction of personal identity. [...] "I'm fascinated by our subjective perception of reality, {{that we are all}} stuck in a very singular point of view, a singular perspective on <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> agree to be an objective reality, and movies are one {{of the ways in which}} we try to see things from the same point of view". Film critic Tom Shone described Nolan's oeuvre as [...] "epistemological thrillers whose protagonists, gripped by the desire for definitive answers, must negotiate mazy environments in which the truth is always beyond their reach." [...] In an essay titled The rational wonders of Christopher Nolan, film critic Mike D'Angelo argues that the filmmaker is a materialist dedicated to exploring the wonders of the natural world. [...] "Underlying nearly every film he's ever made, no matter how fanciful, is his conviction that the universe can be explained entirely by physical processes." ...|$|E

500|$|Under {{new manager}} Charlie Manuel, whose {{offensive}} strategy predominantly revolved around hitting lots of home runs, Rollins struggled {{to post a}} strong batting average early in the Phillies' 2005 season, as he too tried to hit home runs. Nevertheless, he was again selected to the NL All-Star team. His offensive strategy changed in early August, when he began a hitting streak that spanned the season's final 36 games; during the streak, he hit [...]379. It was the longest hitting streak in Phillies' history, surpassing Ed Delahanty, whose streak lasted 31 games. Throughout the streak, Rollins aspired to maintain a team-first mentality, and noted that he would trade the streak for a playoff berth: [...] "If we lose and I keep the streak, what does that mean? The season is automatically over. The playoffs is everything. That's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> want." [...] Ultimately, the Phillies missed the playoffs by one game. Overall, Rollins compiled his fourth career quadruple-double, tying Johnny Damon for most among active players, and posted a [...]290 batting average with 12 home runs, 54 RBIs, and 41 stolen bases.|$|E
500|$|Johnny Loftus of Allmusic {{classified}} [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] as a nu metal song. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{concluded that}} the song [...] "take things to a more over-the-top, theatrical level." [...] Scott Juba of The Trades rated the song with A, and wrote: [...] "As far as the band's single, 'Everybody's Fool', is concerned, it is a song about the stinging betrayal of deception and the refusal to become blinded by deceit any longer. There is a defiance in Lee's voice that gives the track a bold edge, and the song's heavy drums and soaring guitars further enhance the strong sound. The band surely has another chart topping hit on their hands." [...] Simon Cusens of ABC Online gave the song 3 out of 5 stars calling it [...] "a cold, sad and angry song that I would only like to listen to without it being repeated again." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "rolling acoustic guitar and billowing synthesizers {{pave the way for}} the harsh power chords that open the song" [...] adding that Lee's voice was [...] "disembodied" [...] in the opening lines [...] "Perfect by nature/ Icons of self-indulgence/ Just <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> need/ More lies about a world that/ Never was and never will be." ...|$|E
500|$|Once Upon [...] Time in Mumbai Dobaara! {{received}} mixed-to-negative reviews. Anupama Chopra {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} five stars in The Hindustan Times: [...] "Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbaai Dobaara! had me cheering for the bad guy. Which, {{at least in the}} movies, is never a bad thing. The film gets one extra star for Akshay Kumar, who makes a stellar killer". Madhureeta Mukherjee awarded the film 3.5 out of five stars in The Times of India, telling readers to watch the film only for its flattering dons and their heroines, saying [...] "there's nothing criminal about it!" [...] She praised Milan Luthria for capturing the essence of the film's setting and Kumar's portrayal of Shoaib Khan: [...] "Bhai act with flamboyance and mojo ... He gets a chance to do what he does best – herogiri (albeit less menacing, more entertaining), with charisma and clap-trap dialoguebaazi" [...] but criticised Imran Khan's [...] "ill-at-ease" [...] rogue, {{the second half of the}} film for being [...] "at times too overbearing" [...] and said, [...] "this film has its moments, but it's not as compelling as the prequel." [...] Vinayak Chakrovorty gave the film two-and-a-half out of five stars in India Today: [...] "OUATIMD should remind Bollywood <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> always knew: Never make a sequel just for the heck of it if you don't have a genuine idea to entertain". Subhash K. Jha termed the film as [...] "one of the most ill-timed gangster dramas" [...] criticising the acting of all the three leads, praising only the short cameo of Sonali Bendre.|$|E

500|$|In late August 1968, {{a program}} of {{vigorous}} torture methods began on McCain. The North Vietnamese used rope bindings to put him into prolonged, painful positions and severely beat him every two hours, all while {{he was suffering from}} dysentery. His right leg was reinjured, his ribs were cracked, some teeth were broken at the gumline, and his left arm was re-fractured. Lying in his own waste, his spirit was broken; the beginnings of a suicide attempt were stopped by guards. After four days of this, McCain signed and taped an anti-American propaganda [...] "confession" [...] that said, in part, [...] "I am a black criminal and I have performed the deeds of an air pirate. I almost died, and the Vietnamese people saved my life, thanks to the doctors." [...] He used stilted Communist jargon and ungrammatical language to signal that the statement was forced. McCain was haunted then and since with the belief that he had dishonored his country, his family, his comrades and himself by his statement, but as he later wrote, [...] "I had learned <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> learned over there: Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine." [...] Two weeks later his captors tried to force him to sign a second statement; his will to resist restored, he refused. He sometimes received two to three beatings per week because of his continued resistance; the sustained mistreatment went on for over a year. His refusals to cooperate, laced with loud obscenities directed towards his guards, were often heard by other POWs. His boxing experience from his Naval Academy days helped him withstand the battering, and the North Vietnamese did not break him again.|$|E

It is how the Nazis and Hitler saw Wagner as his own prophet... This perception of Hitler colors for many people the perception of Wagner...

2500|$|Harry Harlow drew {{condemnation}} for his [...] "pit of despair" [...] {{experiments on}} rhesus macaque monkeys at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 1970s. The {{aim of the}} research was to produce an animal model of clinical depression. Harlow also devised what he called a [...] "rape rack", to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture. In 1974, American literary critic Wayne C.

6000|$|What {{the world}} at large really needs, and will one day get, is not this, but due {{recognition}} of the true value of science in education. <b>We</b> don't <b>all</b> want to be made into first-class anatomists like Owen, still less into first-class practical surgeons, like Sir Henry Thompson.

2500|$|The {{story of}} The Car Man differs {{completely}} from {{the plot of}} Bizet's Carmen. Although Bourne has commented {{that at least two}} characters, one male (probably Luca) and one female (Lana), were [...] "like" [...] the character of Carmen, and that Luca himself is [...] "The Car Man", no characters were intended to actually be Carmen. According to Bourne, [...] "I wasn't particularly interested in the story of Carmen, the opera. I didn't even know it that well, and I still don't know it that well, to be honest. I know there are parallels, but it was more the feeling of the music and the feeling of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> know Carmen to be." [...] The story is loosely based on the 1934 novel The Postman Always Rings Twice by American novelist James M. Cain (1892–1977) and the 1946 and 1981 films of the same name respectively starring John Garfield and Lana Turner, and Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{opinions}} regarding an afterlife, Schuldiner responded [...] "I don't know", but elaborated that he believed [...] "this is hell", and that demons are in people, as they [...] "create evil".

In the documentary, [...] "666 at Calling Death", he was asked whether Satanism {{was a part of}} his music. [...] He replied, [...] "Not at all. I really don't want to involve any type of religious theme in our music. I think that's more of a personal thing. [...] Yeah, I'm not a Satanist and I definitely don't put that into our music on purpose. I was really young when the band first started out. I was never really into writing Satanic lyrics at all, personally. [...] We did write gore lyrics, but it was more like kind of tongue-in-cheek, horror-movie type level. Nothing like encouraging people to go out and hurt themselves or anything stupid like that. It's pure fantasy-movie type, scary stuff. And then, I just really got into writing about reality, which is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> have to deal with." ...|$|E

As explained by head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb in 2015, Marvel Studios had [...] "first dibs" [...] on the character once the rights had reverted. Drew Goddard pitched a new Daredevil film to Marvel, but Marvel was not looking to create an R-rated film, and Goddard did not want a [...] "watered down version" [...] of the character, as he also explained in 2015: [...] "I went into Marvel and talked to them about making it as a movie {{a couple of years}} ago, long after the Affleck movie. But <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> sort of realised is that, this movie doesn't want to cost $200 million. The thing about Matt Murdock is, he's not saving the world. He's just keeping his corner clean. So it would feel wrong to have spaceships crashing {{in the middle of the}} city. But because of that, Marvel on the movie side is not in the business of making $25 million movies. They're going big, as they should."

[...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave it five stars {{out of five}}, writing that it was [...] "both a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next-gen reboot… ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental of course, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity." [...] Varietys Justin Chang wrote that the film has [...] "sufficient style, momentum, love and care to prove irresistible to any who have ever considered themselves fans". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four, describing it as [...] "a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising, and heart-thumping adventure". Tom Long of The Detroit News wrote that though some may find the film too similar to the original Star Wars, it leaves [...] "the ungainly and unneeded clumsiness of the subsequent prequels far behind… the energy, humor and simplicity of direction [...] been recaptured".
