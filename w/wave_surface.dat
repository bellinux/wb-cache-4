5000|$|An El Rollo (Spanish for [...] "The Roll") is a bodyboarding trick {{performed}} {{when the}} bodyboarder hits {{the lip of}} the wave and uses its power to throw himself out with the lip in a perfect arc to complete a roll before landing on the <b>wave</b> <b>surface</b> or into the white water. When the bodyboarder detaches completely from the <b>wave</b> <b>surface</b> or the lip the trick is called an air roll or aerial roll. Other variations include the [...] "barrel roll" [...] where the roll is completed inside the barrel, and the [...] "rollo takeoff" [...] which is performed while catching the wave. This trick was named by someone in the industry. I remember the story where Pat Caldwell did the roll and Jack Lindholm or whoever saw him do it and commented [...] "what do you call that an el rollo".

50|$|During the fifties, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} {{of interest in the}} Cherenkov effect both in its experimental and theoretical aspects. Professor Majumdar was fascinated by the problem, because it was perhaps the only classical electrodynamical derivation that fetched Nobel prizes in a world dominated by the Quantum. As was usual with him, he approached the problem in an absolutely novel way. Instead of studying the Cherenkov radiation field in the rest frame of the medium through which the charged particle whizzes by, he decided to jump to the rest frame of the charge. The great advantage of this approach is that the electromagnetic field becomes static and can be described by just two scalar potentials, which was a totally new formulation of the problem. However, the flowing medium now acquires a complicated magneto-electric character. This however came as a blessing in disguise, because it led to a discovery in the electrodynamics of crystalline media. Majumdar found that a most general doubly anisotropic medium with tensor permittivity and tensor permeability with non-parallel principal axes could sometimes behave like an 'isotropic' or 'uniaxial' medium as far as the structure of the Fresnel <b>wave</b> <b>surface</b> is concerned. Armed with this insight and his new formulation of the problem, he derived, for the first time, a closed expression for the Cherenkov output in a biaxial crystal in terms of elliptic functions.|$|E

40|$|Water {{particle}} motions on the <b>wave</b> <b>surface</b> are ofinterest to {{the designer}} for various applications that require quantification of particle kinematics.

40|$|Abstract — Methodology {{and results}} are {{presented}} for numerical simulations and field experiments using point absorption ocean wave energy harvesting buoy systems, using the heave motion of the buoys to produce useful electrical power. Two approaches, a direct-drive system and a resonantdrive system are analyzed. These systems are not designed for large scale grid power applications, but rather for relatively low-power ocean sensor and communications applications, with power requirements in the 1 - 10 W range. The field experiments provided useful data for model verification and validation purposes. Results showed that RMS values for armature displacement and armature velocity and mean harvested electrical power were generally within 10 % between model simulations and experimental data. Index Terms – energy conversion, wave energy harvesting, linear generator, ocean energy, heaving buoy I. NOMENCLATURE A rigid-drive-system is an energy harvesting system which forces the linear generator armature to perfectly track (or mirror) the ocean <b>wave</b> <b>surface</b> elevation without amplification or attenuation of amplitude. A direct-drive-system is an energy harvesting system which attempts to force the linear generator armature to track (or mirror) the ocean <b>wave</b> <b>surface</b> elevation, but is {{unable to do so}} perfectly, resulting in attenuation of the amplitude. A resonant-drive-system is an energy harvesting system which allows the linear generator armature and/or the buoy to resonate with, and amplify, the ocean <b>wave</b> <b>surface</b> elevation.

40|$|The {{derivation}} of an electromagnetic (EM) bias {{model that}} includes the physical optics scattering models and the non-Gaussian long <b>wave</b> <b>surface</b> statistics is presented. The final formulation of the model is expressed {{as a function of}} hydrodynamic modulation, surface skewness, and tilt modulation. Through the modulation transfer function, the hydrodynamic modulation coefficient is shown to be equivalent to the long wave RMS slope multiplied by a function of the short wave spectrum. With this result the normalized EM bias reduces to a function of long <b>wave</b> <b>surface</b> parameters with coefficients determined by properties of the short ocean waves. EM bias values are computed from the theory, using a realistic surface PSD, and compared with in situ bias measurements. The bias model is shown to be in excellent agreement with the measured values, and includes features of normalized bias not present in previous models...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>waves</b> are seismic {{waves that}} travel {{at the surface}} of the earth, along the air/earth boundary. [...] <b>Surface</b> <b>waves</b> are slower than P-waves(compressional waves) and S-waves(transverse <b>waves).</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>waves</b> are {{classified}} into two basic types, Rayleigh waves and Love waves. Rayleigh waves travel in a longitudinal manner (the wave motion is parallel to the direction of wave propagation) with particle motion in a retrograde elliptical motion (Figure 1). The Rayleigh waves result from the interaction between P-waves and vertically polarized S-waves. [...] Conversely, Love waves travel in a traverse manner (Figure 1) (the wave motion is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation), consisting of horizontally polarized S-waves.In seismology, <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> are collected along with other seismic data, but are traditionally considered noise and an impedance in interpreting deeper reflection and refraction information. Seismologists usually modify seismic equipment and experimental procedures to remove <b>surface</b> <b>wave</b> information from the data. Earthquake seismologists however require the information seismic <b>surface</b> <b>waves</b> provide and thus design their equipment to amplify and gather as much information on these waves as possible.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel remote sensing {{technique}} that infers the three-dimensional wave form and radiance of oceanic sea states via a variational stereo imagery formulation. In this setting, the shape and radiance of the <b>wave</b> <b>surface</b> are minimizers of a composite cost functional which combines a data fidelity term and smoothness priors on the unknowns. The solution {{of a system of}} coupled partial differential equations derived from the cost functional yields the desired ocean surface shape and radiance. The proposed method is naturally extended to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of ocean waves, and applied to three sets of video data. Statistical and spectral analysis are carried out. The results shows evidence {{of the fact that the}} omni-directional wavenumber spectrum S(k) of the reconstructed waves decays as k^{- 2. 5 } in agreement with Zakharov's theory (1999).
