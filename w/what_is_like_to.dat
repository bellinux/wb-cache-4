6000|$|First. To {{begin with}} God's {{ordinary}} dealing with sinners, when {{at first he}} ministereth conviction to them by his Word, how strangely do they behave themselves! They love not to have their consciences touched; they like not to ponder upon what they have been, what they are, or <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> become of them hereafter; such thoughts they count unmanly, hurtful, disadvantageous; therefore [...] "they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, {{that they should not}} hear" [...] (Zech 7,11).

60|$|Third. Nothing but the Spirit {{can show}} a man clearly his misery by nature, and so {{put a man}} into a posture of prayer. Talk is but talk, as we use to say, {{and so it is}} but mouth-worship, if there be not a sense of misery, and that effectually too. O the cursed {{hypocrisy}} that is in most hearts, and that accompanieth many thousands of praying men that would be so looked upon in this day, and all for want of a sense of their misery! But now the Spirit, that will sweetly show the soul its misery, where it is, and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> become of it, also the intolerableness of that condition. For it is the Spirit that doth effectually convince of sin and misery, without the Lord Jesus, and so puts the soul into a sweet, sensible, affectionate way of praying to God according to his word (John 16:7-9).|$|E

60|$|The doctrine, or mystery, couched {{under these}} words {{is to show}} us <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> become of a fruitless or formal professor. For, 1. By {{the man in the}} parable is meant God the Father (Luke 15:11). 2. By the vineyard, his church (Isa 5:7). 3. By the fig-tree, a professor. 4. By the dresser, the Lord Jesus. 5. By the fig-tree's barrenness, the professor's fruitlessness. 6. By the three years, the {{patience}} of God that for a time he extendeth to barren professors. 7. This calling to the dresser of the vineyard to cut it down, is to show the outcries of justice against fruitless professors. 8. The dresser's interceding is to show how the Lord Jesus steps in, and takes hold of the head of his Father's axe, to stop, or at least to defer, the present execution of a barren fig-tree. 9. The dresser's desire {{to try to make the}} fig-tree fruitful, is to show you how unwilling he is that even a barren fig-tree should yet be barren, and perish. 10. His digging about it, and dunging of it, is to show his willingness to apply gospel helps to this barren professor, if haply he may be fruitful. 11. The supposition that the fig-tree may yet continue fruitless, is to show, that when Christ Jesus hath done all, there are some professors will abide barren and fruitless. 12. The determination upon this supposition, at last to cut it down, is a certain prediction of such professor's unavoidable and eternal damnation.|$|E

"Come this-a-way, Sarpent, here {{more out}} of sight of the women," [...] {{commenced}} the Deerslayer, [...] "for I've several things to say that mustn't so much as be suspected, much less overheard. You know too well the natur' of furloughs and Mingos to have any doubts or misgivin's consarnin' <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> happen, when I get back to the camp. On them two p'ints therefore, a few words will go a great way. In the first place, chief, I wish to say a little about Hist, and the manner in which you red men treat your wives. I suppose it's accordin' to the gifts of your people that the women should work, and the men hunt; but there's such a thing as moderation in all matters. As for huntin', I see no good reason why any limits need be set to that, but Hist comes of too good a stock to toil like a common drudge. One of your means and standin' need never want for corn, or potatoes, or anything that the fields yield; therefore, I hope the hoe will never be put into the hands of any wife of yourn. You know I am not quite a beggar, and all I own, whether in ammunition, skins, arms, or calicoes, I give to Hist, should I not come back to claim them by the end of the season. This will set the maiden up, and will buy labor for her, for a long time to come. I suppose I needn't tell you to love the young woman, for that you do already, and whomsoever the man ra'ally loves, he'll be likely enough to cherish. Nevertheless, it can do no harm to say that kind words never rankle, while bitter words do. I know you're a man, Sarpent, that is less apt to talk in his own lodge, than to speak at the Council Fire; but forgetful moments may overtake us all, and the practyse of kind doin', and kind talkin', is a wonderful advantage in keepin' peace in a cabin, as well as on a hunt." ...|$|E

The issue covered themes related to MuÃ±oz's contribution to various academic fields such as queer of color critique, affect studies, and the new ways to conceptualized concepts such as Latina/o identity, queer ephemera, and temporality. After MuÃ±oz's death, various art, literary, and academic institutions, artists, and periodicals, [...] commemorated his legacy and contributions through a series of online and journal based obituaries and memorial lectures and annual events.
