5|$|Ominously, PAVN and the Pathet Lao did not <b>withdraw</b> <b>to</b> North Vietnam {{during the}} rainy season. Previously during the conflict, air {{mobility}} by STOL aircraft into the Lima Sites had provided the Hmong with an advantage over the road-bound PAVN and Pathet Lao forces. This advantage was {{now going to be}} overcome by road improvement and the prepositioning of supplies which allowed the communists to maintain year-round use of their lines of communication.|$|E

5|$|Saladin {{launched}} his last offensive against Mosul in late 1185, hoping {{for an easy}} victory over a presumably demoralized Mas'ud, but failed due to the city's unexpectedly stiff resistance and a serious illness which caused Saladin to <b>withdraw</b> <b>to</b> Harran. Upon Abbasid encouragement, Saladin and Mas'ud negotiated a treaty in March 1186 that left the Zengids in control of Mosul, but under the obligation to supply the Ayyubids with military support when requested.|$|E
