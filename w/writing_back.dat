Michael (Ralph Fiennes) meanwhile marries, has a daughter, and divorces. Retrieving his books {{from the time of the}} affair with Hanna, he begins reading them into a tape recorder. He sends the cassette tapes and a recorder to Hanna. Eventually, she begins to check the books out from the prison library and teaches herself to read and write by following along with Michael's tapes. She starts <b>writing</b> <b>back</b> to Michael in brief, childlike notes, asking him to write to her. As time goes on, the letters reflect her gradually improving literacy.|$|E

He sometimes participates in the events about which he writes, which are heavy in field research. He also has written interviews with celebrities, namely, Juliette Lewis and Marilyn Manson. These works appear in various magazines and newspapers, such as the Los Angeles Times and Gear magazine. Some of these writings have shown up in his book, Stranger than Fiction: True Stories. Palahniuk also includes some non-fiction factoids within his fictional works and according to the author, these are included in order to further immerse the reader in his work. He also helped write some of Manhunt 2 in his freelance <b>writing</b> <b>back</b> in 2007.|$|E

500|$|Napoleon demanded, from {{a highly}} {{superior}} position, peace terms {{in what was}} to be called the Peace of Tilsit (1807). In the midst of these negotiations, the emperor agreed to keep half of Prussia intact. The men were joined by Queen Louise; Frederick William had sent for his wife, then pregnant with her daughter Princess Louise, to beg for a better settlement for Prussia, with Louise advising her husband, [...] "For God's sake no shameful peace... should at least not go down without honor." [...] As the king felt that her presence might put Napoleon in a [...] "more relaxed mood"; Louise reluctantly agreed to meet the emperor at Tilsit, but only to save [...] "her Prussia". Napoleon had previously attempted to destroy her reputation by questioning Louise's marital fidelity, but the queen met him anyway, attempting to use her beauty and charm to flatter him into more favorable terms. Formerly Louise had regularly referred to him as [...] "the Monster", but nevertheless made a request for a private interview with the emperor, whereon she threw herself at his feet; though he was impressed by her grace and determination, Napoleon refused to make any concessions, <b>writing</b> <b>back</b> to his wife Empress Jos√©phine that Louise [...] "is really charming and full of coquettishness toward me. But don't be jealous...it would cost me too dearly to play the gallant." [...] Napoleon's attempts to destroy Louise's reputation failed however, and they only made her more beloved in Prussia. Queen Louise's efforts to protect her adopted country from French aggression secured for her the admiration of future generations.|$|E

But the exemplary letters that he composed of nights from a Father to a Son at War were never written down.

I have heard that Emerson was a good deal mystified, and in his sublime forgetfulness asked, Who was this gentleman who appeared to think he had offered him some sort of annoyance! But I am not sure that this is accurate. What I am sure of is that Longfellow, a few days after, in my study, stopped before a photograph of Clemens and said, [...] "Ah, he is a wag!" [...] and nothing more. Holmes told me, with deep emotion, such as a brother humorist might well feel, that he had not lost an instant in replying to Clemens's letter, and assuring him that there had not been the least offence, and entreating him never to think of the matter again. [...] "He said that he was a fool, but he was God's fool," [...] Holmes quoted from the letter, with a true sense of the pathos and the humor of the self-abasement.|$|E
