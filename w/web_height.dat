40|$|AbstractUse of T-bars in {{shipbuilding}} {{has increased}} recently. Although T-bars having a <b>web</b> <b>height</b> {{of at least}} twice the flange width are generally required for ships, the dimensions of existing hot-rolled T-bars are not suitable. As a result, T-bars for ships are typically fabricated by welding two plates. To solve this problem, a new rolling method for T-bars using a universal mill and edger mill was investigated. Finite element analyses of universal and edger rolling were executed to investigate the characteristics of side camber. Next, multi-pass rolling experiments simulating the rolling passes at a universal roughing mill and an edger mill were performed, and straight pure lead T-bars having satisfactory cross sections were obtained. However, the web heights {{at the top and}} tail ends were larger than those of the other part. Additional vertical rolls were applied to edger rolling to enable a slight reduction of the <b>web</b> <b>height,</b> and the <b>web</b> <b>height</b> deflection was eliminated by this new arrangement. The results of this research clearly demonstrated the potential of the new rolling process for producing T-bars of ships...|$|E

This paper studies the bending performance of and deformation calculation methods for two-way web-reinforced composite sandwich panels with different <b>web</b> spacing and <b>heights.</b> Polyurethane foam, two-way orthogonal glass-fiber woven cloth and unsaturated resin were used as raw materials in this study. Vacuum infusion molding was used to prepare an ordinary composite sandwich panel and 5 web-reinforced composite sandwich panels with different spacing and <b>web</b> <b>heights.</b> The panels were subjected to two-way panel bending tests with simple support for all four edges. The mechanical properties of these sandwich panels during the elastic stage were determined by applying uniformly distributed loads. The non-linear mechanical characteristics and failure modes were obtained under centrally concentrated loading. Finally, simulations of the sandwich panels, which used the mechanical model established herein, were used to deduce the formulae for the deflection deformation {{for this type of}} sandwich panel. The experimental results show that webs can significantly improve the limit bearing capacity and flexural rigidity of sandwich panels, with smaller web spacing producing a stronger effect. When the web spacing is 75 mm, the limit bearing capacity is 4. 63 times that of an ordinary sandwich panel. The deduced deflection calculation formulae provide values that agree well with the measurements (maximum error < 15 %).

The results indicate that at these pressures geometric nonlinearities are important, and that the overall stiffener stiffness has {{a significant effect on}} panel response, particularly on the out-of-plane deformation or pillowing of the skin. The strain gradients indicated that the interface between the skin and the stiffener experiences two components of shear stress, in addition to a normal (peel) stress.

30|$|An {{experimental}} {{program and}} an analytical model using ANSYS program {{were employed to}} estimate the structural performance of repaired damaged steel beams using fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials. The beams were artificially notched in the tension flanges at mid-spans and retrofitted by FRP flexible sheets on the tension flanges and the sheets were extended to cover parts of the beams <b>webs</b> with different <b>heights.</b> Eleven box steel beams, including one intact beam, one notch damaged beam and nine notches damaged beam and retrofitted with composite materials, were tested in two-point loading up to failure. The parameters considered were the FRP type (GFRP and CFRP) and number of layers. The results indicated that bonding CFRP sheets to both of the tension steel flange {{and part of the}} webs, instead of the tension flange only, enhances the ultimate load of the retrofitted beams, avoids the occurrence of the debonding and increases the beam ductility. Also the numerical models give acceptable results in comparison with the experimental results.|$|R

Some typical ro-ro/pax grillage type decks have been analyzed, aiming at a numerical comparison between the primary supporting beam stress values obtained by the following techniques: Shade orthotropic plate bending theory, grillage analysis, finite-element method. As a result, it has been assessed the relative accuracy of such analysis techniques in deck transverse and girder dimensioning. Considering the necessity to minimize the deck structural weight and the <b>web</b> <b>height,</b> especially to improve the ship stability, it has been investigated the influence of each grillage parameter on deck framing behaviour, particularly in relation to the structural weight.

Finally, some general guidelines to obtain easily a grillage dimensioning quite close to the optimized one are suggested...|$|E

The test specimens, testing program as well as experimental results are presented. The fatigue failure characteristics of the SRC girders are described in detail and compared with the static failure characteristics. It was found that the fatigue cracking was initiated at the weld toe of shear studs on the tension flange of welded H-section steel inside the SRC girder and then the crack propagated along the flange width and the <b>web</b> <b>height</b> until the girder lost loading capacity due to lack of enough cross section.

Preliminarily, the procedures for assessing the scantlings of platings, ordinary stiffeners and primary supporting members subjected to wheeled loads, are presented, in order {{to point out the}} parameters that influence the deck weight, such as ordinary stiffener spacing, transverse spacing, number of girders, <b>web</b> <b>height</b> of primary supporting members. The strength check of platings is rule based, while ordinary stiffeners are schematized as continuous beams; concerning the primary supporting members, instead, the direct scantling procedure, proposed in a previous paper, is adopted, schematizing the deck as an orthotropic plate with clamped boundary conditions in correspondence of the aft and fore bulkheads and the ship sides, in order {{to take into account the}} interaction of the two orthogonal beam sets. Some design charts are presented in order to determine the influence of the previously defined parameters on the deck weight or, similarly, on its equivalent thickness, spreading the stiffener and primary supporting member weight on the deck area.

This effective width is obtained by a consideration of the buckling properties of thin sheet in shear. The results are in the same form as the familiar Wagner beam equations except that certain terms must be modified and corrections made. The results herein obtained are not to be considered as superseding the Wagner Equations as derived in Ref.

40|$|Abstract: LiteSteel beam (LSB) {{is a new}} cold-formed steel hollow flange channel beam {{produced}} using a patented {{manufacturing process}} involving simultaneous cold-forming and dual electric resistance welding. It has the beneficial characteristics of torsionally rigid closed rectangular flanges combined with economical fabrication processes from a single strip of high strength steel. Although the LSB sections are commonly used as flexural members, no research has been undertaken on the shear behaviour of LSBs. Therefore experimental and numerical studies were undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of LSBs. In this research finite element models of LSBs were developed to investigate their nonlinear shear behaviour including their buckling characteristics and ultimate shear strength. They were validated by comparing their results with available experimental results. The models provided full details of the shear buckling and strength characteristics of LSBs, and showed the presence of considerable improvements to web shear buckling in LSBs and associated post-buckling strength. This paper presents {{the details of the}} finite element models of LSBs and the results. Both finite element analysis and experimental results showed that the current design rules in cold-formed steel codes are very conservative for the shear design of LSBs. The ultimate shear capacities from finite element analyses confirmed the accuracy of proposed shear strength equations for LSBs based on the North American specification and DSM design equations. Developed finite element models were used to investigate the reduction to shear capacity of LSBs when full <b>height</b> <b>web</b> side plates were not used or when only one web side plate was used, and these results are also presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been {{sustainable}} development in the steel and composite construction technology. One of the recent additions to such developments is the I-girders with corrugated web beams. The use of these new generation beams results in a range of benefits, including flexible, free internal spaces and reduced foundation costs. Corrugated web beams are built-up girders with a thin-walled, corrugated web and wide plate flanges. The thin corrugated web affords a significant weight reduction of these beams, compared with hot-rolled or welded ones. In this paper, optimum design of corrugated composite beams is presented. A recent stochastic optimization algorithm coded that is based on hunting search is used for obtaining the solution of the design problem. In the optimisation process, besides the thickness of concrete slab and studs, <b>web</b> <b>height</b> and thickness, distance between the peaks of the two curves, the width and thickness of flange are considered as design variables. The design constraints are respectively implemented from BS EN 1993 - 1 : 2005 (Annex-D, Eurocode 3) BS- 8110 and DIN 18 - 800 Teil- 1. Furthermore, these selections are also carried out such that the design limitations are satisfied and the weight of the composite corrugated web beam is the minimum. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} multi-objective design tailoring procedure {{seeking to}} improve the vibroacoustic performance of a fuselage panel while maintaining or reducing weight is presented. The structure considered is the pultruded rod stitched efficient unitized structure, a highly integrated composite structure concept designed for a noncylindrical, next-generation flight vehicle fuselage. Modifications to a baseline design are evaluated within a six-parameter design space including spacing, flange width, and <b>web</b> <b>height</b> for both frame and stringer substructure components. The change in sound power radiation attributed to a design change is predicted using finite-element models sized and meshed for analyses in the 500 Hz, 1 kHz, and 2 kHz octave bands. Three design studies are carried out in parallel while considering a diffuse acoustic field excitation and two types of turbulent boundary-layer excitation. Kriging surrogate models are used to reduce the computational costs of resolving the vibroacoustic and weight objective Pareto fronts. The resulting Pareto optimal designs are then evaluated under a static pressurization ultimate load to assess structural strength and stability. Results suggest that choosing alternative configurations within the considered design space can reduce weight and improve vibroacoustic performance without compromising strength and stability of the structure under the static load condition considered, but the tradeoffs are significantly influenced by the spatial characteristics of the assumed excitation field...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{sandwich}} bridge decks with GFRP face sheets and light weight material core {{have been widely}} used in the world due to their advantages of low cost, high strength to weight ratios, and corrosion resisting. However, as the bridge decks, most of them are used in foot bridges rather than highway bridges because the ultimate bending strength and initial bending stiffness are relatively low. To address this issue and expand the scope of use, a simple and innovative sandwich bridge deck with GFRP face sheets and a foam-web core, manufactured by vacuum assisted resin infusion process, is developed. An experimental study was carried out to validate the effectiveness of this panel for increasing the ultimate bending strength and initial bending stiffness under two-way bending. The effects of face sheet thickness, foam density, web thickness, and web spacing on displacement ductility and energy dissipation were also investigated. Test results showed that, compared to the normal foam-core sandwich decks, an average approximately 657. 1 % increase in the ultimate bending strength can be achieved.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} an experimental study on the shear behaviour and strength of a recently developed, cold-formed steel hollow flange channel beam known as LiteSteel Beam (LSB). The new LSB sections with rectangular hollow flanges are produced using a patented manufacturing process involving simultaneous cold-forming and dual electric resistance welding. They are commonly used as flexural members in buildings. However, no research has been undertaken on the shear behaviour of LSBs. Therefore a detailed experimental study involving 36 shear tests was undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour of 10 different LSB sections. Simply supported test specimens of LSBs with aspect ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 5 were loaded at midspan until failure using both single and back to back LSB arrangements. Test specimens were chosen such that all three types of shear failure (shear yielding, inelastic and elastic shear buckling) occurred in the tests. Comparison of experimental results with corresponding predictions from the current Australian and North American cold-formed steel design rules showed that the current design rules are very conservative for the shear design of LSBs. Significant improvements to web shear buckling occurred due {{to the presence of}} rectangular hollow flanges while considerable post-buckling strength was also observed. Appropriate improvements have been proposed for the shear strength of LSBs based on the design equations in the North American Specification. This paper {{presents the}} details of this experimental study and the results. When reduced <b>height</b> <b>web</b> side plates or only one web side plate was used, the shear capacity of LSB was reduced. Details of these tests and the results are also presented in this paper.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Very {{few studies}} have {{investigated}} the influence of regular practice of a stereotyped behaviour on its future expression. In spiders, orb-web construction is a succession of repetitive and stereotyped behaviours and is a relevant model for such study. This study examined if preventing spiders from building influences their future constructions. Spiders {{were caught in the}} field and brought back to the laboratory where they were exposed to two different situations; half were maintained in small boxes where web building was not possible, and half were maintained in large enclosures where they could build orb-webs. All spiders were tested twice: 1 week after their capture (test 1) and 12 weeks later (test 2). Their building performance was evaluated by examining silk investment (length of the capture spiral, number of radii, of spiral turns, length of {{the lower part of the}} web), <b>web</b> design (mesh <b>height,</b> asymmetry) and the frequency of anomalies in the web. Results: There was no difference in web constructions between the two groups in either test. However, the rearing conditions seemed to affect two parameters: the length of the lower part of the web and the asymmetry were higher for spiders reared in small boxes. We did find also, an overall decrease with time in silk investment (length of the capture spiral, capture area) in both groups as well as an increase in the number of anomalies of the capture spiral from tests 1 to 2. Conclusions: These results suggest that regular web construction does not have a strong effect on web structure or silk investment, but spider age did affect parameters in the two groups. Thus, the lack of practice over a large portion of a spider's adult life does not affect a stereotyped behaviour such as the building of an orb-web...|$|R
40|$|Spider web silk decorations may (i) act {{to attract}} prey, (ii) be decoys for predators, and (iii) make the web visible to prevent larger animals from {{destroying}} them. To disentangle {{the last two}} hypotheses, we examined the fleeing response and flight initiation distance (FID) of the Florida orb weaver spider (Argiope florida Chamberlin and Ivie, 1944). Spiders were approached {{in one of two}} manners: (1) a "predatory" one mimicking a bird and (2) a "looming" approach mimicking the approach of a large animal. We predicted that if silk decorations had an antipredator function, then the extent of silk decoration would influence whether spiders fled from the predatory approach. However, if the function was primarily a signal to large animals, then all spiders would flee the looming approach, but FID would be influenced by the extent of silk decoration. We found no influence of silk decorations on fleeing behaviour and FID of spiders. Spider fleeing behaviour was, however, influenced by height of the web from the ground. The effects of <b>web</b> <b>height</b> might reflect an adaptive response to a more exposed position and therefore could support either of the two hypotheses tested; however, we have no evidence supporting the role of silk decorations on antipredator responses...|$|E

The Classification Societies set up Renewal Criteria for the stiffeners/profiles in ship hull structures when they do not meet the requirements which may be, for example, cross-sectional area falling below 90 % of the original nominal value.

A circular cone type heat source model is newly suggested in heat transfer analysis to realize similar melting zone with that observed in experiment. An additional suggestion is made to consider negative defocus, which is commonly applied in T-joint laser welding since it can provide deeper penetration than zero defocus. The proposed heat source is also verified through 3 D thermal elasto-plastic analysis to compare welding deformation with experimental results. A parametric study for different welding speeds, defocus values, and welding powers is performed to investigate {{the effect on the}} melting zone and welding deformation. In Part II, focuses on the proposed method to employ shell element model to predict welding deformation in thermal elasto-plastic analysis instead of solid element model...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the behaviour of axially loaded long and eccentrically loaded short thin-walled steel channels, strengthened with transversely bonded carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets. Seven long members, each 1400 mm long, and seven short members, each 750 mmlong, were tested. The main parameters were {{the number of}} CFRP plies (one or two) and the clear spacing between the CFRP strips (50, 100 or 150 mm). The effect of CFRP sheet layer and clear spacing was studied. All the ultimate load capacity of the reinforced members was improved in different extent. A maximum strength gain of 9. 13 % was achieved for long members with two CFRP layers and 50 mm spacing of CFRP strips. The experimental {{results show that the}} global buckling happens to all the long specimens. For short members, the maximum strength gain of 12. 1 % was achieved with two CFRP layers and 50 mm spacing of CFRP strips. With the exception of the most heavily reinforced (2 plies at 50 and 100 mm), local buckling was observed prior to global buckling for short members, which was completely opposite of the control specimens. Meanwhile, when the clear spacing of CFRP strips is greater than theweb height of steel channel, the transversely bonded CFRP does not have a significant improvement in buckling load capacity of the short- and long-channel components. While the clear spacing is less than the <b>web</b> <b>height,</b> the more number of CFRP layer, the more enhancement of buckling load capacity...|$|E
40|$|Demand for {{lighter and}} stiffer {{products}} {{has been increasing}} {{in the last few}} years especially in automobile manufacturing. The closed die forging process of Metal Matrix Material (MMC) is presented as possible solution, since it produces parts with good mechanical properties and lighter weight. A computational modeling of closed die forging process using finite element method and optimization techniques makes the design optimization faster and more efficient, decreasing the use of conventional trial and error methods. In this study, the application of commercial finite element software (ANSYS) has been used to model cold closed die forging process. The model has been developed using ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) to simulate a single stage axi-symmetry closed die forging process for H cross sectional shape. The material used is AlMgSi matrix with 15 % SiC particles. Its flow curve and fractural strain are obtained from the literature. ANSYS Optimizer is used to obtain the maximum height in which the material can flow in the rib by changing Design Variables (DV) and State Variables (SV). Normally design variables are geometrical parameters such as, rib height to width ratio, <b>web</b> <b>height</b> to rib height ratio, fillet radii, draft angle and billet radius. State Variables (SV) are some parameters that depend on the design variables such as, the equivalent strain which must be below the fracture strain of the MMC material, and an acceptable contact gap (within the allowable tolerances range). Optimization method called Sub-Problem Approximation Method was used to find out the optimal design set. The technique used in this study can be used for newly developed materials to investigate its forgeability for much complicated shapes in closed die forging process...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{resistance}} of plate girders stiffened with one sided rectangular longitudinal stiffeners under compression and bending, determined {{according to the rules}} given in EN 1993 - 1 - 5. It presents the rules for determination of plate buckling effects due to direct stresses. Compression and bending resistance was calculated {{for a wide range of}} cross sections, using the computer program EXCEL, and the effects of different parameters were studied. The parameters investigated were: the location of the stiffener, the slenderness of the plate, the plate aspect ratio, the stiffener to plate area ratio, the flange to web area ratio, the steel grade and the <b>web</b> <b>height.</b> Separate calculations were made for three different cases: I-girder stiffened with one or two longitudinal stiffeners under bending and plate stiffened with n longitudinal stiffeners under compression. In EN 1993 - 1 - 5 the effects of plate buckling are taken into account by effective cross sectional areas, determined by reduction factors which depend on elastic critical buckling stresses. Calculation of critical stresses is based on simplified models which may have limited applicability. Elastic critical buckling stresses were calculated more accurately by using computer program EBPlate (energy method). In addition to the comparison of critical stresses we were interested in the effect that the different critical stresses have on the section resistance. Therefore, the critical plate buckling stress in the expressions given by EN 1993 - 1 - 5 was replaced by critical stresses from EBPlate calculation. The comparison of the results of both methods of calculation showed that the differences in critical stresses were differently reflected in the results for section resistance...|$|E
40|$|Structural steel design {{standards}} recognize lateral torsional buckling {{as a failure}} mode governing the capacity of long span unsupported beams with wide flange cross-sections. Standard solutions start with the closed form solution of the Vlasov thin-walled beam theory for {{the case of a}} simply supported beam under uniform moments, and modify the solution to accommodate various moment distributions through moment gradient expressions. The Vlasov theory solution {{is based on the assumption}} that cross-sectional distortional effects have a negligible effect on the predicted elastic critical moment. The present study systematically examines the validity of the Vlasov assumption related to cross-section distortion through a parametric study. A series of elastic shell finite element eigen-value buckling analyses is conducted on simply supported beams subject to uniform moments, linear moments and mid span point loads as well as cantilevers subject to top flange loading acting at the tip. Cross-sectional dimensions are selected to represent structural steel cross-section geometries used in practice. Particular attention is paid to model end connection details commonly used in practice involving moment connections with two pairs of stiffeners, simply supported ends with a pair of transverse stiffeners, simply supported ends with cleat angle details, and built in fixation at cantilever roots. The critical moments obtained from the FEA are compared to those based on conventional critical moment equations in various Standards and published solutions. The effects of web slenderness, flange slenderness, <b>web</b> <b>height</b> to flange width ratio, and span to height ratios on the critical moment ratio are systematically quantified. For some combinations of section geometries and connection details, it is shown that present solutions derived from the Vlasov theory can overestimate the lateral torsional buckling resistance for beams...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the laser {{measurements}} {{as part of the}} research on the distribution of a certain amount of steel over the flanges and the web of an I-shaped plate girder to achieve the maximum bending moment resistance [1]. In many steel structures standard hot-rolled sections are used. These sections are divided into specific types in Europe and similar profiles in the USA. The range of hot-rolled sections is limited and therefore fabricated plate girders are used. Double symmetric I-shaped plate girders are built up with steel plates for the top and bottom flange and the web, welded together to a cross-section. Using this type of plate girders, a high degree of optimisation of material use is possible by using different plate thicknesses and widths for the flanges and thickness and height for the web. In the thesis the main topic for optimisation is the bending moment resistance of a plate girder. The maximum bending moment resistance appears for plate girders with a lot of material in the flanges and with a large <b>web</b> <b>height.</b> The web thickness has to be as small as possible and so the web slenderness has to be as large as possible. The limitation of the web slenderness is according to the Eurocode and the American standard based on flange induced buckling. The web of cross-section class 4 buckles and this buckling is during experiments measured by lasers. This paper gives an overview {{of the results of the}} laser measurements. Based on these measurements, it is concluded that flange induce buckling is not a limitation for the web slenderness. High web slenderness can be applied and the bending moment resistance increases enormously and the stiffness increases even more. Because of this, the use of HSS becomes of high interest.

40|$|Thesis (M. Eng.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 2009. Engineering and Applied ScienceIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 158 - 163) Stiffened {{plates are}} the basic structural building blocks of ships and many onshore and offshore structures. The present research explores the plastic response of a stiffened plate subjected to lateral ice loads. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is extensively used to study the plastic behavior of stiffened plates. In order to gain confidence in using FEM, a validation study of a full scale experiment is initially presented. Following the examination of experimental and numerical results for a loaded grillage, the report examines three separate but related questions concerning the design of ice capable stiffened panels. [...] Ship structure design normally considers single frames. This is justified because under uniform loading, all frames behave similarly - so {{it is reasonable to}} consider frames singly. In case of ice loading which is non symmetric, the symmetric boundary condition does not accurately represent the true structural behavior. The difference in load carrying capacity between frames in isolation and frames as part of a grillage, subjected to an unsymmetrical loading is studied. [...] The capacity of a stiffened plate depends on many factors - geometric properties, material properties, loading type etc. The current IACS Polar Rules for Ships contain plastic limit state models of frame capacity. These limit states are analytical 1 y derived using relatively simple energy methods and validated by finite element analyses. The contributions from large deformations and membrane stresses are ignored and hence these analytical solutions may not accurately estimate capacity of all frames. The reliable methods to estimate capacity are either to conduct a full scale experiment or a nonlinear finite element analysis. These methods are either very expensive or too complex. There is a need for a simple regression equation which can predict capacity taking into account all the non-linear behavior of the structure. There are ten factors which influence load carrying capacity of a frame. The study of ten factors at two levels (at high and low levels of each factor) requires 1024 (2 10) ANSYS analyses. A significant {{reduction in the number of}} analyses is achieved by using "design of experiments" (DOE) method. A new regression equation for estimating load carrying capacity of the frame is proposed and validated using independent FE analyses. [...] The total load carrying capacity of a stiffened plate is contributed by both shell plate and stiffener. In most situations, stiffened panels will be sensitive to buckling under axial loads. In the case of ice reinforcement, the loads are primarily normal to the shell, with minimal axial loads. The concern for frame buckling remains, although the issue is less well understood. Some stiffeners, especially those with slender webs, show a tendency to fail by local web buckling, tripping and shear buckling, causing a sudden loss of capacity and resulting in collapse of the structure. The IACS Polar Shipping Rules (URI 2) contains a requirement aimed at the prevention of web buckling by specifying a maximum <b>web</b> <b>height</b> I web thickness (h w /tw). While URI 2 employs plastic limit states, the stability ratio is based on prevention of elastic buckling. In some cases these stability requirements have a significant impact on the design. The current rule limiting values of hw /tw are very conservative and do not adequately reflect the conditions that lead to instability. The FEM coupled with the DOE method is used in the study. Six factors which influence stability of a flat bar stiffener are identified. The study of six factors even at two levels (at high and low levels of each factor) requires 64 (2 6) possible combinations of factors to be considered. A significant reduction in the number of cases is achieved by employing DOE method. The main factors affecting the plastic stability of a frame are quite different from the usual elastic buckling parameters. A new relationship is proposed for calculating the limiting <b>web</b> <b>height</b> and web slenderness...|$|E
