50|$|The main Thirukoneswaram Ther Thiruvilah Festival, the twenty-two-day annual chariot festival {{begins with}} the {{hoisting}} of the temple Nandi flag. This is followed by temple processions of Lord Konesar and his consort Mathumai Ambal, installed and pulled in an ornate chariot temple car while deities Pillayar and Murugan with his two consorts Valli and Theivayanai are taken ahead in two other decorated chariots. This is conducted throughout Trincomalee district, and follows Kulakottan's stone scriptures detailing how Hindus in Tamil villages like Sambaltivu, lands which historically belonged to the temple, are entitled to hold poojahs as their Upayam during the annual festival period. Until April 1624 the Koneswaram Ther Festival occurred around Puthandu in April annually with five chariots and this tradition was reintroduced in April 2003, three hundred and seventy nine years later. The <b>water-cutting</b> Theertham Thiruvilah festival (holy bath) takes place annually in the centuries-old Papanasachunai holy well (Papanasam Theertham) on Swami Rock during the Ther festival period. The deity and other holy artifacts are bathed in {{the water of the}} well in the complex's sacred precincts. Devotees are sprayed with the holy water following the Theertham. The Theppath Thiruvilah Boat Festival consists of Lord Konesar and goddess Mathumai Ambal taken in a boat around the temple from Swami Rock via the Back Bay Sea to the Dutch Bay Sea. Religious discourses and cultural items take place throughout the night before Puthandu at the Dutch Bay Sea beach. Thereafter the deities are taken to the temple early morning the next day on Puthandu by road through the Fort Frederick entrance. The Trincomalee Bhadrakali Amman Temple and other Hindu temples have held their <b>water-cutting</b> Theertham festivals in the Back Bay Sea (Theertha Kadatkarai) for several centuries.

40|$|Primary {{production}} of heavy oil in general only achieves a recovery {{of less than}} 10 % OOIP. Waterflooding has been applied {{for a number of}} years in heavy oil pools and can yield much higher recovery but the efficiency of the process diminishes when viscosity is above a few hundreds cp with high <b>water-cuts</b> and the need to recycle significant volumes of water; in addition, significant quantities of oil are still left behind. To increase recovery beyond that, Enhanced Oil Recovery methods are needed. Thermal methods such as steam injection or Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) are not always applicable, in particular when the pay is thin and in that case chemical EOR can be an alternative. The two main chemical EOR processes are polymer and Alkali-Surfactant-Polymer (ASP) flooding. The earlier records of field application of polymer injection in heavy oil fields date from the 1970 ’s however; the process had seen very few applications until recently. ASP in heavy oil has seen even fewer applications. A major specificity of chemical EOR in heavy oil is that the highly viscous oil bank is difficult to displace and that injectivity with vertical wells can be limited, particularly in thin reservoirs which are the prime target for chemical EOR. This situation has changed with the development of horizontal drilling and as a result, several chemical floods in heavy oil have been implemented in the past 10 years, using horizontal wells. The goal of this paper is to present some of the best documented field cases. The most successful and largest of these is the Pelican Lake polymer flood in Canada, operated by CNRL and Cenovus which is currently producing over 60, 000 bbl/d. The Patos Marinza polymer flood by Bankers Petroleum in Albania and the Mooney project (polymer, ASP) by BlackPearl (again in Canada) are also worthy of discussion...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} are reported of oil-water stratified and stratified-wavy flows in horizontal pipes using a simultaneous two-line (two-colour) technique based on combining planar laser-induced fluorescence with particle image/tracking velocimetry. This approach allows {{the study of}} fluid combinations with properties similar to those encountered in industrial field-applications in terms of density, viscosity, and interfacial tension, even though their refractive indices are not matched. The flow conditions studied span mixture velocities in the range 0. 3 – 0. 6 m/s and low <b>water-cuts</b> up to 20 %, corresponding to in situ (local) Reynolds numbers of 1750 – 3350 in the oil phase and 2860 – 11650 in the water phase, and covering the laminar/transitional and transitional/turbulent flow regimes for the oil and water phases, respectively. Detailed, spatiotemporally-resolved in situ phase and velocity data in a vertical plane aligned with the pipe centreline and extending across the entire height of the channel through both phases are analysed to provide statistical information on the interface heights, mean axial and radial (vertical) velocity components, (rms) velocity fluctuations, Reynolds stresses, and mixing lengths. The mean liquid-liquid interface height is mainly determined by the flow water cut and is relatively insensitive (up to 20 % the highest water cut) {{to changes in the}} mixture velocity, although as the mixture velocity increases the interfacial profile transitions gradually from being relatively flat to containing higher amplitude waves. The mean velocity profiles show characteristics of both laminar and turbulent flow, and interesting interactions between the two co-flowing phases. In general, mean axial velocity profiles in the water phase collapse to some extent for a given water cut when normalised by the mixture velocity; conversely, profiles in the oil phase do not. Strong vertical velocity components can modify the shape of the axial velocity profiles. The axial turbulence intensity in the bulk of the water layer amounts to about 10 % of the peak mean axial velocity in the studied flow conditions. In the oil phase, the axial turbulence intensity increases from low values to about 10 % at the higher Reynolds numbers, perhaps due to transition from laminar to turbulent flow. The turbulence intensity showed peaks in regions of high shear, i. e., close to the pipe wall, and at the liquid-liquid interface. The development of the mixing length in the water phase, and also above the liquid-liquid interface in the oil phase, agrees reasonably well with predicted variations described by the von Karman constant. Finally, evidence of secondary flow structures both above and below the interface exists in the vertical velocity profiles, which is of interest to explore further...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{upstream}} {{oil and gas}} industry has dealt {{with some of the most}} challenging metering applications. One of these is the measurement of water percentage at the point of allocation. It is an essential requirement when test separators or the newly developed full multiphase meters are utilized for oil well production testing. <b>Water-cut</b> can be obtained from measurement of differential pressure, capacitance/conductance, gamma rays absorption, absorption of infrared light, coriolis mass measurement, or microwave permittivity. The use of microwave permittivity has been shown to be very effective with the added benefit of not requiring a nuclear source, as is the case with a gamma ray densitometers. A common problem encountered in oil well production testing is that of gas ??carry-under?? into the liquid stream exiting the test separator. This results in a trace amount of gas entering the <b>water-cut</b> meter, producing errors in the <b>water-cut</b> reading. Gas carry-under may be caused by high liquid viscosity, improper separator operation, or poor separator design. Gas carry-under is believed to be one of the major causes of large allocation factors in oil and gas operations. Problems in clearly defining the three-phase stream as to flow regime and actual gas bubble size have been described in the technical literature. Pertinent references are discussed and compared. The issues in trying to perform such tests in the laboratory and the correlation of the data are disclosed and the difficulties in trying to correlate the effects of the entrained gas are described. Field testing and experience by at least one manufacturer of equipment has verified the effect of entrained gas, but little quantitative data relating gas-cut to increased error of measurement has been published. The objective of this work was to investigate the performance of a microwave <b>water-cut</b> analyzer under three-phase flow conditions to determine the impact of the presence of gas in the liquid stream.

40|$|Inline precise {{measurement}} of water fraction in oil (i. e. <b>water-cut</b> [WC]) finds numerous applications {{in oil and}} gas industry. This paper presents the characterization of an extremely low cost, completely non-intrusive and full range microwave <b>water-cut</b> sensor based upon pipe conformable microwave T-resonator.

30|$|<b>Water-cut</b> {{prediction}} methods primarily comprise numerical simulation, empirical correlation, and {{an analytical}} approach. <b>Water-cut</b> prediction {{is difficult and}} can be significantly affected by the reservoir and fluid properties {{as well as other}} factors (Guo and Sun 1998; Qu et al. 2010). Numerical simulation is a superior forecasting method, but it consumes {{a great deal of time}} (Zhao et al. 2004). Empirical correlation is a mathematical method of data processing that lacks a specific physical ground. This method includes an established <b>water-cut</b> prediction model using Neural Networks (Tang and Luo 2003), Usher Model (Yang 2008), Weibull Model, Warren Model, and Rayleigh Model (Liu et al. 2009) based on the reservoir static and production dynamic data; an established formula by fitting the plot of water cut with experimental data (Liu et al. 2011); and an established quantitatively characterized model of variations in water cut based on the actual water cut and the quantitatively characterized model principles (Zhao et al. 2010). Analytical approaches embrace the <b>water-cut</b> prediction method based on the water saturation function and fractional flow theory (Ershagi and Omoregie 1978; Sitorus et al. 2006; Lo et al. 1990; Ershagi and Abdassah 1984), the mathematical correlation model between the water cut and time established based on making certain assumptions for the reservoir (Li et al. 2011; Kazeem et al. 2007; Jiang et al. 1999), and the analytical solution to the water cut established by calculating the complex potential and portraying flow streamlines in a flooding pattern (Xu et al. 2010).
