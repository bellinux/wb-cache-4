5000|$|The Eighteenth Amendment {{prohibiting the}} sale and {{manufacturing}} of alcohol first took effect in Cleveland on May 27, 1919. However, it was not well-enforced. One policeman even said, [...] "Hell, I'm not going to arrest nobody for doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> myself." [...] Cleveland alcohol stocks declined when the Prohibition Bureau sent an administrator and federal agents as the amendment and the Volstead Act became law in January 1920. With prohibition, Cleveland, like other major American cities saw the development of organized crime. Little Italy's Mayfield Road Mob was notorious for smuggling bootleg alcohol out of Canada to Cleveland. The mob's members included Joe Tonardo, Nathan Weisenburg, the seven Porello brothers (four of whom were killed), Moses Donley, Paul Hackett, and J.J. Schleimer. These names and Milano, Furgus, and O'Boyle held the same connotation as Al Capone in Chicago. Speakeasies began appearing all over the city.

[...] Corbijn later revealed that [...] "Rob was quickly on the horizon for me, and after we met I didn’t meet anyone else for that (Dennis Stock's) role." [...] While producers Iain Canning and Emile Sherman said that [...] "Finding the right actor to play James Dean was a big responsibility, but Dane’s body of work has proved what a chameleon he is and what he will contribute to the role" [...] and further added that [...] "Casting Robert Pattinson and Dane DeHaan brings together two of the most exciting young actors of their generation."

And lyrics to a song like that were not so serious and more cliché metal lyrics, you know about a metal machine (laughs), so I think some of the new songs may go in that direction. We are still gonna have songs like “Save Me” but I think it will probably have some more aggression. We have been writing now, John Comprix and I, for a while, I have a lot of ideas and melodies in my head that I really can’t use anywhere else (laughs). Its nice I get to use em for Beyond Fear. I mean I have been a writer for many years but I don’t get to do it as much as I would like and Iced Earth just keeps me so busy but its nice that every once and sic a while I get to do my thing with Beyond Fear.

Before the film, Newton-John was known for country pop and adult contemporary songs. Following the huge success of Grease, and inspired by her characters transformation from goody-goody [...] "Sandy 1" [...] to the sexy, spandex-clad [...] "Sandy 2", she traded her previous musical styles for a sexier and more aggressive pop image. Later that same year, Newton-John released the studio album Totally Hot, and two years later, the Xanadu soundtrack (1980), both with a more pop-oriented style than in her past albums. Physical was recorded and released in 1981, marking the longest gap between Newton-John studio albums at the time; from 1971 to 1978, she recorded at least one studio album per year. Newton-John feared that she could be overexposed with many works released in a short period.|$|E

5000|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts. [...] "Every female you see at a piano is either Lynsey de Paul or Carole King. And most male music - not all of it but the good stuff - really lays it on you.

[...] Bush, speaking to Melody Maker magazine in 1977. Bush was put on retainer for two years by Bob Mercer, managing director of EMI group-repertoire division. According to Mercer he felt Bush's material was good enough to be released but felt that if the album failed it would be demoralising and if it was successful Bush was too young to handle it. However, in a 1987 interview, Gilmour disputed this version of events, blaming EMI for initially using [...] "wrong" [...] producers.|$|E
5000|$|In interviews, Hendrix usually gave {{different}} {{answers about}} the development of the song's lyrics. Biographer Harry Shapiro points out that [...] "Purple Haze" [...] is most likely [...] "a pot-pourri of ideas" [...] which Hendrix developed over time. As a fan of science fiction, he frequently incorporated its imagery in his songwriting. Hendrix read Night of Light, a 1966 novel by Philip Jose Farmer, that expanded on a short story published in 1957. In the story set on a distant planet, sunspots produce a [...] "purplish haze" [...] which has a disorienting effect on the inhabitants. An early handwritten draft by Hendrix, titled [...] "Purple Haze - Jesus Saves", uses dream-like imagery where the sense of direction and time is distorted. In an interview on January 28, 1967, before the song was completed, Hendrix was asked how he wrote songs; he responded, [...] "I dream a lot and I put my dreams down as songs. I wrote one called 'First Look Around the Corner' and another called 'The Purple Haze,' which was about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea." [...] He later expressed frustration that he was unable to more fully develop his ideas for the song: You know the song we had named 'Purple Haze'? It had about a thousand, thousand words ... I had it all written out. It was about going through, through this land. This mythical ... because that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is write a lot of mythical scenes. You know, like the history of the wars on Neptune. So far, only a crumpled single sheet of ruled yellow tablet paper is on exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and does not include any of the lyrics used in the Experience song. [...] Chandler admitted that in the early stages, he helped Hendrix shape the songs and lyrics to radio single length. Biographer Keith Shadwick comments that although much of the complexity may have been sacrificed, it resulted in verses that are [...] "simple, focused and striking." [...] After its release, Hendrix offered another explanation: [...] "He song's protagonist likes this girl so much, that he doesn't know what state he's in, ya know. A sort of daze, I suppose. That's what the song is all about." [...] This draws on an experience Hendrix had while still in New York, where he felt that a girl was attempting to use voodoo to trap him and he became ill. Shapiro believes that this is reflected in most of the first two verses: ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{class of}} {{sentences}} in German is discussed that are often called whexclamatives. […] So called wh-exclamatives can be roughly characterized as wh-clauses that are embedded under exclamative predicates like erstaunt sein/to be amazed at [ [...] . ] or that are {{used as the basis}} for an exclamation [ [...] . ]. One can ask if wh-exclamatives are a clause-type of their own, in particular, whether they are different from wh-clauses in question environments, that is under question predicates like to ask or to wonder or used as questions. It is often assumed that wh-clauses in exclamative contexts, both embedded and unembedded, are indeed different from wh-clauses in interrogative or question environments [ [...] . ], at least regarding their semantical type, see for example Elliot (1971, 1974), Grimshaw (1979, 1981), Zaefferer (1983, 1984), Altmann (1 987, 1993).

The academic self-concept consists of scales of self-concept in mathematics (10 items), Portuguese (10 items), and school in general (10 items). Examples of items for academic self-concept are “I really want to take math classes,” “I have good grades in Portuguese,” and “I learn very fast in every school class.” The non-academic self-concept consists of four scales: self-concept in the relationship with parents (nine items) and self-concept in relationships with friends (nine items), which {{are part of the}} social self-concept, and self-concept related to the physical appearance (nine items) and physical competence (nine items), which form the physical self-concept.
