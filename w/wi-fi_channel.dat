In this paper, we pose the following question: Can devices use the multiple orthogonal <b>channels</b> in <b>wi-fi</b> networks simultaneously to realize a high data-rate wireless link and hence cater to applications requiring high bandwidths? In other words, given that there are 3 orthogonal <b>wi-fi</b> <b>channels</b> in the 2. 4 GHz band and 12 orthogonal <b>wi-fi</b> <b>channels</b> in the 5 GHz band, can a pair of devices each equipped with 15 wi-fi radios use all the available orthogonal channels to achieve a high data-rate link operating at 600 Mbps? Surprisingly, we find through experimental evaluation that the actual observed performance when using all fifteen orthogonal channels between two devices is a mere 91 Mbps. We identify the reasons behind the low performance and present Glia, a software only solution that effectively exercises all available radios. We prototype Glia and show using experimental evaluations that Glia helps achieve close to 600 Mbps data-rate when using all possible <b>wi-fi</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R

Given a spectrum of colors, endowed with a matrix of interferences between each pair of colors, the Threshold Spectrum Coloring problem fixes the number of colors available and aims to minimize the interference threshold, i. e., the maximum of the interferences at the vertices. Conversely, the Chromatic Spectrum Coloring problem fixes a threshold and aims to minimize the number of colors for which respecting that threshold is possible. As main theoretical results, we prove tight upper bounds for the solutions to each problem. Since both problems {{turn out to be}} NP-hard, we complete the scene with experimental results.

This measurement demonstrates that our sensing engine is capable of seamless capturing and performing accurate channel occupation assessments.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a novel {{denial of service}} attack targeted at popular smartphone operating systems. This type of attack, which we call a Denial of Convenience (DoC) attack, prevents non-technical savvy victims from utilizing data services by exploiting the connectivity management protocol of smartphones ’ operating systems when encountered with a Wi-Fi access point. By setting up a fake Wi-Fi access point without Internet access (using simple devices such as a laptop), an adversary can prompt a smartphone with enabled Wi-Fi features to automatically terminate a valid mobile broadband connection and connect to this fake Wi-Fi access point. This, as a result, prevents the targeted smartphone from having any type of Internet connection unless the victim is capable of diagnosing the problem and disabling the Wi-Fi features manually. For the majority of smartphone users that have little networking knowledge, {{this can be a}} challenging task. We demonstrate that most current smartphones, including iPhone and Android phones, are vulnerable to this DoC attack. To address this attack, we propose implementing a novel Internetaccess validation protocol to validate a Wi-Fi access point by taking advantage of the cellular network channel.

40|$|A {{wireless}} {{channel is}} shared by all devices, in the vicinity, that are tuned to the channel, and at any given time, {{only one of the}} devices can transmit information. One way to overcome this limitation, in throughput capacity, is to use multiple orthogonal channels for different devices, that want to transmit information at the same time. In this work, we consider the use of multiple orthogonal channels in wireless data networks. We explore algorithms and protocols for such multi-channel wireless networks under two broad categories of network-wide and link-level challenges. Towards handling the network-wide issues, we consider the channel assignment and routing issues in multi-channel wireless networks. We study both single radio and multi-radio multi-channel networks. For single radio multi-channel networks, we propose a new granularity for channel assignment, that we refer to as component level channel assignment. The strategy is relatively simple, and is characterized by several impressive practical advantages. For multi-radio multi-channel networks, we propose a joint routing and channel assignment protocol, known as Lattice Routing. The protocol manages channels of the radios, for the different nodes in the network, using information about current channel conditions, and adapts itself to varying traffic patterns, in order to efficiently use the multiple channels. Through ns 2 based simulations, we show how both the protocols outperform other existing protocols for multi-channel networks under different network environments. Towards handling the link-level challenges, we identify the practical challenges in achieving a high data-rate wireless link across two devices using multiple off-the-shelf wireless radios. Given that the IEEE 802. 11 a/g standards define 3 orthogonal <b>wi-fi</b> <b>channels</b> in the 2. 4 GHz band and 12 orthogonal <b>wi-fi</b> <b>channels</b> in the 5 GHz band, we answer the following question: ``can a pair of devices each equipped with 15 wi-fi radios use all the available orthogonal channels to achieve a high data-rate link operating at 600 Mbps?'

Recently, there are theoretic studies that apply proportional fair packet scheduling in FDMA-based 3 GPP LTE [16, 17] and CSMA-based OFDMA systems [10, 18]. These work solved the resource allocation problem by mathematical modeling while assuming that the perfect channel quality information is available via the training sequence (e.g., pilot signal). This is less practical in Wi-Fi networks, since the AP and users do not maintain tight synchronization as in the cellular system. Therefore, we practically consider the <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>channel</b> estimation overhead.|$|E
40|$|Tight {{coupling}} of LTE and Wi-Fi networks {{is accomplished}} by binding their protocol stacks. LTE Wi-Fi radio level integration with IPSec tunnel (LWIP) corresponds to realizing this binding at IP layer. A collocated deployment of LWIP enables greater flexibility in utilizing the channel efficiently. With the advent of bandwidth-hungry smartphone Apps and IoT applications, the cellular uplink resources become highly demanding. This enforces Wi-Fi to support efficient uplink transmissions since the uplink transmissions through Wi-Fi suffers high contention because of distributed nature of Wi-Fi MAC. In order to improve <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>channel</b> utilization by leveraging the potential of LWIP in controlling and coordinating the transmissions through LTE and Wi-Fi links, we introduce Network Coordination Function (NCF) in LWIP. The proposed NCF focuses on coordinating the uplink transmissions through Wi-Fi in a network with high load. NCF enhances the channel utilization of Wi-Fi network by regulating the packet arrival rate to the Wi-Fi link and also by revamping medium access techniques at the Wi-Fi interface of users associated with LWIP node. NCF is composed of four different uplink traffic steering algorithms with diverse objectives which improve <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>channel</b> utilization by (i) minimizing collisions among LWIP users, (ii) increasing transmission opportunities for Wi-Fi users that are connected to legacy Wi-Fi APs operating on the same channel, and (iii) ensuring fairness for both LWIP and Wi-Fi users. Interestingly, NCF has not only improved the throughput of LWIP users but also the throughput of Wi-Fi users. Simulation experiments reveal that NCF has reduced collisions in the Wi-Fi uplink by 13 - 53 % and improved throughput by 10 - 37 % as compared to Wi-Fi offloading and Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) ...|$|E
