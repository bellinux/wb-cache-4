40|$|A {{number of}} <b>weigh</b> <b>stations</b> {{are unable to}} keep pace with current truck traffic levels. In response, state {{enforcement}} agencies are compelled to seek capacity enhancements for the <b>weigh</b> <b>stations.</b> One response is to increase physical capacity by adding a ramp weigh-in-motion (WIM) scale, a sorter and a bypass lane. Electronic screening, on the other hand, is a feasible option for increasing capacity without expanding physical infrastructure of the <b>weigh</b> <b>station.</b> This study compares the impact of these two alternatives in terms of travel time savings and enhanced productivity for a selected high traffic <b>weigh</b> <b>station</b> using a simulation model. The results indicate that physical expansion could improve a <b>weigh</b> <b>station</b> efficiency to some extent in a shorter amount of time than electronic screening programs.

5000|$|Coal was {{typically}} mined in remote areas, often mountainous. The miners lived in crude housing provided at low cost by the companies, and shopped in company stores. There were few amenities, and few alternative industries besides the railroads and saloons. The anthracite mines of Pennsylvania were owned by large railroads, and managed by bureaucrats. Scranton {{was at the}} center. [...] Bituminous mines were locally owned. The social system revolved {{not so much on}} occupation (nearly all inhabitants were blue collar workers with similar incomes) but on ethnicity. Welsh and English miners had the highest prestige and the best jobs, followed by the Irish. At a lower status stood recent immigrants from Italy and Eastern Europe; recent arrivals from the Appalachian hills were lower status. The ethnic groups would stick together, seldom mingling. Blacks were sometimes brought in as strike breakers. There was little machinery apart from the railroad. Before mechanization began about 1910 the miners relied on brute force, pick-axe, hand drills and dynamite to smash lumps of coal out of the wall, and shovel them into mule-drawn carts that hauled it to the <b>weighing</b> <b>station,</b> and the railroad cars. The culture was heavily masculine, with strength, virility, and physical courage held in high regard. Boxing was the favored sport. Opportunities for women were strictly limited, until textile companies after 1900 started opening small factories in the larger coal towns to employ women. Religion was in high regard, as each group was fiercely loyal to its denomination. Schooling was limited. The aspiration of the boys was to get a job helping around the mines until they were old enough to work underground as [...] "real" [...] miners.|$|E
