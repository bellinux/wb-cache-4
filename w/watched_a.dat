5|$|The 1980s saw {{the number}} of {{supporters}} falling {{to some of the}} ground's lowest levels. The lowest ever attendance at Prenton Park was on 20 February 1984, when only 937 supporters <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 victory over Halifax Town. However, the decade also saw a high number of supporters in the ground for other reasons. In the Hillsborough disaster, 96 Liverpool F.C. fans lost their lives and, on 15 April 1989, 12,000 people attended a memorial service at Prenton Park.|$|E

Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled it away and then committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E
5|$|Dr. James Baxter of the Everton {{committee}} donated a £1,000 {{interest-free loan}} to build Goodison Park. The stadium was England's first purpose-built football ground, with stands on three sides. Goodison Park was officially opened on 24 August 1892 by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the Football Association. No football was played; instead the 12,000 crowd <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> short athletics event followed by {{music and a}} fireworks display.

Clarke nearly turned the job down as {{he felt that the}} BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E

After repeated futile attempts to convince first the FBI, and then the author and film director Nora Ephron (who he hoped would make a movie about the case), he contacted a private investigator in New York City. In 2010 the detective, Skipp Porteous, published a book postulating that Christiansen was the hijacker. In early 2011 an episode of the History series Brad Meltzer's Decoded also summarized the circumstantial evidence linking Christiansen to the Cooper case.|$|E

5|$|Since the 20thcentury it {{has been}} {{traditional}} for the newly crowned monarch {{and other members of}} the royal family to sit for official portraits at Buckingham Palace and appear on the balcony, from where in 1953 they <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> flypast by the Royal Air Force. During the appearance, the monarch wears the Imperial State Crown and, if there is one, the queen consort wears her consort crown. In the evening, a fireworks display is held nearby, usually in Hyde Park. In 1902, EdwardVII's illness led to the postponement of a fourteen-course banquet at Buckingham Palace. In 1953, two state banquets were held in the ballroom there, and classical music was provided by the Royal Horse Guards.|$|E

Tom Hanks came to {{a portion of the}} recording session and read the Bixby letter – which appears in the movie – to the orchestra at the behest of Williams.

5|$|Atlético had {{its first}} home ground built in 1912 at Paraopeba Avenue, in {{downtown}} Belo Horizonte, {{across the street}} from América's first stadium. The club's main ground for most of its early years, however, was the Presidente Antônio Carlos stadium, which held 5,000 people; it was nicknamed Estádio de Lourdes for the quarter in which it was located. The Antônio Carlos {{was one of the first}} stadiums in Brazil to feature floodlights, and opened on 30 May 1929 with a friendly against Corinthians, won by Atlético 4–2. The following year, the stadium was visited by FIFA president Jules Rimet, who <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> night game for the first time. The stadium fell out of favour when the larger Independência was built in 1950, and remained largely unused by the first team; eventually it was sold by the club to the Belo Horizonte municipality in the 1960s. After decades of legal disputes with the municipal government, the property returned to the club in 1991. It was leased to a shopping mall in 1995, which was built in the following year where the stadium once was, {{across the street from}} Atlético's administrative headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Back in the League, Hollis took Charsley's {{place in}} goal, as {{customary}} in the latter's absence. The heavy ground did not suit the visitors, Grimsby Town, and the Small Heath forwards' hard-working combination play brought them victory by eight goals to three. The following week, the Coventry Road ground hosted benefit matches for striking ironplate-workers. Around 1,500 spectators <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> match between tinplate- and ironplate-workers' elevens, {{followed by a}} second between teams raised by former Aston Villa captain Archie Hunter, whose poor health prevented him playing, and the recently retired Small Heath forward Eddy Stanley, who led his team to a 9–3 victory. Small Heath went into March with a four-point lead over Darwen, each club having only two League games left to play, but the former's goal average was so much superior that Sheffield United, in third place, ten points behind with five games in hand, were the only team still able to overhaul them.|$|E

He began attending Hounslow College and stayed there through his early teenage years. He was influenced by Elvis Presley by hearing his records at home and at the local youth club. He switched to go to Acton County Grammar School (now Acton High School) to take his O Levels, where he was in the same class as Pete Townshend, but became distracted from studies after leaving the local cinema having <b>watched</b> <b>a</b> Presley film, deciding {{that he wanted to be}} a rock'n'roll singer.
