25|$|Leave for a quashing order must {{generally}} be applied for {{within three months}} of the act or decision that is sought to be quashed. However, an application for leave can still be allowed if the applicant can account for the delay to the satisfaction of the court. There is no specified time limit within which leave to apply for a mandatory order or prohibiting order must be sought. However, the High Court has held that such an application should be made <b>without</b> <b>undue</b> <b>delay.</b>|$|E
500|$|In addition, {{there is}} a time {{requirement}} which stipulates that leave shall not be granted to apply for a quashing order to remove any judgment, order, conviction or other proceeding for the purpose of its being quashed, unless the application for leave is made within three months after the date of the proceeding or such other period (if any) as may be prescribed by any written law. However, the High Court may allow an application for leave to be filed out of time if the delay [...] "is accounted for to the satisfaction of the Judge", {{as was the case in}} Chai Chwan v.

40|$|The {{new member}} {{countries}} of the European Union professed {{on the day of}} their entry to adopt the single European currency Euro <b>without</b> <b>undue</b> <b>delays.</b> There arise two quite fundamental questions within this context, which are: “When will they make this step?” and “Will they be able, in this period, to achieve such a level of the real convergence, which enables them to enjoy all the advantages and to face up all the risks which are associated with the entry into the monetary union?” We have tried to find a partial answer to the second question within our paper, which is devoted to the questions of the real convergence of the Czech Republic and Poland the Euro-zone. Within the analysis carried out by ourselves we {{came to the conclusion that}} both the Polish and Czech economy will have to, in five following years, pass through a rather decisive process of the real convergence as the present state of their economies brings along a number of risks, which could after the adopting of Euro destabilize the economic situation in these countries. ...|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "freedom {{to provide}} {{services}}" [...] under TFEU article 56 applies {{to people who}} give services [...] "for remuneration", especially commercial or professional activity. For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state {{would be enough to}} pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56 because usually the state funds it, but higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a [...] "service" [...] even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was <b>without</b> <b>undue</b> <b>delay,</b> and it followed [...] "international medical science" [...] on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true {{in the context of the}} UK's National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction.|$|E

40|$|Background: Anovulation is {{a common}} cause of {{infertility}} and induction of ovulation with oral agents such as clomifene is the treatment of choice in women with normogonadotropic anovulation. While such treatment is able to achieve ovulation in many, some women fail to respond thus termed as having clomifene resistance. Knowledge on factors associated with such resistance would enable us to counsel patients more accurately and offer alternative treatment modalities <b>without</b> <b>undue</b> <b>delays.</b> This study was aimed at identifying factors associated with clomifene resistance among infertile women with WHO group II anovulation at a teaching hospital in Sri Lanka. Method: A case control study was done at the Infertility clinic of the North Colombo teaching hospital, Ragama conducted {{by the department of}} obstetrics & Gynaecology of the University of Kelaniya. Women with WHO group II anovulation (n= 128) were included and underwent induction of ovulation with clomifene citrate starting at a dose of 50 mg per day, increased up to 150 mg till ovulation was achieved. Those who fail to respond to a maximum dose of 150 mg were termed as clomifene resistant. The factors known to be associated with clomifene resistance were compared between the two groups who responded and those who failed to respond. The study was registered with the Sri Lankan clinical trial registry maintained by the Sri Lanka Medical association. The study was funded by the National Science foundation of Sri Lanka through a research grant (Grant No: RG/ 2007 /HS/ 08) Results: Ovulation was achieved in 77. 3 % (n= 99) of subjects and therefore the prevalence of clomifene resistance was 22. 8 % (n= 29). Among those who responded, 41 did so at a dose of 50 mg per day while 40 % did with 100 mg, thus over 80 % achieving ovulation at a dose of 100 mg per day or less. The factors associated with clomifene resistance in this population included infertility of more than three years (OR 2. 06, 95 %CI 1. 51 - 9. 14), presenc...|$|R

This report describes the successful management of a patella fracture sustained on the Subantarctic island of South Georgia. A 36 -year-old boating officer presented to the island surgery after sustaining an isolated closed injury to his left knee. On physical examination {{there was a large}} effusion palpable within the joint, and on subsequent radiography an undisplaced transverse fracture of the patella was apparent. The patient had an intact and competent extensor mechanism, and fulfilled indications for non-operative management. His clinical case was discussed with supervising consultants at the British Antarctic Survey Medical Unit in the United Kingdom, and radiographs forwarded electronically for an orthopaedic review. The decision was made to undertake medical evacuation of the patient. There were additional environmental factors to be considered in this situation. The terrain on South Georgia is rugged and unforgiving, there is a risk of injury posed by the local fauna (Arctocephalus gazella) during summer months, and emergency evacuation from the base would be difficult for any person with restricted mobility. A planned retrieval enabled our patient to continue rehabilitation and physiotherapy in the preferrential setting of his home country, <b>without</b> causing <b>undue</b> <b>delay</b> in time taken returning to work in this remote location...|$|R

To ensure implementation of amendments of Annex IV in port of Klaipeda, the analysis framework model was defined by authors. The model evaluates the readiness of the port to changes brought by the amendments of MARPOL Annex IV. The scientific problem comes with perception of adequacy.

Based on these sources, criteria that must be met to ensure adequacy were identified and tested in article: 1) reception facilities meet needs of ships normally using them; 2) discharge of sewage does to cause undue delay; 3) reception facilities does not provide disincentive to use them; 4) facilities are accessible; 5) facilities contribute to the improvement of the marine environment...|$|R

5000|$|MiFID II has the {{potential}} to be the most significant catalyst for change in the market for investment research in decades. Crucially, the implementation of MiFID II, which is currently scheduled for January 2018, will require all sell side research to be individually priced and thus effect full price transparency. Investment firms will be required to set and assess research budgets and MiFID II states that that payment must be direct, out of the firm’s own resources, <b>without</b> any <b>undue</b> <b>delay.</b> Full unbundling will finally be achieved as fund management firms will be required to create research payment accounts (RPAs) based on a pre-set budget independent of trading activity. This has met with heavy criticism and lobbying from a number of industry organisations. The MiFID II text also includes further demands of buy side firms which will require buyers and sellers to review and revise the research procurement process. [...] The FCA has already issued a statement of “support” for ESMA’s new policies for investment research and advising asset management firms to start making changes now to prepare themselves for the inevitable regulatory change. While MiFID II’s scope is pan-European only, the regulator recognises that its proposed changes may resonate on a global scale as asset managers are likely to adopt a common system across their global businesses.|$|R
