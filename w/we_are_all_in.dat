"These very {{straight}} people have somehow grasped what cities can be all about," [...] Halprin said, turning from dignitaries to revelers {{to emphasize the}} democratic spirit underlying his design.

500|$|On 12 June 2012, Spearritt {{denied the}} reunion plans {{and stated that}} she will not return to S Club or {{continue}} her music career and will keep on pursuing her acting career. She stated [...] "It's cool that bands like Steps are getting back together, because it's worked out for lots of people. But I don't see it in my plans at all. In the future, I hope I'll still be working {{and being able to}} do what I love. I feel very lucky at the minute, and doing theatre has really opened more doors for me. So as long as I can keep doing what I love, I'm very lucky." [...] On 24 March 2013, Stevens said to the Daily Mirror that a reunion could still happen: [...] "We met up not long ago and we talked about it and we still are talking about it. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> the same head space, talking about how special it was and we do all want to celebrate what we had. So it's definitely a possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|By 8 May a {{continuous}} southerly gale had driven the ship northwards, still {{locked in the}} ice, out of McMurdo Sound and into the open Ross Sea. In his diary for 9 May Stenhouse summarised Aurora's position: [...] "...fast in the pack and drifting God knows where [...] <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> good health [...] we have good spirits and we will get through." [...] He recognised {{that this was the}} end of any hope of wintering the ship in McMurdo Sound, and expressed concern for the men at Cape Evans: [...] "It is a dismal prospect for them [...] we have the remaining Burberrys, clothing etc for next year's sledging still on board." [...] During the next two days the winds reached a force that made it impossible for the men to work on deck, but on 12 May the weather had moderated sufficiently for a temporary wireless aerial to be rigged, and Hooke began trying to contact the men ashore. His Morse messages failed to reach Cape Evans. Although the transmitter's range was normally no more than , Hooke attempted to raise the radio station at Macquarie Island, more than [...] away, again without success.|$|E

I remember <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> {{the control}} room listening to the tympani part with the drums muted. Someone commented how cool it sounded like that, so we kept it that way. I'm glad we did.|$|R
2500|$|General Ian Hamilton, {{the overall}} Allied commander, {{recorded}} on 29 August that [...] "this evening <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> good form {{owing to the}} news from Anzac. Knoll 60, now ours throughout, commands the Biyuk Anafarta valley with view and fire —a big tactical scoop." [...] This {{was based on a}} report from Birdwood who mistakenly believed that the knoll itself had been taken whereas, [...] in reality, the Turks still occupied half of Hill 60.|$|R
500|$|The {{eruption}} {{was heard}} {{hundreds of miles}} away, but {{some of those who}} survived the eruption declared that the landslide and pyroclastic flows were silent as they raced down the mountain. Krau Kilpatrick, an employee of the United States Forest Service, recalled, [...] "There was no sound to it, not a sound. It was like a silent movie and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> it." [...] The reason for this discrepancy is a [...] "quiet zone", created {{as a result of the}} motion and temperature of air and, to a lesser extent, upon local topography.|$|R
2500|$|O'Connor in June 1993 wrote {{a public}} letter in The Irish Times which asked people to [...] "stop hurting" [...] her: [...] "If only I can {{fight off the}} voices of my parents / and gather a sense of {{self-esteem}} / Then I'll be able to REALLY sing ..." [...] The letter repeated accusations of abuse by her parents as a child which O'Connor had made in interviews. Her brother Joseph defended their father to the newspaper but agreed regarding their mother's [...] "extreme and violent abuse, both emotional and physical". Sinead said that month, [...] "Our family is very messed up. We can't communicate with each other. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> agony. I for one am in agony." ...|$|E
2500|$|I am who I am, {{and what}} I {{believe in and}} what my spirituality is about is that we're all in this together. That I think {{it is not a}} good thing to believe as human beings we can turn our backs on the {{suffering}} of other people ... and this is not Judaism, this is what Pope Francis is talking about, that we can't just worship billionaires and the making of more and more money. Life is more than that. In 2016, he stated he had [...] "very strong religious and spiritual feelings" [...] and explained, [...] "My spirituality is that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> this together and that when children go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 3 September 1849 the diarist of the Washington {{expedition}} said of {{the western}} entrance to the park, [...] "I noticed towering pines and firs, also the oak, the aspen, and the willow; and bordering the stream {{there was a great}} variety of shrubbery, the hop vine, loaded with its fruit, being intertwined among them. [...] Flowers of rich profusion and of every hue and delicacy, were also constantly before the eye–upwards of ninety varieties having been picked up since we entered the gorge [...] yesterday. [...] Indeed, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> hopes that, yesterday and today, we have been having an earnest of what we may yet behold {{in this part of the}} world–a rich, well-timbered and sufficiently well-watered country." ...|$|E
500|$|Jamie Edwards, who {{had helped}} record and tour for Happiness... was heavily {{utilized}} during the recording process and was becoming {{a big part of}} the band, considered by some to be the unofficial fifth member of the band at that time. Taggart recounted in 2010, [...] "He’s an amazing guitar player, and he played on the record. People don’t know that he had a lot to do with that stuff. He <b>was</b> very influential. <b>We</b> had him <b>in</b> <b>all</b> our writing sessions. It was a very creative time that <b>was</b> cool because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> a room, kind of working together.” ...|$|R

For our private needs, {{there were only three}} chamberpots. They had to be emptied into an old rusty cauldron which also served for washing our clothes. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> forbidden to have food brought to us from outside, and were given disgusting soup cooked with soda ash which kept us {{in a constant state of}} dysentery. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> a deplorable state.

2500|$|The {{business}} of interpretation is obviously very complicated. Literary {{uses of the}} problem of free-will and necessity, for example, may be noticed to give curiously bad arguments and I should think get their strength from keeping you in doubt between the two methods. Thus Hardy is fond of showing us an unusually stupid person subjected to very unusually bad luck, and then a moral is drawn, not merely by inference but by solemn assertion, that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> the same boat as this person whose story is striking precisely because it is unusual. The effect may be very grand, but to make an otherwise logical reader accept the process must depend on giving him obscure reasons for wishing it so. It is clear at any rate that this grand notion of the inadequacy of life, so various in its means of expression, so reliable a bass note in the arts, needs to be counted as a possible territory of the pastoral.|$|E

2500|$|Journalist Mary Holland {{recalled}} {{seeing one}} of the men being dragged past a group of journalists: [...] "He didn't cry out, just looked at us with terrified eyes, as though <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> enemies <b>in</b> a foreign country who wouldn't have understood what language he was speaking if he called out for help." ...|$|R

40|$|This is {{an account}} of four workers in the human {{services}} who have developed an ongoing collective experience. The four of us, all white, professional social workers, drew together in the late Spring, 1972. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> involved <b>in</b> academic life, primarily as social work professors, although {{one of us was}} detaching himself from academic life at that time...|$|R
2500|$|Cooper {{stated that}} [...] "we made [...] {{decision}} early on" [...] {{to keep the}} same plot structure. [...] "I remember we did this photo shoot for Vanity Fair and that <b>was</b> when <b>we</b> first talked about a sequel in a realistic way; and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> the room together afterwards and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> saying 'here's the choice: do we stray from the structure or do we run straight for it?' And we all agreed, no question about it, we hadn't earned {{the ability to take}} these 3 guys out {{and put them in a}} new structure. There needs to be a ticking clock, there needs to be a missed night and there needs to be someone who's gone and a woman who is waiting to get married and a guy who needs to get married." ...|$|R

500|$|Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim {{described}} von Neumann as the [...] "fastest mind I ever met", and Jacob Bronowski wrote [...] "He was the cleverest man I ever knew, without exception. He was a genius." [...] George Pólya, whose lectures at ETH Zürich von Neumann attended as a student, said [...] "Johnny was {{the only}} student I was ever afraid of. If {{in the course of}} a lecture I stated an unsolved problem, the chances were he'd come to me at the end of the lecture with the complete solution scribbled on a slip of paper." [...] Eugene Wigner writes: [...] ""Jancsi," [...] I might say, [...] "Is angular momentum always an integer of h?

40|$|In a few years, {{men will}} be able to {{communicate}} more effectively through a machine than face to face. That is a rather startling thing to say, but it is our conclusion. As if in confirmation of it, we participated a few weeks ago in a technical meeting held through a computer. In two days, the group accomplished {{with the aid of a}} computer what normally might have taken a week. We shall talk more about the mechanics of the meeting later; it is sufficient to note here that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>in</b> the same room. But for all the communicating we did directly across that room, <b>we</b> could have <b>been</b> thousands of miles apart and communicated just as effectively-as people-over the distance.
