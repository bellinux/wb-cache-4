500|$|In the {{literature}} concerning artificial intelligence, Searle's essay has been {{second only to}} Turing's in the volume of debate it has generated. [...] Searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients {{it would take to}} make a machine conscious: all he proposed <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> was needed was [...] "causal powers" [...] of the sort that the brain has and that computers lack. But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary (though perhaps still not sufficient) extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the Turing test, but the robotic version, which requires grounding the robot's words in the robot's sensorimotor capacity to categorize and interact with the things in the world that its words are about, Turing-indistinguishably from a real person. Turing-scale robotics is an empirical branch of research on embodied cognition and situated cognition.|$|E
2500|$|The Industrial Revolution was {{beginning}} in the period between the writing and publication of A Tale of a Tub, though {{no one at the}} time would have known this. What Englishmen did know, however, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> they called [...] "trade" [...] was on the rise. Merchants, importers/exporters, and [...] "stock jobbers" [...] were growing very wealthy. It was becoming more common to find members of the aristocracy with less money than members of the trading class. Those on the rise in the middle class professions were perceived as being more likely to be dissenters than members of the other classes were, and such institutions as the stock exchange and Lloyd's of London were founded by Puritan traders. Members of these classes were also widely ridiculed as attempting to pretend to learning and manners that they had no right to. Further, these [...] "new men" [...] were not, by and large, the product of the universities nor the traditional secondary schools. Consequently, these now wealthy individuals were not conversant in Latin, were not enamored of the classics, and were not inclined to put much value on these things.|$|E
2500|$|Buñuel's {{films were}} {{famous for their}} surreal imagery, [...] {{including}} scenes in which chickens populate nightmares, women grow beards, and aspiring saints are desired by lascivious women. Even in the many movies he made for hire (rather than for his own creative reasons), such as Susana and The Great Madcap, he usually added his trademark of disturbing and surreal images. [...] Some critics {{have pointed out that}} one reason why Buñuel found working in Mexico so congenial <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> might seem unusual or even outlandish in Europe or the United States fit comfortably with elements of Mexican culture and the audience's expectations of national melodrama. [...] As filmmaker Tomás Pérez Turrent has commented, when referring to the apparently incredible features that many critics find in Buñuel's films: [...] "In Mexico, it's believable", while {{one of the founders of}} Surrealism, André Breton, called Mexico, [...] "the most surrealist country in the world." [...] Certainly, running through the more personal films of Buñuel's early and late years is a backbone of surrealism; [...] Buñuel's world is one in which an entire dinner party suddenly finds itself inexplicably unable to leave the room and go home, a bad dream hands a man a letter which he brings to the doctor the next day, and where the devil, if unable to tempt a saint with a pretty girl, will fly him to a disco. An example of a more Dada influence can be found in Cet obscur objet du désir, when Mathieu closes his eyes and has his valet spin him around and direct him to a map on the wall.|$|E
