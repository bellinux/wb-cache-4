25|$|Bunty, 0-4-0 <b>wing</b> <b>tank,</b> W G Bagnall no. 1480 of 1896. Arrived 1904 from an Irish contract. Sold by 1908 to Sir John Jackson Ltd for {{a project}} in Kinlochleven. Formerly named Crosshaven.|$|E
25|$|Mid-morning on 27 January 1983, a B-52G (57-6507) {{exploded}} on the maintenance ramp, killing five maintenance personnel and injuring eight. A faulty fuel pump in a <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> was being attended to {{prior to the}} accident.|$|E
25|$|Though the FQIS {{itself was}} {{designed}} to prevent danger by minimizing voltages and currents, the innermost tube of Flight 800's FQIS compensator showed damage {{similar to that of}} the compensator tube identified as the ignition source for the surge tank fire that destroyed a 747 near Madrid in 1976. This was not considered proof of a source of ignition. Evidence of arcing was found in a wire bundle that included FQIS wiring connecting to the center <b>wing</b> <b>tank.</b> Arcing signs were also seen on two wires sharing a cable raceway with FQIS wiring at station 955.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ballast system}} has six {{integral}} <b>tanks</b> in the <b>wings.</b> The outboard <b>tanks</b> are filled first and dumped last for better spanwise load distribution. The tail ballast system incorporates two separate tanks {{to maintain a}} favourable C.G. during water dumping. The control of the first tail tank {{is connected to the}} four outer <b>wing</b> <b>tanks,</b> the second tail tank operates with to the two inner <b>wing</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} an {{enhanced}} Mid-Deck Tanker {{and consists of}} a series of centre and <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> that are divided by horizontal bulkheads. The upper <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> form ballast tanks and act as emergency receiver tanks for cargo should the lower tanks be fractured. The lower tanks are connected to these ballast tanks by non-return valves.|$|R
50|$|The tip tanks provide {{additional}} fuel capacity to enable longer times aloft. A jet pump installed in each tip tank transfers fuel into the <b>wing</b> <b>tanks.</b> Fuel can also flow via the flapper check valves into the <b>wing</b> <b>tanks,</b> but {{the lower half}} of the fuel in the tip tanks must be transferred with the jet pump.|$|R
500|$|On 17 September 1950 {{a pair of}} Grumman F9F-2 Panthers {{launched}} from the deck of [...] Philippine Sea. VF-112 Ensign Edward D. Jackson Jr. was leading a section [...] dispatched to strafe an airfield near North Korea's capital, Pyongyang. Flying on his wing was Ensign Dayl E. Crow. The airfield {{turned out to be}} little more than a grass strip littered with burned and shattered Soviet-built war machines. After strafing a locomotive and setting it ablaze, the jets turned north and started down the Han River. Soon, Jackson spotted about 75 river boats. When they starting receiving small arms fire from [...] "passengers" [...] on the vessels, Crow followed Jackson down as they made a low strafing pass, splintering many of the small craft with 20mm cannon fire. After the pass both attackers started to climb from [...] AGL. Jackson then flew through an aerial booby trap: steel cables strung across the Han to [...] "clothesline" [...] low flying planes. The Panther ripped through the cables like twine, but the whipsawing cable strands caught the starboard wing, shredded the wingtip tank and snapped across the canopy, punching out the windscreen and side windows. The impact knocked Jackson unconscious with severe facial injuries. Crow, flying just astern noticed something wrong, then saw the crushed <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> and shattered canopy, its inner surface misted with blood. After 20 seconds Jackson regained consciousness and found himself blinded by shards of Plexiglas and blood. Crow was able to guide his leader towards the Yellow Sea, but Jackson was fading in and out of consciousness. With only the left flap down due to damage to the right wing the Panther approached the ship {{and with the help of}} LSO Lt.j.g."Les" [...] Bruestle and Crow the blind pilot trapped the #4 wire on the first attempt. Jackson survived with 36 stitches and an emergency blood transfusion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inverted}} {{saddle tank}} was {{a variation of}} the <b>Wing</b> <b>Tank</b> where the two tanks were joined underneath the smokebox and supported it. This rare design was used for the same reasons as the <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> but provided slightly greater water capacity. [...] The Brill Tramway locomotive Wotton is believed to have had an inverted saddle tank. [...] The inverted saddle tank {{seems to have been a}} speciality of W.G.Bagnall.|$|E
2500|$|The F-4s were fitted {{out with}} the QRC-160 jamming pods {{normally}} carried only by F-105s, so that their electronic signature would be the same, and the F-4s would also fly the inflexible line-abreast pod formations used by the F-105s to maximize pod effectiveness. [...] The pods had to be mounted {{on one of the}} fuel tank wing pylons, forcing the F-4s to carry a centerline and single <b>wing</b> <b>tank,</b> creating an asymmetric imbalance that made takeoffs difficult (the aircraft would try to roll on liftoff to the side carrying the <b>wing</b> <b>tank).</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Nidd, 0-4-0 <b>wing</b> <b>tank,</b> [...] W G Bagnall no. 1423 of 1893. Arrived by 1906 from Penicuik {{aqueduct}} project near Edinburgh. Sold by 1908 to Sir John Jackson Ltd for {{a project}} in Kinlochleven.|$|E
50|$|F-21 with {{fuselage}} {{fuel tank}} deleted and 40 gal fuel capacity in two <b>wing</b> <b>tanks.</b> 6 built 1982-1984.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel system}} {{consists}} of auxiliary <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> feeding an armored, fuselage-mounted main tank, which sits just {{forward of the}} engine and behind the firewall. The main tank can feed the engine in all attitudes. This tank is continuously refilled from the main <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> with no fuel management duties required of the pilot. By feeding the main tank from the two auxiliary <b>wing</b> <b>tanks,</b> {{the size of the}} fuel tank in the fuselage was effectively halved, creating a large space behind the pilot empty of any tanks or other aircraft systems. This bay had no dedicated function on the demonstrator, but was intended to be left available for any additional equipment which the Army might wish to install in the production version.|$|R
25|$|This {{was similar}} to the A6M5c, but with {{self-sealing}} <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> and a Nakajima Sakae 31a engine featuring water-methanol engine boost.|$|R
2500|$|Wing {{tanks are}} side tanks that run {{the length of}} the smokebox, instead of the full length of the boiler. They were mainly used on narrow gauge {{industrial}} locomotives that could be frequently re-filled with water and where side or saddle tanks would restrict access to inside valve gear. [...] See Kerry Tramway Excelsior which has been described, by various sources, as both a <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> and an inverted saddle tank.|$|E
2500|$|The PA-16 Clipper is a {{stretched}} and refined {{version of the}} Vagabond intended to seat four people (or [...] "two-and-a-half to three" [...] as often told by Clipper pilots). It is equipped with an extra <b>wing</b> <b>tank,</b> added doors to accommodate the new seating, and a Lycoming O-235, the same engine that would later power the Cessna 152. The PA-16 Clipper retained the control sticks that had {{up to that point}} been common in aircraft derived from the [...] "Cub" [...] family.|$|E
2500|$|Burt Rutan created Rutan Aircraft Factory {{to market}} a {{commercial}} variation of his the Model [...] "VariViggen" [...] prototype" [...] he began building {{in his garage}} in 1968 which he called The Model 32, {{also known as the}} VariViggen SP. This model which utilized a slightly longer fuselage, larger span and winglets in order to increase efficiency. The Rutan Aircraft Factory sold over 600 plan sets for the VariViggen to homebuilders, and eventually about 20 of the aircraft were built. Following the crash of one in New Brunswick, Canada in September 2006 due to <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> fuel contamination, fewer than five are currently still flying. The prototype aircraft, N27VV, was donated to the EAA AirVenture Museum in 1988.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} 55 L {{fuel tank}} is mounted under the floor, with <b>wings</b> <b>tanks</b> optional, bringing total capacity to 95 L.|$|R

2500|$|When the Eighth Air Force resumed deep {{penetration}} bombing missions between 2 and 14 October, the 56th FG {{shot down}} 37 Germans while losing just one Thunderbolt. Its {{radius of action}} had been considerably augmented on 31 August by the installation of new belly drop tank shackles on its P-47s that permitted use of 75-gallon steel drop tanks. The Thunderbolts were also modified to pressurize the tanks above [...] by feeding vented air from the instrument vacuum pump into them, and became the norm for future operations, with range further extended periodically {{by the use of}} tanks of increasingly larger size. The use of <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> pylons did not begin until May 1944 and because of its negative effect on maneuvering performance, was not preferred.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{delivery}} of the 65th aircraft, a further change was worked into the production lines, which introduced folding wingtips {{to allow them to}} fit on aircraft carriers. The resulting Model 21 would {{become one of the most}} produced versions early in the war. A feature was the improved range with [...] <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> and [...] drop tank. When the lines switched to updated models, 740 Model 21s had been completed by Mitsubishi, and another 800 by Nakajima. Two other versions of the Model 21 were built in small numbers, the Nakajima-built A6M2-N [...] "Rufe" [...] floatplane (based on the Model 11 with a slightly modified tail), and the A6M2-K two-seat trainer of which a total of 508 were built by Hitachi and the Sasebo Naval Air Arsenal.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{completing}} the repair and run-up of the faulty engine {{that had caused}} a rejected takeoff due to an engine oil warning at Berlin Tegel during the late 1980s, a Dan-Air Boeing 727-200 Adv collided with a jetway at the airport's terminal building while maintenance engineers taxied the aircraft back to its stand. This badly injured the ground crew member manning the jetway and ruptured the fully refuelled aircraft's centre <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> at the left wing root. As a result, a large quantity of jet fuel spilled onto the tarmac. The maintenance engineers' failure to pressurise the aircraft's hydraulics had resulted in a complete loss of hydraulic pressure just before reaching the stand, {{making it impossible to}} steer the aircraft and rendering the brakes ineffective. > Captain Alan Carter] ...|$|E
50|$|The KC-135Q variant was {{modified}} to carry JP-7 fuel {{necessary for the}} Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, segregating the JP-7 from the KC-135s own fuel supply (the body tanks carrying JP-7, and the <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> carrying JP-4 or JP-8). The tanker also had special fuel systems for moving the different fuels between different tanks. When the KC-135Q model received the CFM-56 engines, it was redesignated the KC-135T model, which was capable of separating the main body <b>tanks</b> from the <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> where the KC-135 draws its engine fuel. The only external difference between a KC-135R and a KC-135T {{is the presence of}} a clear window {{on the underside of the}} empennage of the KC-135T where a remote controlled searchlight is mounted. It also has two ground refueling ports, located in each rear wheel well so ground crews can fuel both the body <b>tanks</b> and <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> separately.|$|R
5000|$|The 1979 model [...] "N" [...] {{increased}} the flap-extension speed {{for the first}} 10 degrees to 115 kn. Larger <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> {{increased the}} optional fuel to 66 gal.|$|R
5000|$|ERJ 145XR - Extra-long Range (numerous {{aerodynamic}} improvements, including winglets, strakes, etc. {{for lower}} cruise-configuration drag; a ventral fuel tank (aft location) {{in addition to}} the two main larger capacity <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> (same tanks as in the LR models); increased weight capacity; higher top speed and up-rated engines.|$|R
2500|$|During {{a flight}} on 30 October 1967, pilot Dennis Sullivan {{detected}} radar tracking {{on his first}} pass over North Vietnam. Two sites prepared to launch missiles but neither did. During the second pass, at least six missiles were fired, each confirmed by missile vapor trails on mission photography. Looking through his rear-view periscope, Sullivan saw six missile vapor trails climb to about [...] before converging on his aircraft. He noted the approach of four missiles, and although they all detonated behind him, one came within [...] of his aircraft. Post-flight inspection revealed that a piece of metal had penetrated the lower right wing fillet area and lodged against the support structure of the <b>wing</b> <b>tank.</b> The fragment was not a warhead pellet but {{may have been a}} part of the debris from one of the missile detonations observed by the pilot.|$|E
2500|$|The clean {{fuselage}} of the R.V was an internally wire braced, {{welded steel}} tube structure of rectangular cross section. The [...] Mercedes D.I water-cooled six cylinder inline engine was mounted behind a rectangular nose radiator in an aluminium covered forward fuselage region; fuel was gravity fed from a <b>wing</b> <b>tank.</b> Aft, the fuselage was fabric covered. The pilot had an open cockpit under the wing trailing edge, with one passenger next to him. Two other passengers could sit, though not stand, {{side by side}} within the fuselage forward of the pilot in a cabin lit by windows, one in the small, starboard side door, and heated by hot air from the engine. Their luggage {{was placed in a}} small compartment behind the pilot. The empennage was a steel tube structure, fabric covered. [...] The braced tailplane carried separate elevators which, like the rudder, were balanced. [...] The R.V had a simple, fixed conventional undercarriage with steel tube V struts and mainwheels on a rubber sprung single axle, together with a tailskid.|$|E
2500|$|The 747-400ER {{included}} {{the option of}} one or two additional [...] body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, however Qantas was the only customer that ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with dual body fuel tanks. Manufactured by Marshall Aerospace, these tanks utilized metal to metal honeycomb-bonded technology to achieve a high fuel volume-to-dry weight ratio. The tanks featured a double wall, integrated venting system, and achieve fuel control via a modified Fuel System Management Card (FSMC) which optimizes fuel transfer into the Center <b>Wing</b> <b>Tank</b> (CWT) in flight along with the fuel transfer from the Horizontal Stabiliser Tank (HST). The tank is removable using tooling that interfaces with the cargo loading system. Similar technology has been used by Marshall in the development of body fuel tanks for the Boeing 777-200LR and Boeing P-8A Poseidon. Other changes to the 747-400ER include relocation of oxygen system components and the potable water system tanks and pumps since the body fuel tanks prevent access to the standard locations.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} on the Mid-Deck Tanker is the Coulombi Egg Tanker, which was approved by IMO {{as an alternative to}} the double hull concept. The design consists of a series of centre and <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> that are divided by horizontal bulkheads. The upper <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> form ballast tanks and act as emergency receiver tanks for cargo should the lower tanks be fractured. The lower tanks are connected to these ballast tanks by non-return valves. The United States Coast Guard does not allow this design to enter US waters, effectively preventing it from being built.|$|R
50|$|The air {{temperature}} had been high {{at the time}} of the accident, about , while the Boeing 737-300 was parked at Manila. The air conditioning packs, located beneath the center <b>wing</b> fuel <b>tank</b> of the 737 had been running on the ground before pushback (approximately 30 to 45 minutes). The center <b>wing</b> fuel <b>tank,</b> which had not been filled since March 9, 1990, likely contained some fuel vapors. Shortly after pushback a powerful explosion in the center fuel tank pushed the cabin floor violently upwards. The <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> ruptured, causing the airplane to burst into flames.|$|R
