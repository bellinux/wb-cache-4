500|$|The {{producers}} {{worked to}} incorporate 1980s fashion {{into the show}} {{in a way that}} [...] "felt fun, definitely, but also grounded in a reality where [...] could tell dramatic stories." [...] The styles featured were therefore constructed so that viewers would not be distracted from an emotional scene by characters wearing 1980s makeup, hairstyles, or shoulder pads. In addition, show makers wanted to make the series feel [...] "like something that you'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of, rather than make fun of", and that young women would be inspired by the clothing styles featured in the spin-off as well as on Gossip Girl. During flashbacks in [...] "Valley Girls", Lily dresses in two styles of clothing. She appears in a preppy, upper-crust riding outfit while associating with her rich parents, but changes into a dress more typical of the [...] "underground punk-rock scene" [...] after running away to the San Fernando Valley.

500|$|As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates {{to shoot}} Dale, Daryl takes {{the gun and}} inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the group and have those emotions and care about these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, you can do the things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step in and take that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate {{to do the same thing}} with Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and does what he needs to do." ...|$|E

2500|$|The lawsuit, which Rolling Stone called [...] "the music industry's nastiest legal skirmishes in years," [...] was {{problematic}} for Zomba for two main reasons.

[...] Second, the lawsuit temporarily strained Zomba's relationship with BMG, whose distribution deal with Zomba was coming to a close. [...] Jive initially announced {{that they would not}} renew their deal with BMG, but reconsidered following the lawsuit with BMG and Trans Continental. [...] The distribution deal may have been a determining factor in the outcome of the lawsuit, since distributed Zomba product accounted for 5.5% of BMG's US market share, and company CEO Strauss Zelnick was under pressure not to lose that. [...] They also signed a new deal with the Backstreet Boys that gave the band a 20% royalty rate.|$|E
2500|$|In the West, since {{gatherings of}} Hippies became {{common in the}} 1970s, dreadlocks have gained {{particular}} popularity among predominantly caucasian, counterculture adherents such as hippies, crust punks, New Age travellers, goths and {{many members of the}} Rainbow Family. Many people from these cultures wear dreadlocks for similar reasons: symbolizing a rejection of government-controlled, mass-merchandising culture or to fit in with the people and crowd they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of (such as those who are fans of reggae music). Members of the cybergoth subculture also often wear blatantly artificial synthetic dreads or [...] "dreadfalls" [...] made of synthetic hair, fabric or plastic tubing. Caucasians in dreadlocks have been criticized for cultural appropriation as they generally do not face the same discrimination for adopting the style as do people of color who have historically faced oppression for wearing their hair in this, and other styles that are traditional for their hair type and cultures.|$|E
