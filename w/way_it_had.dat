5|$|By 1980, Gulf {{exhibited}} many of {{the characteristics}} of a giant corporation that had lost its <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> <b>had</b> a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation was bound to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 was in the early 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.|$|E
5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} that ended the 2007 round of strikes. The 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement saw the parties involved agree to a four-phase plan, which would be implemented with dialogue between both sides at each stage of the process. However, the Communication Workers Union said that although Royal Mail had carried out three of the phases in this <b>way,</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how these would affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E

25|$|Space, as {{an element}} of architecture, was {{utilised}} differently from the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been in the Middle Ages. Space was organised by proportional logic, its form and rhythm subject to geometry, rather than being created by intuition as in Medieval buildings. The prime {{example of this is}} the Basilica di San Lorenzo in Florence by Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446).|$|E

Despite its drastic diminution - Serious Materials had called back 75 of the plant's 250 employees, with only 38 employed by the closing's announcement - workers successfully negotiated an agreement with management by that night. Assistance and publicity coincided with the Occupy movement in Chicago, members of which came to the plant. The union agreed to 90 days of employment before the plants closing.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the ANFC {{changed its name}} to the National Football League, but {{continued}} to operate in substantially the same <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> previously. The body worked to introduce a night representative series in 1976 and remodel representative football and interstate carnivals. In 1977, the VFL established a rival competition to the NFL's night series, called the Australian Football Championships (AFC), and by 1980 this competition had replaced the NFL's competition. Through the 1980s, administration of the game increasingly shifted towards Victoria.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the USFS {{realized}} how much its renovations had damaged an architecturally significant structure and began trying to undo {{some of the changes}} it had made. It developed a plan to restore the house and estate to a condition similar to the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been in Pinchot's era, in consultation with the Park Service's Harper's Ferry Center, and hired staff with expertise in landscape and architecture. After a brief closing for this renovation, it reopened on August 11, 2001, Gifford Pinchot's birthday. The state of Pennsylvania's Department of Natural Resources also made a $2 million grant available for renovations to the entrance, entry road and parking facilities. In 2007 the USFS restored the swimming pool.|$|E
25|$|When Demetrius {{arrived in}} Babylon, Seleucus was {{somewhere in the}} east. He had left Patrocles to defend the city. Babylon was defended in an unusual <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> <b>had</b> two strong fortresses, in which Seleucus had left his garrisons. The {{inhabitants}} of the city were transferred out and settled in the neighboring areas, some as far as Susa. The surroundings of Babylon were excellent for defense, with cities, swamps, canals and rivers. Demetrius' troops started to besiege the fortresses of Babylon and managed to conquer one of them. The second fortress proved more difficult for Demetrius. He left his friend Archelaus to continue the siege, and himself returned west leaving 5,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry in Babylon. Ancient sources do not mention what happened to these troops. Perhaps Seleucus had to reconquer Babylon from Archelaus.|$|E

25|$|The Northern Railroad was not {{finished}} until 1908, {{thanks in part}} to the concession of the line to United Fruit Company (UFCO), but by then the interoceanic railway was not the critical <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been; by then, the United States had defeated Spain and after several discussions with Nicaragua and Colombia, had chosen Colombia to build and interoceanic canal and causing the separation of Panama from Colombia when the latter had tried to increase the concession conditions to build the canal. The American policity towards Central America in 1908 was focused on keeping the region as peaceful as possible, using for it American companies investments -e.g., United Fruit Company- and military interventions like the one in Panamá in 1903 and the ousting of Nicaraguan president José Santos Zelaya in 1911; all aimed to keep a swift and smooth construction of the Panama Canal.|$|E

Hot Chip used a variety of vocal structures, including layered vocals, where two takes of the same vocals were added together, changed by idiosyncrasies from the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been sung, and the doubling of a single performance, shifted out of beat.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Yang (Oh) and Hunt (McKidd) were partaking in couples therapy, was {{originally}} planned to be a comical moment. Vernoff commented on this: [...] "I handed them that scene 20 MINUTES BEFORE CAMERAS ROLLED. It was actually a funny scene {{right up until the}} last minute. Sandra and Kevin had smart questions – and what became crystal clear to me instantly is that this storyline could not be resolved in a humorous <b>way.</b> <b>It</b> <b>had</b> earned weight. Indeed, it required weight." [...] In the episode, Meredith (Pompeo) grieves her pain through constant sex with Shepherd. Vernoff explained she loves the fact that Meredith is healthy enough to realize what she is doing. At the conclusion of [...] "Goodbye", Yang finally came to terms with the death of O'Malley.

500|$|This missal {{had been}} {{owned by the}} Legh family since at least 1508. [...] It is the only known nearly {{complete}} copy of the earliest edition of a missal according to the Sarum Rite still in existence. [...] When the family moved from the house in 1946, the missal went with them, and was held for safe-keeping in the John Rylands Library in Manchester. [...] In the late 2000s the National Trust acquired it, and {{it was decided to}} return it to Lyme Park. [...] To celebrate this the décor of the library was restored to the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been during the 19thcentury. [...] This included re-graining of its ceiling, reproducing velvet for the upholstery and curtains, and re-papering the room with replica wallpaper, based on its original design.|$|E
500|$|When {{the health}} care plan, now called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed Congress and became law in March 2010, McCain {{strongly}} opposed the landmark legislation not only on its merits {{but also on the}} <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been handled in Congress. As a consequence, he warned that congressional Republicans would not be working with Democrats on anything else: [...] "There will be no cooperation {{for the rest of the}} year. They have poisoned the well in what they've done and how they've done it." [...] McCain became a vocal defender of Arizona SB 1070, the April 2010 tough anti-illegal immigration state law that aroused national controversy, saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal government's inability to control the border. In the August 24 primary, McCain beat Hayworth by a 56 to 32percent margin. McCain proceeded to easily defeat Democratic city councilman Rodney Glassman in the general election.|$|E

But we wanted to get out there and drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour was the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil." [...] Kimi Räikkönen backed him, stating: [...] "I think this is F1 and not the circus. The people are obviously not happy when we're not running but we cannot make them happy with whatever we do apart from running." ...|$|E
