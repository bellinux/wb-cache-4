5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

He recalled, [...] "My first orchestral engagement {{was with the}} Queen's Hall Orchestra – I was probably the youngest orchestral musician ever, joining them in 1916. We had an enormous repertory – six concerts a week, three hours or more rehearsal a day. In those days <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> if we began and finished together". While playing in the Queen's Hall Orchestra, Barbirolli also played in the opera pit for the Beecham and Carl Rosa opera companies, in recitals with the pianist Ethel Bartlett, with orchestras in theatres, cinemas, hotels and dance-halls, and, as he said, [...] "everywhere except the street". During {{the last year of}} World War I, Barbirolli enlisted in the army and became a lance-corporal in the Suffolk Regiment. Here he had his first opportunity to conduct, when an orchestra of volunteers was formed. He later described the experience: ...|$|E

Toni Kroos, who was chosen as Man of the Match, added that as the Germans felt that in [...] "no game of the Cup, [...] played their best", the squad entered with the tactical knowledge on how to counter Brazil: [...] "we took all the balls, and scored the goals". Löw also declared the team had [...] "no euphoria" [...] during or after the game, as they knew that the 7–1 win meant nothing for the upcoming final, saying [...] "We didn't celebrate. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy,</b> but we still have a job to do".|$|E

It was exhausting and I think we can all say <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> once it was over. But the final result was worth it."

500|$|Andy Greenwald of New York {{magazine}} called [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] a [...] "pretty great episode {{for a show}} that... seems to have gotten its groove back." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepiwall for HitFix who enjoyed the previous week's episode as he believed the show was back in peak, noted that the show [...] "was back to more uneven, but still funny, territory" [...] with this episode. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode [...] "worked just fine", and enjoyed Liz's disastrous appearance on Right On. He, however, did not like Jenna and Kenneth's pageant story. A contributor from The Huffington Post said the episode had a [...] "ton of hilarious moments", and that Queen Latifah [...] "was {{the highlight of the}} show". Vanity Fairs Juli Weiner enjoyed Maulik Pancholy's appearance as Jack's assistant Jonathan, writing that Jonathan is [...] "perhaps the most underutilized character on the show, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> to see him get some screen time this episode." [...] Further in her recap, Weiner said [...] "Thank you, Jenna and Jack, for mercifully putting an end to the tension-less Kenneth's-rehiring narrative." [...] Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times deemed it a [...] "wildly clever and satiric episode" [...] that also [...] "delivered an important critique about the limitations of diversity programs." [...] Blake said that Jane Krakowski's Jenna was on fire in [...] "Let's Stay Together". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun commented that the show has always dealt with racism issues [...] "pretty well" [...] and that the issue featured here [...] "was no exception." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad reported that [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] was one of his favorite episodes of the season, and that it was a [...] "massively pleasing episode." [...] Caitlan Smith of The Atlantic wrote that Latifah [...] "stole the show" [...] and [...] "drove the action" [...] as her character Regina Bookman in this episode of 30 Rock.|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to set the}} game four thousand years before [...] {{was one of the}} first details about the game made known. LucasArts gave BioWare a choice of settings for the game. [...] "LucasArts came to us and said that we could do an [...] game," [...] BioWare CEO Raymond Muzyka said. [...] "Or LucasArts said we could go 4,000 years back, which is a period that's hardly been covered before." [...] BioWare chose to set the game four thousand years before the films as it gave them greater creative freedom. They aimed to create content similar to that from the films but different enough to be a definite precursor. Concept work had to be sent to [...] "the ranch" [...] to be approved for use. Muzyka noted that very little of their content was rejected: [...] "It was more like, 'Can you just make his head like this rather than like that.' So it was all very feasible. There were good suggestions made and they made the game better, so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>happy</b> to do them. It was a good process really and I think we were pleasantly surprised how easy LucasArts was to work with." [...] Zeschuk said that [...] "Overall, we were really happy with the results.
