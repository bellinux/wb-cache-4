5|$|Integrity: being {{whole and}} complete, and honoring one’s word. In the est context {{the word is}} used to depict a matter of <b>workability,</b> rather than with the moral overtones it has in {{everyday}} usage.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{was among}} the first known and most widely studied work and environmental hazards. One of the first metals to be smelted and used, lead is thought to have been discovered and first mined in Anatolia around 6500 BCE. Its density, <b>workability,</b> and corrosion resistance were among the metal's attractions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>workability</b> and {{corrosion}} resistance {{of iron and}} chromium are increased by adding gadolinium; the creep resistance of nickel is improved {{with the addition of}} thorium. Tellurium is added to copper and steel alloys to improve their machinability; and to lead to make it harder and more acid-resistant.|$|E
5|$|Silver-containing brazing alloys {{are used}} for brazing {{metallic}} materials, mostly cobalt, nickel, and copper-based alloys, tool steels, and precious metals. The basic components are silver and copper, with other elements selected according to the specific application desired: examples include zinc, tin, cadmium, palladium, manganese, and phosphorus. Silver provides increased <b>workability</b> and corrosion resistance during usage.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} yttrium (0.1 to 0.2%) {{have been used}} to reduce the grain sizes of chromium, molybdenum, titanium, and zirconium. Yttrium is used to {{increase}} the strength of aluminium and magnesium alloys. The addition of yttrium to alloys generally improves <b>workability,</b> adds resistance to high-temperature recrystallization, and significantly enhances resistance to high-temperature oxidation (see graphite nodule discussion below).|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 2013, ‘Exercise Greyhound 2013’ {{was carried}} out by the Land Transport Authority with SBS Transit to {{validate}} the procedures of SBST’s Operations Control Centre (OCC) and the <b>workability</b> of its contingency plans for bus bridging, free bus service and deployment of Goodwill Ambassadors (GAs) during a simulated prolonged train service disruption. About 300 personnel including representatives from LTA, SBST, SMRT, the Singapore Police Force’s Transport Command (TransCom), Traffic Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) participated in the exercise. Train service continued as per normal and commuters were not affected by the exercise.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium in the δ (delta) form {{normally}} {{exists in}} the 310°C to 452°C range but is stable at room temperature when alloyed with {{a small percentage of}} gallium, aluminium, or cerium, enhancing <b>workability</b> and allowing it to be welded. The δ form has more typical metallic character, and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium. In fission weapons, the explosive shock waves used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual δ phase plutonium to the denser α form, significantly helping to achieve supercriticality. The ε phase, the highest temperature solid allotrope, exhibits anomalously high atomic self-diffusion compared to other elements.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{manganese}} improve the <b>workability</b> of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing {{the formation of}} a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to 863MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel. It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|Seamans' {{establishment}} of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961, to recommend a launch vehicle {{to be used in}} the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision. This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR—as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work—played an important role in publicizing the <b>workability</b> of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR. The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), which had much to lose from the decision, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing on June 7, 1962.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium is a hard, silvery, ductile, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide uranium, to the left of the actinide plutonium and below the lanthanide promethium. Neptunium is a hard metal, having a bulk modulus of 118GPa, comparable to that of manganese. Neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical <b>workability.</b> When exposed to air at normal temperatures, it forms a thin oxide layer. This reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases. Neptunium has been determined to melt at 639±3°C: this low melting point, a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium (which has melting point 639.4°C), is due to the hybridization of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal. The boiling point of neptunium is not empirically known and the usually given value of 4174°C is extrapolated from the vapor pressure of the element. If accurate, this would give neptunium the largest liquid range of any element (3535K passes between its melting and boiling points).|$|E
25|$|Only a true slump is of any {{use in the}} test. A {{collapse}} slump {{will generally}} mean that the mix is too wet or {{that it is a}} high <b>workability</b> mix, for which the slump test is not appropriate. Very dry mixes having slump 0 – 25mm are typically used in road making, low <b>workability</b> mixes having slump 10 – 40mm are typically used for foundations with light reinforcement, medium <b>workability</b> mixes with slump 50 – 90mm, are typically used for normal reinforced concrete placed with vibration, high <b>workability</b> concrete with slump > 100mm is typically used where reinforcing has tight spacing, and/or the concrete has to flow a great distance.|$|E
25|$|Zinc-tin {{coatings}} are {{an alternative}} to lead coatings since they have approximately the same appearance and <b>workability.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of tin—more expensive than lead—improves wetting {{properties of the}} alloy; lead itself has poor wetting characteristics. High-tin tin-lead alloys have limited use as the <b>workability</b> range can be provided by a cheaper high-lead alloy.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is used in}} some cement mix plasticisers. This helps homogenise cement mixes, preventing {{segregation of}} sands and cement, decreases {{the amount of water}} required in a mix and increases <b>workability</b> of the cement product, be it mortar, render or concrete.|$|E
25|$|When {{added to}} Portland cement as a {{pozzolan}} they can reduce chloride permeability and improve <b>workability.</b> They reduce weight and help moderate water content while allowing for slower drying which improves break strength. When added to lime mortars and lime-metakaolin mortars, synthetic zeolite pellets can act simultaneously as pozzolanic material and water reservoir.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{cellulose}} nitrate, B-72 {{does not}} need additives like plasticizers to stabilize its durability. Fumed colloidal silica is a chemical that {{can be added to}} help with the <b>workability</b> of the resin. Additionally research shows that the silica will better distribute stress and strain that occurs during evaporation of the solvent and during the setting of the adhesive film.|$|E
25|$|Copper is an {{excellent}} material for flashing because of its malleability, strength, solderability, <b>workability,</b> high resistance to the caustic effects of mortars and hostile environments, and long service life. This enables a roof to be built without weak points. Since flashing is expensive to replace if it fails, copper’s long life is a major cost advantage.|$|E
25|$|The {{slump test}} is {{suitable}} for slumps of medium to high workabiity, slump {{in the range of}} 5 – 260mm, the test fails to determine the difference in <b>workability</b> in stiff mixes which have zero slump, or for wet mixes that give a collapse slump. It is limited to concrete formed of aggregates of less than 38mm (1.5inch).|$|E
25|$|Steric forces between polymer-covered {{surfaces}} or in solutions containing non-adsorbing polymer can modulate interparticle forces, {{producing an}} additional steric repulsive force (which is predominantly entropic in origin) or an attractive depletion force between them. Such an effect is specifically searched for with tailor-made superplasticizers developed {{to increase the}} <b>workability</b> of concrete and to reduce its water content.|$|E
25|$|Silica fume: A {{byproduct}} of the production of silicon and ferrosilicon alloys. Silica fume is similar to fly ash, but has a particle size 100 times smaller. This results in a higher surface-to-volume ratio and a much faster pozzolanic reaction. Silica fume is used to increase strength and durability of concrete, but generally {{requires the use of}} superplasticizers for <b>workability.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first signs}} of {{established}} jewellery making in Ancient Egypt was around 3,000–5,000 years ago. The Egyptians preferred the luxury, rarity, and <b>workability</b> of gold over other metals. In Predynastic Egypt jewellery soon began to symbolise political and religious power in the community. Although it was worn by wealthy Egyptians in life, it was also worn by them in death, with jewellery commonly placed among grave goods.|$|E
25|$|The {{concrete}} slump test measures {{the consistency of}} fresh concrete before it sets. It is performed to check the <b>workability</b> of freshly made concrete, and therefore {{the ease with which}} concrete flows. It can also be used as an indicator of an improperly mixed batch. The test is popular due to the simplicity of apparatus used and simple procedure. The slump test is used to ensure uniformity for different loads of concrete under field conditions.|$|E
25|$|Melamine also {{enters the}} {{fabrication}} of melamine poly-sulfonate used as superplasticizer for making high-resistance concrete. Sulfonated melamine formaldehyde (SMF) is a polymer used as cement admixture {{to reduce the}} water content in concrete while increasing the fluidity and the <b>workability</b> of the mix during its handling and pouring. It results in concrete with a lower porosity and a higher mechanical strength, exhibiting an improved resistance to aggressive environments and a longer lifetime.|$|E
25|$|When {{initially}} mixed, Portland {{cement and}} water rapidly form a gel of tangled chains of interlocking crystals, and {{components of the}} gel continue to react over time. Initially the gel is fluid, which improves <b>workability</b> and aids in placement of the material, but as the concrete sets, the chains of crystals join into a rigid structure, counteracting the fluidity of the gel and fixing the particles of aggregate in place. During curing, the cement continues to react with the residual water {{in a process of}} hydration. In properly formulated concrete, once this curing process has terminated the product has the desired physical and chemical properties. Among the qualities typically desired, are mechanical strength, low moisture permeability, and chemical and volumetric stability.|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{surfaces}} (specifically, Portland cement concrete) {{are created}} using a concrete mix of Portland cement, coarse aggregate, sand and water. In virtually all modern mixes {{there will also}} be various admixtures added to increase <b>workability,</b> reduce the required amount of water, mitigate harmful chemical reactions and for other beneficial purposes. In many cases {{there will also be}} Portland cement substitutes added, such as fly ash. This can reduce the cost of the concrete and improve its physical properties. The material is applied in a freshly mixed slurry, and worked mechanically to compact the interior and force some of the cement slurry to the surface to produce a smoother, denser surface free from honeycombing. The water allows the mix to combine molecularly in a chemical reaction called hydration.|$|E
25|$|Most {{workbenches}} {{are made}} from solid wood; the most expensive and desirable are made of solid hardwood. Benches may also be made from plywood and Masonite or hardboard, and bases of treated pine and even steel. There are trade offs with the choice of construction material. Solid wood has many advantages including strength, <b>workability,</b> appearance. A plywood or hardboard bench top {{has the advantage of}} being stable, relatively inexpensive, and in some ways it's easier to work with - particularly for a woodworker who doesn't yet have hand tools. The practical drawbacks of a plywood or composite bench top are that they don't hold their corners and edges well, and they can't be resurfaced with a plane - something that is needed from time to time.|$|E
25|$|The clays {{used are}} often {{described}} as being long or short, depending on their plasticity. Long clays are cohesive (sticky) and have high plasticity; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity. In soil mechanics, plasticity is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering on the plastic, to a plastic state bordering on the liquid, though the term is also used less formally to describe {{the ease with which}} a clay may be worked. Clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays. They wet very quickly, meaning that small changes in the content of water can produce large changes in <b>workability.</b> Thus, the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled.|$|E
25|$|The Kurdish Academy of Language (KAL) realises {{that there}} are too many {{shortcomings}} with current Kurdish writing systems. These include <b>workability,</b> cross dialectal usage, and a lack of International IT-based Standards and representation for Kurdish. To avoid the communication obstacles presented by the existence of various Kurdish writing systems, KAL has introduced a standard Kurdish Unified Alphabet (Yekgirtú) based on International ISO-8859-1 Standards. This modern Kurdish (IS) alphabet contained some minor changes in the existing Latin based alphabet and adopting new signs. The new signs were introduced to improve the flexibility of the writing system in Kurdish. This effort was undertaken as part of KAL's broad endeavour to revive and promote the use of the Kurdish language for the benefit of young Kurds. The system devised and presented here by KAL is simple and adequate for the purpose of communicating via the Internet and any electronic media.|$|E
500|$|A draught-type horse {{must pass}} two {{tests in the}} {{studbook}} evaluation: a walking test and either a pulling or a general drivability test. The points given for the horse's performance in these tests are added to those given for its temperament and gaits, resulting in the final <b>workability</b> score. The horse is also given a score for its conformation. In addition to achieving the minimum scores for both <b>workability</b> and conformation, stallions accepted for the working-horse section of the stud book are required to trot [...] in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds.|$|E
500|$|On [...] April 18–20, 1946, Teller {{participated in}} a conference at Los Alamos to review the wartime work on the Super. The {{properties}} of thermonuclear fuels such as deuterium and the possible design of a hydrogen bomb were discussed. It was concluded that Teller's assessment of a hydrogen bomb had been too favourable, and that both the quantity of deuterium needed, {{as well as the}} radiation losses during deuterium burning, would shed doubt on its <b>workability.</b> Addition of expensive tritium to the thermonuclear mixture would likely lower its ignition temperature, but even so, nobody knew at that time how much tritium would be needed, and whether even tritium addition would encourage heat propagation.|$|E
500|$|The two Wyomings, {{along with}} the Floridas and New Yorks were heavily modernized in the 1920s. All six ships were {{converted}} to completely oil-fired boilers with equipment taken from the cancelled South Dakota-class battleships. The boilers were trunked into a single funnel. These boilers were much more efficient than the coal-fired models the ships had been completed with, and they allowed a significantly greater cruising radius of [...] The ships were also fitted with anti-torpedo bulges, which improved their underwater defense and also provided additional oil storage capacity. Wyoming and Arkansas lost their cage main mast, which {{was replaced by a}} short tripod mast that carried searchlights and radio antennas. Some of their secondary battery guns were relocated higher in the ship to improve their <b>workability</b> in heavy seas. A sponson for six guns was built into the hull abreast of the conning tower and the eight 3-inch anti-aircraft guns were moved {{to the top of the}} sponson. Both ships had their torpedo tubes removed.|$|E
500|$|The {{first use}} of cerium was in gas mantles, invented by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. In 1885, he had {{previously}} experimented with mixtures of magnesium, lanthanum, and yttrium oxides, but these gave green-tinted light and were unsuccessful. Six years later, he discovered that pure thorium oxide produced a much better, though blue, light, and that mixing it with cerium dioxide resulted in a bright white light. Additionally, cerium dioxide also acts {{as a catalyst for}} the combustion of thorium oxide. This resulted in great commercial success for von Welsbach and his invention, and created great demand for thorium; its production resulted in a large amount of lanthanides being simultaneously extracted as by-products. Applications were soon found for them, especially in the pyrophoric alloy known as [...] "mischmetall" [...] composed of 50% cerium, 25% lanthanum, and the remainder being the other lanthanides, that is used widely for lighter flints. Usually, iron is also added to form an alloy known as ferrocerium, also invented by von Welsbach. Due to the chemical similarities of the lanthanides, chemical separation is not usually required for their applications, such as the mixing of mischmetall into steel to improve its strength and <b>workability,</b> or as catalysts for the cracking of petroleum. This property of cerium saved the life of writer Primo Levi at the Auschwitz concentration camp, when he found a supply of ferrocerium alloy and bartered it for food.|$|E
2500|$|Plasticizers {{increase}} the <b>workability</b> of plastic or [...] "fresh" [...] concrete, allowing it be placed more easily, with less consolidating effort. A typical plasticizer is lignosulfonate. Plasticizers {{can be used}} to reduce the water content of a concrete while maintaining <b>workability</b> and are sometimes called water-reducers due to this use. Such treatment improves its strength and durability characteristics. Superplasticizers (also called high-range water-reducers) are a class of plasticizers that have fewer deleterious effects and {{can be used to}} increase <b>workability</b> more than is practical with traditional plasticizers. Compounds used as superplasticizers include sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensate, sulfonated melamine formaldehyde condensate, acetone formaldehyde condensate and polycarboxylate ethers.|$|E
2500|$|Lead had {{previously}} been frequently added to PVC to improve <b>workability</b> and stability. [...] Lead {{has been shown to}} leach into drinking water from PVC pipes.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Workability</b> can be {{measured}} by the concrete slump test, a simple measure of the plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the ASTM C 143 or EN 12350-2 test standards. Slump is normally measured by filling an [...] "Abrams cone" [...] with a sample from a fresh batch of concrete. The cone is placed with the wide end down onto a level, non-absorptive surface. It is then filled in three layers of equal volume, with each layer being tamped with a steel rod to consolidate the layer. When the cone is carefully lifted off, the enclosed material slumps a certain amount, owing to gravity. A relatively dry sample slumps very little, having a slump value {{of one or two}} inches (25 or 50mm) out of one foot (305mm). A relatively wet concrete sample may slump as much as eight inches. <b>Workability</b> can also {{be measured}} by the flow table test.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Workability</b> is {{the ability}} of a fresh (plastic) {{concrete}} mix to fill the form/mold properly with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. <b>Workability</b> depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of hydration) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete <b>workability.</b> Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or segregation of aggregates (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too large for the size of the formwork, or which has too few smaller aggregate grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades, or using too little or too much sand for the same reason, or using too little water, or too much cement, or even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate such as pebbles. [...] Any combination of these factors and others may result in a mix which is too harsh, i.e., which does not flow or spread out smoothly, is difficult to get into the formwork, and which is difficult to surface finish.|$|E
