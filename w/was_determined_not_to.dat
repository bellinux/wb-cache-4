5|$|The only damage {{she took}} that year {{occurred}} 30 April 1943, {{while she was}} changing stations on formation, Milwaukee struck Omahas starboard bow. The collision destroyed one of her paravanes and rupturing some plating, which caused some flooding. Omahas damage control party shored up one hole with two mattresses {{and were able to}} stop the leak. One compartment was completely flooded with another compartment requiring pumping out every two hours. On Milwaukee, the 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes on her port side were unserviceable. Several holes had opened up along her port side that were above the main deck, along with some leaks under the waterline from damage to plates and rivets. Milwaukee also lost her No.3 main circulation pump. The damage <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be serious enough to halt their mission and the two cruisers, after completing their patrol, put into Rio de Janeiro for the needed repairs at the Brazilian Navy Yard.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was considered for a location of the film The Graduate. After he consulted with other senior administrative colleagues who advised him to turn it down {{due to the lack}} of artistic merit, the college campus scenes set at Berkeley were shot at USC in Los Angeles. The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a very funny spoof of college life. Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's.|$|E

On 28 May 1930, Ward succumbed to strong pressure from his colleagues and his family, and passed the premiership to Forbes.|$|E

However, in 2008 operating as a corporation <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be commercial viable and the Tuvalu Media Corporation then became the Tuvalu Media Department (TMD) under the Office of the Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|Several {{teams had}} entered the {{competition}} and when Alcock and Brown arrived in St. John's, Newfoundland, the Handley Page team were {{in the final stages}} of testing their aircraft for the flight, but their leader, Admiral Mark Kerr, <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> take off until the plane was in perfect condition. The Vickers team quickly assembled their plane and at around 1:45p.m. on 14 June, whilst the Handley Page team were conducting yet another test, the Vickers plane took off from Lester's Field. Alcock and Brown flew the modified Vickers Vimy, powered by two Rolls-Royce Eagle 360hp engines which were supported by an on-site Rolls Royce team lead by engineer Eric Platford.|$|E
25|$|While the {{leadership}} <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> set a rate, there were moderate Labour councillors {{who were willing}} to defy the whip to vote for a legal budget. Supporters sought to prevent them from being put in such a position. On 16 April, council leader Tony Ritchie prevented a meeting called to set a legal rate from continuing by using powers under the council's standing orders to adjourn pending new advice; the meeting lasted only two minutes. A further meeting on 24 April was also swiftly adjourned, although on this occasion it was because Ritchie collapsed and had to be taken to hospital. When the council finally met on 26 April, the chamber was invaded by members of tenants groups and council staff with the result that the meeting broke up and was cancelled by the Mayor.|$|E

25|$|By then, new {{rounds of}} Federal money were available, and then-SCRTD CEO Allen Pegg {{announced}} that the transit agency was highly confident that sufficient funding for an all subway line, now proposed to travel under Hollywood Blvd to avoid conflicts with the studios on Sunset, could be secured. The line would then turn north along Highland Avenue to Universal City and North Hollywood (a Hollywood Bowl stop <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have enough year-round ridership to meet FTA formulas for Federal funding, {{just one of the}} reasons for not building a station there). The FTA approved the all subway route and funding (although broken into 2 phases rather than the original 1 phase in order to spread the cost over time making it more likely to be approved by Congress as part of the Federal Budget) for the line as it exists today.|$|E
25|$|After {{this major}} defeat, Charles of Lorraine {{was removed from}} his command and {{replaced}} by Daun, who was now promoted to Field Marshal. Frederick hoped the major victories at Rossbach and Leuthen would bring Maria Theresa to the peace table, but she <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> negotiate until she had retaken Silesia. With the Saxon–Silesian front stabilized, Frederick ordered {{the bulk of his}} East Prussian forces under Marshal Lehwaldt to reinforce Pomerania, predicting that no new Russian advance would come until the spring. The enlarged Prussian army quickly drove the Swedes back, occupied most of Swedish Pomerania, and blockaded its capital at Stralsund through the winter. Over the winter, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, now commander of Hanover's army, launched a series of offensives that drove the French out of northern Germany and across the Rhine, securing Prussia's western flank {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|The young Clarence {{attended}} Allegheny College and the University of Michigan Law School, {{but did not}} {{graduate from}} either institution. He attended Allegheny College for only one year before the Panic of 1873 struck, and Darrow <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be a financial burden to his father any longer. Over {{the next three years}} he taught in the winter at the district school in a country community. While teaching, Darrow started to study the law on his own, {{and by the end of}} his third year of teaching, his family urged him to enter the law department at Ann Arbor. Darrow only studied there a year when he decided that it would be much more cost-effective to work and study in an actual law office. When he felt that he was ready, he took the Ohio bar exam and passed. He was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1878. The Clarence Darrow Octagon House, his childhood home in Kinsman, contains a memorial to him.|$|E

25|$|A cataclysmic {{event for}} Chikun {{happened}} {{at the beginning of}} 1986. At around lunch time on January 6, 1986, Cho was leaving in his car when a motorcyclist came around from his blind spot. He had avoided Cho's car, only to have slid and overturned on his motorcycle. Cho was helping the motorcyclist to stand up, and then he went to pick the bike up when a car hit him. His right thigh was broken and he suffered other injuries. He was sent into the emergency room and had an operation the day after. The injuries would take three months to heal. Cho <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> let it affect him. Since his head and hand were fine, he went ahead and played {{the first game of the}} Kisei tournament. He played a good game, only to lose by 2.5 points. Cho recovered from the loss and took the next two games. Kobayashi then took 3 in a row and Cho was without a title for the first time in 8 years—something tremendous, considering he was only 29 years old. He went on to lose in a playoff for the Meijin, only to end the year with winning the Gosei title. This year ended better than last with a record of 35 wins and 17 losses.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} back-to-back stretches in Pitt football history occurred during the 1936 and 1937 seasons which featured Heisman Trophy candidate and Hall of Fame running back Marshall Goldberg. In 1936, Pitt shut out five of its opponents, including a 34–0 win over West Virginia, a 6–0 victory at Ohio State, and a 26–0 win over Notre Dame in which the Irish did not achieve a first down {{until late in the}} third quarter. The Panthers also won at Nebraska 19–6 and defeated Penn State 24–7. Only the second of three consecutive scoreless ties at the Polo Grounds against Fordham, and a mid-October 7–0 upset loss against crosstown rival Duquesne, marred the record. The Panthers finished the regular season winning the Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy as Eastern Champions and ranked third in the Associate Press Poll, the inaugural year of the poll, whose rankings were finalized before the bowl season. Pitt accepted a bid to the Rose Bowl to face Washington, and this time Sutherland <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> lose again out west. To avoid subpar play following the cross country train trip, Sutherland took his team out two weeks early to allow for adequate preparation. These moves paid off with a 21–0 rout of Washington which led many selectors to name Pitt as the 1936 national champions. However, it was during this time that the seeds of a rift between Sutherland and the university's administration were being sown, partly initiated by the refusal of the university to supply pocket money for players during the Rose Bowl trip, which Sutherland then decided to supply out of his own pocket.|$|E
