There, Reyes phones him {{to ask about the}} case, but Mulder cedes to the authority of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), who is formally running the X-Files. However, Reyes says she can't call Doggett since it is about him. Meanwhile, Jeb is in a hotel room in Georgia trying to shoot himself in the head. Suddenly, he notices something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> face; he claws at his face, peeling away the skin to reveal burning embers beneath the skin.|$|E
5|$|The {{defense of}} Machias {{consisted}} of local militia {{under the command}} of Colonel Jonathan Eddy, the leader of the 1776 attack on Fort Cumberland. He had been warned that the British were organizing an attack. The militia laid a log boom across the Machias River, and constructed several earthen redoubts further upriver, armed with cannons taken from local privateers. The defense was coincidentally reinforced by forty to fifty Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscots that Colonel Allan had called to Machias to explain what had gone <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> expedition.|$|E

To-day you ain't 'ardly considered respectable unless you've got it, or 'ave 'ad it. I 'ave no patience with their talk.

50|$|Le Courrier français {{provoked}} {{the public with}} daring prints.The owner Jules Roques was always interested in commercial success, while Louis Legrand tried {{to give it a}} rustic and humanitarian aspect.The hopes raised by the Exposition Universelle of 1900 were disappointed.The tone of the journal changed with the arrival of René Georges Hermann-Paul, who attacked priests, businessmen and some of the customs of the time. Violent and ironic, he was not only the perfect illustrator of Octave Mirbeau, but also a righter of <b>wrongs</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> violent and bitter graphics. His pessimistic spirit resulted in a black art that evoked cruel scenes with acerbic captions.|$|R
25|$|Wüsthoff's {{personality}} clashes {{were not}} the only thing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> leadership; he failed to lead by example, not scoring in battle. He finally shot down his 27th and final victim on 10 March 1918.|$|E
25|$|It is {{precisely}} because he fathered a healthy son with Elizabeth that Henry was convinced his wife's inability to bear him a son was Catherine's fault. She gave birth to at least three boys, yet only the first lived as long as seven weeks. These facts led Henry to believe there was something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> marriage to Catherine, and {{that he needed to}} annul his marriage.|$|E
25|$|When AIDS {{appeared}} in France's news around 1982, Nureyev took little notice. The dancer {{tested positive for}} HIV in 1984, but for several years he simply denied that anything was <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> health. However, by the late 1980s his diminished capabilities disappointed his admirers who had fond memories of his outstanding prowess and skill. Nureyev began a marked decline only {{in the summer of}} 1991 and entered the final phase of the disease in the spring of 1992.|$|E

500|$|Presley's {{condition}} declined precipitously in September. Keyboardist Tony Brown {{remembers the}} singer's arrival at a University of Maryland concert: [...] "He {{fell out of}} the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, Is the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the back and said, 'It'll be all right. Don't you worry about it.'" [...] Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.|$|E
500|$|Waugh was {{approached}} at the Oberoi by an Indian man, {{who was also}} staying at the hotel. The man called himself [...] "John" [...] and gave no surname. John {{said he was a}} man who had won money betting on cricket and asked Waugh to provide pitch and weather information; he also asked the Australian to reveal inside knowledge about the team, such as tactics and player selections, in exchange for US$4,000. Waugh accepted the money and agreed to provide information about the pitch and weather, but he refused to divulge the tactics that the Australians intended to use against their opposition, or information on which players would play and what their role would be. Information on pitch conditions provides an insight into the strategies that the team might adopt and which players might be used, and teams will field different players depending on the pitch, as their skills are suited to different conditions. The arrangement with John remained in place until the end of the 1994–95 Australian summer. Waugh later said that at the time, he did not see anything <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> actions, reasoning that the agreement was similar to a player speculating about their form and the playing conditions in a pre-match media interview.|$|E
500|$|Fender {{completed}} the double in 1922 with 1,169 runs and 157 wickets, Surrey {{finished third in}} the Championship, and once again the lack of effective bowling hindered the team. Wisden described the team's success as [...] "nothing less than a triumph for Mr Fender". Despite damp weather which did not suit his style, he bowled more than his share of overs, often because there were few alternative bowlers. Wisden said: [...] "Essentially a change bowler —the best in England, as he has been aptly described—he became by force of circumstances the chief attacking force". He bowled mainly leg spin, but often bowled successfully at medium pace. Wisden praised his inspirational captaincy, and concluded: [...] "Over and above all this he was, by general consent, by far the best of the county captains, never losing his grip of the game and managing his side with a judgement that was seldom at fault." [...] During the season, Fender began to wear glasses in an attempt to cure headaches; the remedy worked, although he later discovered there was nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> eyesight, and the lenses he wore were little more than plain glass. The first time he wore glasses, Fender scored 185 in 130 minutes against Hampshire. Other rapid scoring feats included 91 in 50 minutes against Leicestershire and 137 in 90 minutes against Kent. There were no Tests in 1922, but Sydney Pardon wrote that Fender was the only amateur who could be guaranteed a place on ability alone in an England team. Late in the season, Fender was involved in a public dispute with Lord Harris over the qualification of Alfred Jeacocke to play for Surrey. Harris, the influential treasurer of the MCC and chairman of Kent, had noticed that Jeacocke's qualification had lapsed when he moved across the border from Surrey to Kent, albeit living on the same road. Fender, privately furious with Harris, publicly defended Jeacocke, and the press supported him; the rules were altered the following season to allow Jeacocke to continue to play for Surrey.|$|E

50|$|Orlov's {{information}} {{proves to}} be highly valuable, leading {{to the arrest of}} Russian spies in many countries, and providing important information on USSR military planning. While the CIA is delighted to have such a valuable asset, Sam McCready has a gut feeling that something might be <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> Orlov; <b>his</b> suspicion is confirmed by the head of the KGB's London residency, who secretly works for McCready (Codename Keepsake). Keepsake claims that Orlov is not a defector, but a plant, tasked with denouncing a high-ranking CIA officer as a Soviet mole in an attempt to bring chaos and distrust to the entire agency.|$|R
2500|$|He {{began his}} radio {{career as a}} page at New York City station WMCA in 1932, after which he held a number of obscure radio jobs, {{including}} announcing. He strenuously objected to the professional name [...] "Morgan". What was <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> own name, Henry van Ost, Jr.? he asked. Too exotic, too unpronounceable, he was told. [...] "What about the successful announcers Harry von Zell or Westbrook Van Voorhis?" [...] he countered. But it was no use, and the bosses finally told Henry he could take the job or leave it. Thus began {{a long history of}} Henry's having arguments with executives.|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} The Tragedy of Othello, {{scholars have}} long debated Iago’s role—highlighting {{the complexity of}} his character. Fred West contends that Shakespeare was not content with simply portraying another “stock” morality figure, and that he, like many dramatists, was {{particularly interested in the}} workings of the human mind. Thus, according to West, Iago, who sees nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> own behaviour, is “an accurate portrait of a psychopath”, who is [...] "devoid of conscience, with no remorse". West believes that [...] "Shakespeare had observed that there exist perfectly sane people in whom fellow-feeling of any kind is extremely weak while egoism is virtually absolute, and thus he made Iago".|$|E
2500|$|Schoetensack - {{like many}} of his colleagues around the {{beginning}} of the 20th century - was <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> assessment of kinship proximity of the lower jaw of Mauer with the apes (hominids): [...] "The mandible of Homo heidelbergensis reveals the original state that defines mankind's and the ape's common ancestor." [...] In 1924, the hitherto oldest fossil of the big pool of hominid variants - the Taung Child was discovered in what is now South Africa. It is around two million years older than the lower jaw of Mauer and despite its advanced age, still does not represent the common base of humans and apes.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} couple of years, the trickster has gained much {{popularity}} by his frequent appearances in pop culture. Focusing on the trickster in contemporary film, there is a director whose work is not immediately linked to tricksterism, but whose work can definitely examined from that angle. David Fincher's films feature trickster characters, trickster games and trickster narratives; the director himself being the ultimate trickster by putting the viewer on the <b>wrong</b> track <b>with</b> <b>his</b> deceptive narratives, and by constantly aiming to break boundaries in film making...|$|R

50|$|Although Keselowski had rubbed some of {{his fellow}} drivers the <b>wrong</b> way <b>with</b> <b>his</b> driving style, the results he {{produced}} on the track seemed to indicate that a permanent move to the Sprint Cup Series was an inevitability. Despite <b>his</b> relationship <b>with</b> Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Hendrick Motorsports, the team {{did not have a}} car for him to drive full-time as each of their four regular teams had established drivers under contract. Keselowski began looking elsewhere and left the Chevrolet camp to drive a Dodge for Team Penske.|$|R
2500|$|Predicate logic was {{primarily}} {{introduced to the}} mathematical community by C. S. Peirce, who coined the term second-order logic and whose notation is most similar to the modern form (Putnam 1982). However, today most students of logic are {{more familiar with the}} works of Frege, who actually published his work several years prior to Peirce but whose works remained in obscurity until Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead made them famous. [...] Frege used different variables to distinguish quantification over objects from quantification over properties and sets; but he did not see himself as doing two different kinds of logic. [...] After the discovery of Russell's paradox it was realized that something was <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> system. [...] Eventually logicians found that restricting Frege's logic in various ways—to what is now called first-order logic—eliminated this problem: sets and properties cannot be quantified over in first-order-logic alone. [...] The now-standard hierarchy of orders of logics dates from this time.|$|E

50|$|David is {{collected}} from the public house by Lord Taverstone’s silent man servant, Gordon (Craig Carr) and taken to a lone statue {{for a meeting with}} the village leader, Lord Alistair Taverstone (Keith Flood). Lord Taverstone explains that the village operates independently from the State, with the Government preoccupied with centres of industry, the capital and the brewing conflict overseas, but expresses awareness of a foreign spy in the village and, using David’s place as a newcomer to the society, plans to root out the <b>wrong</b> doer <b>with</b> <b>his</b> help. <b>With</b> a firm reason now to stay in the village, David readily accepts.|$|R
60|$|Dan would fume, but I {{would remain}} firm. The soda cake would be laid aside, and {{something}} else attempted. His cookery {{was the one thing}} Dan was obstinate about. He would never admit that anything could possibly be <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> it. <b>His</b> most ghastly failures he would devour himself later on with pretended enjoyment. I have known him finish a sponge cake, the centre of which had to be eaten with a teaspoon, declaring it was delicious; that eating a dry sponge cake was like eating dust; that a sponge cake ought to be a trifle syrupy towards the centre. Afterwards he would be strangely silent and drink brandy out of a wine-glass.|$|R

60|$|When she was {{not much}} more than ten Isobel had her first trouble with her father. Something had gone <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> one of <b>his</b> {{shipping}} speculations, and as usual, he vented it upon his wife. So cruelly did he speak to her on a household matter for which {{she was not}} the least to blame, that the poor woman at last rose and left the room to hide her tears. Isobel, however, remained behind, and walking up to her father, who stood <b>with</b> <b>his</b> back to the fire, asked him why he treated her mother thus.|$|R

One day, while sauntering along a campus path, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hands in his pockets, he met two students coming toward him.
