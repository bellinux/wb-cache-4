2500|$|The report {{strongly}} criticized Brown {{for failing}} to check the original lab results. It also noted that {{one section of the}} 2004 CDC report said not one of the people living in a home with <b>water</b> <b>lead</b> levels 20 times higher than the action level had elevated blood lead, but it failed to mention that most of those people were drinking bottled or filtered water, not tap water, before their blood was tested—a fact Brown and her co-authors were well aware of. [...] The investigation found that Brown gave her fellow authors just three hours to review her work before it was submitted for publication.|$|E
2500|$|On January 21, 2005, the EPA ordered WASA {{to notify}} more than 400 homeowners {{that the agency}} had mistakenly told them their house's <b>water</b> <b>lead</b> levels were safe, and to replace an {{additional}} 500 service lines to comply with federal law. The EPA said that WASA had flushed the water line for five minutes before running the lead tests for those homes, resulting in artificially low readings; such a lengthy flush is not permitted by EPA standards. [...] The EPA {{did not believe that}} the flushes were done intentionally by WASA to reduce lead levels. [...] The testing had been done {{as part of an effort}} to avoid the expense of replacing lead lines in areas where it found low lead levels.|$|E

The report [...] "summarizes {{the results of the}} preliminary investigations, which indicated that the elevated <b>water</b> <b>lead</b> levels might have contributed to a small increase in blood lead levels (BLLs)". The report describes the background, and the various kinds of blood tests it employed, and explicitly states: [...] "All blood tests were used in this analysis." [...] There is no mention at all of any test results not being available, not even in the caveat section, where other potential sources of error are discussed.|$|E
2500|$|The nominal {{temperature}} of the cooling water at the inlet of the reactor is about [...] and the outlet temperature , at pressure in the drum separator of [...] The pressure and the inlet temperature determine the height at which the boiling begins in the reactor; if the coolant temperature is not sufficiently below its boiling point at the system pressure, the boiling starts {{at the very bottom}} part of the reactor instead of its higher parts. With few absorbers in the reactor core, such as during the Chernobyl accident, the positive void coefficient of the reactor makes the reactor very sensitive to the feedwater temperature. Bubbles of boiling <b>water</b> <b>lead</b> to increased power, which in turn increases the formation of bubbles. After 1986 absorbers were introduced in the fuel assembly, permanently assuring a negative void coefficient at the cost of higher enrichment requirements of the uranium fuel.|$|E

2500|$|Lev Grossman's New York Times best-seller The Magicians is a {{contemporary}} dark fantasy about an unusually gifted young man obsessed with Fillory, the magical land of his favourite childhood books.

Not only is the land home to many similar talking animals and mythical creatures, it is also accessed through a grandfather clock {{in the home of}} an uncle to whom five English children are sent during World War II. [...] Moreover, the land is ruled by two Aslan-like rams named Ember and Umber, and terrorised by The Watcherwoman. She, like the White Witch, freezes the land in time. The book's plot revolves heavily around a place very like the [...] "wood between the worlds" [...] from The Magician's Nephew, an interworld waystation in which pools of <b>water</b> <b>lead</b> to other lands. This reference to The Magician's Nephew is echoed in the title of the book.|$|E
60|$|The {{remaining}} part of Mr. Spencer's {{essay is}} devoted to {{a consideration of the}} hypothetical action of the environment on the lower organisms which consist of simple cells or formless masses of protoplasm; and he shows with great elaboration that the outer and inner parts of these are necessarily subject to different conditions; and that the outer actions of air or <b>water</b> <b>lead</b> to the formation of integuments, and sometimes to other definite modifications of the surface, whence arise permanent differences of structure. Although in these cases also {{it is very difficult to}} determine how much is due to direct modification by external agencies transmitted and accumulated by inheritance, and how much to spontaneous variations accumulated by natural selection, the probabilities in favour of the former mode of action are here greater, because there is no differentiation of nutritive and reproductive cells in these simple organisms; and it can be readily seen that any change produced in the latter will almost certainly affect the next generation.[201] We are thus carried back almost to the origin of life, and can only vaguely speculate on what took place under conditions of which we know so little.|$|E
