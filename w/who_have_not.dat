In contrast to the group of respondents <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> used risk management tools, however, the margin level for those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> used price risk management tools was positive and significant. All else constant, a higher margin offers more profit protection. Respondents <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> used risk management tools were more likely to purchase the offered insurance as operator education increased and as they were closer to insolvency. Further, California respondents <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> used risk management tools were more likely to purchase the offered insurance than were Wisconsin respondents (the omitted State category).|$|R

They argue that if something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> always existed. On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E
5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} civil partnership ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> entered into a civil partnership or marriage.
