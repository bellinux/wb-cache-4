Süß {{goes so far}} as to destroy half of a blacksmith's house to prove his power to punish those <b>who</b> <b>refuse</b> to pay their taxes. When the blacksmith attacks Süß's coach with a sledgehammer, Süß has the blacksmith hanged on the grounds that an attack on the Duke's minister is tantamount to an attack on the Duke himself.|$|E

40|$|All The World Is Now Richer Meets The Woman <b>Who</b> <b>Refused</b> To Dance Sokari Douglas Camp’s All The World Is Now Richer Meets The Woman <b>Who</b> <b>Refused</b> To Dance is a video work {{created as}} a {{memorial}} to commemorate the abolition of slavery. The work was commissioned by The Diaspora Pavilion in Venice combines the sculptural work of Camp and the opera by Shirley J Thompson The Woman <b>Who</b> <b>Refused</b> to Dance travelling on a boat on the canals in Venice with a dance performance by Tania Dimbelolo, choreography by Monique Jonas. The opera The Woman <b>Who</b> <b>Refused</b> To Dance, is about an unknown woman on the slave boat of Captain Kimber in 1792 <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> to dance and is beaten and hung for arbitration. Although the unknown woman dies, in Shirley J. Thompson's opera, her spirit rises. In this new filmed production, All The World Is Now Richer Meets The Woman <b>Who</b> <b>Refused</b> to Dance, her spirit rises and additionally reunites with her ancestors. The film brings the figures and their multiple references to history of slavery into echoing with the current migrant crisis. The film and sculptures are on display until 16 November 2017 {{as part of an}} exhibition at the Venice Biennial featuring the work of 19 artists...|$|R
5|$|Obama {{spoke in}} front of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. {{president}} to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progresses made in education, infrastructure, and economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders <b>who</b> <b>refuse</b> to step aside, discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly {{improve the quality of life}} for Africans. During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{realizes that}} he can make the girls winners only if he can help them {{overcome}} their differences. During his first few days as coach he benches several players <b>who</b> <b>refuse</b> to follow his rules—including Bindia Naik (Shilpa Shukla), his most experienced player. In response, Bindia repeatedly encourages the other players to defy Khan. When she finally succeeds, Khan angrily resigns; however, he invites the staff and team to a farewell lunch at McDonald's. During the lunch, local boys make a pass at Mary; Balbir attacks them, triggering a brawl between the boys and the team. Khan, recognizing that they are acting as one for the first time, prevents the staff from intervening; he only stops a man from hitting {{one of the women}} from behind with a cricket bat, telling him that there are no cowards in hockey. In an about-face, after the fight the women ask Khan to remain as their coach.|$|E

5000|$|Survival was a moral {{as well as}} a {{physical}} struggle. A woman doctor wrote to a friend in June 1933 that she had not yet become a cannibal, but was [...] "not sure that I shall not be one by the time my letter reaches you." [...] The good people died first. Those <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> to steal or to prostitute themselves died. Those who gave food to others died. Those <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> to eat corpses died. Those <b>who</b> <b>refused</b> to kill their fellow man died. Parents who resisted cannibalism died before their children did.|$|R

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of the infallibility of ecumenical councils states that solemn definitions of ecumenical councils, approved by the Pope, which concern faith or morals, and to which the whole Church must adhere, are infallible. Such decrees are often labeled as canons, and they often have an attached anathema, a penalty of excommunication, against those <b>who</b> <b>refuse</b> to believe the teaching. The doctrine does not claim that every aspect of every ecumenical council is infallible.|$|E

25|$|A tax protester {{is someone}} who refuses to pay a tax {{claiming}} that the tax laws are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. Tax protesters are different from tax resisters, <b>who</b> <b>refuse</b> to pay taxes as a protest against the government or its policies, not out of {{a belief that the}} tax law itself is invalid. The United States has a large and organized culture of people who espouse such theories. Tax protesters also exist in other countries.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{enactment}} of the 1937 constitution, the Treason Act 1939 provided for the imposition of the death penalty for treason.

No person has been charged under the Treason Act.
