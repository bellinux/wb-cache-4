Evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm. Complications <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced {{the helicopters}} to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, the helicopters arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees.|$|E

5|$|At the {{completion}} of the regular season, the top four teams progressed to the postseason. It was contested over three weeks, following the Page playoff system. Each stage was decided by a best–of–three game series. Unlike regular season games, which made use of a variation of the International Baseball Federation's mercy rule after seveninnings, no such rule was in place for postseason games; all games went the full nineinnings, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> exception being two games that were tied after nineinnings, therefore requiring extra innings.|$|E

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current England Test players be allowed to play. After the hosts had complied, Bradman selected a full-strength team, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> difference from the Fifth Test team being Ring’s omission for Johnson, so McCool was left out. After Australia had taken a 312-run first innings lead, the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E
