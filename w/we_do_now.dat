5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E

Around the same time Hawtrey directed Flora Robson in Dumb Dora Discovers Tobacco (1946). Both films are believed lost.|$|E
25|$|All Roman cities had {{at least}} one Thermae, a popular {{facility}} for public bathing, exercising and socializing. Exercise might include wrestling and weight-lifting, as well as swimming. Bathing was {{an important part of the}} Roman day, where some hours might be spent, at a very low cost subsidized by the government. Wealthier Romans were often accompanied by one or more slaves, who performed any required tasks such as fetching refreshment, guarding valuables, providing towels, and at the end of the session, applying olive oil to their masters' bodies which was then scraped off with a strigil, a scraper made of wood or bone. Romans did not wash with soap and water as <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E

500|$|... "Coming of Age" [...] {{examines}} Gethenian {{sexuality in}} greater detail than in Left Hand. In describing the story, Le Guin stated: It seemed high time we got {{all the way into}} a kemmerhouse. With a native guide, instead of a poor uptight Earth guy trying to figure out what's going on and being disturbed by it... Left Hand gives the reader very little opportunity to experience being double-gendered [...] I wanted to explore it as a natural, universal experience, instead of a weird alien condition. Back in 1968, I and most readers needed Genly Ai's POV to mediate the strangeness. I don't think <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>now.</b> She referred to the story as a sexual footnote to Left Hand.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{incorporated}} utopian {{themes in}} his previous works but reviewers were divided on whether The Years of Rice and Salt qualified as a utopian story. Those that did call the world described in the story as utopian cited the story's illustration of progress. However, those that wrote The Years of Rice and Salt was not a utopian story say that the world history presented is not necessarily better or worse than the real history, just different. Robinson calls himself a [...] "utopian novelist" [...] in that he claims [...] "all science fiction has a utopian element, in that it tends to say that what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> matters and will have consequences". Several other themes were identified by reviewers. Robinson had previously used the theme of memory (or identity) and incorporates it into this story with characters who are reincarnated versions of previous characters and who only recognize each other while in the bardo, but sometimes feel a connection between themselves while on earth. The reviewer in The Globe and Mail identified feminism and [...] "struggles over the nature of Islam" [...] as recurring themes.|$|E

50|$|Three issues {{must first}} {{be present in the}} affirmative case and are the {{building}} blocks of logically choosing to take any action (in policy debate or in everyday life).

What are the results of what <b>we</b> are <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> versus what <b>we</b> could be <b>doing</b> (significance stock issue)? The last stock issue, topicality, is procedural and unique to debate as it concerns how germane the plan (specifically, plan text) is to the resolution (which isn't usually a restriction in contemporary, outside policy issues).|$|R

500|$|Perry is a LGBT rights activist. She {{supported}} Stonewall {{during their}} [...] "It gets better..... today" [...] campaign to prevent homophobic bullying, and dedicated the music video to her song [...] "Firework" [...] to the It Gets Better Project. Perry told Do Something in November 2008 {{she was proud}} to be a gay activist, saying [...] "I've always been a very open-minded person, but I definitely believe in equality." [...] She confirmed that she voted against Proposition 8, an amendment (ultimately ruled unconstitutional) that legally defined marriage as a union solely {{between a man and a}} woman in California. In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting [...] "hopefully, we will look back at this moment and think like <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> concerning [...] civil rights issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future." [...] In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth. On March 18, 2017, she received a Nation Equality Award from Human Rights Campaign for [...] "using her powerful voice and international platform to speak out for LGBTQ equality", with the organization further stating that [...] "Katy's message of inclusion and equality continues to inspire us and the world".|$|E

2500|$|While {{accepting}} {{the award for}} Best Director at the 80th Academy Awards, Joel Coen said that [...] "Ethan and I have been making stories with movie cameras since we were kids", recalling a Super 8 film they made titled [...] "Henry Kissinger: Man on the Go". [...] "Honestly," [...] he said, [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> doesn't feel that much {{different from what we}} were doing then. We're very thankful to all of you out there for continuing to let us play in our corner of the sandbox."

2500|$|According to Christopher Hitchens, Moore {{had argued}} in a {{previous}} public debate that Osama bin Laden was to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and thus questions the treatment of bin Laden in the film. [...] "Something – I cannot guess what, since we knew as much then as <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> – has since apparently persuaded Moore that Osama Bin Laden is as guilty as hell. Indeed, Osama is suddenly so guilty and so all-powerful that any other discussion of any other topic is a dangerous 'distraction' from the fight against him. I believe that I understand the convenience of this late conversion." [...] Hitchens was subsequently invited to appear on Joe Scarborough's MSNBC talk show, Scarborough Country, at which point a tape recording of his debate with Moore at the Telluride Film Festival in 2002 was replayed.|$|E

2500|$|With Monroe and Lester Flatt, Scruggs {{performed}} on the Grand Ole Opry and in September 1946 recorded the classic hit [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky"; a song that was designated by the Library of Congress {{to be added to}} the National Recording Registry, and later added to the Grammy Hall of Fame. The work schedule was heavy in Monroe's band. They were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south, riding in a 1941 Chevrolet from town to town, doing up to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night. Lester Flatt said, [...] "It wasn't anything to ride two or three days in a car. We didn't have buses like <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>now,</b> and we never had our shoes off". The self-imposed rule was to always get back in time to play the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville each Saturday night. Scruggs said of Monroe that [...] "Bill would never let the music go down no matter how tired we were. If a man would slack off, he would move over and get that mandolin up close on him and get him back up there". Despite the group's success, Scruggs decided the demands were too great. He was single at the time, and the brief few hours on Saturdays that he made it home, it was just to pack his suitcase at the Tulane Hotel where he lived alone, then repeat the cycle—he had done this for two years. He turned in his resignation, planning to go take care of his mother in North Carolina. [...] Flatt had also made up his mind to leave but he had not told anyone. He later gave his two-week notice but, before the notice was up, the bass player Howard Watts announced that he was leaving too. [...] Despite Monroe's pleading, they left the band. Monroe thought Flatt and Scruggs had a secret understanding, but both men denied it. Monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter, a feud well known in country music circles.|$|E
