25|$|At a sysop {{meeting in}} Dallas, {{the idea was}} raised that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> there was some way for the sysops to post {{messages}} that would be shared among the systems. In February 1986 Jeff Rush, {{one of the group}} members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the sysop selected, {{in a manner similar to}} the way the original mailer handled private messages. The new program was known as a tosser/scanner. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system.|$|E
500|$|In March 1993, {{military}} incursions by Azeri {{forces and}} artillery barrages {{were reported to}} have been coming from the region, prompting military leaders to announce an offensive against the rayon. [...] However, a different reason was given by the Armenians' most successful commander of the conflict, Monte Melkonian. [...] According to Melkonian, the commander of the southern front in Martuni (Khojavend), the decision to take the town was a matter of certainty rather than choice. He stated, [...] "This is a historical issue... of course this is historical Armenia... And we'll vindicate that reality [...] with our guns. Unfortunately! It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> the Azeris would understand that reality is reality, agree and say OK, it's yours, and that's that." [...] Questioned on the possibility of a large expulsion of civilians if the region was captured, Melkonian responded, [...] "A lot of blood has been spilled on both sides... The emotions are high and that isn't conducive to living together in near or medium future." ...|$|E
500|$|After Thomas G. W. Settle's record {{flight in}} the Piccards Century of Progress, the balloon was again {{returned}} to the Piccards, who decided to fly it to the stratosphere on their own. Jean would concentrate on the science, while Jeannette would pilot the balloon. DeVorkin wrote that, [...] "Energetic and forceful, {{she seemed to have}} a better chance of obtaining a pilot's license than Jean, who was preoccupied with restoring the gondola and balloon and convincing scientists to provide instruments to fly". She studied at Ford Airport in Dearborn, Michigan under Edward J. Hill, a balloonist and Gordon Bennett Cup winner, who agreed to serve as flight director for the Piccards' planned stratospheric flight. Henry Ford offered the use of his hangar and brought Orville Wright (with his brother Wilbur, inventor of the airplane and first human to fly a heavier-than-air powered aircraft) to observe a flight of Jeannette's in 1933. Her son Don was a crew member that day and shook hands with Wright, [...] "I was a little kid and he [...] attention to me." [...] On June 16, 1934, Jeannette flew her first solo flight. Later that year, the National Aeronautic Association made her the first woman licensed balloon pilot in the U.S. Auguste wrote to Jean in June 1934, [...] "Hopefully you will make your flight ahead of other competitors. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice,</b> <b>if</b> the name of Piccard through Jeannette, would once more be placed on the record list of the F.A.I." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 2, Cantor {{responded that}} his {{question}} does have interest: [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> {{it could be}} answered; for example, provided {{that it could be}} answered no, one would have a new proof of Liouville's theorem that there are transcendental numbers." ...|$|E
2500|$|A June 27, 1950, {{movie of}} a [...] "flying disk" [...] over Louisville, Kentucky, {{taken by a}} Louisville Courier-Journal photographer, had the USAF Directors of counter{{intelligence}} (AFOSI) and intelligence discussing in memos how to best obtain the movie and interview the photographer without revealing Air Force interest. One memo suggested the FBI be used, then precluded the FBI getting involved. Another memo said [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> OSI could arrange to secure {{a copy of the}} film in some covert manner," [...] but if that wasn't feasible, one of the Air Force scientists might have to negotiate directly with the newspaper. In a recent interview, the photographer confirmed meeting with military intelligence and still having the film in his possession until then, but refused to say what happened to the film after that.|$|E

6000|$|The pastor's wife decided, [...] "Why, you've {{caught my}} very thoughts, Mrs. Kennicott. Of course I have never READ Swinburne, but years ago, {{when he was}} in vogue, I {{remember}} Mr. Warren saying that Swinburne (or was it Oscar Wilde? but anyway:) he said that though many so-called intellectual people posed and pretended to find beauty in Swinburne, there can never be genuine beauty without the message from the heart. But at the same time I do think you have an excellent idea, and though we have talked about Furnishings and China as the probable subject for next year, I believe that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> the program committee would try to work in another day entirely devoted to English poetry!

Shaving, with all respect to you, is a trivial and materialistic thing, and in such things startling inventions are {{sometimes}} made. But what you say reminds me in some dark and dreamy fashion of something else. I recall it especially when you tell me, with such evident experience and sincerity, that the new shaving is not really new. My friend, the human race is always trying this dodge of making everything entirely easy; but the difficulty which it shifts off one thing it shifts on to another. If one man has not the toil of preparing a man's chin, I suppose that some other man has the toil of preparing something very curious to put on a man's chin. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> we could be shaved without troubling anybody. It would be nicer still if we could go unshaved without annoying anybody-- ...|$|E

My work is rather difficult and I am afraid I am a little stupid. It is hard to be interested in anything just because that is how you have to live, is it not? I daresay you sometimes feel the same of school. But I suppose everybody is doing things they don't like.

50|$|Knowing {{that they}} cannot control Captain Underpants, George and Harold destroy the Hypno Ring {{in an attempt}} to {{permanently}} change him back into Krupp. Feeling that Krupp <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>nicer</b> <b>if</b> he had friends, the boys set him and lovesick Edith up on a date, thus making Krupp have a change of heart; he returns the comics he took away from George and Harold, and even admits their comics are funny. However, the toxic waste from the Turbo Toilet 2000 transforms all the toilets into vicious monsters that attack the restaurant at which Mr. Krupp and Edith are dining. Upon snapping his fingers (accidentally), Mr. Krupp once again becomes Captain Underpants and flies away, carrying George and Harold away to help him fight them, much to Edith's surprise and admiration. As this happens, George says he thought destroying the Hypno-Ring would get rid of his powers and Harold exclaims his catchphrase said {{at the end of every}} Captain Underpants book, save the last, 'here we go again!'.|$|R
