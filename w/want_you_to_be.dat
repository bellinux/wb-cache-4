25|$|Midas Touch elaborates on points made by Trump and Kiyosaki {{in their}} prior work Why We <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Rich. The coauthors assert their ideas {{will lead to}} an uptick in the American economy. Trump and Kiyosaki lament the lack of {{financial}} literacy espoused in the U.S. education structure. They argue students should be taught how to become business owners instead of learning how to go work for another company. Trump and Kiyosaki write that such students are instructed to achieve academic excellence through avoiding risk. They say those who do engage in risk will learn from their mistakes and be stronger for it.|$|E
25|$|Why We <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Rich {{notes in}} the {{introduction}} it is not intended as a technical manual with specific recommendations. The book warns the reader that the American middle class strata is shrinking due to multiple factors including oncoming retirement of the baby boomers, rising costs of light crude oil, decreasing employer pay to employees, increasing national debt of the United States, and a declining power of the United States dollar. The authors caution that individuals should not rely on the federal bureaucracy for support from problems including the middle-class squeeze, economic globalization, and threats of terrorism. They assert that employment opportunities are not formed from the government but rather through entrepreneurship.|$|E

The coauthors became familiar with each other through encounters at the company The Learning Annex. Trump explained his motivation for wanting to work with Kiyosaki, saying he was motivated by their respective success with Trump's book The Art of the Deal and Kiyosaki's book Rich Dad, Poor Dad.

25|$|Trip Brennan of The Intercept {{reviewed}} both Why We <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Rich and Midas Touch, and {{was critical}} of both books. Brennan criticized Midas Touch for its support of multi-level marketing, a practice he described as a pyramid scheme in disguise. He wrote negatively of the book's discounting of investment in mutual funds. BuzzFeed News wrote about the work during Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, and contrasted the book's views on the changing American economy with Trump's statements from the campaign trail. BuzzFeed News was critical Trump had shifted his perspective from the book, where he had previously written U.S. industrial jobs would never return and individuals needed to learn to cope with new skills in the Information Age. Business Insider similarly compared the work with Trump's 2016 campaign message, noting the book ended with a passage embracing immigrants whereas the Trump campaign {{was critical of}} illegal immigration from Mexico.|$|E

500|$|... "Carry Out" [...] is one {{of twelve}} songs written and {{produced}} by Timbaland and J-Roc for Timbaland's third studio album Shock Value II (2009). Justin Timberlake, Attitude and Jim Beanz, notable collaborators with Timbaland, also assisted {{in the writing of}} the song. Timbaland, in an interview with MTV's Shaheem Reed and Gil Kaufman, stated that he favored this song over other recordings because the process for creating the song was similar to those of other collaborations they have done. Timberlake would come into the studio and listen to the track. Afterwards, he would then compose the lyrics in his head. Upon explaining their method of making music, Timbaland stated that: [...] "We got a chemistry that cannot be described. People ask, 'Well, what are you and Justin like?' Can't tell you what it's like — it's a chemistry that can't be described. Something you would have to see for yourself and be, like, 'Them two got magic'." [...] Timbaland stated that the song resembles a [...] "2010 version" [...] of Snoop Dogg's [...] "Drop It Like It's Hot", produced by The Neptunes. He also revealed that the intention of the song was to provide a different slang for women: [...] "Instead of 'Your phat butt' or 'Your big breasts,' we say, 'Oh, I need you. Can I be your carry out? Be my carry out. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> my dinner, my leftovers, my everything.' It's a different slang. We're grown men, I wanna be subliminal to females.
