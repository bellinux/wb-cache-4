30|$|By {{adjusting}} {{the location of}} <b>wells,</b> <b>well</b> pattern optimization can significantly improve the efficiency of water drive development and obtain higher economic benefits (Beckner and Song 1995).

5|$|Wilson {{began his}} career as a trainee with Charlton Athletic, and was a regular in the club's Under-18 team, where he played in defence. He progressed through the club's youth system, and {{featured}} in Charlton's reserve side throughout the club's 2005–06 campaign, making a total of 16 appearances for the reserve side as a second-year scholar. However, he failed to make any first-team appearances and was subsequently allowed to search for a new club. In February 2006, he played for Luton Town's reserve side in a match against Stevenage Borough reserves at Kenilworth Road, although no transfer materialised. He was officially released by Charlton in April 2006. A month later, Wilson went on trial at League Two side Shrewsbury Town, and played the whole match in Shrewsbury's 2–1 pre-season friendly home win against Rotherham United, although he was unsuccessful in his attempt to earn a professional contract with the club. In August 2006, Wilson signed a one-year deal with Colchester United. Similarly to his time at Charlton, Wilson featured regularly for the club's reserve side throughout the 2006–07 season, but failed to make any first-team appearances, making the substitute's bench once in a 1–0 loss to MK Dons in the League Cup. He was loaned out to Conference South side <b>Welling</b> United in December 2006. He made his debut for <b>Welling</b> in the club's 1–0 win away at Cambridge City, but was sent-off after just 27 minutes for violent conduct. He returned to first-team action in Welling's 0–0 draw with Basingstoke Town at Park View Road in the FA Trophy, and also played the whole match in Welling's 2–1 away win against Thurrock. Wilson played his last game for <b>Welling</b> in the club's 2–0 win at home to Fisher Athletic in early January 2007. He played a total of four times for <b>Welling</b> during his one-month loan spell at the club. On returning to Layer Road, Wilson was released at the end of the 2006–07 season, and failed to make a first-team appearance for Colchester. Ahead of the 2007–08 season, Wilson spent pre-season trialling at Brentford and Stockport County respectively, training with Stockport for a number of weeks and playing in several pre-season friendlies, but was ultimately not offered a contract.|$|E

5|$|By 1988, Searchlight {{reported}} that the party's membership had declined to around 1,000. Tyndall responded by trying to raise finances, calling for greater sales of their newspaper and increasing the price of membership by 50%. He also promised {{that he would make}} the BNP the largest extreme-right group in the UK and that he would establish a professional headquarters for the party. This was achieved in 1989, as a party headquarters was opened in <b>Welling,</b> Southeast London, an area chosen because it was a recipient of significant 'white flight' from inner London. That year also witnessed the BNP become the most prominent force on the British far-right as the NF collapsed amid internal arguments and schisms.|$|E
50|$|A <b>well</b> cluster, also {{referred}} to as a monitoring <b>well</b> cluster, consists of multiple co-located monitoring <b>wells</b> that are constructed with intakes (<b>well</b> screens) at different depths in the subsurface. The purpose of a <b>well</b> cluster is to provide groundwater samples from discrete depths at approximately the same location. Also, water levels can be measured in each individual monitoring <b>well,</b> providing vertical profiles of groundwater pressure (hydraulic head). <b>Well</b> clusters are different from nested <b>wells</b> in that each monitoring <b>well</b> is constructed in a separate borehole, as opposed to multiple <b>well</b> casings in a single borehole which is the case with nested <b>wells).</b> A key advantage of a <b>well</b> cluster over a nested <b>well</b> is that there is less potential for vertical leakage and hydraulic short-circuiting because reliable annular seals are installed in each separate borehole in the cluster. However, <b>well</b> clusters require drilling multiple boreholes, which results in higher construction costs compared to nested <b>wells.</b> Economical alternatives to <b>well</b> clusters are multilevel groundwater monitoring systems, {{also referred}} to as engineered nested <b>wells.</b>|$|R
