I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This {{is not going to be}} for much longer, because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'" ...|$|E

Yes, Sir, that <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Sammy Jay felt--scared. Every time a leaf rustled, Sammy jumped almost out of his skin. His heart went pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat.

She tried to look as if she understood all about [...] "investments, percentage, and long credit;" [...] but she was out of her depth in five minutes, and dared say nothing, lest she should betray her lamentable ignorance on all matters of business. She got out of the scrape by cleverly turning the conversation to old times, and youthful reminiscences soon absorbed them both.|$|E

The Mountain Ranch is nearest, and thither Mr. Gray goes first. Mrs. Morpher, over a kneading-trough, with her bare arm whitened with flour, is genuinely grieved at parting with the master, and, in spite of Mr. Gray's earnest remonstrances, insists upon conducting him into the chill parlor, leaving him there until she shall have attired herself in a manner becoming to [...] "company." [...] "I don't want you to go at all--no more I don't," [...] says Mrs. Morpher, with all sincerity, as she seats herself finally on the shining horsehair sofa. [...] "The children will miss you. I don't believe that any one will do for Risty, Kerg, and Clytie what you have done. But I suppose you know best what's best. Young men like to see the world, and it ain't expected one so young as you should settle down yet. That's what I was telling Clytie this morning. That <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> with my John afore he was married. I suppose you'll see M'liss and her before you go. They say that she is going to San Francisco soon.

6000|$|Dear General Hoskyns,--I {{have the}} honour to report as usual. Your giddy mother having gone {{planting}} a flower-garden, I am obliged to write {{with my own}} hand, and, of course, nobody {{will be able to}} read it. This has been a very mean kind of a month. Aunt Maggie left with the influenza. We have heard of her from Sydney, and she is all right again; but we have inherited her influenza, and it made a poor place of Vailima. We had Talolo, Mitaele, Sosimo, Iopu, Sina, Misifolo, and myself, all sick in bed at the same time; and was not that a pretty dish to set before the king! The big hall of the new house having no furniture, the sick pitched their tents in it,--I mean their mosquito-nets,--like a military camp. The Tamaitai and your mother went about looking after them, and managed to get us something to eat. Henry, the good boy! though he was getting it himself, did housework, and went round at night from one mosquito-net to another, praying with the sick. Sina, too, was as good as gold, and helped us greatly. We shall always like her better. All the time--I do not know how they managed--your mother found the time to come and write for me; and for three days, as I had my old trouble on, and had to play dumb man, I dictated a novel in the deaf-and-dumb alphabet. But now we are all recovered, and getting to feel quite fit. A new paddock has been made; the wires come right {{up to the top of}} the hill, pass within twenty yards of the big clump of flowers (if you remember that) and by the end of the pineapple patch. The Tamaitai and your mother and I all sleep in the upper story of the new house; Uncle Lloyd is alone in the workman's cottage; and there is nobody at all at night in the old house, but ants and cats and mosquitoes. The whole inside of the new house is varnished. It is a beautiful golden-brown by day, and in lamplight all black and sparkle. In the corner of the hall the new safe is built in, and looks as if it had millions of pounds in it; but I do not think there is much more than twenty dollars and a spoon or two; so the man that opens it will have a great deal of trouble for nothing. Our great fear is lest we should forget how to open it; but it will look just as well if we can't. Poor Misifolo--you remember the thin boy, do you not?--had a desperate attack of influenza; and he was in a great taking. You would not like to be very sick in some savage place in the islands, and have only the savages to doctor you? Well, that <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he felt. [...] "It is all very well," [...] he thought, [...] "to let these childish white people doctor a sore foot or a toothache, but this is serious--I might die of this! For goodness' sake let me get away into a draughty native house, where I can lie in cold gravel, eat green bananas, and have a real grown-up, tattooed man to raise spirits and say charms over me." [...] A day or two we kept him quiet, and got him much better. Then he said he must go. He had had his back broken in his own islands, he said; it had come broken again, and he must go away to a native house and have it mended. [...] "Confound your back!" [...] said we; [...] "lie down in your bed." [...] At last, one day, his fever was quite gone, and he could give his mind to the broken back entirely. He lay in the hall; I was in the room alone; all morning and noon I heard him roaring like a bull calf, so that the floor shook with it. It was plainly humbug; it had the humbugging sound of a bad child crying; and about two of the afternoon we were worn out, and told him he might go. Off he set. He was in some kind of a white wrapping, with a great white turban on his head, as pale as clay, and walked leaning on a stick. But, O, he was a glad boy to get away from these foolish, savage, childish white people, and get his broken back put right by somebody with some sense. He nearly died that night, and little wonder! but he has now got better again, and long may it last! All the others were quite good, trusted us wholly, and stayed to be cured where they were. But then he was quite right, if you look at it from his point of view; for, though we may be very clever, we do not set up to cure broken backs. If a man has his back broken we white people can do nothing at all but bury him. And was he not wise, since that was his complaint, to go to folks who could do more? ...|$|E

5000|$|Aurora {{was created}} {{to appeal to the}} instinctual side of the {{listener}} as opposed to the logical, in likeness to tales and myths, emphasizing vocals and melody. The songs were written so that the album would lack any inherent story or concept, inviting the listener to create their own reading. However, as he wrote the lyrics out, seven of the album's ten songs ended up having to do with [...] "you" [...] (kimi), which accidentally created undertones of a story about two people. Hirasawa wanted to avoid that if at all possible, but felt that <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the language worked and left it as is. Many words representing natural phenomena were included in an attempt to resolve complaints about the lyrics being opaque. Hirasawa chose words that were easy to understand and had a large impact, the word Aurora came from this decision as well.|$|E

5000|$|Norton practiced drama {{criticism}} {{when the}} relationship between the regional critic and playwrights whose shows were undergoing tryouts in their towns were not as adversarial as they were to become. Frank Rich, who became prominent as a theater critic for The New York Times, wrote about how Norton's role as a [...] "play doctor" [...] was part of its times:What people should remember was that in his heyday ... the Josh Logans and Rodgers and Hammersteins looked to out-of-town critics for informed advice about how to `fix their shows.' Critics like Norton relished playing the role. They went back to see plays {{at the end of the}} run and that <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the Broadway theater worked. Newspapers and audiences accepted it as part of the process as critics would write columns that combined repertorial, critical, and advice-giving elements. It would be consideredhighly inappropriate today to talk to the writers and producers outside of columns, but it was a different world.|$|E
5000|$|David Weber didn't set out {{to create}} a female protagonist; [...] "it {{was the way the}} {{character}} came to me," [...] Weber explains. [...] "I didn't {{set out to}} do it because I thought that it was especially politically sensitive on my part or because I thought it was likely to strike a chord with female readership or be a financial success. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that the character first presented herself." [...] Weber doesn't find writing a female character particularly challenging, because, he says, [...] "I'm writing about a human being who happens to be female." [...] When he first started writing, he had developed her entire back story before he started the first book. However, since he knew from the beginning that these books would become aseries, he deliberately set Honor up as a character who changes and grows. One example Weber offers is that in The Short Victorious War, Honor off-handedly refers to her genetically enhanced metabolism, which isn't fully explored until In Enemy Hands: [...] "It was one of those little things that I knew about or that I was holding in reserve," [...] Weber says.|$|E
