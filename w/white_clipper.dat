50|$|For {{this reason}} a <b>white</b> <b>clipper</b> circuit {{is used to}} {{strictly}} limit the maximum amplitude of the video waveform at the transmitter. For recording and general use the <b>white</b> <b>clipper</b> is used to limit the maximum excursion of the signal. For recording this prevents overmodulation on analogue systems which tends to corrupt adjacent tracks in helical scanning; while on digital systems the peak signal amplitude is an absolute numerical value and cannot be exceeded.|$|E
50|$|A <b>white</b> <b>clipper</b> (or white limiter) is {{a circuit}} in {{professional}} video products that limits the maximum amplitude of the luminance {{part of the}} analogue video signal to 1 volt. It is essential for both analogue recording and transmission of video material.|$|E
5000|$|Video cameras {{can easily}} produce over 1 volt in high {{contrast}} scenes. However, because the analogue video chain {{is designed to}} work within the limits laid out above, the use of the <b>white</b> <b>clipper</b> may result in loss of highlight detail or [...] "burn-out", while a limited contrast ratio is achieved.|$|E
50|$|In 1868, Golden Fleece made a 44-day {{passage from}} San Francisco to Hong Kong, {{arriving}} {{three days before}} <b>White</b> Swallow, a <b>clipper</b> known for her speed. White Swallow had left the Golden Gate with a two-day head start.|$|R
50|$|On December 27, 1853 a fire {{broke out}} in the {{buildings}} of the Novelty Baking Company near the piers where Great Republic and several other wooden merchant vessels were moored. The fire quickly spread to the packet ship Joseph Walker, and to the <b>clippers</b> <b>White</b> Squall, Whirlwind, Red Rover and Great Republic. The first three ships were destroyed, Red Rover was damaged, and Great Republic burnt to near the waterline. Great Republic was declared a total loss, and Donald McKay, who never got over the loss, was compensated by insurers. The sunken hulk was sold by the insurance underwriters to Captain Nathaniel Palmer who salvaged and rebuilt it as a three-deck vessel with reduced masts.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>white</b> <b>clipper</b> is {{a circuit}} that clips out the excess level of video signal. It is {{especially}} important for those transmitters that receive signals from other transmitters through professional receivers. The circuit has two parallel arms. In the first arm a Zener diode clips out the signal in excess of 1 volt. In the second arm, the chrominance signal bypasses the Zener diode through a band pass filter. Sometimes it is necessary or desirable to create a soft clipping action where some highlight detail can be preserved in high contrast scenes. This is known as a [...] "knee" [...] circuit after the shape of the transfer characteristic graph.|$|E
