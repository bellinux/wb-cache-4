To publicize it the band appeared on the popular morning television show Live with Regis and Kelly, an event that Shears later recalled: [...] "Kelly Ripa loved us, after {{the first time we}} played, she gave me a hug and <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> 'I {{just want you to know}} that this is my favorite music performance we've ever had.' It was amazing." [...] Nonetheless, neither the band nor the album proved to be a big commercial success in the US: major chain store Wal-Mart refused to stock it, claiming on its website that it contained [...] "a snarling, swaggering attack on conservatism" [...] in the form of the song [...] "Tits on the Radio".|$|E

60|$|He {{remained}} {{still for}} a time in the dark--silent; almost invisible. All at once he pinned my elbows to my sides. I felt utterly powerless in his grip, and his voice, <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> vibrated.|$|R
5000|$|According to vocalist David Draiman, {{the song}} is [...] "a real racy song... about me {{standing}} over the body of my girlfriend, who just killed herself, and the Devil is standing over me, <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear</b> to kill myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Then it {{was that}} Hans, who {{understood}} something of Arabic as he did of most African tongues, pulled my sleeve and <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?' she <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> at last. 'I can't tell why {{we should}} stay. He's asleep, and papa will be wanting us back.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the popular}} novelist," [...] the lawyer <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> but {{loud enough for}} the rest to hear, and they all testified their {{amusement}} at my cost.|$|E

[...] Excerpt from Franz Kafka's [...] "A Country Doctor" ...|$|R
6000|$|A voice there is, that <b>whispers</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> ('Tis reason's voice, which {{sometimes}} one can hear) 'Friend Pope! be prudent, let your Muse take breath, And never gallop Pegasus to death; Lest, still and stately, void of fire or force, You limp, like Blackmore on a Lord Mayor's horse.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pyecroft <b>whispered</b> this <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear</b> as Moorshed {{moved toward}} a {{group at the}} stern.|$|R
60|$|A slave girl, to whom I {{had been}} kind, <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear</b> {{to have a}} care, for that was Madam Mendizabal; but the name was new to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell whoever {{takes care}} of him," [...] she <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> [...] "that he cannot live long. The doctors have assured me. It {{is a matter of}} weeks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{wonderful}} self-possession!" [...] somebody <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b> The {{children in}} the room were healthy, well-behaved little creatures--but {{the name of the}} innocent one among them was Selina.|$|E

6000|$|... "'She's gone riding,' I <b>whisper</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bronc's <b>ear,</b> 'with Birdstone Jack, {{the hired}} mule from Sheep Man's Canada. Did you get that, old Leather-and-Gallops?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Paul," [...] she <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> [...] "is it true {{that the}} {{inspector}} who had her followed all that morning {{was a friend of}} dad's?" [...] I shook my head.|$|E

6000|$|... "You see a {{very old}} man, but you {{see a very}} {{unsettled}} mind. There are red traditions and pale-face traditions. Both speak of the Great Spirit, but only one speak of his Son. A soft voice has been <b>whispering</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> lately, much of the Son of God. Do they speak to you in that way on the prairies? I know not what to think. I wish to think what is right; {{but it is not}} easy to understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{came the}} {{beginning}} of the end. We were staying in a villa which we had rented for a month near Florence, and one day we drove into the city together to do some shopping. Paul was at the post-office, and I was crossing the square to go to him, when of a sudden I felt a hand upon my dress, and a hoarse <b>whisper</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b> I started round in terror. A man, pale and hollow-eyed, stood by my side. It was Gomez! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{spoke to}} no one," [...] said the Duke hastily--"nay, I mistake, I {{remember}} a fellow <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> that one, who I thought had left London was still lingering in town. A person whom I had business with." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{conclusion}} of dinner {{was marked by}} an absence of all ceremony. The cigarettes had already been passed round before the Archduchess rose, but those who chose to remain at the table did so. Isobel leaned over and <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Where {{would you}} go?" [...] I asked {{when the door}} was closed upon us, so that those inside the cabin might not hear what was said, and the dear little French lad <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> while caressing the sleeve of my coat: ...|$|E
6000|$|V:2:42 [...] SOL. [...] Not a breath. [...] Our long-vexed destinies--even {{now their}} streams [...] Blend in one tide.

6000|$|... "Perhaps {{something}} {{may happen}} to prevent Armadale {{from coming to}} Naples? When he last wrote, he was waiting at Gibraltar for an English steamer in the Mediterranean trade to bring him on here. He may get tired of waiting before the steamer comes, or he may hear of a yacht at some other place than this.

6000|$|Surprise and astonishment flashed from face to {{face all}} over the house; the queen's gratified smile faded out at the name of Sir Kay, and she looked disappointed; and the page <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear</b> with an accent and manner {{expressive}} of extravagant derision-- ...|$|E
6000|$|After her {{came the}} nobles who had {{accompanied}} Idernes, grave Eastern men. One of these, a tall captain with eyes like a hawk, seemed familiar to me.

60|$|The kind {{friend who}} {{presented}} me to General Smith <b>whispered</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear</b> some {{few words of}} comment upon the man.

6000|$|... "Yes, Nigel, {{he would}} have it so. I can hear his <b>whisper</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b> Honor to him was everything--the rest nothing.
