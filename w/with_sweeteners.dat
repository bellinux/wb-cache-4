40|$|The {{development}} of age-adapted dosage forms and taste-masking of bitter-tasting drugs administered orally for children, are formidable challenges for formulation scientists. Childhood {{is a period}} of maturation requiring knowledge of developmental pharmacology to establish dose but the ability of the child to manage different dosage forms and devices also changes. Paediatric formulations must allow accurate administration of the dose to children of widely varying age and weight. Whilst the oral route will be preferred for long term use and the intravenous route for the acutely ill, many of the dosage forms designed for adults, such as oro-dispersible tablets, buccal gels and transdermal patches, would also benefit children if they contained an appropriate paediatric dose.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the anti-carious effect {{of coffee in}} humans. Coffee {{represents one of the}} most consumed products by the population. Materials and Methods: A random sample of 1000 individuals, of both sexes, who consumed only coffee as a beverage and who visited the Out-Patient Department of KLE Society&#x 2032;s Institute of Dental Sci-ences, with a dental complaint and no history of any major illness, were considered as subjects. The patients&#x 2032; histories with regard to the coffee intake, such as, period of consumption, frequency of consumption, whether taken with milk or wihout milk, with sugar or without sugar, and the brand make, was noted. History of the type of diet, consumption of sweets, periodic-ity of brushing, and whether they had undergone fluoride applications were also noted. A thousand patients who consumed beverages other than coffee were taken as the control. Results: The results showed that coffee most consumed was roasted coffee, and the frequency on an average was about three cups per day, for an average period of 35 years. The Decayed/Missing/Filled Surface (DMFS) scores varied from 2. 9, in subjects who drank black coffee, to 5. 5 in subjects who consumed coffee together <b>with</b> <b>sweeteners</b> and creaming agents. The DMFS score was 3. 4 in subjects who consumed coffee together with milk but no sugar.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ice {{cream is}} a product whose {{formulation}} requires considerable amounts of sugar. In addition to providing flavor, sugar contributes to the physicochemical characteristics of ice cream but its consumption in large quantities is related to chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. For this reason, the food industry seeks to formulate products <b>with</b> <b>sweeteners</b> that preserve the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of the original product. Stevia rebaudiana is a plant that naturally contains glycosides with no calories and high sweetening capacity and it is considered safe for consumption. Therefore {{the aim of this}} research was to evaluate the effect of replacing sugar with different levels of extracts of S. rebaudiana Morita II and Criolla, on the physicochemical and sensory properties of strawberry ice cream. Using a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design, a total of 4 formulations were prepared with two levels of concentration of the aqueous extract of Stevia rebaudiana (5 or 8 %) and the variety of S. rebaudiana (Morita II or Criolla). Proximate composition, physicochemical properties and sensory evaluation were determined in processed products. The proximate analysis of strawberry ice cream varied significantly (P< 0. 05) depending of variety and level used on the formulation. The viscosities of all ice cream mixes were decreasing as the shear rate was increased, indicating a pseudoplastic behavior. The sensory analysis showed differences (P< 0. 05) among the formulations tested, however the score of all products were above the indifference point, suggesting that all of these formulations may have a commercial potential...|$|E

The statistical analysis revealed that all models of konjac gels <b>with</b> <b>sweeteners</b> were effective and adequate fitted. The most variable affecting gel strength was konjac/κ-carrageenan n blend. Quadratic effect of konjac/κ-carrageenan blend was more profound (p< 0. 001) on konjac gels with each sweetener. The variation of xylitol and sucrose had a linear effect (p< 0. 001) and a quadratic effect (p< 0. 05) on gel strength, respectively, while an increase in erythritol-sucralose had no significant effect. Also, {{the interaction between the}} two variables had no significant effect on gel strength. The optimal conditions for the highest gel strength were 1 % konjac/κ-carrageenan (39. 56 : 60. 44) with 9. 58 % sucrose, 1 % konjac/κ-carrageenan (39. 87 : 60. 13) with 2 % xylitol and 1 % konjac/κ-carrageenan (38. 18 : 61. 82) with 0. 94 % erythritol-sucralose.

40|$|Stevia-based {{sweeteners}} containing {{steviol glycosides}} are trendy non-caloric sweeteners {{commonly used in}} the food industry to substitute high calorie sweeteners like, table sugar, and consequently reduce the caloric content of the product. Modifying product formulation can concern food-microbial kinetics. These novel sweeteners {{can be added to}} solid-like structured products, where bacteria are forced to grow as colonies and characteristic diffusive microgradients appear in and around the colonies. This work studied the growth kinetics of Salmonella Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes when substituting table sugar with commercial stevia and a pure mixture of steviol glycosides at different concentration values. Next, the role of homogeneous and heterogeneous solid systems was also studied, using gelatine and dextran as gelling agents. Inoculated media were incubated at 20, 8 and 4 °C, cell concentration was determined and the Baranyi and Roberts (1994) model was fitted for growth parameter estimation. Results reveal a negligible effect from sweetener’s addition in homogeneous gelatine-based media on the growth of S.

40|$|The {{analytical}} method for sweeteners in various food matrixes {{is very important}} for food quality control and regulation enforcement. A simple and rapid method for the simultaneous determination of 10 sweeteners [acesulfame potassium (ACS-K), aspartame (ASP), cyclamate (CYC), dulcin (DUL), glycyrrhizic acid (GA), neotame (NEO), neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDC), saccharin (SAC), sucralose (SCL), and stevioside (STV) ] in various foods by liquid chromatography/tandem mass chromatography (LC–MS/MS) was developed. The chromatographic separation was performed on a Phenomenex Luna Phenyl-Hexyl (5  μm, 4. 6  mm ×  150  mm) column with gradient elution of 10  mM ammonium acetate in water and 10  mM ammonium acetate in methanol. The recoveries of the 10 sweeteners were between 75 % and 120 %, and the coefficients of variation were less than 20 %. The limits of quantification were 0. 5  μg/kg for NHDC and SCL. For the other sweeteners, the limits of quantification were 0. 1  μg/kg. Compared to the traditional high-performance liquid chromatography method, the LC–MS/MS method could provide better sensitivity, higher throughput, enhanced specificity, and more sweeteners analyzed in a single run. The samples included 27 beverages (16 alcoholic and 11 nonalcoholic beverages) and 15 pickled foods (1 pickled pepper, 3 candies, and 11 candied fruits). Two remanufactured wines were found to contain 7. 2, 8. 5  μg/g SAC and 126. 5, 123  μg/g CYC, respectively. ACS-K, ASP, SCL, and NEO were detected in five beverages and drinks. The pickled peppers and candied fruits were found to contain SAC, GA, CYC, ASP, STV, NEO, and ACS-K.

AIMS: To study bladder sensation during a forced diuresis protocol and to assess differences in sensation perceived by different ethnic groups and after drinking artificially sweetened water. METHODS: Female Caucasian and south Indian Asian volunteers performed the diuresis protocol drinking water, or water sweetened with saccharin (5 [*]mg/kg body weight). Participants recorded filling sensation every 5 [*]min while drinking 250 - 350 [*]mL/ 15 [*]min. They were asked to record the strongest sensation before voiding as maximum sensation, before voiding. The void was measured and sensation immediately recorded as minimum. The process was repeated. Voided volume and time required to achieve maximum sensation during cycle 2 were compared by water and sweetener, ethnic group, and age. RESULTS: Twenty Asian and 20 Caucasian volunteers participated. No differences in maximum voided volume or diuresis rate was seen by ethnicity. Median diuresis <b>with</b> <b>sweetener</b> was 16. 7 [*]mL/min (8. 6 - 35) compared to 13. 2 (7. 1 - 25) with water (P[*]=[*] 0. 008), a difference accounted for by 16 women with > 5 [*]mL/min difference in diuresis rate. These were excluded to leave 24 women with similar diuresis rates <b>with</b> both <b>sweetener</b> and water (14. 8 [*]mL/min (8. 6 - 28. 0) and 13. 2 [*]mL/min (7. 1 - 25. 0).

40|$|Co-crystallising sugars by the {{supersaturation}} {{process was}} investigated using sucrose and lactose as the matrix sugars. The components to be cocrystallised with either sucrose or lactose were {{a variety of}} mono- and disaccharides along <b>with</b> <b>sweeteners</b> such as saccharin. Analysis of the materials yielded from the supersaturation process was done primarily by differential scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD). DSC analysis allowed information to be obtained on the thermal behaviour of the various co-crystalline materials, whilst PXRD permitted information on the structural aspects of the materials to be gained. These two forms of analysis were complimentary to each other, each revealed unique characteristics of the co-crystalline materials. To unambiguously differentiate {{the difference between a}} material that is co-crystalline and one that is not, physical blends of the sugars to be cocrystallised were analysed by DSC and PXRD. This approach allowed for identification of all the components in the mixture, more importantly, this identification was achievable {{at all levels of the}} second component in the mixture. Co-crystallising either sucrose or lactose, with various sugars, yielded solely co-crystalline material up to a certain level of the added sugar. Once this level has been reached, two distinct phases appear in both DSC and PXRD analysis. A co-crystallised and a phase relating to the added sugar can be observed. The formation of a potentially co-crystalline material appears to result from a direct inclusion of the added sugar into the matrix sugar. DSC analysis of the co-crystallised material revealed thermal behaviour that is suggestive of a doping of the matrix sugar by the added component. PXRD analysis did provide some data to further this argument, axis elongation for co-crystallised material is suggestive of a sopping of the main phase. However, determination of the unit cell volumes did not yield conclusive evidence to help prove this hypothesis though. This behaviour in both forms of analysis was generally proportional to the quantity of the second component that has become included into the matrix sugar. The formation of solely co-crystalline materials appears to rely on the structural similarity between the matrix sugar and the component to be included. A higher degree of similarity is reflected by a high level of inclusion of the added component. Co-crystallisation appears to rely on a degree of intermolecular sugar-sugar recognition. The inclusion of a second component is not solely down to structural similarities between materials however. It appears that there are kinetic factors potentially involved to. Varying the method of co-crystallisation allowed for higher, or lower, amounts of various second components to be included within a matrix sugar. The appearance of co-crystalline materials may be due to the inclusion of the second component in an amorphous state. Analysis by Autosorb of various co-crystalline materials has dispelled this idea. All co-crystalline materials behaved in a manner that was indicative of a crystalline material. During the course of the work with sucrose, it was noted that a unique melting point was observed. From previous work, this unique phase was thought to be a hydrated form of sucrose. Further analysis on this material has allowed for further postulation on its formation and on new methods of its synthesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Low- and non-calorie {{sweeteners}} like saccharine, xylitol, acesulfame-K, etc., {{have been}} used in the food industry to replace high-calorie sweeteners, e. g., table sugar, since over a century; however, some disadvantages like their thermolability, bitter after-taste or laxative effect, encourage a constant search for better options. Stevia-based sweeteners and tagatose have recently appeared in the market as novel alternatives to traditional non‑/low-calorie sweeteners, with optimized characteristics. Their organoleptic properties, stability and impact on human’s health have been widely reported; however, little is known about their potential effect on microbial growth dynamics of food pathogens. Modifying product formulation might trigger changes in parameters such as chemical composition, aw, etc., which could affect microbiological food safety. Food structure should be also considered when addressing the effect of these sweeteners on microbial growth, since they can be added {{to a wide variety of}} liquid and solid-like food products. Although the role of food structure on microbial dynamics has been acknowledged, the combinatory effect of both novel sweeteners and food structure has not been studied. The overall objective of this thesis dissertation is to investigate the effect of stevia-based sweeteners and tagatose on the growth dynamics of Salmonella Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes, when added to liquid and solid food (model) systems, and to UHT skimmed milk, (selected as case study). Solid model systems were used over real food product because they are more reproducible, easy to prepare and sterilized. Due to the differences in physicochemical properties between stevia/steviol glycosides and tagatose, these were individually considered. More specifically, commercial stevia (St) and the pure mix steviol glycosides (SG) were studied in comparison to table sugar (TS), while tagatose (Tg) was independently considered. The studies from St/SG vs. TS are presented through two chapters because of the broad amount of information gathered, while results from Tg are compiled in one. The first study focuses on the effect of stevia-based sweeteners in liquid systems. In this case, the effect of different concentration levels of St and SG was compared to sweet-equivalent concentrations of TS and laboratory sucrose (LS). Incubation temperature was another variable taken into account, addressing the effect of the sweeteners at room and refrigeration conditions. The liquid media chosen to address the bacterial growth dynamics were chemically defined minimal media and general culture broth. Results reveal variable responses depending on the microorganism, temperature and sweetener studied. On one hand, the growth of S. Typhimurium is more affected by the presence of the sweeteners, especially at high concentrations and low incubation temperatures. On the other hand, the growth of L. monocytogenes is only altered at 4 °C when the sweeteners are present, except with SG. Results from chemically defined minimal media provide useful information regarding the metabolizing ability of the different sweeteners by both bacteria. More specifically, they reveal the key role of the bulk agent used in St, maltodextrin, as both bacteria are able to grow on it. Furthermore, experiments in UHT skimmed milk (UHT SM) enriched with sweetener were conducted at low temperatures. Results reveal a similar behaviour of L. monocytogenes in UHT SM enriched <b>with</b> <b>sweeteners</b> as compared to the results in general liquid media. Nevertheless, the behaviour of S. Typhimurium in this product is very different to that in general liquid culture media, since the presence of TS promotes the growth in UHT SM at 8 °C. The second study of this dissertation addresses the effect of stevia-based sweeteners on the growth kinetics of S. Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes in homogeneous and heterogeneous solid systems. As in the previous study, St, SG and TS were added at different concentration values to general media supplemented with gelatine, and a mixture of gelatine and dextran which is known to lead to phase separation. As in the case of liquid media, different results were obtained for each type of bacterium, S. Typhimurium being generally more sensitive to the environmental changes than L. monocytogenes. Results also demonstrate the key role played by the media micro-structure and incubation temperature on the growth of these microorganisms, over the presence of the studied sweeteners. Finally, the effect of Tg at different concentration levels on the growth kinetics of S. Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes was investigated. Incubation temperatures, and the liquid and solid model systems to which Tg was added, were the same as for St/SG/TS. Results demonstrate the inhibitory effect on S. Typhimurium growth when Tg is added to TSBdf and to both solid systems. This effect is stronger at low temperature, as generally observed through the whole thesis. In UHT SM no measurable growth is obtained. The growth of L. monocytogenes remains invariable to the addition of, Tg, except at 4 °C, where the presence of Tg facilitates the growth of L. monocytogenes in liquid broth but not in UHT SM. Overall, this work contributes to a better understanding of bacterial kinetics in new low calorie formulations. The different growth behaviour of the two bacteria under study is evident, S. Typhimurium being more sensitive to environmental changes than L. monocytogenes. The use of Tg, that has a hurdle effect on the growth of S. Typhimurium, is here demonstrated to be a better option than replacing TS with St/SG because St/SG can facilitate bacterial growth. Nevertheless, any environmental modification, either the addition of sweeteners or the structure of the media, causes a stronger effect at low temperatures for both microorganisms. These conclusions can be used as a benchmark for the selection of the best low‑/non-calorie sweetener to be used in food industry. The importance of validating predictive models with real food products or more accurate food model systems, including solid systems, has also been demonstrated. Future work should focus on addressing the effect of these sweeteners on the growth dynamics of relevant food spoilage microorganisms, such as Pseudomonas fluorescens and Zyggosaccharomyces bailii, in other food products that are candidates for sugar replacement, e. g., fruit beverages and ketchup sauce. Localized measurements of pH and aw with non-invasive techniques in the solid systems can also contribute to a better understanding of the environmental changes occurring in the media and their effect on microbial behaviour. status: publishe...|$|E
