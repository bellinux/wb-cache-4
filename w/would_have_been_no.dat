5|$|A {{study of}} D. horneri skulls suggest that unlike many depictions of tyrannosaurids, this genus and likely other tyrannosaurids did not possess lips. Comparisons {{of the skull}} of this species with modern {{crocodiles}} show the same rugose bone structure that indicates the presence of large flat scales as opposed to lips. As the rough texture descends almost to the tooth line, it is theorized that Daspletosaurus teeth were not covered by lips, as there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> room for such soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|There were {{numerous}} reports in southern Mississippi of embedded tornadoes that exacerbated the hurricane's effects. Reports in Gulfport indicated that three schools actively {{being used as}} hurricane shelters were struck and damaged by tornadoes. At one location, almost 400 people being housed in a school had to rush to safety before part of its roof collapsed. Another apparent tornado sideswiped a senior citizens' center, endangering nearly 200 people in a structure that sustained damage to windows, doors, and part of its roof; about 20 people required rescue by paramedics. Only minor injuries occurred {{in association with the}} possible tornadoes. Teams of experts tasked with reviewing the validity of tornado reports were largely unable to prove that {{a significant portion of the}} damage in southern Mississippi had been done by tornadoes. As a result, few tornadoes were confirmed, and it is likely that most of the damage in the region resulted from squall-like winds that are part of an intense hurricane's nature, or potentially localized microbursts. Any unconfirmed tornadoes <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> stronger than the hurricane's synoptic winds.|$|E

25|$|Other sources {{the paper}} {{consulted}} found more flaws with the story.

25|$|Years {{after the}} war, {{memories}} faded {{and in the}} public mind it became popular to assume that the few pillboxes and other concrete objects that could easily be seen were all that was done to defend Britain; that their purpose was just to bolster morale and that there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> realistic hope of resisting a German assault. Even the Home Guard came to be seen as something of a joke, as exemplified by the BBC sitcom Dad's Army. However, what can be seen today are just the most visible and robust remains of a massive programme of fortification undertaken in a very short period.|$|E
25|$|On the {{argument}} that verses of Ali’s rule had been removed, Al-Khoei states that {{the collection of the}} Quran by Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman occurred significantly after the caliphate was decided and so if Ali’s rule had been mentioned {{it would have been the}} strongest argument for him to be the first caliph. There <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> need for the Muslims to gather to appoint someone. (Khu’i 158) The fact that the Companions did not mention anything , neither at the beginning of the caliphate nor after the caliphate had fallen to ‘Ali is proof that alteration in this sense did not occur.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, Elijah Delmedigo (c.1458 – c.1493), in his Bechinat ha-Dat {{endeavored}} {{to show that}} the Zohar could not be attributed to Shimon bar Yochai, by a number of arguments. He claims that if it were his work, the Zohar would have been mentioned by the Talmud, as has been the case with other works of the Talmudic period; he claims that had bar Yochai known by divine revelation the hidden meaning of the precepts, his decisions on Jewish law from the Talmudic period would have been adopted by the Talmud, that it would not contain the names of rabbis who lived at a later period than that of bar Yochai; he claims that if the Kabbalah was a revealed doctrine, there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> divergence of opinion among the Kabbalists concerning the mystic interpretation of the precepts.|$|E

25|$|The {{preliminary}} draft plan of 1992 envisaged speeds of 250km/h with a journey time between Nuremberg and Erfurt of 75minutes. The planned costs were DM 8 billion (about €4 billion). Already in 1993, {{before the beginning}} of construction, the route handled 80passenger trains during the day and 200freight trains at night. In 1992, five options were developed that would have passed through a 20kilometre-wide corridor, one of which was immediately rejected. A route through Coburg that would have required the demolition of existing buildings was also considered. At first the use of the existing line south of Coburg with a new line commencing on its southern approach had been considered as the favoured option. The Thuringian Forest would have been crossed at its narrowest point, but there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> stop in Coburg. In a citizens’ initiative, Coburg citizens collected 13,000 signatures against the route.|$|E
25|$|Casey {{could have}} {{commissioned}} the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Billy McMahon, as acting Prime Minister or Caretaker prime minister, {{but instead he}} appointed John McEwen, the leader of Liberals' coalition partner, the Country Party. In this he was following a precedent set in 1939, when Sir Earle Page was appointed Prime Minister {{following the death of}} Joseph Lyons. But it was later alleged that Casey appointed McEwen to prevent McMahon having an advantage in the Liberal Party's ballot for a new leader, since he shared the view of some Liberals that McMahon would not be a suitable successor. This matter was aired in a 1969 book, The Power Struggle, by veteran political journalist Alan Reid. Casey's biographer, W.J. Hudson says (in his 1986 book Casey) that Casey was concerned to preserve the Liberal-Country Party coalition, and that he knew (because McEwen had told him) that the Country Party would not serve under McMahon. (McEwen publicly confirmed his party's position on McMahon the day after his swearing-in.) If this was his motive for commissioning McEwen rather than McMahon, it suggests that he did take political considerations into account in making his decision. On the other hand, if the coalition were to disband, there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> party that could command a majority in the parliament and it could well have become unworkable.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{contemplated}} {{standing for}} Parliament. In 1916 the Conservative Party chairman Arthur Steel-Maitland {{had offered to}} get him a seat. Esher and Duncannon proposed forming a new “National” party of 20–30 MPs, which would include David Davies {{who had been on}} the mission to Russia. The new party’s policies would include more vigorous prosecution of the war – Wilson urged Irish conscription – and the detachment of Turkey and Bulgaria. Wilson was worried that it {{would be the end of}} his army career (he was also short of money – he had a private income of £300 a year, and half pay of £600 (£450 after tax) – but his house at Eaton Place was costing him £1,500 a year). His brother Jemmy proposed getting him an Ulster seat, and thought that the prospect of Wilson as an MP would annoy Robertson (who told Wilson that there was no army job for him in Britain), but the Irish Unionist leader Carson thought an English seat more sensible. Bonar Law was dismissive of Wilson’s hopes that, like J.C.Smuts, he might be invited to join the War Policy Committee, and also poured cold water on the idea of Wilson becoming an MP. Wilson did not agree with Milner’s suggestion that he succeed Sarrail as Commander-in-Chief at Salonika. Éamon de Valera of Sinn Féin had recently won the East Clare by-election (caused by the death of Willie Redmond) and on a visit to Currygrane (his first in eight years) everyone Wilson spoke to – judges, landowners, police officers, a Redmondite local politician and “some natives” agreed on the need for conscription. Brock Millman argued that the threat to stand for Parliament was blackmail to get a military job out of Lloyd George, but Keith Jeffery rejects this, arguing that Wilson <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> threat as a new MP but as a military adviser was a useful rival to Robertson, whom by July 1917 French was telling Wilson Lloyd George wanted to remove.|$|E

500|$|The Hyde Park Agreement {{was lost}} in Roosevelt's papers after his death, and until the American copy of the {{document}} was found American officials were puzzled when the British mentioned it.

5|$|Steiner {{differentiated}} offers, {{threats and}} throffers {{based on the}} preferability of compliance and noncompliance for the subject {{when compared to the}} normal course of events that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> come about <b>were</b> <b>no</b> intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable than it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of coercion, and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats <b>have</b> <b>been</b> cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|R

500|$|Chrysippus had a {{long and}} {{successful}} career of resisting the attacks of the Academy and hoped not simply to defend Stoicism against the assaults of the past, but also against all possible attack in the future.

At the close of the war in April 1865, Beecher was invited to speak at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, where the first shots of the war had been fired; Lincoln had again personally selected him, stating, [...] "We had better send Beecher down to deliver the address on the occasion of raising the flag because {{if it had not been}} for Beecher there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>no</b> flag to raise." ...|$|E
