40|$|Effective crop load {{management}} in orchards {{is a requirement}} for accurate crop yield estimation. Traditionally this involves various methods of obtaining {{a measure of the}} fruit tree features that predominantly determine crop yield (<b>wood,</b> <b>buds,</b> flowers, fruitlets, and fruit). Manual counting of fruit, flowers, or fruitlets during various stages of growth is a laborious and expensive process and often suffers from significant inaccuracies. While optical approaches to automated fruit counting have been proposed they are usually not robust to changing light conditions or colour and shape changes of the fruit during the growing season. We are currently developing an automated yield estimation system that optically estimates crop yield in orchards during various stages of growth. Instead of using traditional machine vision and image processing algorithms we build on recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNN) to build an object detector that extracts regions from the image that represent a fruit. The same framework {{can also be used to}} detect leaves, branches or other parts of the orchard canopy. These results can then be used to estimate yield using a statistical modelling approach...|$|R

60|$|A {{year later}} my canoe touched {{the same old}} landing. For ten months I {{had been in the}} city, where Killooleet never sings, and where the {{wilderness}} is only a memory. In the fall, on some long tramps, I had occasional glimpses of the little singer, solitary now and silent, stealing southward ahead of the winter. And in the spring he showed himself rarely in the underbrush on country roads, eager, restless, chirping, hurrying northward where the streams were clear and the big <b>woods</b> <b>budding.</b> But never a song in all that time; my ears were hungry for his voice as I leaped out to run eagerly to the big cedar. There were the stakes, and the tin plate, and the bark roof all crushed by the snows of winter. The bread was gone; what Killooleet had spared, Tookhees the wood mouse had eaten thankfully. I found the old tent poles and put up my house leisurely, a hundred happy memories thronging about me. In the midst of them came a call, a clear whistle,--and there he was, the same full cravat, the same bright cap, and the same perfect song to set my nerves a-tingling: I'm here, sweet Killooleet-lillooleet-lillooleet! And when I put crumbs by the old fireplace, he flew down to help himself, and went off with the biggest one, as of yore, to his nest by the deer path.|$|R

50|$|After the {{introduction}} of citrus greening disease, all commercial nurseries, where new young trees are purchased, were relocated indoors and a <b>bud</b> <b>wood</b> registration program was enacted. Previously young citrus trees were grown outdoors before disease pressure became an issue. This is to certify that Florida grove owners are able to purchase clean citrus trees for the planting of citrus groves. A greening positive young citrus tree will never reach maturity, even with intensive sprays.|$|R
5000|$|... "Hot {{and sour}} soup" [...] is a Chinese soup claimed {{variously}} by the regional cuisines of Beijing and Sichuan {{as a regional}} dish. The Chinese hot and sour soup is usually meat-based, and often contains ingredients such as day lily <b>buds,</b> <b>wood</b> ear fungus, bamboo shoots, and tofu, in a broth that is sometimes flavored with pork blood. It is typically made hot (spicy) by red peppers or white pepper, and sour by vinegar.|$|R

50|$|However, {{the patent}} was widely violated. Growers would buy one tree from Mr. Brokaw {{who had the}} {{exclusive}} right to produce the nursery trees.

5000|$|Now is {{the third}} album {{released}} by The Tubes. It was produced by John Anthony. Fed up with constant meddling from Bud Scoppa and Don Wood {{under the direction of}} Bill Spooner including surreptitiously remixing a track when John was not at the studio, John Anthony was advised to quit the project by Jerry Moss. Head of A&M A&R Kip Cohen said they took advantage of John and believed they overran the budget to bump up their union fees. Bill Spooner took over and completed the project with the help of engineer Don <b>Wood</b> and <b>Bud</b> Scoppa. John believes in retrospect he should not have tried to be [...] "one of the boys" [...] with this band but remains proud of his idea to get the band playing again live in the studio liked they used to do in the Bay Area bars.

50|$|After {{reading a}} {{magazine}} article illustrating an avocado tree with dollar bills hanging from it in 1925, Hass used all the money he had, plus a loan from his sister, Ida Hass, to buy a small acre and a half avocado grove at 430 West Road La Habra Heights, California. The trees were old Fuerte avocados with 2 or 3 Lyon {{as well as a}} few Pueblas and Nabals. The Fuerte was the best avocado available at that time, but Hass could not afford to buy more trees, so he decided to cut down many of the old trees and have them grafted over to Fuerte with new <b>bud</b> <b>wood.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Elliot tree in Henry Elliot's lawn had a trunk {{diameter of}} 0.76 m and was {{noted for its}} resistance to pecan scab and other diseases. The tree annually produced up to 114 kg of pecan nuts. In 1919, the Elliot family shared some of their pecans with Mr. Harlan of Harlan Farms Nursery in Paxton, Florida. Mr. Harlan {{was so impressed with}} the quality of the Elliot Pecan that he planted a 15 acre orchard of trees using <b>bud</b> <b>wood</b> that the Elliot family had given him. The orchard was then sold to Otis Mathis, whom the Florida Pecan Grower's Association credit with advancing the Elliot Pecan as an industry staple.|$|R

50|$|The trees {{thrived in}} the {{southern}} California climate and the navel orange industry grew rapidly. Many growers purchased <b>bud</b> <b>wood</b> and then grafted the cuttings to root stock. Within a few years, the successful cultivation of many thousands of the newly discovered Brazilian navel orange led to a California Gold Rush of a different kind: {{the establishment of the}} citrus industry, which is commemorated in the landscapes and exhibits of the California Citrus State Historic Park and the restored packing houses in the downtown's Marketplace district. By 1882, there were {{more than half a million}} citrus trees in California, almost half of which were in Riverside. The development of refrigerated railroad cars and innovative irrigation systems established Riverside as the richest city in the United States (in terms of income per capita) by 1895.|$|R

40|$|A {{disorder}} {{causing the}} cracking of bark {{in the lower}} trunk region of seedlings and in the root stock of bud-grafted trees of Hevea brasiliensis was observed recently. A preliminary investigation was carried {{out for the first}} time to study the occurrence, symptoms, its relationship to the genotype of clones or seedlings, age and growth of trees. The observations were that, this disorder appears only after about three years of establishment and reaches a high percentage in about seven years and is completely absent in <b>bud</b> <b>wood</b> nurseries. Bud-grafted trees with the disorder had a greater girth than those unaffected. The genotype of the scion in bud-grafted trees did not have a significant influence on the occurrence of this disorder. The nature and the symptoms of this disorder do not show the involvement of a pathogen of, but secondary infections may be the reason for bark decay around cracks. The information gathered so far points to an inherited physiological disorder that appears at maturity affecting both root stocks in bud-grafted trees and the lower trunk region in seedlings.

40|$|AbstractTo date, most poplar {{expressed}} sequence tags (ESTs) {{are from}} above-ground tissues such as <b>wood,</b> leaf and <b>buds.</b> Here, {{we present a}} large-scale production of ESTs from roots of the hybrid cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa×deltoides. cDNA libraries were generated from the root system of 2 -month-old rooted cuttings, and roots of 2. 5 -month-old cuttings water-stressed for 19 days. Partial sequences obtained from 7013 clones were assembled into 1347 clusters and 3527 singletons. This set of ESTs represents 4874 unique transcripts expressed in roots. Putative functions could be assigned to 3021 (62 %) of the transcripts. A {{significant portion of the}} ESTs encode proteins of common metabolic pathways; energy and metabolism represented 5 % and 8 % of total transcripts, respectively. Of specific interest to root functions are the 6 % of ESTs involved in signalling pathways and hormone metabolism, and 4 % encoding transporters and channels. The current poplar root ESTs and the aspen root ESTs present in public databases represent 6700 unique transcripts. The Unigene set was selected from the ESTs and used to generate nylon microarrays. Changes in aquaporins and transporter transcripts were then studied during adventitious root development...|$|R
40|$|Procurando encontrar um teste de campo rápido e prático para identificar a presença do virus da exocorte em plantas cítricas, foram feitas sôbre-enxertias no viveiro e no pomar em plantas portadoras do virus, usando borbulhas de limoeiro cravo e de trifoliata. Em cinco meses apareceram os sintomas da exocorte nos ramos de limoeiro cravo e em 6 - 7 meses nos de trifoliata. Inoculando pés francos de limoeiro cravo, no viveiro, com borbulhas portadoras do virus e provocando a formação de ramos novos e vigorosos nessas plantas, os sintomas da exocorte apareceram nesses ramos quatro meses depois da inoculação. Êste último parece ser o melhor e mais rápido teste de campo para a exocorte, até agora descoberto. Identification of the {{presence}} of exocortis virus in citrus trees have been based on the bark splitting symptoms showed in die trunk of trifoliate and Rangpur lime rootstocks within a period of 4 - 8 years. As a result of several tests made at the Liineira Experiment Station a very quick and efficient procedure was found to induce exocortis symptoms. By inoculating (budding) in the nursery vigorous Rangpur lime seedlings and cutting them back it was possible to see exocortis symptoms in the new sprouts growing from them within 4 months. These symptoms are yellow elongated blotches and splitting of the bark. This procedure seems to be the best and quickest field test for exocortis in a <b>bud</b> <b>wood</b> certification program...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of dwarfed rootstocks in apple crop {{has led to}} a new concept of intensive planting systems with the aim of producing early high yield and with returns of the initial high investment. Although yield is an important aspect to the grower, the consumer has become demanding regards fruit quality and is generally attracted by appearance. To fulfil the consumer’s expectations the grower may need to choose a proper training system along with an ideal pruning technique, which ensure a good light distribution {{in different parts of the}} canopy and a marketable fruit quality in terms of size and skin colour. Although these aspects are important, these fruits might not reach the proper ripening stage within the canopy because they are often heterogeneous. To describe the variability present in a tree, a software (PlantToon®), was used to recreate the tree architecture in 3 D in the two training systems. The ripening stage of each of the fruits was determined using a non-destructive device (DA-Meter), thus allowing to estimate the fruit ripening variability. This study deals with some of the main parameters that can influence fruit quality and ripening stage within the canopy and orchard management techniques that can ameliorate a ripening fruit homogeneity. Significant differences in fruit quality were found within the canopies due to their position, flowering time and <b>bud</b> <b>wood</b> age. Bi-axis appeared to be suitable for high density planting, even though the fruit quality traits resulted often similar to those obtained with a Slender Spindle, suggesting similar fruit light availability within the canopies. Crop load confirmed to be an important factor that influenced fruit quality as much as the interesting innovative pruning method “Click”, in intensive planting systems...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLitchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn. cv. Hong Huay) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important fruit products in Thailand, especially in the highlands of Chiang Mai where litchi can have natural off-season flowering even during the rainy season (June to August). The off-season production of litchi is not a common practice in the region because the physiological responses of litchi trees to flower induction techniques are still unclear. Therefore, we aim to use Random Forests (RF) as a tool to understand the effects of horticultural techniques on plant hormone dynamic or generative shoot development. A field experiment was conducted considering four horticultural treatments, namely (1) control, (2) girdling, (3) foliar spraying with 1 % of monopotassium phosphate (0 - 52 - 34) and ethephon 800 mg/l, and (4) combination of girdling and foliar spraying. The girdling was applied at the end of leaf development stage. Foliar spray was applied three times at 7 -d intervals from 14 days after girdling. Random Forests (RF) was applied to compute the percentage of flowering from plant hormone concentrations observed on 0, 7, 21, 35, 49, 56 and 63 days after the treatment, and to evaluate variable importance to illustrate physiological responses to horticultural treatments. In the field experiment, the three horticultural techniques could induce off-season flowering, while untreated trees had no flower, but leaf flushing. The RF model showed fair performance for modelling the percentage of flowering. The variable importance illustrated the effects of plant hormones in different tissues (i. e. wood, bark, leaves and apical bud) and timing (i. e. sampling dates). The variable importance of the total cytokinins and zeatin/zeatin riboside were observed to be high in wood, leaves and apical bud, while the importance of auxin in bark, <b>wood</b> and apical <b>bud</b> was found to be low on day 35. The RF model could present additional information for a deeper understanding of plant hormone dynamics in plant tissues and critical timing required for flower induction, which can be used for better and improved farmers’ management and practices in the future...|$|R
60|$|Henrietta grew very happy. She had {{her brother}} again, as wholly hers as in their younger days,--depending upon her, {{participating}} {{in all her}} pleasures, or rather giving her favourite occupations double zest, by their being for him, for his amusement. She rode and walked in the beautiful open spring country with grandpapa, to whom she was a most valuable companion; and on her return she had two to visit, both of whom looked forward with keen interest and delight to hearing her histories of down and wood, of field and valley, of farm-house, cottage, or school; had a laugh for the least amusing circumstance, admiration for the spring flower or leaf, and power to follow her descriptions of <b>budding</b> <b>woods,</b> soft rising hills, and gorgeous sunsets. How her mamma enjoyed comparing notes with her about those same woods and dells, and would describe the adventures of her own youth! And now it might be noticed {{that she did not}} avoid speaking of those in which Henrietta's father had been engaged; nay, she dwelt on them by preference, and without the suppressed sigh which had formerly followed anything like a reference to him. Sometimes she would smile to identify the bold open down with the same where she had run races with him, and even laugh to think of the droll adventures. Sometimes the shady woodland walk would make her describe their nutting parties, or it would bring her thoughts to some fit of childish mischief and concealment, and to the confession to which his bolder and more upright counsel had at length led her. Or she would tell of the long walks they had taken together when older grown, when each had become prime counsellor and confidante of the other; and the interests and troubles of home and of school were poured out to willing ears, and sympathy and advice exchanged. How Fred and Mary had been companions from the very first, how their love had grown up unconsciously, in the sports in the sunny fields, shady coombs, and green woods of their home: how it had strengthened and ripened with advancing years, and how bright and unclouded their sunshine had been to dwell on: this was her delight, while the sadness which once spoke of crushed hopes, and lost happiness, had gone from her smile. It was as if she still felt herself walking in the light of his love, and at the same time, as if she wished to show him to his daughter as he was, and to tell Henrietta of those words and those ways of his which were most characteristic, and which used to be laid up so fast in her heart, that she could never have borne to speak of them. The bitterness of his death, as it regarded herself, seemed to have passed, the brightness of his memory alone remaining. Henrietta loved to listen, but scarcely so much as her mother loved to tell; and instead of agitating her, these recollections always seemed to soothe and make her happy.|$|R
