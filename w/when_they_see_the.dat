5|$|The {{story is}} set two million years ago. The {{inhabitants}} of the planet Krikkit built a race of androids called the Krikkitmen to wipe out all life in the universe. They were stopped by the Time Lords, who trapped Krikkit within a temporal prison. A group of Krikkitmen which escaped the Time Lords' sentence are trying to reassemble the components of a key which can free Krikkit—components which happen to resemble elements of the Earth game of cricket, itself actually {{a reflection of the}} ancient war. The Doctor and Sarah stumble upon this plot <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Krikkitmen steal the Ashes during a test match at Lords. They then travel to the planet Bethselamin to foil {{the next step in the}} Krikkitmen's quest.|$|E

25|$|For example, if two musicians, one {{standing}} on the front sideline of the football field {{and one on the}} back sideline, begin playing exactly <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> beat of the conductor's baton or hand, the sound produced by the musician on the front sideline reaches listeners in the stands noticeably before the sound played by the back musician, and the musicians is seen to move before the sound reaches the stands.|$|E

25|$|The Bank of America's website is one {{of several}} that ask users to select a {{personal}} image (marketed as SiteKey), and display this user-selected image with any forms that request a password. Users of the bank's online services are instructed to enter a password only <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> image they selected. However, several studies suggest that few users refrain from entering their passwords when images are absent. In addition, this feature (like other forms of two-factor authentication) is susceptible to other attacks, such as those suffered by Scandinavian bank Nordea in late 2005, and Citibank in 2006.|$|E
25|$|As Emma and Hook try {{to spend}} a romantic time together, they hear a {{rumbling}} sound from above and are joined by Regina, Henry, David, and Snow to find a dirigible from the Land of Untold Stories hovering around the town. They confront Hyde, who as the town's new owner, has brought the residents {{from the land of}} Untold Stories with him. Both Emma and Regina try to use magic to stop him, but fail. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> blimp crash into the forest, they search for survivors but find no one (although Snow and David find the displaced arrivals later on), Jekyll tells the residents that they can use the baton that powered the dirigible to create a device to stop Hyde. As they go through the wreckage, Emma feels her hand move strangely. Later on, the residents create a weapon that successfully takes care of Hyde and he is placed in jail, when Emma suddenly experiences a strange vision that causes her hand to shake again, Hyde becomes aware of this.|$|E
500|$|The Travels of Sir John Mandeville reports (incorrectly) that Hippocrates was {{the ruler}} of the islands of [...] "Kos and Lango" [...] , and recounts a legend about Hippocrates' daughter. She was {{transformed}} into a hundred-foot long dragon by the goddess Diana, and is the [...] "lady of the manor" [...] of an old castle. She emerges three times a year, and will be turned back into a woman if a knight kisses her, making the knight into her consort and ruler of the islands. Various knights try, but flee <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> hideous dragon; they die soon thereafter. This is a version of the legend of Melusine.|$|E

A {{suspicious}} Prateek notices digital patterns on the fateful road and realises that Ra.One has come to life. He convinces Jenny of the same <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> destroyed game laboratory, and the latter tries to bring G.One into the real world. Meanwhile, Ra.One, having accepted the guise of Akashi, returns to his family home and takes up residence with Akashi’s mother. He kills her viciously and chases Prateek and Sonia [...] {{on their way to}} the airport, but G.One enters the real world and causes a gas explosion which temporarily destroys Ra.One. G.One takes Ra.One's H.A.R.T. and accompanies the family to Mumbai after Sonia realises that she needs him.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{exiting the}} elevator, guests enter a hallway within the secret MIB Headquarters. Traveling down the hall, {{they pass the}} film's famous [...] "worm guys" [...] on break, several {{interactive}} doors to various labs, and through the alien scanners. [...] At {{the end of the}} hallway, guests overlook the immigration and controls room, with a large video screen broadcasting the training information and alien twins, Bob and Bhnxaxx operating controls. They then move into the weapons room, and finally into the training facility, where a training vehicle awaits. Guests who use an Express Pass skip some rooms and meet the normal riders <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> alien twins in the control rooms, then follow the normal riders but in a different path.|$|E
2500|$|Coker {{also came}} under fire for some of his {{comments}} after the incident. [...] "I {{think that it will}} affect the image of our program greatly, but in a positive way," [...] he said. [...] "I think that <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> video and they see how it was handled they will be impressed with our players." [...] His handling of the incident contributed to speculation that he would not return in 2007, Shalala's vote of confidence notwithstanding.|$|E
40|$|In two studies, {{children}} between 5 and 10 {{years of age}} were asked to reach to grasp an object without sight of the hand during the movement. The oldest children and adults were faster <b>when</b> <b>they</b> could <b>see</b> <b>the</b> hand and increased maximum grip aperture <b>when</b> <b>they</b> could not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> hand. The 10 -year-olds were less able to integrate grasp and lift than adults <b>when</b> <b>they</b> could <b>see</b> their hands. Children aged 5 and 6 showed no increase in movement time <b>when</b> <b>they</b> could not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> hand and did not adapt maximum grip aperture to lack of sight. These effects remained when children were encouraged to reach for and lift the target as quickly as possible. The results indicate that younger children did not give preference to vision in the control of prehension, while older children used visual feedback to improve efficiency. Dependence on sight of the hand for the control of prehension does not simply decrease with age, {{but it may be}} integrated into an anticipatory control strategy where it contributes to the efficiency of control...|$|R

2500|$|Fidel Castro presided at a {{ceremony}} changing {{the name of the}} island from Isla de Pinos to Isla de la Juventud on 3 August 1978.

2500|$|In 1988–89, Australia lost {{again to}} the West Indies, and Border's form suffered; the West Indies {{routinely}} applied a tactic of targeting the opposition captain when he batted, thus undermining his confidence {{and that of the}} team. It worked to the extent that Border compiled 258 runs at 32.25 and his best performance was with the ball. He celebrated becoming the first Australian to play 100 Tests by taking 7/46 and 4/50, backed with an innings of 75, in Australia's only victory for the series, in the Fourth Test at Sydney. His bowling figures are the best for a match (and second best for an innings) by an Australian captain. Previously, he had taken 16 wickets in 99 Tests. Receiving the player of the match award, Border said, [...] "there will be batsmen all around the world shaking their heads in disbelief <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> result".|$|E
2500|$|Dhammakaya {{meditation}} {{begins with}} the vipassana level at a later stage than some other meditation schools in Thailand. In Dhammakaya meditation, insight relies on stability of mind: only a mind that is stable can develop penetrative insight into the reality {{of life and the}} world. After practitioners have attained the Dhammakaya, it is believed they can understand birth, death and suffering at a deeper level, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> literal essence of these phenomena through meditative attainment. The practitioner can accomplish a sequential shedding of the mental defilements until an end can be reached, that is Nibbana. Dhammakaya meditation at the higher levels is believed to bring forth abhiñña, mental powers {{that can be used for}} the benefit of society at large. The technique is believed by some practitioners to have been used during the Second World War to prevent Thailand from being bombed, and used to extinguish the negative forces in the cosmos (Mara). This final aspect has strongly affected the attitudes of practitioners at Dhammakaya movement temples, who therefore hold that Dhammakaya meditation is not only important for the individual, but also for the [...] at large.|$|E
