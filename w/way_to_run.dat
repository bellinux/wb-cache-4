25|$|Reith's autocratic {{approach}} {{became the}} stuff of BBC legend. His preferred approach was one of benevolent dictator, but with built-in checks to his power. Throughout his life, Reith remained convinced that that approach was the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> an organisation. Later Director-General Greg Dyke, profiling Reith in 2007, noted that the term Reithian has entered the dictionary to denote a style of management, particularly with relation to broadcasting. Reith summarised the BBC's purpose in three words: inform, educate, entertain; this remains part of the organisation's mission statement to this day. It has also been adopted by broadcasters throughout the world, notably the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Though less {{famous and}} romanticized than Atlantic or Caribbean pirates, corsairs in the Mediterranean equaled or outnumbered the former {{at any given}} point in history. Mediterranean piracy was {{conducted}} almost entirely with galleys until the mid-17th century, when they were gradually replaced with highly maneuverable sailing vessels such as xebecs and brigantines. They were, however, of a smaller type than battle galleys, {{often referred to as}} galiots or fustas. Pirate galleys were small, nimble, lightly armed, but often heavily manned in order to overwhelm the often minimal crews of merchant ships. In general, pirate craft were extremely difficult for patrolling craft to actually hunt down and capture. Anne Hilarion de Tourville, a French admiral of the 17th century, believed that the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> down raiders from the infamous corsair Moroccan port of Salé was by using a captured pirate vessel of the same type. Using oared vessels to combat pirates was common, and was even practiced by the major powers in the Caribbean. Purpose-built galleys (or hybrid sailing vessels) were built by the English in Jamaica in 1683 and by the Spanish in the late 16th century. Specially-built sailing frigates with oar-ports on the lower decks, like the James Galley and Charles Galley, and oar-equipped sloops proved highly useful for pirate hunting, though they were not built in sufficient numbers to check piracy until the 1720s.|$|E

500|$|Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra had {{disagreements}} {{about the}} events of the May Revolution and the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the government; their disputes became public shortly after the creation of the Junta. Saavedra was the president, and Moreno was a secretary with the support of other vocal members. Ignacio Núñez describes how Morenists felt that the President was attempting to restore in his office the authority of the viceroys, thus downgrading the importance of {{the other members of the}} Junta at public events; while Saavedrists considered that the Secretary was overstepping his authority and did not allow even the appointment of a janitor that was not of his liking. However, Domingo Matheu would clarify in his memoirs that their initial concerns with Saavedra were based more on his desire for honours and privileges than for a real power struggle. Núñez described how Moreno was resisted by some criollos who initially supported the revolution without being aware of the long-term consequences. He was resisted by criollos alarmed by his straightforward way of talking about concepts like self-determination, tyranny, slavery, and freedom. Theologians resented that Moreno cited authors like Rousseau, Voltaire, or Montesquieu rather than Christian philosophers like Saint Augustine or Saint Thomas. He was also resisted by conservative lawyers and by most of the [...] military.|$|E

There is some evidence also that, when he was Foreign Secretary, Lady Avon had influenced (or, at any rate endorsed) his patterns of work. A later Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, has observed that, though he worked hard, Eden did not keep office hours and often spent mornings working in bed.

2500|$|In a video titled [...] "Catholic Government", now {{removed from}} his apostolate's site but still {{available}} online, Voris reiterates the statement by St. Thomas Aquinas that monarchy is the highest form of government ("Accordingly, the best form of government {{is in a state}} or kingdom, wherein one is given the power to preside over all." [...] Summa Theologica I-11, 105.1). In the video Voris said, [...] "The only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a country is by benevolent dictatorship, a Catholic monarch who protects his people from themselves and bestows on them what they need, not necessarily what they want." [...] Voris later clarified his remarks, saying it would have been more accurate if he had called it an [...] "enlightened monarchy," [...] but maintaining that his larger point [...] "that a society needs strong morals in order to survive" [...] remains true. Voris holds {{that there has been a}} liberal shift in the Catholic Church, a post-1960s culture that has had a negative influence over Catholics; some of this has been influenced by [...] "Americanism," [...] a heresy that Pope Leo XIII warned about in the 19th century.
