5|$|During their investigation, Pembleton and Bayliss learn Kaja {{has been}} in a Haitian prison for four months, {{eliminating}} him as a lead. Gee announces the Baltimore Sun is running a story that Kaja has been cleared as a suspect, leaked from the police. Pembleton accuses Ballard and Gharty of leaking the story, while Gharty accuses Pembleton of going easy on Felix Wilson because he is a successful black man. The discussion prompts a heated argument with accusations of racism from both sides. Pembleton agrees to interview Felix Wilson alone because he believes it will clear him. When Pembleton tells Wilson he needs a blood test from him and his son, Wilson admits that he had consensual sex with Brierre the night of the murder, but said he does not kill her. Later, a devastated Pembleton and Gee still insist he should not necessarily be treated as a suspect, much to the disbelief of Ballard and Gharty. The detectives are interrupted by Wilson's attorney, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> family will not submit to a blood and hair test without a court order.|$|E

Noonan's acting has also been praised by Vince Gilligan, <b>who</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> [...] "understated" [...] manner in which Roche is portrayed [...] "sends chills down [...] spine every time". The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff reviewed the episode positively, rating it an A.

500|$|A {{scene that}} was {{eventually}} {{dropped from the}} episode featured Robby Krieger, guitarist of the American rock band The Doors, as himself. Krieger had been promised a guest role on The Simpsons after the staff were allowed to use the Doors song [...] "The End" [...] for the season 11 episode [...] "Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder".

The scene was later included in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season DVD set. To this day, Krieger has not officially been featured in an episode of The Simpsons. The con artist Devon Bradley was portrayed by American actor and director Edward Norton. Scully hired Norton for the role after James L. Brooks, one of The Simpsons producers, told Scully that Norton was [...] "a {{big fan of the}} show" [...] and was willing to guest star in an episode. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Scully noted that Norton was very versatile and could imitate many Simpsons characters perfectly.
