25|$|In early Rome {{agriculture}} and military activity were closely bound up, {{in the sense}} that the Roman farmer was also a soldier. … In the case of the October Horse, for example, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> trying to decide whether it is a military, or an agricultural festival; but see it rather as one of the ways in which the convergence of farming and warfare (or more accurately of farmers and fighters) might be expressed.|$|E
500|$|Reporting on the ship's {{arrival in}} New York, {{in its first}} issue Scientific American opined, [...] "If there is any thing {{objectionable}} in the construction or machinery of this noble ship, it is the mode of propelling her by the screw propeller; and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> surprised if it should be, ere long, superseded by paddle wheels at the sides." ...|$|E

It's {{the highest}} social offence I know; it ought--it {{absolutely}} ought--I'm quite serious--to be capital If I knew I should be hanged else, I should manage {{to find the}} best word.

500|$|Fifield is a {{geologist}} {{who has become}} mentally unstable after many missions. Harris described the character as [...] "someone who can sense when things are up. He's your audience guy, going, 'Don't go in that tunnel. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> doing this! Fifield's bright red mohawk hairstyle was designed by Harris and Scott, based on Scott's sketch {{of a man with}} a [...] "severe haircut".|$|E
500|$|Williams {{argued that}} Kant {{had given the}} [...] "purest, deepest and most {{thorough}} representation of morality," [...] but that the [...] "honourable instincts of Kantianism to defend the individuality of individuals against the agglomerative indifference of Utilitarianism" [...] may not be effective against the Kantian [...] "abstract character of persons as moral agents." [...] <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> expected to act as though we are not who {{we are in the}} circumstances in which we find ourselves.|$|E
500|$|By 1792, Lady Charlotte Finch {{had become}} ill and deaf. Princess Sophia remarked that autumn, [...] "I am grieved to death about her, she is if {{possible}} more kind {{to us than}} ever. Indeed, both [...] and her are so good to us that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> deserving of having such treasures about us, {{if we did not}} feel their kindness in the highest degree". Finch resigned from her role in November 1792 and retired on 5 January 1793, though she continued to correspond with {{members of the royal family}} and receive gifts from them, particularly the Prince of Wales, the future George IV. She received £600 in yearly payment, supplemented by income from the South Sea Company, until her death on 11 July 1813 at St James's Palace.|$|E

500|$|We paid our {{shilling}} at the gate, {{and then}} we saw for the first time, that the entrance, {{if there had been}} any magic about it at all, was now decidedly disenchanted, being, in fact, nothing more nor less than a combination of very roughly-painted boards and sawdust. We glanced at the orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past—we just recognised them, and that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at least, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre, and daubs of crimson and yellow all round, like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where night after night we had beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of Madame Somebody (we forget even her name now), who nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine her temple! ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, {{when the}} American beef {{industry}} {{was struggling with}} public perception of its use and sale of pink slime, Grandin spoke out {{in support of the}} food product. She said, [...] "It should be on the market. It should be labeled. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> throwing away that much beef." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The most serious. It is the {{principal}} event for good or for evil in all lives. Had I not married, and married as I did, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> here--and where, I dare not think." ...|$|R

50|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>not</b> <b>be</b> distracted now by {{who serves}} {{in the interim}} leadership, because {{ultimately}} the people's voice will be heard. They will vote for their leaders, and everyone else will {{apply for a job}} and be interviewed to obtain any position.|$|R
2500|$|Burke {{adds that}} it {{requires}} a [...] "certain manly discipline {{to serve as an}} altar boy in service at the side of a priest, and most priests have their first deep experiences of the liturgy as altar boys. If we are not training young men as altar boys, giving them an experience of serving God in the liturgy, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> surprised that vocations have fallen dramatically." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{surprised}} {{at the lack of}} ruins in America in general. Actually the scarcity of identifiable remains in the Old World is even more impressive. In view of the nature of their civilization one should not be puzzled if the Nephites had left us no ruins at all. People underestimate the capacity of things to disappear, and do not realize that the ancients almost never built of stone. Many a great civilization which has left a notable mark in history and literature has left behind not a single recognizable trace of itself. We must stop looking for the wrong things.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, McCain said {{he would}} {{consider}} changing the U.S. military's don't ask, don't tell policy: [...] "The day that {{the leadership of the}} military comes to me and says, 'Senator, we ought to change the policy,' then I think we ought to consider seriously changing it." [...] In December 2007, McCain said he supported the policy, citing reports from military leaders that [...] "this policy ought to be continued because it's working." [...] In January 2010, when Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen – the top civilian and uniform leadership of the military – came out in favor of repealing the policy, McCain said he was [...] "disappointed" [...] by their stance: [...] "At this moment of immense hardship for our armed services, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> seeking to overturn the Don't ask, don't tell policy," [...] which he described as [...] "imperfect but effective." [...] McCain also criticized Gates for what he saw as an attempt to usurp Congressional authority over the policy. In December 2010, McCain voted against repealing the policy.|$|E

5000|$|Also abroad, we must not, as we {{have done}} so far, always stick to the party, which pursues the rape of {{important}} cultural elements on behalf of its own national hegemony.
