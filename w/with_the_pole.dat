5|$|Wooden carvings in {{the shape}} of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are {{decorated}} with the filial of fleche faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor’s voice, and a base <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points (facing downwards) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the fleche faitière is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses.|$|E

25|$|In {{elliptic}} geometry, {{two lines}} perpendicular {{to a given}} line must intersect. In fact, the perpendiculars on one side all intersect at the absolute pole of the given line. The perpendiculars {{on the other side}} also intersect at a point, which is different from the other absolute pole only in spherical geometry, for in elliptic geometry the poles on either side are the same. There are no antipodal points in elliptic geometry. Every point corresponds to an absolute polar line of which it is the absolute pole. Any point on this polar line forms an absolute conjugate pair <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pole.</b> Such a pair of points is orthogonal, and the distance between them is a quadrant.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the problems facing Napoleon III in obtaining potential allies, Bismarck worked feverishly to isolate France from the other European powers. Since 1863, Bismarck had made efforts to cultivate Russia, co-operating, amongst other things, in dealing with Polish insurgents. This important move gained for Bismarck the neutrality of Russia if Prussia went to war, and it also prevented Austria from taking sides with France as Austria fully supported the Poles. When Alexander II came to France on an official visit in 1867, {{he was at the}} receiving end of an unsuccessful assassination attempt by Polish-born Anton Berezovski while riding with Napoleon III and the Empress Eugenie. Tsar Alexander was very offended that not only the French courts had given Berezovski imprisonment instead of death but also the French press had sided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pole</b> rather than Alexander. This experience forever shattered his views of France and saw in the reaction his visit had received why his father had despised the French.|$|E
500|$|Later, authors Vince Gordon and Peter DijkemaIt {{argue that}} the guitar sound on [...] "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] could be created with {{distortion}} commonly achievable with a highly-overdriven early 1950s guitar amplifier. They point {{out that in the}} recording, the higher treble strings sound relatively clean, with the low E string having the most distortion; with a tube malfunction, all strings would be distorted more or less to an equal degree. [...] The authors add that this difference in sound could be achieved <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> piece for the low E string raised higher than the rest, thereby allowing it to overload the amplifier more than the treble strings. They also argue that Nashville session guitarist Grady Martin provided the guitar parts for the Trio's recording; they base this on stylistic and technical qualities, since, at the time, Martin was a more accomplished player than Burlison, and these qualities are apparent in his work on other recordings.|$|E

500|$|In classic {{cross-country}} skiing the skis remain parallel, as the skier strides straight ahead. The undersides of the skis have a grip {{section in the}} middle treated with a special ski wax that provides friction when the foot is still, yet glides when the foot is in motion, {{while the rest of}} the ski bottom has a glide wax. Classic events occur on courses with tracks set by a grooming machine at precise intervals and with carefully planned curvature. Both poles may be used simultaneously ("double-poling") or with alternating foot and arm extended (as with running or walking) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>pole</b> pushing on the side opposite of the extended, sliding ski. In classic skiing the alternating technique is used for the [...] "diagonal stride"—the predominant classic sub-technique. In diagonal-stride legs move like in ordinary walking, but with longer and more powerful steps. Diagonal is useful on level ground and on gentle uphill slopes. Uphill steps are shorter and more frequent. With double-poling both poles are used simultaneously for thrust, which may be augmented with striding. Double-poling is useful on level ground and on gentle downhill slopes. On steep uphills fishbone technique can be used.|$|E
